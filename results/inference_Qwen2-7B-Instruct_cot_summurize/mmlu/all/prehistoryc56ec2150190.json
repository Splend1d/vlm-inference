There were two or more related but geographically separate hominid species during this period that evolved from earlier African hominids: This theory suggests that during this time, multiple species coexisted and evolved in different regions. These species likely branched off from a common ancestor and adapted to their specific environments.\n\nB. Hominids dating from this time can be grouped into different species in Africa, Asia, and Europe: This indicates that the geographical distribution of these hominid species was not limited to a single region. They spread across various continents, leading to the diversification of species according to the habitats they inhabited.\n\nC. All of the hominids that evolved from Homo habilis and predate Homo sapiens belong in a single, geographically widespread but morphologically diverse species known as Homo erectus: This statement implies that Homo erectus is a species that emerged from the lineage of Homo habilis and was present worldwide. Its morphological diversity across different regions could suggest adaptation to various environmental conditions.\n\nTherefore, all of these arguments collectively describe the complex evolutionary patterns and geographical spread of early hominids during the specified timeframe."
