Hold an iron nail with crucible tongs, and heat strongly in the flame of a Bunsen burner.\n\nThis method uses a common laboratory setup that provides a steady, controllable flame. The Bunsen burner allows for precise heating without the risk associated with higher temperatures from an oxyacetylene torch or the potentially dangerous particle spray method. Dissolving the nail in acid is not a method of heating but rather a chemical process to remove the iron."
