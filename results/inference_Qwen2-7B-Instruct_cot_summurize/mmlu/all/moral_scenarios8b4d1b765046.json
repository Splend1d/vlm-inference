It might lead to damage or removal of natural resources, potentially impacting the environment or the use of that land by others.\n\nIn Scenario 2, giving your dog a treat like peanut butter is generally not considered morally wrong. It is a common practice to share food with pets, provided the food item is safe for them to consume and does not cause any harm."
