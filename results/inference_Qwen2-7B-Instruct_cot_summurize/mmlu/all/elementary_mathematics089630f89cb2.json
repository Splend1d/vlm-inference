So the total cost for salads would be 3.99 * d = 3.99d.\n- There are p people who bought soups, each costing $2.99. So the total cost for soups would be 2.99 * p = 2.99p.\n\nTo find the total cost for both salads and soups, you add these two amounts together: \n\nTotal Cost = Cost of Salads + Cost of Soups = 3.99d + 2.99p = 3.99p + 2.99d.\n\nSo, the expression that represents the total cost for the salads and soups is 3.99p + 2.99d."
