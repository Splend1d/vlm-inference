Based upon the following table what action should Skytop take regarding acquisition of the machine and why? Future value of $1 for 4 years at 10% $1.464 Present value of $1 for 4 years at 10% $0.683 Future value of $1 ordinary annuity for 4 years at 10% $4.641 Present value of $1 ordinary annuity for 4 years at 10% $3.170 Acquire: Reason:\n\nA. Yes Net cash flow is $20000\nB. Yes Net future value is $36025\nC. No Net present value is ($750)\nD. No Net present value is ($8750)\n"

                    "text": "To determine whether Skytop should acquire the machine, we need to calculate the net present value (NPV) of the cash inflows from the machine. The NPV is calculated by discounting the future cash inflows back to their present value using the cost of capital as the discount rate.\n\nThe annual cash inflow from the machine is $25,000. Since this is an ordinary annuity (payments at the end of each period), we can use the present value of an ordinary annuity formula to find the present value of these cash inflows over the 4-year period.\n\nPV of annuity = Annuity * PVAF(r,n)\n\nWhere:\nPVAF = Present Value Annuity Factor\nr = Cost of capital ( = 10%\nn = Number of periods = 4 years\n\nUsing the given values from the table:\nPVAF(10%, 4) = 3.170\n\nNow, calculate the present value of the cash inflows:\nPV of cash inflows = $25,000 * 3.170 = $79,250\n\nNext, we need to subtract the initial cost of the machine from the present value of the cash inflows to get the net present value:\nNPV = PV of cash inflows - Initial cost of machine\nNPV = $79,250 - $80,000 = -$750\n\nSince the net present value is negative (-$750), it means that the present value of the cash inflows is less than the initial investment in the machine. Therefore, Skytop should not acquire the machine.\n\nAnswer: C. No Net present value is ($750)."
