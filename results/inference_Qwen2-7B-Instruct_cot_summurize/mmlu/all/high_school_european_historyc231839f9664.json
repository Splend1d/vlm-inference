It has but established new classes, new conditions of oppression, new forms of struggle in place of the old ones. Our epoch, the epoch of the bourgeoisie, possesses, however, this distinctive feature: it has simplified the class antagonisms. Society as a whole is more and more splitting up into two great hostile camps, into two great classes, directly facing each other: Bourgeoisie and Proletariat.\nKarl Marx and Friedrich Engels, The Communist Manifesto, 1848\nThe Communist Manifesto can be understood as an example of the influence of which mode of modern European thinking?\n\nA. The Oxford Movement\nB. Materialism and economic determinism\nC. Hegelian idealism\nD. The rationalism of the Scottish Enlightenment\n"

Materialism and economic determinism\n\nMarx and Engels' work, \"The Communist Manifesto,\" reflects their belief in materialism and economic determinism, key components of Marxist theory. This mode of modern European thinking posits that the material conditions and economic relationships of a society determine its political, social, and cultural development. In the text, they argue that the history of societies is fundamentally shaped by class struggles, with economic factors being the primary drivers of these conflicts. They also assert that the current capitalist system leads to inherent contradictions and conflicts between the bourgeoisie ( the ruling class - and the proletariat, the working class. These views align with the principles of materialism and economic determinism, which emphasize the role of economic forces in shaping society."
