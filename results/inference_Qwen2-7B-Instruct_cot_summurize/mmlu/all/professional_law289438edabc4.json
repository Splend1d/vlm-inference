The applicable state statute limits eligibility to citizens of the United States and aliens seeking U. S. citizenship. A candidate for a J. D. degree at the state law school applied for one of the non-interest-bearing loans. Since he did not intend to seek U. S. citizenship, he was refused the loan for ineligibility under the state statute. In a suit by the candidate challenging the constitutionality of the state statute, he will\n\nA. win, because the statute is violative of the privileges or immunities clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nB. win, because classifications by a state that are based on alienage are inherently suspect and subject to close judicial scrutiny.\nC. lose, because the statute promotes a compelling state interest.\nD. lose, because alienage classifications are not, per Se, unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment's equal protection clause.\n"

Instead, such classifications are generally subject to rational basis review, meaning the state must show only that there is some rational connection between the classification and a legitimate state interest.\n\nIn this case, the state's law school loan program appears to be designed to promote the state's interest in supporting education for its own citizens and those seeking to become citizens. This interest could potentially justify the distinction made between citizens and aliens not seeking U.S. citizenship under the state statute. Therefore, the candidate would likely lose his challenge to the constitutionality of the state statute."
