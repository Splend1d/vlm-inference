At the age of 7 months, he was treated for osteomyelitis caused by Aspergillus fumigatus. He has been admitted to the hospital three times during the past 4 years for severe pneumonia. He appears moderately ill. His temperature is 39\u00b0C (102.2\u00b0F). Abdominal examination shows an enlarged, tender liver. Ultrasonography of the abdomen shows an intrahepatic abscess. Culture of the abscess fluid grows Staphylococcus aureus. Further analysis shows failure of the neutrophils to undergo an oxidative burst when exposed to S. aureus. This patient has an increased susceptibility to infection as a result of which of the following abnormalities?\n\nA. Failure of leukocytes to migrate between endothelial cells\nB. Failure of leukocytes to roll along the endothelial surface\nC. Inability of leukocytes to ingest microorganisms\nD. Inability of leukocytes to kill intracellular microorganisms\n"

Inability of leukocytes to kill intracellular microorganisms.\n\nThe patient's inability to undergo an oxidative burst when exposed to Staphylococcus aureus indicates that there is a defect in the function of his neutrophils, a type of white blood cell. The oxidative burst is a critical part of the immune response where neutrophils produce reactive oxygen species to help destroy invading pathogens like bacteria and fungi. The failure of this process means the neutrophils are not effectively killing the Staphylococcus aureus bacteria, making the patient more susceptible to infection. \n\nOptions A, B, and C refer to other aspects of the leukocyte migration and interaction with the endothelium, which are also important for the immune response but do not specifically address the mechanism by which this patient is unable to kill intracellular microorganisms."
