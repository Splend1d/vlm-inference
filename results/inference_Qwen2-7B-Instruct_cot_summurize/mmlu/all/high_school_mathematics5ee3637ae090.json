If Fresh has a volume of $1$ unit, then:\n\n\\[ \\text{Volume of Glow} = 1 + \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{4}{3} \\text{ units} \\]\n\n### Step 3: Cost Relationship between Glow and Bright\n\nGlow is $25\\%$ less expensive than Bright. Since Bright costs $ \\$1.60$, then:\n\n\\[ \\text{Cost of Glow} = \\$1.60 - 25\\% \\times \\$1.60 = \\$1.60 - \\$0.40 = \\$1.20 \\]\n\n### Step 4: Calculating Cost per Unit of Volume for Glow\n\nTo find the cost per unit of volume for Glow, we divide the total cost by its volume:\n\n\\[ \\text{Cost per unit of volume of Glow} = \\frac{\\$1.20}{\\frac{4}{3}} = \\$1.20 \\times \\frac{3}{4} = \\$0.90 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of cents per unit of volume of Glow is $\\boxed{90}$ cents, which corresponds to answer choice **A**."
