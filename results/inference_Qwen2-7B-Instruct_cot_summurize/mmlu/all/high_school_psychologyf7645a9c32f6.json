These medications work by increasing the levels of the neurotransmitter serotonin in the brain, which can help alleviate symptoms of depression.\n\nIt's important to note that SSRIs are not typically used for the other conditions listed:\n\nA. Manic - This is usually associated with bipolar disorder and is typically treated with mood stabilizers or atypical antipsychotics.\n  \nC. Dissociative identity disorder - Treatment for this condition often involves psychotherapy rather than medication.\n\nD. Conversion disorder - This is a condition where physical symptoms are not caused by a medical illness but may be related to psychological factors. Medication, including SSRIs, might be used as part of treatment, but it's not the primary treatment modality.\n\nAlways consult a healthcare professional for accurate diagnosis and treatment recommendations."
