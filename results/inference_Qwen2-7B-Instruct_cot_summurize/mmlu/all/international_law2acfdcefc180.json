However, there are some key differences:\n\n- **Conciliation** typically involves a process where a conciliator ( or a commission of conciliators is appointed by the parties involved or by an international organization like the United Nations. The conciliator's role is to facilitate communication between the parties and help them reach a mutually acceptable solution. Unlike arbitration, the outcome of conciliation is not legally binding but can be incorporated into an agreement if accepted by the parties. Conciliation is often used when the parties wish to maintain their relationship and avoid formal adjudication.\n\n- **Mediation**, on the other hand, is a more flexible process. It can be conducted by a mediator who assists the parties in negotiating a resolution to their dispute. Mediation does not require a formal agreement or treaty between the parties and can be initiated spontaneously by any party. The mediator does not have the authority to impose a decision; instead, they help the parties to identify interests, generate options, and negotiate a solution that is acceptable to all. Mediation can be confidential and is often seen as a less confrontational approach to resolving disputes.\n\nOptions A, B, and C are incorrect because:\n- A suggests that conciliation results in a binding outcome, whereas it typically does not.\n- B incorrectly specifies that conciliation is conducted exclusively by the UN Secretary-General's representatives, when it can involve any appointed body.\n- C describes mediation incorrectly by stating that it is usually conducted by a person appointed with the consent of the parties, when mediation can be conducted by individuals or entities without such specific appointment procedures."
