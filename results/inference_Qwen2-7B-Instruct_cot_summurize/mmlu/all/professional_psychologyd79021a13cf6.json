This means that the types of sounds and combinations of sounds that infants are likely to produce during babbling will be similar to those found in the languages they hear around them, even before they start to speak actual words. However, this does not mean that babbling is the same across all language communities ( it can vary based on the specific sounds present in each language's phonetic structure. It also doesn't mean that babbling contains the full range of phonemes that comprise all languages or that it remains the same until the first words are spoken."
