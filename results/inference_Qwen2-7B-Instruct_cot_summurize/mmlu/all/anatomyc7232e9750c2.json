The muscles of mastication, anterior and posterior bellies of digastric, and geniohyoid originate from the first brachial arch. \n\n- Muscles of mmtastication include the masseter, temporalis, and medial pterygoid.\n- The anterior and posterior bellies of the digastric muscle also develop from the first brachial arch.\n- The geniohyoid muscle is another structure that arises from this arch.\n\nOptions A, B, and C either exclude important components (like the geniohyoid in option A, or include structures that do not originate from the first brachial arch, such as the muscles of mastication in options B and C which are typically associated with the third branchial arch."
