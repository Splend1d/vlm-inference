This usually suggests that the oxygen saturation level in the blood is 80% or lower. Therefore, the correct answer is C. \n\nIt's important to note that the specific oxygen saturation levels can vary depending on the severity of the condition and the individual's health status. In general, oxygen saturation levels should ideally be 94% or higher for individuals at sea level to ensure adequate oxygenation of tissues. However, this can vary based on factors such as age, underlying medical conditions, and activity levels."
