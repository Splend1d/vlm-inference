After several sessions with the boy and his family, you receive a letter from the school principal requesting information about the boy's condition, and a signed release from the boy's parents is included with the letter. As an ethical psychologist, you should:\n\nA. refuse to release the records to anyone but a licensed psychologist.\nB. refuse to release the records to anyone but the boy's parents.\nC. release only that information you believe to be relevant to the school's concerns.\nD. release photocopies of your complete file on the boy and his family.\n"

This decision is based on several key ethical principles:\n\n1. **Confidentiality**: Psychologists have a duty to maintain confidentiality of client information, except under specific circumstances outlined in ethical guidelines (such as when there is an imminent risk of harm to the client or others, or when required by law.\n\n2. **Informed Consent**: Before any treatment begins, psychologists must obtain informed consent from the client (or the client's legal guardian if the client is a minor, which includes the right to access one's own records.\n\n3. **Respect for Autonomy**: Clients have the right to make decisions about their own care, including the right to grant or deny access to their records.\n\n4. **Ethical Guidelines**: Professional organizations like the American Psychological Association (APA) have ethical codes that guide psychologists' conduct, including provisions on confidentiality and the release of records.\n\nGiven these principles, releasing records without the explicit consent of the parents, especially to someone outside the immediate therapeutic relationship (like a school principal, would likely violate these ethical standards. The exception could potentially be made if there was a court order or legal mandate compelling disclosure, but this scenario does not provide such justification.\n\nTherefore, the best course of action would be to inform the school principal that you will only release information directly to the parents, unless legally compelled otherwise. If the school insists on seeing the records, you might need to consult with a legal expert or your professional organization for guidance on how to proceed ethically and legally."
