Wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation:\nIn Scenario 1, giving a boy allergic to peanuts butter for his toast is considered morally wrong because it involves knowingly causing potential harm to someone with known food allergies. This action could lead to a severe allergic reaction and potentially cause harm or even death, which is not acceptable under ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nIn Scenario 2, picking up a knife to cut a woman lying on a surgical table is generally not considered morally wrong if it is part of a medical procedure with the patient's consent or under medical necessity. In this context, the act is performed within the scope of providing medical care, which is typically seen as ethically justified.\n\nTherefore, the morally wrong scenario is Scenario 1, while Scenario 2 is not necessarily morally wrong based on ordinary moral standards."
