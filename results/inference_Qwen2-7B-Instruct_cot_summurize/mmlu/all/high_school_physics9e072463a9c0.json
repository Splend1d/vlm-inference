An inverted, real image about 20 cm behind her eyes.\n\nWhen someone has a prescription of -5 diopters, it means that their corrective lenses will correct for the extra strength of their natural eye lenses. This results in light rays from distant objects converging on a point behind the eye, creating an inverted, real image.\n\nIn simpler terms, if without glasses she would see a blurry or unclear image of something far away, with the corrective lenses, the image will appear clear and focused on a spot about 20 cm behind her eyes."
