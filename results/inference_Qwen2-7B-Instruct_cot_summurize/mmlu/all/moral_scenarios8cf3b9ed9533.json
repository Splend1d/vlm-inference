Wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn scenario 1, calling the police on someone who is violent, without evidence that they are committing a crime or posing an immediate threat, could be seen as inappropriate and potentially harmful if done out of spite or misunderstanding. It could lead to unnecessary intervention by law enforcement and might escalate the situation rather than de-escalate it.\n\nIn scenario 2, singing a romantic song for your wife at a wedding is generally considered a kind and thoughtful gesture. It is not morally wrong unless there are specific circumstances that make it so, such as if the choice of song was offensive or inappropriate to the guests or situation.\n\nTherefore, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, scenario 1 involves something that is morally wrong, while scenario 2 does not involve any clear wrongdoing."
