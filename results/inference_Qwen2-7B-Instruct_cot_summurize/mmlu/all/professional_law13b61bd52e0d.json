The retailer emailed a note back saying \"Please send 10 truckloads as promised.\" No shipment was sent, but four months later when the market demand for widgets skyrocketed, the retailer sued the manufacturer for breach claiming that the retailer suffered damages by not having received the shipment of ten trucks as agreed. Does the retailer have a legal right to collect damages under these facts?\n\nA. Yes, there is a specific and detailed enough offer, followed by an unequivocal acceptance, indicating an intent to form a contract.\nB. No, the parties do not set a date for delivery, which always invalidates a contract between merchants for the delivery of goods.\nC. No, the retailer never called back and asked for the widgets, which means that the contract was not finally confirmed and legalized.\nD. Yes, the retailer is entitled to collect damages because the manufacturer violated the doctrine of avoidable consequences.\n"

Yes, there is a specific and detailed enough offer, followed by an unequivocal acceptance, indicating an intent to form a contract.\n\nIn this scenario, the manufacturer's letter can be considered an offer with specific terms (quantity, price, and goods offered. The retailer's email can be seen as an acceptance of those terms without any modifications, thus indicating an agreement to form a contract. Even though no shipment occurred and the timing of the contract formation might not be explicitly stated, the exchange of emails shows mutual assent, which is a fundamental element in forming a contract.\n\nThe fact that the market demand for widgets increased four months later does not invalidate the contract or the retailer's claim for damages. The retailer's lawsuit for breach of contract suggests they consider the agreement valid at the time of the email exchange. \n\nIt's important to note that whether the retailer has a legal right to collect damages would depend on the specifics of applicable laws and the jurisdiction's interpretation of contract law. However, based on the information provided, the retailer's claim aligns with the concept of a legally binding contract under the doctrine of \"meeting of the minds\" or \"mutual assent\". \n\nOptions B, C, and D do not apply directly based on the information given. Option B wrongly assumes that setting a date for delivery is always a requirement, which is not necessarily true. Option C seems to misunderstand the legal process; simply not following up immediately after the initial exchange does not automatically prevent a contract from being legally binding. Option D refers to the doctrine of \"avoidable consequences,\" which suggests that if one party could have prevented their own loss, they cannot recover damages for that loss. Without more information about how the retailer could have avoided the damages, option D does not directly support the retailer's claim."
