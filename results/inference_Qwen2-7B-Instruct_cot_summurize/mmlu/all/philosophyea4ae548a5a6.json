However, there's no direct quote from Wolf that matches your description exactly. It seems like there might be some confusion with the attribution.\n\nJonathan Haidt does discuss the idea of moral identity, which can sometimes lead to a form of \"moral grandstanding\" or \"moral signaling,\" where individuals adopt extreme moral positions to signal their virtue rather than actually engaging in virtuous behavior. He critiques this phenomenon, suggesting that it can lead to a culture where certain behaviors (like those you've listed: not reading Victorian novels, lacking a sarcastic wit, or disinterest in gourmet cooking\u2014are stigmatized as incompatible with being a \"moral saint.\"\n\nHowever, these are not actual quotes from Wolf but interpretations within Haidt's critique of moral identity. Therefore, none of the options A, B, C, or D are accurately represent a direct statement by Wolf. The correct answer to your question, based on the context provided, would be that there isn't enough information to select one of the given options since they do not align with any known statements made by Wolf."
