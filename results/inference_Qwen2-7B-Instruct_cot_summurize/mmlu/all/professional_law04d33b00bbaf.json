The flier stated that recipients should come to a nearby storefront on election day, where there would be free food and drink, and other \"prizes\" for those who voted. Two police undercover agents went to the party, where they agreed to be taken to vote in return for $50 each. The campaign worker drove the men to their alleged poll location, where the agents arrested him on charges of conspiracy to violate the election bribery laws. The defense filed a motion to dismiss on the basis that it was legally impossible to commit the crime because the agents were not registered to vote in that district and they never intended to allow a crime to be permitted. Is the trial court likely to grant the motion to dismiss?\n\nA. Yes, because legal impossibility is a defense to the crime of conspiracy.\nB. Yes, because he could not be guilty of conspiring with two law enforcement agents who never intended to commit the crime.\nC. No, because the basis of the conspiracy charge is the agreement to commit the act, along with an affirmative step in that direction.\nD. No, because when the worker drove the agents to the voting place, he committed the complete crime of bribery and the conspiracy was an element contained within it.\n"

No, because the basis of the conspiracy charge is the agreement to commit the act, along with an affirmative step in that direction.\n\nIn this scenario, the key elements of the conspiracy charge involve:\n\n1. An agreement between two or more persons to commit a criminal act.\n2. An overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy by one of the conspirators.\n\nThe defense argues that the crime was legally impossible because the agents were not registered voters and had no intention of committing a crime. However, the conspiracy charge does not hinge on the actual commission of the underlying crime (in this case, bribery \u2013 but rather on the agreement to commit it and at least one overt act towards that end.\n\nBy driving the agents to the supposed polling location constitutes an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy, even if the agents themselves were not capable of committing bribery due to lack of voter registration or intent. The focus is on the agreement to transport voters in exchange for money, which is illegal under election laws, and the action taken in pursuit of that agreement.\n\nTherefore, the trial court is unlikely to grant the motion to dismiss based on legal impossibility, as the defense does not negate the existence of the conspiracy itself, only the possibility of the underlying crime being committed by the agents."
