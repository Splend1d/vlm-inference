Separation of sister chromatids occurs during the second division, whereas in mitosis separation of sister chromatids occurs during the first division.\n\nExplanation:\n- **Meiosis**: This process involves two rounds of cell division (meiosis I and meiosis II. During meiosis I, homologous chromosomes separate, not sister chromatids. However, it's important to note that sister chromatids do separate during meiosis II, which is analogous to the second division in mitosis.\n- **Mitosis**: In contrast, during mitosis, sister chromatids separate during the\u540e\u671f of anaphase, which is the second phase of mitosis. \n\nTherefore, the key difference highlighted in option B accurately distinguishes the two processes. Options A, C, and D contain inaccuracies or misrepresentations about the typical sequence of events in meiosis and mitosis."
