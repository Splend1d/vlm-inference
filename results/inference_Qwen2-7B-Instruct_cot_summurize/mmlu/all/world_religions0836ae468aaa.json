In faith in God\n\nSikhism emphasizes the importance of faith (\u4fe1\u4ef0 in God (Waheguru) and devotion (bhakti to attain spiritual liberation. The central belief is that through the remembrance of God and living a righteous life, one can achieve m\u4e86\u89e3mukti. This is not necessarily tied to ascetic renunciation or the life of a community member, but rather through an integrated spiritual practice that includes both personal devotion and service to others (seva). The life of a householder (guru ka kula) is also valued as it involves fulfilling one's duties while maintaining a strong connection with God."
