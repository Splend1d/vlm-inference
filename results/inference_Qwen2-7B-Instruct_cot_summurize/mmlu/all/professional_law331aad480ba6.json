The large man followed the businessman for several blocks of unending, unlit alleys. The businessman was in great fear. The large man was just a few feet behind, singing songs about how he was going to have a \"big meal tonight\" and it looked like he \"had struck it rich,\" and other words indicating possible violence and robbery. Finally, the businessman threw his wallet in one direction and ran the other way, as he yelled, \"You can have my money, just leave me my life!\" The large man picked up the wallet and ran in the opposite direction, but when he came to the end of the alley he was arrested and charged with robbery. He appealed his conviction, arguing that he had no intent to steal and was trying to return the wallet to the victim. Will the appellate court likely affirm the robbery conviction?\n\nA. No, the large man's songs could have been coincidental or unthinking, he made no threats, and later could have been trying to return the wallet.\nB. Yes, because the large man followed too closely for too long, he sang menacing songs that placed the businessman in fear, and then he took the wallet and ran in the other direction.\nC. Yes, because one should never pick up someone else's wallet laying on the ground for any reason.\nD. No, because the wallet was not in the immediate presence of the victim when the large man picked it up.\n"

Yes, because the large man followed too closely for too long, he sang menacing songs that placed the businessman in fear, and then he took the wallet and ran in the other direction.\n\nRobbery is typically defined as the taking of property from another person's presence by force or intimidation. In this scenario, the large man's close following, threatening behavior through song, and subsequent taking of the wallet while the businessman was in fear, strongly suggest an intent to commit robbery. The fact that the large man attempted to return the wallet after being arrested does not negate his initial actions at the time of the incident. The appellate court would likely consider the totality of the circumstances to affirm the conviction for robbery."
