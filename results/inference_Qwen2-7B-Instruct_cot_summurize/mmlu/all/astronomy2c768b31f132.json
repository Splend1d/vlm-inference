A and B only\n\nA. ejecta: This refers to the material that is blasted outwards from the impact site and can form a ring around the crater. The ejecta can have various compositions depending on the materials present in the area being impacted.\n\nB. Raised rims: Impact craters often have raised edges or rims due to the force of the impact. These rims can be steep or gentle, depending on the size of the impactor and the properties of the surface being impacted.\n\nCentral peaks are typically found in larger craters where the impact force is so strong that it actually raises the center of the crater above the surrounding terrain. However, this feature is not as commonly observed in smaller craters because the energy of the impact is not sufficient to significantly raise the center of the crater. Therefore, while central peaks can be a feature of some impact craters, they are not universally present in all impact craters, especially smaller ones."
