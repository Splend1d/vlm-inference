When product quality improves, it often means that new, better products enter the market, which can lead to an increase in the overall price level if these new products replace older, less expensive versions. This would cause the CPI to rise, assuming the cost of the new products is higher than the cost of the products they replace. Therefore, an improvement in product quality typically leads to an automatic increase in the CPI, assuming no other changes in the market."
