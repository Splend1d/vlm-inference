Moreover, for any \\(r \\in R\\), we have:\n\\[r(u + v) = ru + rv\\]\nSince \\(U\\) and \\(V\\) are ideals, \\(ru \\in U\\) and \\(rv \\in V\\) for all \\(r \\in R\\). Hence, \\(r(u + v) \\in I\\). Similarly, \\((u + v)r = ur + vr\\) shows that \\(I\\) absorbs multiplication from the right as well. Thus, \\(I\\) satisfies the conditions to be an ideal.\n\n2. **\\(J = \\{uv : u \\in U, v \\in V\\}\\)**\n\nThis set consists of products of elements from \\(U\\) and \\(V\\). To check if \\(J\\) is an ideal, we need to verify the absorption property for all \\(r \\in R\\):\n\\[r(uv) = ( (ru)v = (r(uv))\\]\nGiven \\(U\\) and \\(V\\) are ideals, \\(ru \\in U\\) and \\(v \\in V\\) imply \\(ruv \\in U\\) and \\(ruv \\ \\in V\\). Hence, \\(ruv \\ \\in J\\), showing \\(J\\) is indeed an ideal.\n\n3. **\\(K = \\{x : x \\in U \\cap V\\}\\)**\n\nThe set \\(K\\) consists of elements that are simultaneously in both \\(U\\) and \\(V\\). This set does not automatically form an ideal because while it might be closed under addition (since the intersection of two ideals is always an ideal, hence closed under addition), it doesn't necessarily absorb multiplication by elements of \\(R\\). The key point here is that for \\(x \\in K\\), if \\(r \\in R\\), then \\(rx\\) or \\(xr\\) might not necessarily be in \\(U\\) or \\(V\\) anymore, and thus not in \\(K\\). \n\nTherefore, based on the analysis:\n- **(I and II only** must be true, as they both satisfy the conditions to be ideals of \\(R\\).\n\nThe correct answer is: **C. I and II only**"
