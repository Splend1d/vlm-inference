AN (Anorexia Nervosa, has the highest mortality rate across all mental disorders. \n\nAnorexia Nervosa is associated with high rates of medical complications, including malnutrition, heart problems, and electrolyte imbalances, which can be life-threatening if not properly treated. The high mortality rate is partly due to the severity of these medical complications and the fact that many individuals with Anorexia Nervosa do not seek treatment.\n\nIt's important to note that the other options are incorrect for various reasons:\n\nA. Eating Disorders ( (ED) have not necessarily decreased in prevalence over the last decades. While there may have been improvements in recognizing and diagnosing EDs, as well as in treatment options, the overall prevalence might still be increasing due to factors like societal pressure to maintain an ideal body image.\n\nC. Binge Eating Disorder ( (BED) does not occur exclusively in obese subjects. While BED is more commonly diagnosed in individuals who are overweight or obese, it can also occur in those who are of normal weight.\n\nD. Individuals with Bulimia Nervosa ( (BN) are are not predominantly impulsive and have comorbid borderline personality disorder. While impulsivity can be a characteristic of individuals with BN, and they can have comorbid conditions including Borderline Personality Disorder, this statement oversimplifies the complex nature of eating disorders and the variety of traits and co-occurring disorders that people with BN might experience."
