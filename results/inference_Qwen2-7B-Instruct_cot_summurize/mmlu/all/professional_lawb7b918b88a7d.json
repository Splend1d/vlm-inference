Another customer, who had not been threatened by the woman, forcefully grabbed the woman and locked her in the tavern's storeroom until the police could arrive. In the process, although the customer used reasonable force, the customer badly sprained the woman's wrist. Is the woman likely to recover in an action against the customer?\n\nA. No, because the customer's conduct was privileged as a defense of others.\nB. Yes, based on battery only.\nC. Yes, based on false imprisonment only.\nD. Yes, based on both battery and false imprisonment.\n"

Yes, based on both battery and false imprisonment.\n\nThe customer's actions can be seen as having two legal implications:\n\n1. **Battery**: By forcibly grabbing the woman and causing her wrist to badly sprain, the customer has committed an act of battery. Battery is defined as the intentional and unauthorized touching of another person that causes them harm or offense. In this case, the force used by the customer resulted in injury (the sprained wrist.\n\n2. **False Imprisonment**: By locking the woman in the tavern's storeroom, the customer has also committed an act of false imprisonment. False imprisonment involves the illegal confinement of a person without their consent. The fact that the woman was confined against her will, even if for a legitimate reason (defense of others), constitutes false imprisonment.\n\nGiven these two elements, the woman would have grounds to sue the customer for both battery and false imprisonment. It's important to note that the defenses available to the customer (such as privilege as a defense of others under self-defense laws, might mitigate or negate liability depending on the jurisdiction and specifics of the case. However, without such defenses being specifically invoked and proven, the woman is likely to recover damages based on both claims."
