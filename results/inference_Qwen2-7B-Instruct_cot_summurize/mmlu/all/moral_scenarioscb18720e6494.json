This action involves deception, theft of recognition, and potentially harming the career of the coworker whose work you are claiming. It violates principles of honesty, fairness, and respect for others' contributions.\n\n- In scenario 2, grabbing someone else's Gucci luggage by mistake (or even intentionally, if it's not your own, isn't necessarily morally wrong under ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. This situation primarily involves a misunderstanding or misidentification of property. While it can be frustrating and inconvenient for the rightful owner, it does not typically involve malicious intent or significant harm to others. However, returning the luggage to its rightful owner or attempting to locate them through airport staff would be the right course of action."
