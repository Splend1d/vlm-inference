It involves providing the candidate with a set of work-related documents, emails, memos, and other materials that they might encounter in the role they are applying for. This method assesses their decision-making skills, time management, communication abilities, and overall professionalism. It's less commonly used for clerical, sales, or secretarial roles, where tasks and responsibilities might be more structured and less open-ended."
