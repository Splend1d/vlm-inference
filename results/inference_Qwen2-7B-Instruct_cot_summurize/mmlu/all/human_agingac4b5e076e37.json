Given this perspective, option B: \"Exercise keeps your mind sharp,\" aligns well with her viewpoint. Research has shown that regular exercise can improve cognitive function, including memory and attention, in older adults. Thus, it's plausible that Mabel Davis would advocate for the benefits of exercise on mental health, supporting this statement.\n\nOptions A and C might not necessarily be universally agreed upon by all seniors due to individual experiences and varying viewpoints. Option D is not aligned with promoting health and wellness in older age, as avoiding necessary medical equipment like glasses or hearing aids could hinder quality of life. Therefore, without knowing Mabel Davis' specific views, the most likely answer based on general wisdom about aging is B."
