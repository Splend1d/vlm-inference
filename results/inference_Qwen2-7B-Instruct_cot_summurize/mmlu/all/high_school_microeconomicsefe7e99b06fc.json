The socially optimal price is where the marginal cost (MC) curve intersects with the demand curve. This ensures that the quantity supplied matches the quantity demanded at the lowest possible marginal cost, maximizing efficiency and minimizing waste. At this point, the monopolist charges a price equal to the marginal cost, which leads to an efficient allocation of resources in the market."
