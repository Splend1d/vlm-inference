Her parents say that she started walking at the age of 14 months and since then has always seemed clumsier and had more injuries than other children. She has had increasingly frequent chest pain with exertion since starting a soccer program 3 months ago. She usually has pain or swelling of her knees or ankles after practice. She has been wearing glasses for 2 years. Her 16-year-old brother has required two operations for a severe rotator cuff injury he sustained while taking a shower, and she has a maternal cousin who died of a ruptured aortic aneurysm at the age of 26 years. Today, the patient walks with a limp. She is at the 99th percentile for height and 50th percentile for weight. A midsystolic click is heard at the apex. The left ankle is swollen and tender; range of motion is limited by pain. The joints of the upper and lower extremities are hypermobile, including 25 degrees of genu recurvatum, thumbs that may be extended to touch the forearms, and flexibility at the waist, with palms easily touching the floor with straight knees. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis?\n\nA. Skeletal survey\nB. Echocardiography\nC. Bone scan\nD. MRI of the shoulder\n"

Echocardiography\n\nThe history of chest pain with exertion, a family history of cardiovascular issues (specifically an aortic aneurysm, and the palpable click at the apex during auscultation (which could suggest a heart murmur or other cardiac abnormality, particularly in light of the family history, make echocardiography a logical first diagnostic step. This test allows for detailed visualization of the heart's structure and function, which can help identify any potential cardiac abnormalities.\n\nHowever, it is also important to consider the joint hypermobility and possible connective tissue disorder, which might necessitate further evaluation. Therefore, depending on the findings from the echocardiogram, additional tests such as a skeletal survey (to look for bone abnormalities associated with conditions like Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, or an MRI of the shoulder (if there's concern about the rotator cuff injury mentioned in the family history, could be considered. Bone scans might also be relevant if there are concerns about bone health or stress fractures.\n\nUltimately, a comprehensive approach to diagnosis, considering both cardiac and musculoskeletal systems, would be advisable given the presented symptoms and family history."
