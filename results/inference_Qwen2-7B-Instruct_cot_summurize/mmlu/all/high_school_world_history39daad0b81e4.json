It did not even grudge us the spectacle of the conflict. More than sixty thousand fell, not beneath the Roman arms and weapons, but, grander far, before our delighted eyes. May the tribes, I pray, ever retain if not love for us, at least hatred for each other; for while the destinies of empire hurry us on, fortune can give no greater boon than discord among our foes.\"\nGermania, Publius Cornelius Tacitus, ca. 98 C.E.\nWhich of the following conclusions about imperial treatment of \"barbarian\" (foreign) peoples in the period 600 B.C.E. to 600 C.E. is most directly supported by the passage?\n\nA. Empires encouraged rival tribes to destroy one another to reduce threats to the state.\nB. Empires welcomed migrations of barbarian peoples as sources of military manpower or economic productivity.\nC. Empires used military force against all neighboring barbarian peoples as a means of expanding their influence.\nD. Empires used religion to convert barbarian peoples so that they might become friendlier to the state.\n"

Empires encouraged rival tribes to destroy one another to reduce threats to the state.\n\nThe passage describes how certain tribes, like the Chamavi and Angrivarii, drove out and utterly exterminated other tribes, such as the Bructeri, with the assistance of neighboring tribes. Tacitus suggests this was done out of hatred for their tyranny, the attraction of plunder, or divine favor for the region. This indicates an imperial strategy of encouraging rival tribes to combat each other as a way to manage and reduce threats posed by foreign groups without direct intervention."
