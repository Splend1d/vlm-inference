The investigators defined antihypertensive therapy as effective if the treatment resulted in a blood pressure measurement below 140/90 mm Hg. When designing the study, the investigators set the probability of wrongly finding that Drug X is more effective than the standard therapy as 1%; they set the probability of wrongly finding that the effectiveness of the two drugs is the same as 10%.

It's the likelihood of detecting an effect when there is one. In your scenario, the investigators are interested in determining whether Drug X is more effective than the standard therapy. \n\nGiven:\n\n- They want to minimize the Type I error ( (false positive) to 1%.\n- They want to minimize the Type II error (false negative) to 10%.\n\nTypically, the power of a test is not directly specified by these values but is usually targeted to be high, often at least 80% or higher, especially for clinical trials. However, based on the context provided, we understand that they aim to control both types of errors at specific levels, which suggests they are trying to balance between minimizing false positives and false negatives.\n\nThe question seems to be asking for the most accurate estimate of the power of the study. Given the options:\n\nA. 1% - This represents the Type I error rate, not the power of the study.\nB. 10% - This represents the Type II error rate, not the power.\nC. 40% - This doesn't align with common expectations for a clinical trial's power, especially considering their efforts to control errors.\nD. 90% - This could potentially represent the power of the study, assuming they have designed it with adequate sample size and statistical considerations to achieve this level of power given their constraints on Type I and Type II errors.\n\nGiven the information provided and the typical expectations for clinical trials, option D (90% would be the most accurate estimate of the statistical power in this study, assuming that the study was well-designed to meet these stringent error rates while also achieving a high power to detect a difference if one exists. However, without specific details about the study design, sample size, and other statistical parameters, it's challenging to definitively state the power. In practice, a study aiming to control Type I and Type II errors at such low rates would likely require careful planning to ensure sufficient power."
