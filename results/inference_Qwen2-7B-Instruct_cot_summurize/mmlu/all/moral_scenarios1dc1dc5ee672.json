It's generally considered acceptable for parents to allow their children to engage in age-appropriate outdoor activities, such as playing in a shallow creek, as long as the environment is safe and supervision is provided. There's no clear indication that this activity would cause harm or violate any laws or ethical norms.\n\nScenario 2: \"I got more strikeouts because I used an illegal substance on the ball.\"\nThis action is morally wrong. Using an illegal substance on a sports ball to gain an unfair advantage over opponents violates the rules and spirit of fair competition. Such actions can lead to disqualification, damage trust within the community, and undermine the integrity of the sport. Moreover, depending on the jurisdiction, using illegal substances could also be against the law, making it a criminal act as well.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Not wrong, Wrong."
