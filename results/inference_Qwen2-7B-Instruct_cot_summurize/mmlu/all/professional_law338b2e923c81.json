As it turned out, the hospital had hired a 52-year-old man as the nurse\u00d5s replacement, a fact that rendered an age discrimination claim unavailable. The hospital responded tothe complaint by filing a motion for sanctions against thenurse\u00d5s attorney. Is the court likely to grant the hospital\u00d5s motion?\n\nA. No, because sanctions are not proper against the attorney of a represented party.\nB. No, because the hospital failed to give the attorney the chance to withdraw the complaint in advance of filing the motion with the court.\nC. Yes, because the nurse\u00d5s attorney failed to conduct areasonable pre-filing inquiry.\nD. Yes, because the nurse\u00d5s complaint contained legal contentions that were not warranted by existing lawbased on the facts in this case.\n"

Yes, because the nurse's attorney failed to conduct a reasonable pre-filing inquiry.\n\nIn legal terms, attorneys have a duty to exercise reasonable care and diligence when filing complaints or motions with the court. This includes ensuring that the claims being presented are legally viable based on the facts of the case. In this scenario, the attorney filed an age discrimination complaint, which became invalid once it was discovered that the hospital had hired a similarly aged individual to replace the nurse. This indicates that the attorney may not have conducted a thorough investigation into all relevant facts before filing the complaint, potentially violating their professional responsibility.\n\nCourts can impose sanctions against attorneys for misconduct, including failing to conduct adequate research or investigation before filing documents with the court. These sanctions might include fines, the inability to practice for a period, or other penalties aimed at deterring future similar behavior. Therefore, given the circumstances described, the court is more likely to grant the hospital's motion for sanctions against the nurse's attorney for failing to conduct a reasonable pre-filing inquiry."
