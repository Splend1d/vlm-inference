                    "text": "A state has recently enacted a statute requiring all prospective voters in state elections who wish to write-in a candidate to print the candidate's full name, and designate the office for which the candidate is running. The statute provides that such information must be written on the ballot in ink inan appropriate space. A write-in candidate is a German-American and is of the opinion that he needs a large turnout of German voters in order to win the election. As a result, his campaign manager decides to mail to every registered German voter a tear-off sticker, which bears the candidate's name and office for which he is running. Since many native German people are not proficient in reading and writing English, the campaign manager believes that many of the voters will have difficulty writing the candidate's name and office on the ballot. As a result, the campaign manager has mounted an extensive media campaign to inform voters on how to apply the stickers to the ballot. Five months prior to the election an election official notifies the candidate's campaign committee that the tear-off stickers do not comply with the state statute. In her letter, the official explains that state election officials are of the opinion that it is necessary for potential voters to write the candidate's name in ink. Therefore, she concludes that the stickers do not comply with statutory requirements. Three weeks later, the candidate filed suit in federal district court against state election officials, claiming that their interpretation of the state statute violates the U. S. Constitution. Which of the following sets forth the strongest constitutional argument the candidate could make against the interpretation of the statute by the state officials?\n\nA. It unreasonably discriminates against German voters who lack a proficiency in the English language.\nB. It unreasonably discriminates against write-in candidates for public office.\nC. It unreasonably interferes with the exclusive federal election power as embodied in the Fifteenth Amendment.\nD. It unreasonably interferes with the 1965 Voting Rights Act outlawing literacy tests.\n"

                    "text": "The strongest constitutional argument the candidate could make against the interpretation of the statute by the state officials would likely be:\n\nA. It unreasonably discriminates against German voters who lack a proficiency in the English language.\n\nThis argument focuses on the unequal treatment of voters based on their language abilities, which may be considered a form of discrimination under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. By requiring voters to write the candidate's name and office in English, the state statute potentially disadvantages those who are less proficient in English, particularly if this group disproportionately includes German-speaking voters. This could be seen as a violation of the Equal Protection Clause, which prohibits states from denying any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. \n\nArguments B, C, and D might also have some merit depending on the specifics of the case and existing legal precedents, but they would likely be more difficult to argue successfully without clear evidence or precedent supporting their application to the facts presented. For example:\n\n- Argument B could be argued if there is evidence showing that the statute specifically targets write-in candidates, potentially affecting their ability to gain votes compared to candidates appearing on the ballot. However, without specific evidence linking the statute to a discriminatory impact on write-in candidates, this argument might be weaker than A.\n\n- Argument C could potentially be relevant if the Fifteenth Amendment's prohibition on denying the right to vote based on race or color were implicated. However, the amendment was ratified before the widespread use of write-in ballots and does not directly address language barriers or voter assistance. Thus, while theoretically possible, this argument might be less compelling unless the statute can be shown to have a discriminatory effect on racial minorities or is part of a broader pattern of discrimination.\n\n- Argument D could be relevant if the Voting Rights Act had provisions that specifically addressed language barriers or voter assistance. However, without specific evidence that the act applies to this situation or that the statute has a discriminatory effect related to the Voting Rights Act, this argument would likely be less strong than A.\n\nIn summary, argument A is the strongest because it directly addresses the potential violation of the Equal Protection Clause through unequal treatment of voters based on language ability, which is a clear and direct constitutional concern."
