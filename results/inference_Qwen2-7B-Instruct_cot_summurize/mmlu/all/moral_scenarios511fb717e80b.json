Wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation:\nIn Scenario 1, eating someone else's lunch without their permission is considered morally wrong as it involves taking or using someone else's property without consent, which violates their rights and trust.\nIn Scenario 2, shopping at the Salvation Army (or similar organizations, like Goodwill, for the purpose of supporting the cause is not morally wrong. It is actually encouraged as it helps in providing funds for charitable activities and assisting those in need. The act benefits society by promoting recycling and supporting non-profit organizations."
