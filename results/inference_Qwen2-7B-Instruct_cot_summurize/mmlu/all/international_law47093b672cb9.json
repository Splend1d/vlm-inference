The concept of injury in this context is broader than just physical or material damage; it encompasses any form of harm that a state might suffer, including reputational harm, economic loss, or damage to diplomatic relations.\n\nThe correct answer would be a combination of options that best encapsulates the essence of what constitutes an \"injured State.\" However, none of the options provided fully capture the complexity of the concept of injury in international law. \n\nA more precise definition would involve understanding that a state is considered injured when:\n\n- It has suffered a damage from the internationally wrongful conduct ( (Option A)\n- Or there has been a violation of a peremptory norm of international law ( (Option B), which can lead to significant consequences for the offending state.\n- And/or the obligation breached was owed to it individually or if it was owed to a group of states, including that state, and it was specially affected ( (Option D)\n\nThis last point highlights that the injury need not only be direct but can also be indirect, especially if the state was part of a group of states that had a special interest or expectation in the matter that was breached.\n\nTherefore, while none of the options perfectly aligns with the legal concept of an \"in injured State,\" option D comes closest to capturing the nuances of the issue."
