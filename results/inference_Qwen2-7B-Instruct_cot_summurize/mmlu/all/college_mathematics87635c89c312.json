A tree with \\(n\\) vertices has \\(n-1\\) edges. Therefore, a tree with 5 vertices will have 4 edges.\n\nLet's consider how these vertices and edges can be arranged without forming any cycles:\n\n1. **One Vertex is a Leaf:**\n   - Choose one vertex to be a leaf (4 ways (since any of the 5 vertices can be chosen).\n   - The remaining 4 vertices form a chain (only 1 way to arrange them in a line without forming a cycle.\n   - Total configurations for this case = \\(4 \\times 1 = 4\\).\n\n2. **Two Vertices are Leaves:**\n   - Choose two vertices to be leaves (\\(\\binom{5}{2} = 10\\) ways).\n  - The other three vertices form a chain.\n  - Total configurations for this case = \\(10 \\times 1 = 10\\).\n\n3. **No Vertices are Leaves:**\n   - This configuration corresponds to a star graph where all vertices are connected to a central vertex and then two additional branches of length 1 each.\n  - There is only 1 way to arrange this configuration since the choice of which vertex is the central vertex is unique.\n\nAdding these possibilities together, we get:\n\\[4 + 10 + 1 = 15\\]\n\nHowever, this calculation overcounts some cases because it doesn't account for the fact that the two-leaf case can be further divided into configurations based on where the leaves are located relative to each other. Specifically, the two-leaf case should actually be considered as follows:\n\n- **Two Vertices are Leaves:**\n  - If the two leaves are adjacent, there is only 1 way to arrange them since the rest of the structure (the chain of 3 vertices) is fixed.\n  - If the two leaves are not adjacent, then they must be at the ends of the chain of 3 vertices, giving us another 1 way (since the arrangement of the chain and the two leaves does not change the structure.\n  \nSo, the correct breakdown for the two-leaf case is \\(2\\) configurations instead of \\(10\\). Let's correct the total:\n\n1. **One Vertex is a Leaf:** Correctly calculated as \\(4\\).\n2. **Two Vertices are Leaves:** Now correctly calculated as \\(2\\).\n3. **No Vertices are Leaves:** Correctly calculated as \\(1\\).\n\nAdding these correctly calculated configurations together gives us:\n\\[4 + 2 + 1 = 7\\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is that there are 7 non-isomorphic trees with 5 vertices, which was not listed among the options provided (A. 1, B. 2, C. 3, D. 4. It seems there might have been an oversight in the options given."
