Hire a colleague to take over his appointments while he is on vacation.\n\nThis ensures continuity of care for his clients and provides them with support when needed. It also allows Dr. Holliday to fully enjoy his vacation without worrying about his professional responsibilities. \n\nOption A ( discussing his vacation plans with his current clients ahead of time is also a good practice as it sets clear expectations. However, it doesn't solve the problem if an emergency occurs during his absence.\n\nOption B ( giving his clients a phone number where he can be reached might not be practical or ethical if it involves leaving clients in charge of their own care, which could lead to potential harm if they're unable to provide adequate psychological support.\n\nOption C, giving his clients the phone number of a colleague who has agreed to accept phone calls in emergencies, could work under certain circumstances, but it depends on the nature of the emergencies and the trust between the client and the colleague. If emergencies are frequent or severe, this might not be the best solution. \n\nHence, hiring a colleague to take over his appointments while he is on vacation is the most comprehensive and responsible option."
