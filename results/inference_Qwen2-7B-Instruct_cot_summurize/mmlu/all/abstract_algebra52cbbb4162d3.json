This means each element in the domain maps to a unique element in the codomain.\n  \n- **Surjectivity**: A function \\(f\\) is surjective (or onto) if for every \\(b \\in B\\), there exists at least one \\(a \\in A\\) such that \\(f(a) = b\\). This means every element in the codomain is mapped to by some element in the domain.\n\nGiven the condition that for all \\(a \\in A\\), \\(g(f(a)) = a\\), we can analyze both statements:\n\n**Statement 1**: The function \\(f\\) must necessarily be injective.\n\nThis statement is **True**. If \\(f\\) were not injective, there would exist \\(a_1 \\neq a_2\\) in \\(A\\) such that \\(f(a_1) = f(a_2)\\). However, this would imply \\(g(f(a_1)) = g(f(a_2))\\), which would mean \\(a_1 \\neq a_2\\) but \\(g(f(a_1)) = g(f(a_2)) = a_1 = a_2\\), contradicting our assumption. Thus, for the given condition to hold, \\(f\\) must be injective.\n\n**Statement 2**: The function \\(f\\) must necessarily be surjective.\n\nThis statement is **False**. The given condition does not guarantee that \\(f\\) is surjective. For \\(f\\) to be surjective, every element in \\(B\\) must be the image of some element in \\(A\\), but the condition only ensures that applying \\(g\\) after \\(f\\) brings us back to the original element in \\(A\\). It does not necessarily imply that every element in \\(B\\) has a preimage in \\(A\\).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **C. True, False**."
