Doctrine of Destructibility of Contingent Remainders.\n\nThis doctrine states that a remainder interest becomes void if the condition upon which it was granted fails to occur. In this case, the cousin conveyed the property to the farmer \"for as long as he would continue to farm the property.\" Since this is a contingent remainder, and the condition (farming the property continuously - has been met by the farmer, the remainder interest would not be destroyed. However, the initial conveyance from the homeowner to his cousin for \"life\" would still take precedence, making the cousin the owner during his lifetime. Upon the cousin's death, the property would revert to the homeowner's heirs under the original deed. The farmer would have an interest based on the conditional remainder, but it wouldn't override the previous deed terms."
