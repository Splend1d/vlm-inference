L <= M <= T <= R.\n\nHere's why:\n\n1. **Left Sum (L**: This sum uses rectangles whose height is determined by the function value at the left endpoint of each subinterval. Since the function is increasing, the left endpoints give us the smallest possible heights for the rectangles within each subinterval.\n\n2. **Midpoint Sum M**: The midpoint sum uses rectangles where the height is determined by the function value at the midpoint of each subinterval. For an increasing function, the midpoint heights will be greater than those used in the left sum but less than those used in the right sum.\n\n3. **Trapezoidal Sum T**: The trapezoidal rule averages the heights of the left and right sums, creating trapezoids instead of rectangles. Since the function is increasing and concave up, the trapezoids will have a larger area than any of the rectangles used in the left or midpoint sums, but they will not exceed the area of the rectangles used in the right sum.\n\n4. **Right Sum R**: This sum uses rectangles whose height is determined by the function value at the right endpoint of each subinterval. For an increasing function, these rectangles will provide the largest possible heights within each subinterval.\n\nGiven these properties, we can see that:\n- The left sum (L will be the smallest because it uses the smallest possible heights.\n- The midpoint sum M will be greater than L but smaller than R because it uses midpoints which are higher than the left endpoints but lower than the right endpoints.\n- The trapezoidal sum T will be greater than M because it averages the left and right sums, thus capturing more area.\n- The right sum R will be the largest because it uses the highest possible heights.\n\nSo, the order from smallest to largest is: L <= M <= T <= R."
