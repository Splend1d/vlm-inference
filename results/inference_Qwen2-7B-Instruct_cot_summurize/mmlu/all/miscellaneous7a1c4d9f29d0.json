It focuses on using drought-tolerant plants, mulching, efficient irrigation systems, and other strategies to minimize water usage while maintaining a beautiful outdoor space.\n\nReplacing non-native ornamentals with native shrubs that don't require much irrigation is a key principle of xeriscaping. Native plants are adapted to local conditions, so they typically require less water, fertilizer, and maintenance compared to non-native species. This choice supports local ecosystems and biodiversity as well."
