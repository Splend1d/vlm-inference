                    "text": "The correct answer is A. One cannot have comparative advantage in producing both goods if they have an absolute advantage in producing at least one of them. Comparative advantage refers to the ability of an individual or entity to produce a particular good or service at a lower opportunity cost than another individual or entity. If someone has an absolute advantage in producing both goods, it means they can produce more of both goods than anyone else, which contradicts the concept of comparative advantage.\n\nHere's a brief explanation of each option:\n\nA. One cannot have comparative advantage in producing both goods if they have an absolute advantage in producing at least one of them. This statement is incorrect based on the definition of comparative and absolute advantages.\n\nB. One can have both an absolute advantage and a comparative advantage in producing x. This statement is correct because having an absolute advantage ( (being able to produce more of x than others) does not preclude having a comparative advantage ( ( being able to produce x relatively cheaper compared to others).\n\nC. One can have absolute advantage and no comparative advantage in producing x. This statement is possible. For example, if person A can produce 10 units of x in an hour while person B can produce 5 units of x in an hour, but person A can also produce 20 units of y in an hour while person B can produce 15 units of y in an hour, then person A has an absolute advantage in producing x but no comparative advantage since they can produce y at a lower opportunity cost compared to person B.\n\nD. One can have comparative advantage and no absolute advantage in producing x. This statement is possible as well. For example, if person A can produce 10 units of x in an hour while person B can produce 5 units of x in an hour, but person A can also produce 20 units of y in an hour while person B can produce only 5 units of y in an hour, then person A has a comparative advantage in producing x but no absolute advantage since person B can produce more of x in an hour."
