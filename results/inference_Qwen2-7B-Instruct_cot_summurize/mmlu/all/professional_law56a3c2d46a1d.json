The senator claimed that the allegations in the newspaper story were false, and he brought a defamation action against the newspaper. Which of the following is the most accurate statement with regard to the newspaper's liability?\n\nA. A qualified privilege of fair comment existed because the newspaper was reporting on a matter of public interest.\nB. Because the senator is a public figure, he has the burden of proof to show malice on the part of the newspaper.\nC. The newspaper would not be liable because, under the First Amendment's freedom of the press, the newspaper was privileged to publish the story.\nD. The newspaper would be relieved of any liability for defamation because an absolute privilege existed.\n"

Because the senator is a public figure, he has the burden of proof to show malice on the part of the newspaper.\n\nWhen a public figure, like a politician, brings a defamation claim, they must prove that the defamatory statements were made with \"actual malice.\" This means that the newspaper must have known the statements were false or acted with reckless disregard for the truth. This standard applies to protect the public interest when information about public figures is at stake."
