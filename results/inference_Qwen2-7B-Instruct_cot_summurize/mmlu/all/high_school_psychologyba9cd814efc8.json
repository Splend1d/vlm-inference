Operant conditioning involves behaviors being reinforced or punished, leading to changes in the frequency of those behaviors.\n\nHere's a brief explanation of each option:\n\nA. Milo starting at the sound of a buzzer because it sounds similar to his alarm clock is an example of classical conditioning, where a neutral stimulus (the buzzer) becomes associated with a naturally occurring stimulus (the alarm clock), leading to a conditioned response (starting at the buzzer.\n\nB. Paula's promotion leading to her vow not to lose touch with her employees is an example of reinforcement, a key component of operant conditioning. In this case, the promotion acts as a positive reinforcer, increasing the likelihood of her continuing to maintain connections with her employees.\n\nC. Rebecca cancelling her credit card to avoid the annual fee and planning to reinstate it later does not fit into either classical or operant conditioning directly. This could be seen as a decision based on cost-benefit analysis rather than a direct application of operant conditioning principles.\n\nD. Ashmed speaking louder on the phone because his mother has difficulty hearing is another example of reinforcement, similar to option B. The louder speech is a response to a specific consequence (his mother's hearing difficulty, which increases the likelihood of her understanding him better, thus reinforcing this behavior.\n\nSo, while all options involve some form of learning or decision-making process, only options B and D can be considered examples of operant conditioning if we strictly interpret the question. However, the most accurate answer would be option B, as it specifically describes a scenario where a behavior is reinforced by a positive outcome (promotion leading to a promise to maintain connections with employees."
