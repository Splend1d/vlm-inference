She is 165 cm (5 ft 5 in) tall and weighs 70 kg (154 lb); BMI is 26 kg/m2 . Her pulse is 80/min, and blood pressure is 130/82 mm Hg. Physical examination shows temporal balding and coarse dark hair on the upper lip and chin. Pelvic examination shows clitoral enlargement. Her serum testosterone concentration is increased. Serum concentrations of androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone, and urinary 17-ketosteroids are within the reference ranges. Ultrasonography of the pelvis shows a 12-cm ovarian mass. Which of the following best describes this mass?\n\nA. Granulosa tumor\nB. Ovarian carcinoid\nC. Sertoli-Leydig tumor\nD. Teratoma\n"

                    "text": "The best description for this ovarian mass would be:\n\nA. Granulosa tumor\n\nGranulosa cell tumors are a type of ovarian tumor that typically occur in postmenopausal women but can also affect younger individuals, like in this case. They are often associated with increased levels of estrogen and may cause symptoms such as increased facial hair growth (hirsutism), acne, and irregular menstrual periods. The presence of an increased serum testosterone concentration, along with other symptoms like temporal balding and clitoral enlargement, points towards a hormonal imbalance that could be indicative of a granulosa cell tumor.\n\nIt's important to note that the other options are less likely based on the information provided:\n\nB. Ovarian carcinoid - These are slow-growing tumors that produce hormones, but they do not typically cause hirsutism or have the same typical presentation as granulosa cell tumors.\n\nC. Sertoli-Leydig tumor - This type of tumor is more common in males, although it can occur in females. It usually presents with symptoms related to androgen excess, such as hirsutism, but the presentation would typically differ from what's described here.\n\nD. Teratoma - Also known as a yolk sac tumor, this type of tumor contains tissues of different embryonic origin, including hair, teeth, and bone fragments. While it can present with various symptoms, the hormonal aspects and specific clinical presentation do not align with a teratoma."
