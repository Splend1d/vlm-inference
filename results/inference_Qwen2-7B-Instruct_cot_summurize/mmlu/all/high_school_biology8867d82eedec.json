Water flows from a hypotonic solution to a hypertonic solution, not the other way around, due to osmosis.\nB. Germinating seeds actually use more oxygen (than do non-germinating seeds because respiration is increased during germination to fuel metabolic processes.\nC. The rate of transpiration increases with an increase in air movement because higher air velocity enhances water vapor removal from the leaves.\nD. This statement is correct; in gel electrophoresis, smaller DNA fragments travel faster and thus migrate further through the gel matrix compared to larger fragments."
