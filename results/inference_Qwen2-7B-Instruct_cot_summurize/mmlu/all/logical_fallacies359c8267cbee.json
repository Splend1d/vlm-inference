Therefore, option B is correct:\n\nB. arguing that two things are causally related without evidence of a causal relationship\n\nThis fallacy occurs when someone assumes that just because two events occurred sequentially, one must be the direct result of the other. This conclusion is often incorrect, as there could be other explanations or intervening factors. To avoid this fallacy, one should look for evidence of a causal relationship, such as a controlled experiment or a well-established scientific theory, rather than simply assuming causality based on temporal succession alone."
