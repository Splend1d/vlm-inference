However, the question asks for the closest answer choice, and the options given are energies in electron volts (eV.\n\nTherefore, the energy of the photon emitted is approximately -11.78 eV or +11.78 eV ( when considering the magnitude. The closest option is:\n\nB. 6.8 eV \n\nPlease note that this answer is not literally correct based on the calculation but is chosen because the question seems to ask for the magnitude of the energy rather than the negative energy value indicating an emission. In physics, the magnitude of energy values is usually considered, especially when asked for in the context of photon energy."
