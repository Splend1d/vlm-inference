Non-governmental groups have played a significant and effective role in developingi ng arms control measures in recent years.\n\nNon-governmental organizations (NGOs) play a crucial role in the global defense trade by advocating for policies changes, raising awareness about the impacts of arms sales and trade, and pushing for more responsible practices within the industry. They often engage in research, publish reports, and organize campaigns that can influence public opinion and government policies. NGOs can also provide a platform for victims of armed conflict to share their experiences, which can help shape international laws and norms regarding the use and trade of weapons. Furthermore, they can monitor compliance with existing arms control agreements and lobby for the development of new ones. Their efforts are instrumental in promoting transparency, accountability, and ethical standards in the defense sector."
