Not wrong, Wrong\n\nExplanation:\nIn Scenario 1, keeping kimchi in the garage is not inherently morally wrong, though it might be considered irresponsible or thoughtless if it leads to the food going bad or causing unpleasant odors. The main character's action could be seen as neglectful or inconsiderate, but it doesn't necessarily violate any clear moral norms unless it leads to significant harm or inconvenience to others.\n\nIn Scenario 2, removing the batteries from smoke alarms is morally wrong. It constitutes a risk to personal safety and the safety of others by disabling an essential device designed to alert people to potential fire hazards. This action violates basic moral standards concerning care for oneself and others and can be considered reckless and potentially criminal, depending on local laws."
