While every partial order is a relation that is reflexive, antisymmetric, and transitive, an equivalence relation is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive. Thus, not all equivalence relations satisfy the antisymmetry property required for a partial order.\n\nB. **Number of relations from set A = {x, y, z} to set B = {1, 2) is 64.**\n   - This statement is true. To determine the number of relations from set A to set B, we consider that for each pair (a, b) in A x B ( (which contains 3 * 2 = 6 pairs), we can either include it in a relation or not. This gives us 2^6 = 2^6 = 64 possible relations.\n\nC. **Empty relation _ is reflexive.**\n   - This statement is false. A relation R on a set S is reflexive if every element of S is related to itself. The empty relation does not contain any elements, so it cannot be reflexive unless S is empty.\n\nD. **Properties of a relation being symmetric and being unsymmetric are negative of each other.**\n  - This statement is false. Symmetry and unsymmetry (or asymmetric properties of a relation are not considered as negative of each other. A relation can be symmetric without being unsymmetric, and vice versa. For example, a relation is symmetric if for every (a, b) in the relation, (b, a) is also in the relation. It can also be asymmetric if for every (a, b) in the relation, (b, a) is not in the relation. These are distinct properties and do not have a direct negative relationship with each other.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is **B**."
