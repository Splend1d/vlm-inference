It is often used in laboratories for tasks such as DNA sequencing, gene expression analysis, and creating enough DNA for cloning. The process involves denaturing the double-stranded DNA, annealing primers to the single-stranded DNA, and then extend the primers with a DNA polymerase enzyme. This cycle is repeated multiple times, exponentially increasing the copies of the targeted DNA sequence."
