The student should have stopped eating pizza after 2 slices.\n\nMarginal utility refers to the additional satisfaction or utility gained from consuming one more unit of a good or service. In this case, the marginal utility of the first slice of pizza is 10 utils, and it decreases to 7 utils for the second slice and further to 3 utils for the third slice. This suggests that each additional slice provides less satisfaction than the previous one.\n\nGiven this information, the student would likely gain more total utility by stopping at the second slice rather than continuing to the third. Therefore, based on the principle of diminishing marginal utility (\u2014 where each successive unit provides less additional utility \u2014 the student should have stopped eating pizza after the second slice to maximize their overall satisfaction or utility."
