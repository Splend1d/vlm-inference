This method forces raters to distribute a fixed number of high or low ratings across a group of individuals being evaluated, which can help reduce this type of bias. However, it's important to note that while this approach can address certain statistical concerns related to ipsativity, it may also introduce other biases or limitations if not carefully implemented."
