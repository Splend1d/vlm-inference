Supply loops, Recapture, Waste.\n\nReplacing supply chains with supply loops enhances the importance of product recapture as well as a fundamental redesign of every activity a firm engages in that produces waste. \n\nSupply loops refer to a system where products are reused or recycled, rather than discarded. This system encourages companies to design products for reuse and recycling, which in turn leads to product recapture. The focus shifts from linear production (make, use, dispose) to a more circular economy model. This change necessitates redesigning of activities within a company, including manufacturing processes, product design, and logistics, to minimize waste and maximize resource efficiency."
