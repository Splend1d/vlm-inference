                    "text": "To find the correct pretax income for the year ended December 31, we need to adjust the reported pretax income based on the errors found by the external auditors.\n\nFirst, let's identify how each error affects the pretax income:\n\n1. **Ending inventory overstated**: When ending inventory is overstated, it means that more inventory is recorded than actually exists. This results in higher cost of goods sold (COGS), which reduces gross profit and thus decreases pretax income. To correct this, we need to reduce the pretax income by the overstatement of inventory.\n\n   Original pretax income = $152,500\n\n   Correction for overstated inventory = $30,000\n\n   Adjusted pretax income after correcting inventory = $152,500 - $30,000 = $122,500\n\n2. **Depreciation expense understated**: Understating depreciation expense means that expenses are not fully recognized in the current period, resulting in higher net income than it should be. To correct this, we need to add back the understated amount to the adjusted pretax income.\n\n   Correction for understated depreciation = $66,400\n\n   Final corrected pretax income = $122,500 + $66,400 = $188,900\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is not listed among your options. The correct pretax income, after adjusting for these errors, would be $188,900."
