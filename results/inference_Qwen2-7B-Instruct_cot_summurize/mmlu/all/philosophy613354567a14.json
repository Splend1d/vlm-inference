The first principle is the \"original position\" or \"veil of ignorance,\" which is a thought experiment designed to ensure fairness in the creation of societal principles. The second principle is the \"difference principle,\" which states that social and economic inequalities should be arranged so that they are to everyone's greatest benefit, particularly those least well-off. These two principles cannot be understood or accepted independently of each other; one relies on the foundational assumptions of the other."
