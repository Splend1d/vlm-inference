                    "text": "The process that uses only the gradient of material to control the direction in which the material moves across the cell membrane is:\n\nA. Osmosis\n\nOsmosis is the movement of solvent (usually water) molecules across a selectively permeable membrane from an area of lower solute concentration to an area of higher solute concentration. This movement occurs naturally and does not require energy input from the cell. It relies solely on the concentration gradient of the solvent and solute to drive the movement of water molecules.\n\nWhile all of the options you've listed involve transport mechanisms across the cell membrane, let's briefly describe each one to clarify their roles:\n\nB. Passive Transport: This includes several types of transport, such as simple diffusion and facilitated diffusion. Simple diffusion involves the movement of substances down their concentration gradient without the use of cellular energy. Facilitated diffusion requires carrier proteins but still moves substances down their concentration gradient, again using no energy from the cell.\n\nC. Active Transport: This mechanism requires energy (usually in the form of ATP - to move substances against their concentration gradient, from an area of lower solute concentration to an area of higher solute concentration. This allows cells to take up nutrients or expel waste even when those substances are at a lower concentration inside the cell than outside.\n\nD. Endocytosis: This is a process by which the cell takes in large molecules or particles by engulfing them in a vesicle formed from the cell membrane. This process requires energy and involves the cell membrane folding inward to create a vesicle around the substance to be taken in.\n\nSo, while osmosis uses the concentration gradient to move water across the cell membrane, passive transport generally refers to the broader set of mechanisms that can include osmosis, simple diffusion, and facilitated diffusion, none of which specifically rely on active energy input to move substances against their concentration gradient."
