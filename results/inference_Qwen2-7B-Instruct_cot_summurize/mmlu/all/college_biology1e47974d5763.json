The suspensor is indeed derived from the basal cell, which is part of the endosperm and plays a crucial role in supporting the developing embryo.\nB. Cotyledons, which store nutrients for the developing embryo, are derived from the apical cell, which is part of the embryo proper.\nC. Contrary to option C, shoot apical meristem (SAM) formation typically occurs during the early stages of embryogenesis, not after seed formation. The SAM is responsible for the continuous growth and development of shoots in the mature plant.\nD. Precursors of all three plant tissue systems ( dermal, ground, and vascular - do form during embryogenesis, as the embryo develops into the mature plant with these distinct tissue layers."
