Please ship immediately 36 dozen 10-inch hot dog buns at your current list price of $6 per dozen. \"The day after receiving the purchase order, the bakery shipped 24 dozen 10-inch hot dog buns and 12 dozen 8-inch hot dog buns. The owner of the bakery had instructed his staff to include a message that the bakery did not have enough 10-inch hot dog buns to fill the order, so they were including the 8-inch hot dog buns as an accommodation. However, the shipping department forgot to \u0080\u0098include the message with the shipment. Which of the following is the most accurate statement regarding the operator's legal rights following receipt of the hot dog buns?\n\nA. The operator may either accept or reject all of the hot dog buns upon seasonable notice to the bakery, but it cannot accept only the 10-inch hot dog buns without the bakery's approval.\nB. The operator may either accept or reject all of the hot dog buns, or accept any commercial unit and reject the rest, but must give the bakery seasonable notice of either total or partial rejection.\nC. The operator may either accept or reject all of the hot dog buns, or accept the 10-inch buns and reject the 8-inch buns, but it cannot accept any combination of the hot dog buns.\nD. The operator may either accept or reject all of the hot dog buns, or, provided the bakery gives seasonable notice that the shipment was made for accommodation only, the operator may accept any combination of hot dog buns and reject the rest.\n"

The operator may either accept or reject all of the hot dog buns, or accept any commercial unit and reject the rest, but must give the bakery seasonable notice of either total or partial rejection.\n\nThis is based on the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), which governs the sale of goods in many jurisdictions. When a buyer receives non-conforming goods, they have the option to accept the goods, reject them entirely, or reject only some of the goods (accepting the conforming ones). In this case, the operator can choose to accept all the hot dog buns, accept only the 10-inch buns, or accept the 12 dozen 8-inch buns while rejecting the 24 dozen 10-inch buns. The operator must provide timely notice to the bakery regarding their decision."
