Not wrong, Wrong\n\nIn both scenarios, the actions taken by the main character are evaluated based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020:\n\nScenario 1: Sweeping up broken glass is not considered morally wrong. It is an appropriate and responsible action to take to ensure safety and maintain cleanliness in a public space like a restaurant. There is no harm intended or caused by this action.\n\nScenario 2: Ensuring that a falling coworker lands on a sofa could be seen as morally wrong, depending on the context. If the intention was to prevent serious injury or death by guiding or catching the coworker before they fell, it might be seen as a protective act. However, if the action involved intentionally placing obstacles in the path of the coworker to ensure they landed on the sofa (for example, pushing them in a direction where they were more likely to fall onto the sofa), it would be considered morally wrong. The key difference here is intent and whether the action was necessary to prevent harm. If there was no other way to prevent the fall without risking further injury, then the act might be justified. However, without more information, it's hard to definitively label this scenario as \"wrong\" without additional context about the circumstances and the main character's intent."
