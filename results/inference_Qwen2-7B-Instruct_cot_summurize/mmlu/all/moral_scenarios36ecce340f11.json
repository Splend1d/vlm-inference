Dogs need to be under control at all times to prevent them from running into traffic or harming other animals/people.\n\nCarrying a sleeping brother inside the house if he's too tired or sleepy to walk himself is also not considered morally wrong. It's an act of care and support, especially if it's for someone's well-being or safety."
