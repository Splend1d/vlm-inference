This is supported by findings such as beads made from seashells that have been found in Neandertal sites, which suggests they engaged in some form of personal adornment or ritual practices.\n\nB. Neandertals buried their dead. Evidence from various Neandertal sites, such as the El Sidr\u00f3n cave in Spain, shows that Neandertals practiced burial rituals, indicating a level of cognitive sophistication and emotional complexity.\n\nC. Neandertals produced and used complex stone tools. This is well-documented through archaeological finds, including tools like the Mousterian tool industry, which includes a variety of stone tools such as hand axes, scrapers, and points, demonstrating their technological capabilities and ingenuity."
