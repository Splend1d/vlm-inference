The mean IQ score is typically around 100, with a standard deviation of around 15 points. Thus, a score range of 70 to 130 spans two standard deviations below the mean (to two standard deviations above the mean. This range would cover approximately 95% of the population, given the empirical rule for normal distributions.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer would be D. 95%."
