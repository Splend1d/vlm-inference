The bonds linking the monomers of starch differ in shape from the bonds linking the monomers of cellulose.\n\nThis answer choice highlights that the structure of the bonds between glucose monomers in starch and cellulose differs significantly. In starch, the glucose monomers are linked through alpha-1,4-glycosidic bonds and alpha-1,6-glycosidic bonds, allowing for a more flexible and digestible structure. In contrast, cellulose's glucose monomers are linked through beta-1,4-glycosidic bonds, creating a strong, rigid, and non-digestible polymer. This structural difference means that enzymes capable of breaking down alpha-1,4-glycosidic bonds are present in our digestive system to break down starch, whereas no such enzyme exists to break down beta-1,4-glycosidic bonds in cellulose."
