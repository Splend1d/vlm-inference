Instead, he posits that these moral convictions have evolved over many generations through a process of moral reflection. This means that these moral beliefs have been refined, debated, and adapted over time as societies and individuals consider ethical principles and their implications.\n\nThus, the correct answer would be:\n\nA. the moral reflection of many generations."
