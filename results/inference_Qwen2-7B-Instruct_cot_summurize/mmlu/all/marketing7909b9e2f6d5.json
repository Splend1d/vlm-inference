Harvesting objectives.\n\nHarvesting objectives refer to strategies that focus on maximizing short-term profits from a product or business segment that is in a mature phase of its life cycle, particularly when it's entering a decline phase. This strategy involves optimizing the use of existing resources to generate as much profit as possible before the product or business segment becomes unprofitable or loses competitiveness. It may involve reducing investment in the product or segment, focusing on cost-cutting measures, or targeting specific customer segments that provide higher profitability.\n\nHere's a brief overview of each option:\n\nA. Divest objectives: This strategy involves selling off underperforming assets or business units to free up capital for more profitable ventures. It can be part of a broader restructuring plan but does not necessarily focus on maximizing short-term profits in a mature market.\n\nB. Hold objectives: This strategy maintains the status quo without making significant changes to the product, marketing, or operational approach. It is typically used when there are are no better alternatives available, and the company aims to preserve its market share rather than aggressively growing profits.\n\nC. Growth objectives: This strategy focuses on expanding the market presence and increasing sales through innovation, marketing, or geographic expansion. It is most suitable for products or businesses in early stages of their life cycle when growth is still possible.\n\nEach of these strategies can be tailored to fit the specific circumstances of a mature market where a product or business is declining."
