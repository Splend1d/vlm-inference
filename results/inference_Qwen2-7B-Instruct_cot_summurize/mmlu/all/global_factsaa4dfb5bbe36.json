However, if we were to consider real-world examples, such as the re-elections of Franklin D. Roosevelt to four terms (which was not limited by term limits at the time) and Barack Obama to two terms, public approval ratings can fluctuate significantly based on various factors including political climate, economic conditions, foreign policy outcomes, and domestic policy successes or failures.\n\nFor a more concrete answer, we would need to refer to historical data from opinion polls conducted during the periods leading up to these elections. Without specific data points for the scenario you've described, it's impossible to provide an accurate percentage. Polling data can vary widely depending on the time of year, the economy, and other factors.\n\nGiven this context, none of the options A through D (20%, 40%, 660%, or 80% directly correspond to an average approval rating for re-election without additional information about the specific situation or historical context you're referring to. If you're looking for a general trend or historical average for re-election approval rates, the actual percentages could fall anywhere within a wide range, depending on the circumstances surrounding each election."
