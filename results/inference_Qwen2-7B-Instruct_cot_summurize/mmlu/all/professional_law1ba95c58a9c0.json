The man called a towing company and told the company's manager that the car was 100 feet down the embankment. \"That's lucky,\" said the manager, \"because our winch only goes 100 feet.\" After the manager and the man agreed on a price, an employee of the company attempted to reach the car but could not because the car turned out to be 120 feet down the embankment. Is the towing company's performance excused on the grounds of mistake?\n\nA. No, because both parties were uncertain about the distance.\nB. No, because the towing company assumed the risk by the manager's failure to examine the distance himself.\nC. Yes, because at the time of contracting, both parties were mistaken about a basic assumption on which the contract was based.\nD. Yes, because the agreement did not allocate the risk of mistake to either party.\n"

Yes, because at the time of contracting, both parties were mistaken about a basic assumption on which the contract was based.\n\nIn this scenario, both the towing company and the man were mistaken about the distance of the car from the road, which was a crucial factor in determining the cost of the service. The manager relied on the information given by the man, assuming the accuracy of his statement, and the man expected the company to be able to retrieve the car based on the manager's confirmation. This mutual mistake regarding a basic assumption upon which the contract was made can potentially lead to the excusing of performance under certain legal doctrines, such as the doctrine of mistake or mutual mistake in contract law. However, the applicability of these doctrines would depend on the specific laws of the jurisdiction and whether the mistake was material and mutual, among other factors."
