Acting as a Good Samaritan, the pedestrian approached the boys and tried to intercede. The boy stumbled and accidentally fell into the pedestrian, knocking him to the ground.

In civil cases like this one, where the pedestrian is seeking damages for personal injury, the legal principles would be different. \n\nAssuming the pedestrian did not have a contractual relationship with the boy or any other legal basis to expect the boy to protect them from harm, the pedestrian's assumption of risk might not apply directly. However, the concept of contributory negligence could come into play if it can be shown that the pedestrian contributed to their own injury by not maintaining an appropriate distance or taking reasonable steps to avoid being knocked down.\n\nWithout evidence of negligence on the part of the boy, such as intentionally pushing the pedestrian or failing to exercise reasonable care in the circumstances ( e.g., knowing that children were playing nearby, and foreseeing the risk of causing injury to others, the pedestrian may not prevail in their lawsuit against the boy. The pedestrian's belief that a fight was occurring does not necessarily translate into a duty on the part of the boy to prevent harm to the pedestrian.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. not prevail, unless the boy was negligent."
