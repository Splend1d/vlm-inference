But we do not want to be beaten. No, we refuse to be beaten! One feature of the history of old Russia was the continual beatings she suffered because of her backwardness. She was beaten by the Mongol khans. She was beaten by the Turkish beys. She was beaten by the Swedish feudal lords. She was beaten by the Polish and Lithuanian gentry. She was beaten by the British and French capitalists. She was beaten by the Japanese barons. All beat her\u2013\u2013because of her backwardness, because of her military backwardness, cultural backwardness, political backwardness, industrial backwardness, agricultural backwardness. They beat her because it was profitable and could be done with impunity. You remember the words of the pre-revolutionary poet: \"You are poor and abundant, mighty and impotent, Mother Russia.\" Those gentlemen were quite familiar with the verses of the old poet. They beat her, saying: \"You are abundant,\" so one can enrich oneself at your expense. They beat her, saying: \"You are poor and impotent,\" so you can be beaten and plundered with impunity. Such is the law of the exploiters\u2013\u2013to beat the backward and the weak. It is the jungle law of capitalism. You are backward, you are weak\u2013\u2013therefore you are wrong; hence you can be beaten and enslaved. You are mighty\u2013\u2013therefore you are right; hence we must be wary of you.\nThat is why we must no longer lag behind.\"\nJoseph Stalin, speech delivered at the first All-Union Conference of Leading Personnel of Socialist Industry, February 4, 1931\nStalin's speech is most strongly influenced by which of the following?\n\nA. Appeasement\nB. Fascism\nC. Communism\nD. Secret treaties\n"

Communism\n\nThe speech reflects Stalin's commitment to rapid industrialization and the strengthening of Soviet power, which were central tenets of Communist ideology. Stalin sought to rapidly transform the Soviet economy into a modern industrial powerhouse to match or surpass Western capitalist nations. This was part of his broader strategy to build a strong socialist state capable of defending itself against foreign aggression and internal challenges. The emphasis on industrialization, backwardness, and the need for rapid progress aligns with the goals of communism as articulated by Marx and Lenin, particularly in terms of overcoming economic and social inequalities through state-led industrial development and collective ownership of means of production."
