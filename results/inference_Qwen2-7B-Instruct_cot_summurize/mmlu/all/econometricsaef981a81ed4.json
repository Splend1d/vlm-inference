In hypothesis testing, the significance level (\u03b1 (often set at 0.05) represents the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true (Type I error. This directly corresponds to the size of the test's critical region.\n  \n- **(ii)** The statement \"The significance level is equal to the power of the test\" is incorrect. The power of a test, which is the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when the alternative hypothesis is true, is not equal to the significance level. Instead, it is often calculated as 1 minus the probability of a Type II error (\u03b2.\n\n- **(iii)** For a two-sided test with a significance level of 0.05, the distribution is split into two tails, with 2.5% of the total distribution in each tail. This is because the test is assessing whether the observed effect is significantly different from the null hypothesis in either direction.\n\n- **(iv)** The statement \"5% of the total distribution will be in each tail rejection region for a 2-sided test\" is also correct but redundant given the explanation for (iii. It reiterates that for a two-tailed test with a 5% significance level, 2.5% of the distribution is in each tail.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. (i) and (iii) only."
