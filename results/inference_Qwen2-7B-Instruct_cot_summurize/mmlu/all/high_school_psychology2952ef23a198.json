This condition is characterized by an inability to recall important personal information, usually of a traumatic or stressful nature, and is a defense mechanism to protect the individual from overwhelming emotional pain. It can occur as a response to severe trauma, such as a car accident or violent event, where the brain blocks out the memory to cope with the emotional impact."
