The man thrusts his arms out away from his body.\n\nAngular momentum is conserved in a closed system, meaning it will not change unless an external torque acts on the system. In this scenario, the man-platform system is considered closed since no external torques are acting on it (due to the platform being frictionless. \n\nLet's examine each option:\n\nA. Catching a baseball would introduce an external force (the force of the ball hitting the man, which would result in an external torque, changing the angular momentum of the system.\n\nB. Thusting his arms out away from his body would create a moment arm (the distance between the axis of rotation and the point where the force is applied (in this case, the point where his hand touches the air. This creates a torque, which can change the angular momentum of the system.\n\nC. Bringing his arms back to his side again reverses the torque created in option B, but because the system was already in motion due to the initial thrust, the net effect might not change the angular momentum significantly depending on the speed and duration of the movement.\n\nD. Jumping straight up in the air and landing back on the platform involves forces acting downward due to gravity, which create a torque about the center of mass of the man. However, since the platform is frictionless, there is no external torque, and the angular momentum of the system should be conserved. The upward jump does not directly change the angular momentum of the man-platform system.\n\nTherefore, the only option that could change the angular momentum of the man-platform system without an external torque is B: the man thrusts his arms out away from his body."
