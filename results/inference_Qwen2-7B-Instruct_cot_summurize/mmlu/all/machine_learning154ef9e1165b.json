All of the above\n\nThe reason for this is that each of these feature selection methods has different approaches to selecting the subset of features:\n\nA. **Best-subset selection** evaluates all possible combinations of features and selects the best subset based on some criterion (such as AIC or BIC). The model obtained using this method might differ from the one after best-subset selection because the final model includes the optimal combination of features, which might not be included in subsequent models.\n\nB. **Forward stepwise selection** starts with an empty set of predictors and adds features one by one based on their contribution to the model. The order in which features are added can influence the final model, potentially leading to differences compared to the best-subset selection model.\n\nC. **Forward stage-wise selection** also starts with an empty set but adds features incrementally, adjusting the coefficients of the existing features at each step. This method can lead to different final models than those obtained through best-subset or forward stepwise selection, as it does not necessarily find the absolute best combination but rather iteratively improves the model.\n\nThus, depending on the specific characteristics of the data and the underlying relationships between variables, the model obtained after identifying the subset through any of these methods might differ from the final model obtained after applying linear regression on the selected subset."
