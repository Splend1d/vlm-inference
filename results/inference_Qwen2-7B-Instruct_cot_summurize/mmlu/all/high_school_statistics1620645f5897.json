A stratified random sample provides information about each stratum in the population as well as an estimate for the population as a whole, and a simple random sample does not.\n\nThis statement is incorrect because both stratified random sampling and simple random sampling can provide estimates for the population as a whole. However, stratified random sampling has the additional advantage of providing separate estimates for each stratum, which can be useful if there are are significant differences between the strata. Simple random sampling does not guarantee such separate estimates for each subgroup within the population, but it still allows for an overall estimate of the population parameters."
