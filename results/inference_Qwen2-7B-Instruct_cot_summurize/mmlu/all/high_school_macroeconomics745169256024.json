This is because it creates jobs and economic activity within the U.S., thereby increasing spending power and demand for goods and services.\n\nA. An American entrepreneur founding a software company in London does not directly affect the U.S. economy's aggregate demand since it occurs outside of the U.S.\n\nB. The closure of a military base in California would likely decrease aggregate demand in the U.S. as it results in job losses and reduced economic activity in that specific area.\n\nC. Making it increasingly difficult for American firms to export goods to China could decrease aggregate demand in the U.S. if it leads to reduced exports, which are are a component of aggregate demand.\n\nTherefore, option D represents an action that would most likely increase aggregate demand in the United States."
