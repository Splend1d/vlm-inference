It is a precautionary measure to prevent the spread of diseases and is generally encouraged by public health authorities.\n\nScenario 2: Asking for permission to go to the bathroom during an exam is not inherently morally wrong. However, calling a friend during that time to discuss the exam content and then returning to complete the exam would be considered cheating, which is morally wrong. Sharing answers or receiving help on an exam without permission from the instructor goes against academic integrity principles."
