Honda separating its potential customers into economy car buyers and luxury car buyers.\n\nSegmented markets refer to dividing a broad target market into subsets of consumers, groups with common needs or interests. In this case, Honda recognizing two distinct segments - economy car buyers and luxury car buyers - demonstrates a segmented market approach. This allows Honda to tailor its products, marketing strategies, and customer service to meet the specific preferences and requirements of each segment effectively."
