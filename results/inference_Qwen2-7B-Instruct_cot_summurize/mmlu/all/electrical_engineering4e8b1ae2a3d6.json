                    "text": "The total outward electric displacement normal to the surface of the sphere (or in this case, the cube, can be found using Gauss's Law. Gauss's Law states that the total electric flux through any closed surface is equal to the total charge enclosed by that surface divided by the permittivity of free space (\\(\\epsilon_0\\)).\n\n\\[ \\Phi_E = \\frac{Q_{enclosed}}{\\epsilon_0} \\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( \\Phi_E \\) is the electric flux,\n- \\( Q_{enclosed} \\) is the total charge enclosed by the surface, and\n- \\( \\epsilon_0 \\) is the permittivity of free space.\n\nGiven that the total surface area of the cube is \\( 6a^2 \\) where \\( a \\) is the length of each side, and since each face of the cube has an area of \\( a^2 \\), the total area of the cube's faces is \\( 6a^2 \\).\n\nThe surface charge density on the metal surface is given as \\( \\sigma = 20 \\, \\text{C/m}^2 \\). Since the metal surface is considered part of the system enclosed by the cube, we need to calculate the total charge on this surface.\n\nThe area of the metal surface is \\( \\pi r^2 \\), where \\( r = 1 \\, \\text{m} \\) is the radius of the metal surface. Therefore, the total charge on the metal surface is:\n\n\\[ Q_{metal} = \\sigma \\times \\pi r^2 = 20 \\times \\pi \\times 1^2 = 20\\pi \\, \\text{Coulombs} \\]\n\nSince the entire metal surface is enclosed within the cube, this charge is entirely enclosed by the cube, contributing to the total charge \\( Q_{enclosed} \\).\n\nThus, the total electric displacement flux through the cube can be calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\Phi_E = \\frac{Q_{enclosed}}{\\epsilon_0} = \\frac{20\\pi}{\\epsilon_0} \\]\n\nHowever, to find the total outward electric displacement normal to the surface of the cube, we need to multiply the flux by the total surface area of the cube, which is \\( 6a^2 \\). Since the problem doesn't specify the material of the cube or its conductivity, we assume it's a conductor like the metal surface, meaning it will also have a surface charge density due to induction.\n\nFor a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium, the induced charge density on the opposite face of the cube (where the metal surface is located, would be such that the electric field inside the conductor is zero. This means that the electric field lines originating from the metal surface will be canceled out by the electric field lines originating from the induced charges on the opposite face of the cube.\n\nTherefore, the net outward electric displacement flux through the cube is actually determined by the charge on the metal surface alone, not by the cube's own surface charge density, because the cube's interior does not contribute to the electric field outside of the conductor.\n\nGiven the context, the correct interpretation should focus on the charge on the metal surface, not the cube itself. Thus, the total outward electric displacement normal to the surface of the metal (not the cube, considering the question seems to conflate the two surfaces for simplicity's sake\u2014would be directly proportional to the charge on the metal surface, scaled by the permittivity of free space, but the specific calculation provided in the options suggests a misunderstanding in framing the question around the cube's role in this scenario.\n\nGiven the standard approach and assuming the intent was to calculate based on the metal surface's contribution:\n\n\\[ \\Phi_E = \\frac{Q_{metal}}{\\epsilon_0} = \\frac{20\\pi}{\\epsilon_0} \\]\n\nHowever, the question seems to ask for the total outward electric displacement normal to the surface of the cube, which, in the context of Gauss's Law applied to a conductor, is not directly calculated through the charge on the metal surface but rather through the concept of electric flux and the permittivity of free space. The provided answer choices seem to be aiming at a direct calculation based on the metal surface's charge density and the area, which doesn't directly translate into the formula used to determine electric flux through a surface, especially when considering the cube's role in the context of a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium.\n\nGiven the standard understanding and typical application of Gauss's Law, none of the provided options A, B, or C accurately represent the total outward electric displacement normal to the surface of the cube based on the information provided. The correct interpretation would involve the charge on the metal surface and its relation to the permittivity of free space, leading to a result involving \\( \\pi \\) and \\( \\epsilon_0 \\), but none of the options provided match this theoretical outcome correctly. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer choice, based on"
