He just returned from a weeklong summer camp that included hiking trips and swimming lessons in the camp-owned swimming pool. He has no history of major medical illness and receives no medications. He appears tired. His temperature is 39.4\u00b0C (102.9\u00b0F); other vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows conjunctival injection and discharge and oropharyngeal erythema. The public health department reports an outbreak of similar symptoms among the other campers and camp volunteers. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient\u2019s symptoms?\n\nA. Adenovirus\nB. Cytomegalovirus\nC. Epstein-Barr virus\nD. Influenza virus\n"

Adenovirus\n\nAdenoviruses are commonly cause respiratory illnesses such as coughs, colds, and bronchitis but can also lead to symptoms like those described here - fever, sore throat, itchy eyes, conjunctival injection and discharge, and oropharyngeal erythema. Given the patient's recent attendance at a summer camp where other campers and volunteers have experienced similar symptoms, adenovirus is a strong candidate for the cause of his symptoms. Adenovirus infections are known to spread easily in crowded environments, which fits with the scenario described. \n\nThe other options:\n- Cytomegalovirus ( can cause a variety of symptoms including fever, sore throat, and eye symptoms but typically presents more prominently with gastrointestinal issues.\n- Epstein-Barr virus is associated with mononucleosis-like symptoms, including sore throat, fever, and swollen lymph nodes, but usually includes additional symptoms like fatigue and the spleen being tender on palpation.\n- Influenza virus would also produce a fever, but its symptoms are generally characterized by a dry cough, body aches, and a sore throat, and it tends not to cause conjunctival injection and discharge as specificallyly mentioned. \n\nPlease note, definitive diagnosis requires laboratory testing, such as viral culture or PCR, which could identify the specific type of adenovirus causing the infection."
