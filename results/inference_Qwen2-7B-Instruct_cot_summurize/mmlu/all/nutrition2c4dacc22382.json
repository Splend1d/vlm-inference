This percentage can vary depending on factors such as age, socioeconomic status, access to healthcare, and oral hygiene practices.\n\nGiven the options provided:\n\nA. 20% - This is likely too low for the global prevalence of untreated dental caries.\nB. 40% - This might be closer but still underestimates the global prevalence based on WHO data.\nC. 60% - This could be considered an accurate estimate, considering the fluctuating nature of dental health statistics globally.\nD. 80% - This is likely an overestimate for the global prevalence of untreated dental caries.\n\nBased on these considerations, the closest answer would be **C. 60%** as it aligns with typical estimates, though it's important to note that specific percentages can vary."
