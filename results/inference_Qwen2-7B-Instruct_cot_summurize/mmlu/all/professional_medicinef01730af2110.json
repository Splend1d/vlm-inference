Aortic valve issues can lead to aortic regurgitation (leaking of the aortic valve allowing blood to flow backward into the left ventricle during systole) or aortic stenosis (narrowing of the aortic valve). \n\nSymptoms such as dizziness or fainting (syncope) may occur due to reduced blood flow to the brain when the heart is unable to pump enough blood because of aortic stenosis or inadequate forward flow of blood from the aorta due to aortic regurgitation. In this case, given the description of the murmur's characteristics and location, aortic insufficiency seems the most likely cause."
