The congressional statute stipulates that the religious organization must use the buses to travel across America to spread the moral message of sexual abstinence to teenagers at school assemblies. Which of the following is the strongest constitutional grounds for invalidating the gift of the buses to the religious organization?\n\nA. The gift violates the equal protection rights of secular organizations.\nB. The gift violates the establishment clause.\nC. The gift is a taking of federal property without just compensation.\nD. The gift violates the commerce clause.\n"

The gift violates the establishment clause.\n\nThis is because the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibits the government from establishing an official religion or favoring one religion over another. By providing the buses specifically for the purpose of spreading the \"moral message of sexual abstinence\" to teenagers through religious organizations, Congress appears to be endorsing a particular religious viewpoint and promoting religious activities in a manner that could be seen as a violation of the separation of church and state. This could potentially lead to the establishment of a de facto state religion, which is not permissible under the Constitution."
