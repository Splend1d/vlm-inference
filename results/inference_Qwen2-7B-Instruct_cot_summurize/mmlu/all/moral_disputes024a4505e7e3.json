If something is considered desirable but not desirable as an end (meaning it's not something one would pursue for its own sake), it can still be desirable as a means to achieve a more desirable end. For example, studying hard (which might not be inherently desirable as an end) could be desirable as a means to achieve a good grade, which is desirable both as an end and as a means to future educational opportunities."
