She has had similar episodes over the past 6 months. The symptoms improve following ingestion of orange juice or soft drinks. She says that she has had a great deal of stress. She has been drinking two alcoholic beverages daily for the past month; before this time, she seldom drank alcohol. Examination shows no abnormalities. Her serum glucose concentration is 30 mg/dL. Intravenous glucose is administered, and the patient's symptoms improve. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis?\n\nA. Measurement of serum proinsulin and insulin antibodies\nB. Measurement of serum cortisol and ACTH concentrations\nC. Measurement of serum growth hormone and plasma somatomedin-C concentrations\nD. Measurement of serum insulin and C-peptide concentrations\n"

Measurement of serum insulin and C-peptide concentrations.\n\nThe symptoms described (nervousness, dizziness, palpitations, and excess perspiration, along with the improvement after ingesting sugar, suggest a hypoglycemic episode. The low serum glucose concentration of 30 mg/dL confirmed this. The patient's history of stress, recent increase in alcohol intake, and the fact that her symptoms improved with sugar intake also point towards an underlying cause related to insulin secretion or sensitivity.\n\nMeasuring serum insulin and C-peptide levels will help determine if the hypoglycemia is due to excessive insulin secretion (a condition known as insulinoma or idiopathic hypoglycemia, or if it is due to inadequate glucose utilization by the body (which can be seen in conditions like insulin resistance. \n\nInsulin is produced by the pancreas in response to high blood glucose levels, while C-peptide is a byproduct of insulin production. Both insulin and C-peptide levels can be elevated in cases of excessive insulin secretion. Therefore, measuring these levels can provide insights into the underlying cause of the patient's hypoglycemic episodes."
