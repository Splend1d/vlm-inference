The motel manager authorized the officers to enter the room and provided them with a passkey. Without obtaining a warrant, the officers knocked on the room's door, announced their presence, and told the occupants that they would like to speak with them. The officers then heard yelling and repeated flushing of the toilet. They then used the passkey and entered the room, where they saw the occupants dumping drugs into the toilet. The occupants of the room were charged with drug dealing and have moved to suppress the drugs. Should the court grant the motion to suppress?\n\nA. No, because exigent circumstances justified the officers' entry.\nB. No, because the motel manager consented to the officers' entry.\nC. Yes, because exigent circumstances cannot excuse the lack of a warrant.\nD. Yes, because the officers cannot benefit from exigent circumstances that they created.\n"

Yes, because the officers cannot benefit from exigent circumstances that they created.\n\nIn this scenario, the police officers did not obtain a warrant before entering the room, which is a requirement under the Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, unless there are are exigent circumstances (such as immediate threat to life or destruction of evidence. The fact that the officers heard yelling and the sound of the toilet being flushed after knocking on the door and announcing themselves can be considered exigent circumstances, but it does not justify bypassing the warrant requirement if those circumstances were created by the officers' own actions.\n\nBy using the passkey to enter the room without first obtaining a warrant, the officers created the exigent circumstances they later claim justified their entry. This action is not permissible, as it allows the police to circumvent the warrant requirement. Therefore, the court should grant the motion to suppress the evidence obtained as a result of the unlawful entry."
