The formula for the z-score is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{X - \\mu}{\\sigma} \\]\n\nwhere \\( X \\) is the score, \\( \\mu \\) is the mean, and \\( \\sigma \\) is the standard deviation.\n\nFor the midterm:\n- \\( X = 58 \\) points\n- \\( \\mu = 52 \\) points\n- \\( \\sigma = 4 \\) points\n\nPlugging these values into the formula gives us:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{58 - 52}{4} = \\frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \\]\n\nSo, her z-score on the midterm is 1.5.\n\nNow, we want to find out what score (\\( X_f \\)) she would need on the final exam to have the same z-score (1.5. We can rearrange the z-score formula to solve for \\( X_f \\):\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{X_f - \\mu_f}{\\sigma_f} \\]\n\nwhere \\( \\mu_f \\) is the mean of the final exam scores (112 points, and \\( \\sigma_f \\) is the standard deviation of the final exam scores 10 points. Plugging in the known values:\n\n\\[ 1.5 = \\frac{X_f - 112}{10} \\]\n\nSolving for \\( X_f \\):\n\n\\[ 1.5 \\times 10 = X_f - 112 \\]\n\\[ 15 = X_f - 112 \\]\n\\[ X_f = 15 + 112 \\]\n\\[ X_f = 127 \\]\n\nTherefore, her score on the final exam must have been 127 points to have the same z-score as her midterm score. The correct answer is D. 127 points."
