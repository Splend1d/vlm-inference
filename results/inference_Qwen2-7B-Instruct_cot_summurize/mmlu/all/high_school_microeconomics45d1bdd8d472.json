The benefit received from studying is greater than the opportunity cost of $8.\n\nGiven the choices:\n\n- Studying offers an unspecified benefit (let's call it B_studying.\n- Mowing the lawn offers a wage of $6 in opportunity cost.\n- Babysitting offers a wage of $8 in opportunity cost.\n\nSince Nancy chooses to study, it implies that the benefit she receives from studying (B_studying > $8 ( (opportunity cost of babysitting).\n\nTherefore, the benefit received from studying is indeed greater than the opportunity cost of $8, making option A correct. \n\nOptions B, C, and D are incorrect based on the information provided and the choice Nancy made:\n\n- B. The statement about the opportunity cost being $14 and less than the benefit from studying is not given in the problem and thus cannot be concluded.\n- C. There is no information to suggest Nancy is indifferent between studying and mowing the lawn; her choice indicates she values studying more than mowing the lawn by comparison to babysitting.\n- D. The statement that Nancy's behavior is irrational because babysitting was clearly superior to studying is also incorrect, as her decision aligns with maximizing the perceived value of her time spent, choosing studying over babysitting."
