Ethene contains one double bond, which consists of one sigma bond and one pi bond.\n\nB. At least four sigma bonds: This statement is also correct. Each carbon in ethene forms three sigma bonds (two with hydrogen atoms and one with the other carbon atom. \n\nC. A tetrahedral configuration: This statement is incorrect. The carbon atoms in an alkene form a linear structure, not a tetrahedral one. The tetrahedral configuration refers to the arrangement of four atoms around a central atom, like in methane.\n\nD. Cis-trans isomers: This statement is correct for some alkenes but not necessarily for the simplest alkene. Cis-trans isomerism occurs when there are restricted rotation around the double bond, leading to different spatial arrangements of the attached groups. However, the simplest alkene, ethene, does not have this isomerism because it has no side chains to rotate around the double bond. \n\nSo, the correct answer choices are A and B."
