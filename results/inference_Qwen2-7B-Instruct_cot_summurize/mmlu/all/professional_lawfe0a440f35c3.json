Testimony concerning subsequent repairs to the truck paid for by the trucking company where they have stipulated to ownership.\n\nThis is because it directly relates to the condition of the truck at the time of the incident and could potentially show that the truck was not properly maintained or was mechanically unsound, which could be relevant to proving negligence on the part of the trucking company. The fact that the company has stipulated to ownership adds credibility to the testimony.\n\nB. Color pictures of a plastic surgeon operating on the plaintiff showing the incision and bloody surgical tools, might be considered too gruesome or prejudicial and may not be admissible under rules of evidence designed to prevent unfair prejudice. These types of graphic images could potentially inflame the jury's emotions rather than help them understand the nature of the injuries sustained.\n\nC. Testimony from the plaintiff's boss concerning the amount of time she has missed work, when payroll records have already been admitted as evidence of lost wages, could be seen as redundant since the payroll records should provide sufficient information about lost wages. However, if there are discrepancies between the records and the testimony, the testimony could be relevant and possibly admitted.\n\nD. Testimony of a surprise witness to the accident when the court is willing to grant the trucking company a continuance to prepare for cross-examination, might be problematic. While the testimony could be relevant, the surprise nature of the witness and the lack of preparation could lead to potential unfairness and may not be admissible without proper justification or consent from the opposing party."
