When inflation occurs unexpectedly, the purchasing power of money decreases over time. If a creditor lends out money at a fixed interest rate, the real value of the repayments (in terms of what they can buy) will be less than when the loan was made. Therefore, creditors who do not anticipate inflation might end up with less purchasing power in the future for the same amount of money received back.\n\nB. **Hurts Credittors who anticipate it.** Anticipating inflation means that the creditor understands that the real value of their payments will decrease over time due to inflation. They can take steps to mitigate this risk, such as demanding higher nominal interest rates to compensate for the expected loss of purchasing power. Thus, if a creditor anticipates inflation, they might structure their loans to include adjustments for inflation or negotiate higher interest rates, which could potentially offset the negative effects of inflation on them.\n\nC. **Hurts Debtors.** This statement is also generally true. Debtors, who owe money, benefit from inflation because the real value of their debt repayments decreases over time. If the inflation rate exceeds the interest rate on their debt, the burden of repayment effectively becomes lighter in terms of purchasing power.\n\nD. **Both A and D are correct.** This option accurately summarizes the potential impacts of inflation on creditors and debtors. Creditors who do not anticipate inflation are likely to suffer, while those who do anticipate inflation might mitigate their losses through adjustments in interest rates or loan terms. Debtors, on the other hand, benefit from inflation because it reduces the real cost of their debts.\n\nTherefore, the most comprehensive answer would be D, acknowledging that both creditors who do not anticipate inflation and debtors can be negatively affected by unexpected inflation, while creditors who anticipate it might manage to mitigate some of these effects."
