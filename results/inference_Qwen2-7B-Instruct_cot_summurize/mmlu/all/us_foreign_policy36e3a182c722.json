The resolution, which was largely a response to alleged North Vietnamese attacks on U.S. naval vessels, granted President Lyndon B. Johnson broad authority to take military action against North Vietnam without needing to seek a formal declaration of war from Congress. This effectively allowed the US to intensify its involvement in Vietnam.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. It allowed the US to intensify its involvement in Vietnam\n\nThis action marked a pivotal moment that led to a substantial escalation of U.S. military presence and commitment to the conflict in Vietnam."
