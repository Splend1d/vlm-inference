Those who wished to broaden the scope of security studies advocated the inclusion of resource, environment, and other referent points for analysis.\n\nExplanation:\n\nBuzan's concept of \"societal security\" marks a significant departure from traditional understandings of security by expanding the scope of security studies beyond the military-centric focus of realism and neorealism. Prior to the end of the Cold War, security was largely defined in terms of national survival against external threats, particularly during times of superpower rivalry. However, the changing geopolitical landscape and the realization that non-military threats could pose serious risks to states and societies prompted a reevaluation of what constitutes security.\n\nBuzan's work, particularly his 1983 book \"Security: A New Framework for Analysis,\" introduced the idea of \"comprehensive security,\" which encompasses not just military security but also economic, environmental, social, and political dimensions. This shift reflects a recognition that the survival of a state is no longer solely dependent on its ability to deter or retaliate against military threats. Instead, it includes the capacity to manage and adapt to a wide array of challenges that can undermine societal well-being and stability.\n\nBy A, C, and D, while they touch upon elements of broader security concepts, they do not specifically highlight Buzan's contribution or the shift towards societal security. A refers to the importance of societal security as an independent interest, but without specifying its broader implications or how it departs from traditional understandings. C describes a focus on military capabilities, which is not the central point of Buzan's societal security concept. D discusses the impact of globalization and societal conflict on security, but does not specifically reference Buzan's work or the conceptual shift towards societal security."
