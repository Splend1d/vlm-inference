The specific factors that contributed to this period include:\n\nB. There were more professional jobs available but not enough people to fill them: This is partially correct as the 1980s saw an increase in demand for highly skilled labor, especially in sectors like finance, technology, and professional services, which tended to pay higher salaries. This led to a wage premium for those with specialized skills or education.\n\nC. The price of consumer goods rose at a higher rate than earnings: This factor also played a role, as inflation during the 1980s was relatively high, particularly from 1979 to 1982. This meant that the cost of living increased faster than wages in some cases, eroding the purchasing power of lower and middle-income earners and exacerbating income disparities.\n\nD. Growing unemployment made more people dependent on welfare benefits: Although unemployment did increase during the early part of the decade, particularly in the U.S., leading to more individuals relying on welfare, this was not the primary driver of income inequality. Instead, the increase in unemployment was seen as a consequence of broader economic shifts, including automation, globalization, and changes in labor market dynamics, which affected both employment levels and wage structures.\n\nIn summary, while each of these factors had some impact, it was the combination of increased demand for skilled labor, high inflation, and broader economic shifts that contributed significantly to the growth in income inequality during the 1980s."
