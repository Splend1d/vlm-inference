Availability.\n\nThe Combined Code of Practice, published by the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) in the United Kingdom, sets out 13 principles for good corporate governance. These principles cover areas such as openness, integrity, and acceptability, but not availability. \n\nPrinciples underlined in the Combined Code include:\n\n1. Openness: The company should provide full and frank information to its stakeholders.\n2. Integrity: The company should have systems and controls that ensure that all transactions are properly authorized, recorded, and reported accurately.\n3. Acceptability: The company should maintain high standards of business ethics, social responsibility, and environmental care.\n\nSo, among the options provided, \"Availability\" does not appear in the list of principles outlined by the Combined Code of Practice."
