Self-executive treaties are clear and precise enough so as not to require any further implementing measures\n\nSelf-executing treaties are international agreements that come into force within a country without the need for additional legislative action or implementing measures by the domestic government. This means that once these treaties are ratified, they can be applied directly by courts and other governmental bodies within the country's legal system. The clarity and precision of the treaty terms allow them to operate independently of further national legislation."
