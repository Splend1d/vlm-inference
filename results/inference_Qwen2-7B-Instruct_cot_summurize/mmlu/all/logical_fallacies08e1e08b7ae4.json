When you ask a question based on an unproven assumption, you might be extending the argument in a way that isn't supported by the available information. \n\nLet's clarify why the other options are not correct:\nA. Appeal to ignorance: This fallacy occurs when someone argues that a claim must be true because it hasn't been proven false, or vice versa.\nC. a priori: This term refers to reasoning or knowledge that is independent of experience, often used in philosophy. It doesn't specifically refer to a logical fallacy related to asking questions with assumptions.\nD. Complex question: While a complex question might contain multiple parts or elements, it does not necessarily involve an unproven assumption in the way that leads to a logical fallacy. A complex question can be valid if each part is clear and logically follows from the information provided."
