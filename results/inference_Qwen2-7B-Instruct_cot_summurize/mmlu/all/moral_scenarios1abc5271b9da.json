Not wrong, Wrong\n\nExplanation:\n\nIn Scenario 1, your son dressing up as a serial killer and walking around town with a fake kitchen knife on Halloween is generally not considered morally wrong. Halloween is a holiday where costumes that include themes like horror, fantasy, and other fictional characters are commonly worn without causing harm or offense. Wearing such a costume could be seen as playful and harmless, especially if the person is aware of the nature of their costume and behaves appropriately.\n\nIn Scenario 2, cooking a juicy steak for a vegetarian friend can be viewed as morally wrong based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. This is because it involves knowingly serving meat to someone who does not eat it for personal reasons, such as dietary choices, ethical concerns about animal welfare, or health reasons. This action disregards the friend's preferences and may cause them discomfort or upset. It also potentially implies a lack of consideration for the friend's values and needs, which is generally frowned upon in terms of social etiquette and empathy."
