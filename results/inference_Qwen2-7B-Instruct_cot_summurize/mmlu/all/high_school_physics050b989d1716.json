                    "text": "When a non-conducting sphere with a net positive charge \\(+Q\\) is brought close to a neutral conducting sphere, the following will happen:\n\n- **Electric Field Induction**: The presence of the positively charged sphere induces a negative charge on the side of the conducting sphere facing the positive charge, and a positive charge on the opposite side. This is due to the rearrangement of free electrons in the conductor to create an electric field that opposes the external field (a phenomenon known as polarization. Therefore, **A** is true.\n\n- **Charge Transfer**: Since the conducting sphere is neutral and now has regions of positive and negative charges due to polarization, it will redistribute its charges so that the total charge on its surface becomes zero. This redistribution happens by the movement of free electrons from the side facing the positive charge to the side opposite the positive charge, effectively making the surface charge of the conductor neutral but with an internal charge distribution that opposes the external field. Hence, **B** is not strictly true; the net charge on the surface remains zero, but there is an internal charge distribution that results in an overall electric field within the conductor opposing the external field.\n\n- **Electrostatic Forces**: Given the induced charges, the spheres will experience an electrostatic force between them. Since one sphere is positively charged and the other has a net negative charge on its surface (due to the redistribution of charges), they will experience an electrostatic attraction. So, **C** is true.\n\n- **Repulsion**: This is not true because, as explained above, the spheres will attract each other due to the opposite charges on their surfaces, not repel each other.\n\nTherefore, the correct answers are are **A** and **C**."
