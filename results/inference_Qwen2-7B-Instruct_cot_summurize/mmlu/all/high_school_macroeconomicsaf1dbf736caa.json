This is because increased demand for exports makes the domestic currency more attractive to foreign buyers who need it to purchase those goods. As a result, the value of the dollar (in this case) would tend to appreciate, making it stronger relative to other currencies.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. the value of the dollar will tend to appreciate."
