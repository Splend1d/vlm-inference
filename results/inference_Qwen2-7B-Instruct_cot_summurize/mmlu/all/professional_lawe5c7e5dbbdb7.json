They decided on strychnine poisoning, which the friend told them how to get and they went and got it. When they asked the friend to go forward in poisoning the victim, he refused, saying, \"I'm was only here for planning and advice, but I never intended to commit murder.\" The man and his brother took the poison to a meeting with the neighbor, but he wouldn't drink. They were caught and arrested. The statute requires an overt act for criminal conspiracy. Which of the following most accurately states the criminal responsibility of each of the three men?\n\nA. The man and his brother have committed criminal conspiracy and attempted murder.\nB. The man and his brother are guilty of conspiracy but not attempted murder.\nC. The man and his brother are guilty of conspiracy and attempted murder, but the friend is guilty of nothing.\nD. The man and his brother are guilty of conspiracy and attempted murder, and the friend is guilty of criminal conspiracy.\n"

The man and his brother are guilty of conspiracy and attempted murder, and the friend is guilty of criminal conspiracy.\n\nExplanation:\n- The man and his brother planned the crime, agreed on a specific method (strychnine poisoning, acquired the poison, and attempted to carry out their plan by attempting to poison the neighbor. This constitutes both criminal conspiracy ( agreeing to commit a crime, and attempted murder ( attempting to take someone's life.\n- The friend provided the means to commit the crime ( the strychnine, and advised on its use, but once it was clear that the neighbor would not willingly ingest the poison, the friend declined to participate further. His role stops at providing information and advice for the crime, which still makes him guilty of criminal conspiracy under the law, even though he did not physically administer the poison himself or intend to directly cause harm.\n\nTherefore, while the man and his brother engaged in actions that lead directly to the attempted murder, the friend's involvement was in the planning and advice phase, making him guilty of criminal conspiracy as well."
