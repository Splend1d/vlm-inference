Although he never lost consciousness, the pedestrian was in excruciating pain and has been taking strong painkillers since the accident that have affected his memory of the accident. At trial, the pedestrian calls a renowned hypnotist to testify. The hypnotist proposes to testify that after he placed the pedestrian under a hypnotic spell, the pedestrian gave a detailed account of the accident and told the hypnotist that the driver ran a red light and that the driver's license plate number was GIJO-7 14. The driver concedes that his license plate number isGIJO-7 14. The hypnotist's proposed testimony will most likely be held to be\n\nA. admissible, because the license plate identification substantiates that the other information is accurate and trustworthy.\nB. admissible, because it is a statement of past recollection refreshed.\nC. inadmissible, because it is hearsay not within any recognized exception.\nD. inadmissible, because statements procured through hypnosis cannot be authenticated as truthful.\n"

While some jurisdictions may allow the use of hypnosis for recall purposes, there is often skepticism about the reliability of such testimony due to concerns that the hypnotized individual might fabricate details or be influenced by suggestions given during the hypnosis session. Therefore, many courts follow the general rule that statements made under hypnosis are not admissible as evidence unless they can be authenticated as truthful, which is not typically possible due to the inherent risks associated with hypnosis.\n\nIn this case, the hypnotist's testimony would likely be considered inadmissible because it falls under the category of hearsay and cannot be authenticated as truthful through the use of hypnosis. Hearsay refers to out-of-court statements offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted, and such evidence is generally excluded from court proceedings to ensure reliability and prevent the admission of secondhand information. Exceptions to the hearsay rule do exist, but the hypnotically-induced testimony would not likely fall under any recognized exception."
