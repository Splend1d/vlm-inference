Erikson**.\n\nErik Erikson developed his theory of psychosocial development, which outlines eight stages that individuals go through from infancy to late adulthood. Each stage involves a conflict or crisis that must be resolved for healthy personality development. His theory has been widely studied and supported by various types of research, including longitudinal studies that track the same individuals over many years, and cross-sectional studies that compare different age groups at one point in time. This broad support across different methodologies lends credibility to Erikson's theory."
