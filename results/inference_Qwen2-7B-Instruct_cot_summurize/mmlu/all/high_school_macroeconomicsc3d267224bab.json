                    "text": "The correct answer is C. bond prices fall.\n\nWhen bond prices fall, it means that the value of existing bonds decreases. This makes households less satisfied with holding bonds as an asset because their wealth appears to be decreasing. As a result, households might demand more money as an asset, which can lead to an increase in the demand for money and potentially affect the economy's overall liquidity and inflation rates.\n\nLet's briefly discuss why the other options are not correct:\n\nA. Nominal GDP falls: A decrease in nominal GDP could suggest economic downturns, but this doesn't directly influence households' preference for money over bonds. Households may still demand more money if they perceive uncertainty or need liquidity, but the direct link isn't as straightforward as with bond prices.\n\nB. The nominal interest rate falls: Lower interest rates typically make borrowing cheaper, which might encourage spending and investment rather than saving in bonds. However, it does not necessarily lead households to demand more money as an asset, as the relationship between interest rates and money demand is more complex and influenced by expectations of future interest rates and inflation.\n\nD. The supply of money falls: When the supply of money decreases (e.g., through monetary policy tightening, households might feel more secure in holding money as an asset since it becomes scarcer. However, this doesn't directly relate to the demand for money as an asset against bonds, which is more about the perceived value of holding money versus other assets like bonds."
