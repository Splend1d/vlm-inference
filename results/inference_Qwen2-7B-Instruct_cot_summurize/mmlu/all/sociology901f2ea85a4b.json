Among the options provided, the statement most closely aligned with Butler's ideas would be:\n\nD. gender is performed through bodily gestures and styles to create 'sex'\n\nButler argues that gender is not merely a reflection of one's biological sex or a given set of traits but rather a social construct that is performed and re-performed through various actions, behaviors, and presentations. This idea counters the notion that gender is innate or fixed, suggesting instead that it is a performative act that individuals engage in, often in relation to societal expectations and norms.\n\nOption A (\"sexual characteristics are the biological determinants of gender\") alignss more with a biological understanding of gender, which Butler critiques as essentialist and limiting. Options B and C do not accurately encapsulate the main themes of Butler's work, which focuses on the fluidity and performance of gender identity rather than the binary oppositions or historical shifts in the understanding of gender and sexuality."
