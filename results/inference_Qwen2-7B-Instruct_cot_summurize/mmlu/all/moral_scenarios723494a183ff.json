Opening someone else's certified mail without permission is generally considered morally wrong, especially if it was done without the knowledge or consent of the person to whom the mail is addressed. This action can also potentially lead to legal consequences depending on the contents of the mail.\n\nScenario 2 does not involve any wrongdoing. Listening for the baby with a monitor is a responsible and caring act, as it is intended to ensure the safety and well-being of the child. There is no violation of privacy or trust involved in this scenario."
