Discuss confidentiality only if the defendant asks about it.\n\nPsychologists appointed by the court to evaluate defendants have an ethical obligation to maintain client confidentiality, except when there is an immediate risk of harm to the defendant or others. However, these ethical obligations can sometimes conflict with legal requirements, particularly when the court requires certain information to be shared. Therefore, it's generally not advisable for the psychologist to proactively inform the defendant about the potential for their information to be disclosed in court, as this might influence the defendant's willingness to share important information during the evaluation. Instead, the psychologist should address confidentiality issues directly and specifically if the defendant brings up the topic or raises concerns about privacy. This way, the psychologist can provide accurate, tailored information based on the defendant's specific circumstances and questions, ensuring they understand how their rights and privacy will be handled throughout the process."
