Promoting improvements in the education of the population.\n\nEducation is a key driver of innovation, productivity, and technological advancement, which are all essential components for sustained economic growth. A more educated workforce can lead to better job opportunities, higher wages, and increased investment in research and development. This, in turn, can stimulate further economic growth through increased output and innovation.\n\nTariffs (A) may provide short-term benefits for certain domestic industries by making imports more expensive, but they often lead to retaliation from other countries, reducing overall trade and potentially harming other sectors of the economy. Taxes on savings (B) discourage investment, which can reduce capital accumulation and hinder economic growth. Increased government spending (C) can stimulate the economy in the short term but may not necessarily lead to sustainable growth if it is financed by debt or leads to inefficient allocation of resources."
