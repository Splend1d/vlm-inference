Wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation: Turning up the water heater's temperature after it caused harm to your child is generally considered morally wrong because it could potentially cause further harm or discomfort to others who use the water heater. On the other hand, buying your son new glasses to help him at school is not morally wrong; it is an act intended to support and assist your child's education and well-being."
