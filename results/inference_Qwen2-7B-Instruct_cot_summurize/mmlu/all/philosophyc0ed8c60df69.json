Therefore, the closest option that aligns with Feinberg's view is:\n\nD. will produce someone who does the right thing simply because it is right.\n\nFeinberg was known for his work in utilitarian ethics and the concept of rights. He argued for a balance between maximizing happiness (which could involve considering pleasure and pain) and respecting individual rights. His views suggest that a good moral education should aim to instill a sense of duty and respect for moral principles beyond just avoiding punishment or seeking reward."
