The unconditioned stimulus (UCS) naturally elicits an unconditioned response (UCR), while the conditioned stimulus (CS) initially does not. When repeatedly paired with the UCS, the CS eventually elicits a conditioned response (CR).\n\nTo eliminate or extinguish the CR, one must present the CS without the UCS. Over time, through repeated pairing without the actual UCS, the association weakens and eventually disappears. This is because the brain learns that the CS no longer predicts the UCS, and thus the CR diminishes and fades.\n\nThe other options do not effectively eliminate the CR:\n\nB. Presenting the CS without the UCS actually helps in extinguishing the CR, so this option is incorrect.\n\nC. A neutral stimulus would not have any effect on the existing CR since it has no prior association with the UCS.\n\nD. Presenting the CS a few seconds before the UCS might initially strengthen the CR but will not lead to its extinction over time, as the CS-UCS pairing still occurs.\n\nSo, the most effective way to eliminate a classically conditioned response is by presenting the unconditioned stimulus without the conditioned stimulus."
