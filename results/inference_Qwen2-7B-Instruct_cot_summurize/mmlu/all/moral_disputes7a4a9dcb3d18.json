When considering the claim that any adequate action-guiding moral theory must provide clear guidance that any intelligent person could follow, Hursthouse's stance would likely fall under option B: she says the claim is implausible.\n\nHursthouse argues against the idea that moral theories should aim for absolute clarity and universality in their prescriptions. She suggests that moral obligations can be complex and context-dependent, which may make it difficult to provide simple, one-size-fits-all rules that apply to all situations without exception. Instead, she emphasizes the importance of understanding the reasons behind moral judgments and acting according to one's considered moral principles, which can vary from person to person.\n\nThus, Hursthouse's critique implies that the claim in question is too simplistic and overlooks the nuanced nature of moral reasoning and action."
