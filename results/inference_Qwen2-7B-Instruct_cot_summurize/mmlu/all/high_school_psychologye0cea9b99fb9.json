By removing the blocks during this time, it reduces the temptation to leave her seat and play with them.\n\nOption A ( Allowing Mary to read from a teacher-selected book for a specific period of time before beginning her seat work might not address the immediate issue of leaving the seat, as reading can still be an engaging activity that might lead to distractions.\n\nOption B, Allowing Mary to play with the blocks afterward if she remains in her seat throughout the assigned seat-work time, could potentially motivate her to stay seated but does not address the behavior during seat-work time itself and may inadvertently reinforce the idea that playtime is more valuable than work time.\n\nOption C, Explaining to Mary the value of completing seat work in terms of the objectives of the lesson, while important for her understanding and motivation, might not be enough to immediately change her behavior during times when she is distracted by other activities.\n\nTherefore, removing the potential distraction directly from the environment seems to be the most straightforward and effective method to ensure that Mary focuses on her seat work."
