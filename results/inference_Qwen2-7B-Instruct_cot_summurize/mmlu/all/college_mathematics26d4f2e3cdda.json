This is because any group of prime order is cyclic, and hence there is only one group of order 3 up to isomorphism.\n\n2. **Groups of Order 5**: Similarly, the only possible group of order 5 is the cyclic group of order 5, \\(\\mathbb{Z}_5\\). Any group of prime order is cyclic, and thus there is only one group of order 5 up to isomorphism.\n\n3. **Groups of Order 7**: The only possible group of order 7 is the cyclic group of order 7, \\(\\mathbb{Z}_7\\). Therefore, there is only one group of order 7 up to isomorphism.\n\n4. **Groups of Order 11**: The only possible group of order 11 is the cyclic group of order 11, \\(\\mathbb{Z}_{11}\\). Hence, there is only one group of order 11 up to isomorphism.\n\n5. **Groups of Order 4**: There are two groups of order 4: the cyclic group \\(\\mathbb{Z}_4\\) and the Klein four-group \\(V_4 = \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2\\). Thus, there is not only one group of order 4 up to isomorphism.\n\n6. **Groups of Order 6**: There are two groups of order 6: the cyclic group \\(\\mathbb{Z}_6\\) and the symmetric group \\(S_3\\). Hence, there is not only one group of order 6 up to isomorphism.\n\n7. **Groups of Order 8**: There are five groups of order 8: the cyclic group \\(\\mathbb{Z}_8\\), the quaternion group \\(Q_8\\), and three non-abelian groups of order 8. Thus, there is not only one group of order 8 up to isomorphism.\n\n8. **Groups of Order 10**: There are four groups of order 10: the cyclic group \\(\\mathbb{Z}_{10}\\), the dihedral group \\(D_5\\) of order 10, and two non-abelian groups. Hence, there is not only one group of order 10 up to isomorphism.\n\nFrom this analysis, we see that there is only one group of order 3, 5, 7, and 11 up to isomorphism.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **B. For 3, 5, 7, and 11 only**."
