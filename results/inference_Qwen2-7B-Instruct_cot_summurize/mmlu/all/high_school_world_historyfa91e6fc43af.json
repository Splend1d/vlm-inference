To consent to the consignment year after year of hundreds of innocent victims to a cruel and untimely end, when the power exists of preventing it, is a predicament which no conscience can contemplate without horror. But, on the other hand, to put to hazard by a contrary course the very safety of the British Empire in India is an alternative which itself may be considered a still greater evil. When we had powerful neighbours and greater reason to doubt our own security, expediency might recommend a more cautious proceeding, but now that we are supreme my opinion is decidedly in favour of an open and general prohibition.\nWilliam Bentinck, Govenor-General of India, \"On the Suppression of Sati,\" 1829\nI have made it my study to examine the nature and character of the Indians [who trade with us], and however repugnant it may be to our feelings, I am convinced they must be ruled with a rod of iron, to bring and keep them in a proper state of subordination, and the most certain way to effect this is by letting them feel their dependence on [the foodstuffs and manufactured goods we sell them].\nGeorge Simpson, Head of Northern Department, Hudson's Bay Company, 1826\nThe first passage can be said to undermine which commonly held assumption about Western imperialism?\n\nA. That European colonizers sometimes interfered with native religious practices\nB. That European colonizers concerned themselves deeply with turning profits\nC. That European colonizers were uniformly eager to force their cultural norms on native populations\nD. That European colonizers often resorted to armed force to impose their will on imperial subjects\n"

Bentinck argues for the open and general prohibition of this practice, suggesting that continuing it would lead to the 'consignment year after year of hundreds of innocent victims to a cruel and untimely end'. This directly contradicts the commonly held assumption that European colonizers were uniformly eager to force their cultural norms on native populations, as it shows a concern for human rights and the welfare of the indigenous population.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. That European colonizers were uniformly eager to force their cultural norms on native populations"
