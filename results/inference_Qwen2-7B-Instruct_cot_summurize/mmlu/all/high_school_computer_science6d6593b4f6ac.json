The computers cannot communicate because different manufacturers use different communication protocols.\nB. The computers can communicate, but additional hardware is needed to convert data packets from one computer's protocol to the other computer's protocol.\nC.

The computers can communicate directly because Internet communication uses standard protocols. \n\nThe Internet is designed around standard protocols such as TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol), HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) for web services, and others. These protocols allow different devices and systems, regardless of their manufacturer or internal implementation details, to communicate with each other seamlessly over the Internet. This means that a computer running a web server and another running a web browser can communicate with each other as long as they both support these standard protocols, without needing additional hardware to convert data packets."
