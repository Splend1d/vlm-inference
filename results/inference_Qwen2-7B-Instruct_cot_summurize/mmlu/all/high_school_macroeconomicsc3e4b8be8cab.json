I and II are true. \n\nThe GDP Deflator is indeed used to calculate inflation rates, serving as a measure of inflation that takes into account all transactions for which a market price is paid within a given period. It is an alternative to the Consumer Price Index ( (CPI), which measures the change in prices over time experienced by consumers when purchasing a basket of goods and services. The GDP Deflator is considered a broader measure of inflation since it includes not only household consumption but also business investment, government spending, and net exports. However, it's important to note that the GDP Deflator might not always be more accurate than the CPI; both have their strengths and limitations, and they serve different purposes depending on the specific context of analysis."
