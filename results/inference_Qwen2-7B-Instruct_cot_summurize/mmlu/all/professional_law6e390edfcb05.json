Because the builder was unable to secure enough building contracts to keep all its employees busy during the season beginning March 1, it notified the brick mason on February 15 that it could not afford to employ him as a mason. At the same time, however, the builder offered to employ the mason, for the same contract period, as a night guard at an annual salary of $25,000. The mason declined the offer and remained unemployed during the year. No offer and remained unemployed during the year. No employment for brick masons was available in the community during the year, but the mason could have obtained other employment as a day laborer that would have paid up to $25,000 a year. At the end of the year, in an action against the builder for breach of contract, how much, if anything, is the mason entitled to recover?\n\nA. $20,000 (the $45,000 contract price less the $25,000 the mason could have earned in other employment).\nB. $45,000 (the contract price).\nC. Nothing, because the builder did not act in bad faith when it discharged the mason.\nD. Nothing, because the mason did not mitigate his damages.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is B. $45,000 ( the contract price).\n\nIn contract law, when one party breaches a contract, the non-breaching party (in this case, the brick mason) is generally entitled to recover the full value of the contract they were expecting to fulfill. This is known as \"specific performance\" or \"fulfillment of the contract terms.\" In this scenario, the builder breached the contract by not providing work for the brick mason during the agreed-upon period. Therefore, the brick mason is entitled to the full amount stated in the contract, which is $45,000.\n\nOptions A, C, and D do not accurately reflect the principles of contract law in this context:\n\n- Option A suggests subtracting the hypothetical earnings from another employment opportunity ( this is not how breach of contract damages are typically calculated. The focus is on the contract terms, not alternative employment.\n  \n- Option C states that the builder did not act in bad faith, which is not relevant to determining whether the non-breaching party is entitled to recover the contract amount. The question of bad faith may be relevant to other aspects of the case, such as punitive damages, but it does not affect the entitlement to the contract price in this situation.\n  \n- Option D claims that the brick mason did not mitigate his damages, meaning he did not take reasonable steps to reduce the financial harm caused by the breach. However, in this case, the brick mason could have obtained other employment as a day laborer that would have paid up to $25,000 a year. This suggests that the brick mason did indeed mitigate his damages by seeking alternative employment, making option D incorrect."
