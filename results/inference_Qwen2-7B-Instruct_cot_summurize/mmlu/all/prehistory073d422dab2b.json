It works by measuring the accumulated radiation dose that an object has received since it was last heated. The more radiation the object has absorbed, the older it is considered to be.\n\nOptically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) is a similar technique but instead of using heat, it uses light to stimulate the release of trapped electrons in the material. This method can be used on a wider range of materials, including sediments and flint tools surfaces.\n\nSo, while the other options listed may be useful in different contexts, they do not specifically measure the energy trapped in heated materials."
