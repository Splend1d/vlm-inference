This is because, without a sovereign authority to enforce rules and rights, every person has equal claim to all resources and actions, leading to a chaotic and violent existence. Hobbes believed that only through the establishment of a strong, central authority can peace and order be maintained, as this authority can define and enforce rights and duties among individuals."
