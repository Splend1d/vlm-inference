Let's break down each part:\n\n- \"Some kind people\" can be represented as (\u2203x)(Kx \u2227 Px), which means there exists an x that is both kind and a person.\n- \"Helping\" can be represented as Hxy, meaning x helps y.\n- \"Some endangered species\" can be represented as (\u2203y)(Ey \u2227 Sy), which means there exists a y that is both endangered and a species.\n\nPutting these together, we want to say that there exists an x who is kind and a person, and there exists a y who is endangered and a species, and x helps y. This corresponds to option B: (\u2203x)(\u2203y){[(Kx \u2227 Px) \u2227 (Ey \u2227 Sy)] \u2227 Hxy}. \n\nOption A incorrectly pairs \"kind people\" with \"endangers species\" instead of \"helps\", and it uses \"x\" for both variables when one should be a species and the other a person. Option C swaps the order of the variables in the helping relation, making it incorrect. Option D uses implication (\u2283, which suggests that if something is true on the left, then something on the right must also be true, but does not correctly express the relationship between the entities involved."
