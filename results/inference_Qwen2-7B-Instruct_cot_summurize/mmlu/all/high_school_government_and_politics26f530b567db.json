Revenue bills do not have to originate in the Senate; they can originate in either chamber.\nB. Representation in the House is based on state population, not equal among all states.\nC. The Speaker of the House wields significantly more power than the president pro tempore of the Senate, who is essentially the second-in-command in the Senate.\nD. This statement is accurate. The House of Representatives has a Committee on Ways and Means, which is responsible for tax legislation and other fiscal matters. The Senate, however, does not have an equivalent committee with this specific focus."
