It divides the interval size by 1.732.\n\nWhen you triple the sample size, the standard error of the mean decreases because it is inversely proportional to the square root of the sample size. The formula for the standard error (SE) is:\n\n\\[ SE = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}} \\]\n\nwhere \u03c3 is the population standard deviation and n is the sample size. If you triple the sample size (n, the new standard error \\(SE'\\) would be:\n\n\\[ SE' = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{3n}} = \\frac{SE}{\\sqrt{3}} \\approx \\frac{SE}{1.732} \\]\n\nThis means that the standard error (and thus the width of the confidence interval, which is approximately 2 times the standard error for a given confidence level) would decrease by a factor of about 1.732. Therefore, when you triple the sample size, the confidence interval size would be divided by approximately 1.732."
