This action is harmful and potentially dangerous, not only for the child's health but also for their emotional well-being, as it could lead to feelings of neglect or harm from a parent.\n\nScenario 2 involves having an older dog put down because the person wants a puppy. While this decision might be influenced by personal preference, it is not inherently morally wrong under ordinary US moral standards as of 2020. The act itself is a decision made within the context of pet care and ownership, and there isn't a clear ethical violation unless additional factors are considered, such as the treatment of the animal prior to its euthanasia or the availability of rehoming options. However, it's important to note that the morality of such a decision can vary widely based on individual values and societal norms."
