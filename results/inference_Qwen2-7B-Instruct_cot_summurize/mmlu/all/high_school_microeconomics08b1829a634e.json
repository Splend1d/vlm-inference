                    "text": "A. everyone who wants to work has the opportunity to do so\n\nIn a perfectly competitive labor market, when the market is in equilibrium, it means that the number of workers willing and able to accept the prevailing wage equals the number of jobs available at that wage. This implies that all individuals who want to work and are able to do so under the current wage rate will find employment. The equilibrium in such a market ensures full employment at the equilibrium wage rate.\n\nB. individual firms face downward sloping labor demand curves\nThis statement is not correct in the context of a perfectly competitive labor market. In this type of market, firms are price takers and must pay the going market wage for labor. They do not have the power to set wages or negotiate terms with workers, hence they do not face a downward-sloping labor demand curve. Instead, they hire labor up to the point where the marginal revenue product of labor equals the market wage.\n\nC. unemployment can reach as high as 10-15 percent\nThis statement is incorrect. In a perfectly competitive labor market in equilibrium, unemployment is considered to be zero ( or at the natural rate of unemployment, which includes only frictional and structural unemployment, not cyclical unemployment.\n\nD. individual firms face upward sloping labor demand curves\nThis statement is also incorrect. As explained above, in a perfectly competitive labor market, firms do not face an upward-sloping labor demand curve because they are unable to influence the wage rate and must hire labor at the prevailing market wage.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: everyone who wants to work has the opportunity to do so."
