The study enrolled 4000 subjects, aged 20 to 65 years. Of these subjects, 2100 were men and 1900 were women; 2500 were white, 1000 were African American, 300 were Hispanic, and 200 were Asian/Pacific Islanders. Results of the trial showed no overall benefit of the vaccine. However, post hoc analysis disclosed a small but statistically significant vaccine protection among African American subjects. Which of the following is the most accurate rationale for questioning the validity of efficacy analysis of the HIV vaccine among the African American study subjects?\n\nA. HIV infection is more prevalent among African American populations\nB. The study was not blinded\nC. There was a Type II error\nD. Vaccine response among African American subjects was not the primary outcome measure\n"

Vaccine response among African American subjects was not the primary outcome measure.\n\nThis is because the primary focus of the trial was likely to assess the efficacy of the vaccine in preventing HIV infection across the general population or among all participants, rather than specifically targeting any subgroup. Therefore, the statistical significance observed in the African American subgroup may not be robust enough to draw strong conclusions about its efficacy within that specific group without considering potential biases or limitations in the study design. It's important to note that while there might be various reasons to question the validity of such findings, option D directly addresses the issue of subgroup analysis not being a primary focus of the study."
