The economic necessity which has forced women out of the home and into the world of business has completely annihilated the old idea that a woman should eat only in the privacy of her household or in the homes of her friends, has created the absolutely new social phenomenon of women eating in public, unescorted by men, by the tens of thousands, and has given rise to a wholly new phase of the restaurant business.\"\n\u2014The New York Times, October 15, 1905\nWhich of the following groups would have most likely supported the scenario described in this passage?\n\nA.

National Woman Suffrage Association.\n\nThe passage describes the increasing role of women in the workforce and their changing social behaviors, particularly regarding dining out in public without male companionship. This reflects the broader societal changes that were taking place during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, which were championed by the National Woman Suffrage Association ( and other feminist organizations. These groups advocated for women's rights, including the right to vote, education, and employment, as well as more autonomy in personal matters like dining choices.\n\nThe Ku Klux Klan ( was known for promoting white supremacy and racial violence, not for supporting women's rights or social changes. \n\nThe American Temperance Union focused on advocating for prohibition and temperance, which did not directly relate to the social roles of women or the acceptance of public dining.\n\nThe Southern Christian Leadership Conference ( (founded much later) was an organization of civil rights activists who fought for racial equality, not specifically for women's rights or changes in women's social roles during the time period described in the passage."
