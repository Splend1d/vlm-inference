Moore's critique in his work \"Principia Ethica,\" many traditional philosophers committed the naturalistic fallacy by attempting to derive an is-ought proposition, essentially conflating what is (or how things appear to be) with what ought to be. Moore argued that this approach fails because moral properties cannot be reduced to non-moral properties or facts about the world. He famously introduced the concept of \"good\" as a primary quality that cannot be defined in terms of other qualities, challenging the prevailing views on ethics at the time."
