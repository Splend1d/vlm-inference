To end Dutch domination of maritime trade by limiting their ability to move goods between England and her colonies as well as goods to and from England from other countries\n\nThe Navigation Acts of 1651 were designed to restrict colonial trade to English ships and to limit Dutch influence over trade routes and goods moving between England and its colonies. This was part of a broader effort to consolidate control over English colonial possessions and to strengthen English maritime commerce at a time when the Dutch were considered major competitors in global trade."
