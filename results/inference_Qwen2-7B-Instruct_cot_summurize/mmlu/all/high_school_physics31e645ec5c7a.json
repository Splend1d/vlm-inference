To find \\(C\\), we use the fact that at \\(r=0\\), the potential \\(V\\) should be 0 ( (since there's no potential difference at the origin when considering it as a reference point). \n\n\\[ V(0) = -\\frac{6(0)^3}{3} + 2(0)^2 + 3(0) + C = 0 \\]\n\n\\[ C = 0 \\]\n\nSo the potential \\(V\\) can be expressed as:\n\n\\[ V = -\\frac{6r^3}{3} + 2r^2 + 3r \\]\n\nNow, we calculate the potential at the point (3, 4) which implies \\(r = \\sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} = 5\\)\n\n\\[ V_{point} = -\\frac{6(5)^3}{3} + 2(5)^2 + 3(5) \\]\n\n\\[ V_{point} = -\\frac{6 \\times 125}{3} + 2 \\times 25 + 15 \\]\n\n\\[ V_{point} = -250 + 50 + 15 \\]\n\n\\[ V_{point} = -185 V \\]\n\nTherefore, the potential difference between the origin and the point (3, 4 is \\(-185 V\\), which corresponds to option D."
