Suburbanization will develop because the time it takes to commute to the city has been decreased.\n\nWhen a highway connects a major city with areas previously used for farmland, it often leads to suburbanization. The reduced travel time between the city and the countryside makes living in suburban areas more appealing, especially for those who work in the city but prefer not to live within its dense urban environment. This can lead to an expansion of residential areas outward from the city center, as people move closer to their places of employment to save time and reduce commuting costs. As a result, the farmland may be developed for housing, shopping centers, and other infrastructure associated with suburban growth."
