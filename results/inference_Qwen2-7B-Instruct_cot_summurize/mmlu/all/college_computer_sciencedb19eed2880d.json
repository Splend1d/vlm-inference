It is inherently nonassociative because there have to be upper and lower bounds on the size of numbers.\n\nFloating-point arithmetic is inherently nonassociative due to the finite precision used to represent numbers, which means that some numbers do not have an exact representation. This leads to rounding errors when performing operations, making it impossible for (a + (b + c) to always equal ((a + b) + c). The need for upper and lower bounds on the size of numbers is related to the limitations of memory and storage in computers, not to the associativity property of arithmetic operations."
