The theater has a duty to maintain its premises in a reasonably safe condition for patrons. This duty typically includes regular inspections to identify and correct potential hazards. If the collapse of the seat was due to negligence on the part of the theater (for example, failing to properly maintain or inspect the seating) and it can be proven that this negligence led to the customer's injury, the customer would have grounds for recovery under the legal principle of premises liability."
