This model was famously associated with the manufacturing processes used by Henry Ford in the automotive industry. In contrast, Post-Fordist practices are more flexible, decentralized, and tailored to specific market segments or niches.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it describes the characteristics of the Fordist model, where there was often a focus on mass production for a broad audience.\n\nOption B refers to the differences between producer-broadcaster and publisher-broadcaster models in broadcasting, which is related but not specifically to the concept of Post-Fordist forms of media production and consumption.\n\nOption D is also incorrect as it focuses on a specific type of advertising content (motoring and car-related products, which could be a part of any media production model, not necessarily indicative of Post-Fordist characteristics.\n\nTherefore, option C correctly identifies the key feature of Post-Fordist forms: the creation of a wide array of products designed to cater to specialized interests or smaller, targeted audiences."
