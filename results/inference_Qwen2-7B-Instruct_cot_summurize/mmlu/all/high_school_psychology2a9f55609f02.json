Counterconditioning involves learning new responses to situations in order to change negative emotional reactions or behaviors. This technique can be applied in a somatic therapy context to help clients develop healthier ways of responding to stress or trauma.\n\nChemotherapy (option D) is not a type of therapy but a treatment for cancer involving the use of drugs-based medicines. It's not typically associated with somatic therapy, which focuses on psychological and emotional factors rather than medical treatments.\n\nOptions B ( systematic desensitization and C rational emotive behavior therapies are are more commonly associated with cognitive-behavioral therapy, which focuses on changing patterns of thinking and behavior, rather than the direct integration of mental and physical states that somatic therapy emphasizes."
