In Atkinson, Morten, and Sue\u2019s 1993 Racial/Cultural Identity Development Model, the dissonance stage is characterized by individuals who start to question their rejection of all aspects of the dominant culture and their absolute loyalty to their own culture. During this phase, they become aware of the contradictions and conflicts between their cultural identity and the dominant culture, leading them to critically examine their values, beliefs, and behaviors."
