                    "text": "The correct statement about cellular respiration is:\n\nD. ATP is formed because an endergonic reaction is coupled with an exergonic reaction.\n\nExplanation:\n- A. This is incorrect. Most CO2 produced during cellular respiration comes from the Krebs cycle (Citric Acid Cycle), not glycolysis. Glycolysis produces 2 molecules of CO2, while the Krebs cycle produces 6 molecules of CO2 per glucose molecule.\n- B. This is incorrect. Protons (H+ ions) are not pumped through ATP synthase by active transport; they are moved down their concentration gradient, which drives the synthesis of ATP.\n- C. This is incorrect. The final electron acceptor in the electron transport chain is oxygen (O2). NAD+ and FAD are reduced to NADH and FADH2, respectively, as electrons are passed along the chain but are not the final acceptors.\n- D. This is correct. ATP synthesis in cellular respiration occurs when an endergonic reaction (the formation of ATP from ADP and phosphate) is coupled with an exergonic reaction (the release of energy from the breakdown of glucose). The energy released from the exergonic reactions (such as the oxidation of glucose in glycolysis, the Krebs cycle, and the electron transport chain) is harnessed to drive the endergonic reactions that produce ATP."
