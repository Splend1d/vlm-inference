Their testimony should be focused on providing insights that can help the court determine what is in the best interest of the child, considering various factors such as the child's emotional and psychological well-being, their relationship with each parent, and any potential risks or benefits associated with each parenting arrangement. The psychologist's duty is to serve the judicial process and not to advocate for the interests of any particular party involved in the case."
