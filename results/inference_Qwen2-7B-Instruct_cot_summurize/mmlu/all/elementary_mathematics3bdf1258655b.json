We can do this by cross-multiplying:\n\n\\[ 18.5 \\times 7.5 = 3.60 \\times m \\]\n\n\\[ 138.75 = 3.60 \\times m \\]\n\nNow, divide both sides by 3.60 to find \\(m\\):\n\n\\[ m = \\frac{138.75}{3.60} \\]\n\n\\[ m = 37.04 \\]\n\nSince the question asks us to round to the nearest hundredth if necessary, \\(37.04\\) remains unchanged. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is not listed among your options because the question seems to be asking for a value of \\(m\\) that makes the original equation true, which is approximately \\(37.04\\), not any of the options A through D."
