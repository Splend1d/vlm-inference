This area was part of the ancient kingdoms of Silla, Goguryeo, and Baekje, which together formed the Three Kingdoms of Korea during the period from the 1st to the 7th century AD.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer would be a combination of B. Silla, C. Goguryeo, and D. Joseon ( considering Joseon is the name of the last kingdom of Korea which ruled from 1392 to 1910. However, since these options do not allow for multiple selections, the question might be better suited with an option that encompasses all relevant historical periods or regions where this belief existed. \n\nIn general, it's important to note that the belief in the Holy Mother of Mount Fairy Peach is deeply rooted in Korean shamanistic traditions and has been passed down through generations, influencing various aspects of Korean culture, including folklore, literature, and art."
