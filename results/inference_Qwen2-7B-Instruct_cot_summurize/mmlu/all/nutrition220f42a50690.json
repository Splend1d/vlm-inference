Family history: Having a first-degree relative ( such as a parent or sibling with diabetes increases your risk.\n\nB. Being overweight or obese: Excess body weight, especially around the waist, can lead to insulin resistance and contribute to the development of type 2 diabetes.\n\nC. High intake of dietary fat: Consuming a diet high in saturated fats and trans fats can contribute to obesity and increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetes.\n\nIt's important to note that while these factors can increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetes, they do not necessarily mean that someone will develop the condition. Lifestyle changes such as maintaining a healthy weight, eating a balanced diet, and regular physical activity can help reduce the risk."
