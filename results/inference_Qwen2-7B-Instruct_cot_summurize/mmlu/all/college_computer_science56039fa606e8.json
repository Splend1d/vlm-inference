Operator precedence\n\nContext-free grammars are used to define the syntax of programming languages, including the rules for constructing valid expressions and statements. Operator precedence rules determine the order in which operators are applied in an expression, which can be effectively captured by a context-free grammar.\n\nHere's why the other options are not as well-suited for specification with a context-free grammar:\n\nA. Identifier length - This is a lexical or syntactic rule that defines the minimum and maximum number of characters allowed for identifiers. While it can be part of the overall grammar, it is not typically specified using context-free grammatical constructs.\n\nB. Maximum level of nesting - While context-free grammars can specify nested structures ( like parentheses, curly braces, etc., they do not inherently limit the depth of nesting. The maximum nesting level would need to be defined externally or through constraints not directly captured within the grammar itself.\n\nD. Type compatibility - This involves complex rules about how variables of different types can be used together, which often requires more sophisticated mechanisms than those provided by context-free grammars, such as type systems or semantic analysis. Context-free grammars are primarily concerned with syntax, not semantics or type checking."
