Specifically, the H1N1 strain that caused the 2009 pandemic was of swine origin (so option A is partially correct in this context, though it's important to note that the virus itself was a result of a reassortment of genes from multiple animal strains. \n\nThe H5N1 strain, which has been responsible for several outbreaks and pandemics in humans, comes from wild birds (so option B is also correct.\n\nThe H7N9 strain, identified more recently, is believed to have originated from poultry, particularly chickens.\n\nAnd indeed, bats are often considered a significant reservoir for various influenza strains due to their ability to carry these viruses without showing symptoms, making them a potential source for new pandemics (so option C is also correct.\n\nTherefore, while pigs (A) can be a relevant answer given the specific case of the 2009 pandemic, all options (A, B, C, and D could be seen as relevant depending on the specific strain of influenza being discussed. In the broadest sense, influenza viruses that cause pandemics typically originate from animals, with the exact animal source varying by strain."
