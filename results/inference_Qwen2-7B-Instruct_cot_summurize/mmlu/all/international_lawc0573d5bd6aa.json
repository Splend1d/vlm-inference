                    "text": "Prior to the establishment of the United Nations and the adoption of its Charter in 1945, the regulation of the use of armed force by states was largely governed by the laws of war, also known as international humanitarian law ( (IHL), and the principles of sovereign equality and non-interference under international law.\n\nThe laws of war were codified in various treaties and customs, such as the Geneva Conventions, which primarily dealt with the treatment of wounded and sick soldiers, prisoners of war, and civilians during times of conflict. However, these laws did not completely prohibit the use of armed force but rather set rules about how it could be used humanely and with respect for the distinction between combatants and non-combatants.\n\nInternational law did not provide a clear prohibition on the use of armed force until the advent of the Charter of the United Nations. The Charter introduced the concept of collective security and established the United Nations Security Council with the power to authorize the use of force to maintain or restore international peace and security. Prior to this, the use of armed force by states was generally guided by principles of self-defense, intervention in cases of gross human rights violations, and sometimes under the auspices of international organizations like the League of Nations, though with limited enforcement mechanisms.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer would be:\n\nC. Armed force was permitted subject to few restrictions\n\nThis reflects the fact that while the use of armed force was not entirely prohibited, it was subject to various constraints and was often regulated by international norms and treaties that sought to limit its destructiveness and ensure humane treatment of those affected by conflict."
