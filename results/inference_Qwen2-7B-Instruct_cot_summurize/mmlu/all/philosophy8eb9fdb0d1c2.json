It is believed that beauty and art can exist purely for their sensory or emotional impact, without serving any necessary purpose beyond pleasing the senses or evoking certain feelings. This perspective is often associated with the philosophy of art and aesthetics, where the focus is on the intrinsic qualities of objects rather than their external or utilitarian attributes."
