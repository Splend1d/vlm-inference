A hexagon has 6 sides, while a triangle has 3 sides. Therefore, this statement incorrectly equates two different shapes based on their side counts.\nB. This statement is true because an octagon, by definition, is a polygon with 8 sides. All octagons are indeed polygons as they meet the basic requirement for being classified as a polygon: having at least three sides.\nC. This statement is false because not all parallelograms are rectangles. While it's true that both parallelograms and rectangles have two sets of parallel sides, rectangles also have four right angles. Not all parallelograms have right angles, so not all parallelograms can be classified as rectangles.\nD. This statement is false because not all rhombi are squares. Rhombi are defined by having all four sides of equal length. However, for a shape to be a square, it must also have four right angles. Thus, while all squares are rhombi (because they have four equal sides, not all rhombi are squares because they may lack the right angles characteristic of squares."
