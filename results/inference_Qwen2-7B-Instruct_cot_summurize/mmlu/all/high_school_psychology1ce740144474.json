The research must be conducted as a double-blind study.\n\nThe American Psychological Association (APA) guidelines on deception in psychological research state that deception can only be used under certain circumstances:\n\nA. The research is of great importance and cannot be conducted without the use of deception.\nB. Participants are expected to find the procedures reasonable upon being informed of them.\nC. Participants must be allowed to withdraw from the experiment at any time.\n\nThese points align with the ethical principles that justify using deception, such as the need for the study to have significant scientific value, ensuring that participants are not misled unnecessarily, and respecting their autonomy by allowing them to leave if they wish.\n\nHowever, conducting the research as a \"double-blind\" study is not one of the conditions that justify the use of deception in a study. A double-blind study refers to a type of experimental design where neither the participants nor the researchers know who is receiving a particular treatment or intervention, which helps to reduce bias. While this method is important for ensuring the validity of the results, it does not relate directly to the justification for using deception in research."
