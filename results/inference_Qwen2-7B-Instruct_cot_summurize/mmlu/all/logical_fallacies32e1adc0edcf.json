This fallacy occurs when someone claims something is true or correct simply because some unnamed authority says so, without providing any specific information about who this authority is or why they are considered credible. \n\nIn other words, the argument relies on the idea that if an authority endorses a particular view or action, then that view or action must be valid or right, even if the identity and qualifications of the authority are not disclosed or are irrelevant to the argument at hand. This can lead to misinformation or false beliefs being perpetuated, as the lack of transparency and scrutiny regarding the authority's expertise or credibility undermines the soundness of the argument."
