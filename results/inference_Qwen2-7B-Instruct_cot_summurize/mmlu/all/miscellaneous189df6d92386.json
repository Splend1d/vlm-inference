Placing celery stalks in water colored with a dye and observing the results\n\nThis activity is particularly effective for introducing kindergartners to the concept of how plants transport water because it provides a simple, observable demonstration of xylem function. When celery stalks are placed in water containing a food coloring, the color rises up the stalk through its xylem vessels. This visual representation helps children understand that plants absorb water and nutrients from the soil and transport them to all parts of the plant through their vascular system. It's a hands-on, engaging way to introduce basic biological concepts in a manner suitable for young learners."
