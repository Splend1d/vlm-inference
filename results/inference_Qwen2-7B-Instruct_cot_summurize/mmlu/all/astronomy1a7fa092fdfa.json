                    "text": "The statement that is not true is:\n\nD. Neptune and Pluto won't collide because of their orbital resonance\n\nThis statement is incorrect for several reasons. First, it's important to clarify what an orbital resonance is: it refers to a gravitational interaction between two orbiting bodies where the ratio of their orbital periods results in a stable pattern of gravitational forces. This can lead to the bodies maintaining relatively stable orbits over long periods.\n\nHowever, the mere fact that Neptune and Pluto have an orbital resonance does not prevent them from colliding. The resonance affects the timing and distances of their closest approaches but does not guarantee they will always miss each other. \n\nNeptune and Pluto do indeed have a resonance relationship, but this does not prevent their paths from intersecting over time. In fact, it was once thought that Pluto's orbit might be unstable due to its proximity to Neptune, leading to theories about gravitational interactions causing Pluto to be ejected from the solar system or even collide with Neptune. However, current models suggest Pluto's orbit is stable enough to remain within the Kuiper Belt for billions of years, avoiding collisions with Neptune.\n\nOther aspects mentioned in the statements are generally true:\n\nA. The Earth and Venus do not have a simple 1:1 orbital resonance. Venus completes approximately 0.6154 times as many orbits as Earth does in a year, which means that after about 8 Earth years, Venus returns to the same position relative to Earth, creating a near-resonance known as the 8:1 resonance.\n\nB. Neptune and Pluto do indeed have a 3:2 orbital resonance. For every 3 orbits Neptune makes around the Sun, Pluto makes 2. This resonance helps stabilize their orbits and reduces the likelihood of close encounters, but it doesn't guarantee that they will never collide over the vast timescales involved.\n\nC. The Kirkwood gaps in the asteroid belt are indeed due to resonances with Jupiter. These gaps occur at specific distances from the Sun where the orbital periods of asteroids are a simple fraction of Jupiter's orbital period, leading to gravitational perturbations that make it difficult for asteroids to maintain orbits in those regions."
