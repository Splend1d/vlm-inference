Weak stationarity requires that the statistical properties such as mean, variance, and autocorrelation are constant over time. Financial returns often show changes in these properties over time due to market dynamics, economic conditions, or other factors.\n\nTo clarify why the other options are not typical characteristics:\n\nA. Financial asset return time-series often exhibit fat-tailed distributions rather than thin-tailed distributions. This means they have a higher probability of extreme outcomes compared to a normal distribution.\n\nC. Financial returns can be autocorrelated, meaning that past returns may influence future returns. However, this autocorrelation might not always be present, and it's not a universal characteristic across all financial assets or time periods.\n\nD. Financial returns often show trends, either upward or downward, due to economic growth, inflation, interest rate changes, or other market forces. This trend component makes them non-stationary in terms of having a constant mean and variance over time."
