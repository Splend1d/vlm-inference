They spread and grow in the evil soil of poverty and strife. They reach their full growth when the hope of a people for a better life has died. We must keep that hope alive. . . . Great responsibilities have been placed upon us by the swift movement of events. . . . I am confident that the Congress will face these responsibilities squarely.\"\n\u2014President Harry S. Truman, 1947\nThe ideas expressed in the passage above most directly reflect which of the following continuities in U.S. history?\n\nA. Debates about the relationship between Congress and the president.\nB. Debates about the use of military force in volatile situations.\nC. Debates about the role of the United States in world affairs.\nD. Debates about the proper role of political parties.\n"

Debates about the role of the United States in world affairs.\n\nThe passage reflects President Truman's concerns about the potential for totalitarian regimes to emerge in unstable or impoverished regions, and his call for the United States to take an active role in preventing this. This is a central theme in debates about American foreign policy and the country's role in global affairs. The other options do not fit the context as clearly:\n\nA. While there have been historical debates about the relationship between Congress and the president, this particular passage does not directly address this issue.\nB. Although military action is often a part of U.S. foreign policy, the passage does not specifically discuss military strategy or conflict resolution.\nD. The role of political parties in domestic politics is not the primary focus of the passage; it is more concerned with international relations and the responsibilities of the U.S. government in the post-World War II era."
