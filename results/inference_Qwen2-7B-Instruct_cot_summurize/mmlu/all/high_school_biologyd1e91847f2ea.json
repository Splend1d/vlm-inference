This phenomenon is most closely linked to sexual selection because it often occurs when one allele is favored by one sex and another allele is favored by the opposite sex. In this case, the heterozygote has traits that are attractive to both sexes, leading to increased reproductive success. This can favor the persistence of the intermediate phenotype represented by the heterozygote in a population."
