This goes against ethical guidelines in psychology which typically advocate for fair and unbiased decision-making processes, especially when it comes to promotions or hiring decisions. By linking the promotion decision to an unresolved charge of sexual harassment, Dr. Hanson might be prejudging the outcome of the accusation, which is not a role of his as a personnel committee head. Ethical guidelines often require that such decisions should be made independently of any ongoing legal or disciplinary proceedings. Therefore, his action could be seen as unethical."
