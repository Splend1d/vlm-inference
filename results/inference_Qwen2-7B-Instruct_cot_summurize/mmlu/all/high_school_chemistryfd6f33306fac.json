Heat of fusion\n\nHeat of fusion measures the energy required to change a substance from a solid to a liquid phase at its melting point, which is related to intermolecular forces within the solid phase but does not directly measure the relative intermolecular attractive forces between different substances. Boiling points, vapor pressures, and heat of vaporization are all properties that depend on the strength of intermolecular forces between particles in a substance and can be used to compare these forces within the same substance or between different substances."
