However, there were several dominant periods that can be categorized under different doctrines. For instance, during the early 20th century, the U.S. foreign policy was largely isolationist, leading to the passage of the Neutrality Acts that aimed to keep the country out of international conflicts. This period was characterized by a reluctance to engage in overseas military commitments or to interfere in European affairs. \n\nPlease note that the term \"containment\" (option A refers to a specific strategy employed by the United States during the Cold War era, aimed at preventing the spread of communism. \"Neoconservatism\", option B, is a political ideology that emerged after World War II and advocates for strong U.S. leadership abroad, often involving military interventions. \"Protectionism\", option D, refers to policies measures aimed at protecting domestic industries from foreign competition, not a foreign policy doctrine."
