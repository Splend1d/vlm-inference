In this framework, actions that lead to the greatest good for the greatest number are considered morally right. Maximizing profit can be seen as aligning with this principle, as increased profits often result in more resources being available to satisfy societal needs and desires.\n\nWhile other theories may have indirect implications for corporate behavior, they do not prescribe profit maximization as a primary goal:\n\nB. Preference Utilitarianism - This variant of utilitarianism focuses on maximizing individual preferences rather than happiness, which might not directly correlate with profit maximization.\n\nC. The Categorical Imperative - Immanuel Kant's philosophy suggests acting only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law. Profit maximization does not inherently align with this principle unless it is done ethically and universally applicable.\n\nD. Ethics of Care - This theory emphasizes relationships and responsibilities over impartiality and impersonal calculations of utility. While companies may consider ethical practices and stakeholder interests, profit maximization is not necessarily the core focus of this theory."
