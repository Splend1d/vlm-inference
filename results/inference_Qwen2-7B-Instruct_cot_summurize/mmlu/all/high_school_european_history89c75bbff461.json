It has but established new classes, new conditions of oppression, new forms of struggle in place of the old ones. Our epoch, the epoch of the bourgeoisie, possesses, however, this distinctive feature: it has simplified the class antagonisms. Society as a whole is more and more splitting up into two great hostile camps, into two great classes, directly facing each other: Bourgeoisie and Proletariat.\nKarl Marx and Friedrich Engels, The Communist Manifesto, 1848\nMarx and Engels would be most inclined to view which of the following developments as a significant event in European history?\n\nA. The War of the Roses\nB. The French Revolution of 1789 to 1793\nC. The Seven Years' War\nD. Britain's Glorious Revolution of 1688\n"

                    "text": "Marx and Engels would likely view the French Revolution of 1789 to 1793 ( option B, as a significant event in European history. This is because the French Revolution was a period of radical social and political upheaval that saw the rise of revolutionary ideals such as liberty, equality, and fraternity, which were part of the broader ideological context that Marx and Engels analyzed. The revolution also involved significant class struggles, particularly between the bourgeoisie ( the middle class, who sought to gain power and influence, and the proletariat or working class, who were increasingly organized and seeking better conditions. This aligning with their views on the historical progression of class struggles.\n\nOption A, The War of the Roses, is a series of civil wars fought between the House of Lancaster and the House of York for the throne of England. While these events were certainly significant in shaping the political landscape of Europe during the time, they did not involve the same level of class-based conflict and ideological struggle that Marx and Engels focused on.\n\nOption C, The Seven Years' War, was a global conflict involving many European powers, primarily centered around colonial possessions in North America, India, and Africa. While it had significant geopolitical consequences, it was not primarily a class struggle and did not align with Marx and Engels' focus on class dynamics.\n\nOption D, Britain's Glorious Revolution of 1688, was a political crisis resulting in the deposition of King James II of England and the establishment of the rule of William III and Mary II. Although this event led to significant changes in the English political system and was a key moment in the development of constitutional monarchy, it did not involve the same level of class conflict and revolutionary ideology that Marx and Engels associated with their theory of historical materialism."
