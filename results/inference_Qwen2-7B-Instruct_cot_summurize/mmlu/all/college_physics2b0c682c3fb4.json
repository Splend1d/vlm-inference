In these lasers, atoms are excited to higher energy states and then return to lower states, emitting photons in the process. The specific type of transition depends on the gas used in the laser. \n\nA. Diode lasers use semiconductor materials and do not involve free atoms.\n\nB. Dye lasers typically use organic dyes dissolved in a liquid medium. They can be thought of as involving transitions of molecules rather than free atoms.\n\nC. Free-electron lasers work by accelerating electrons through a magnetic field, which causes them to emit radiation. This process does not directly involve transitions of free atoms in the same way that gas lasers do."
