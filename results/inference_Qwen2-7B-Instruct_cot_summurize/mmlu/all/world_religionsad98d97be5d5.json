They believed that nakedness was an elemental expression of non-attachment. \n\nThe Digambara sect, one of the two main branches of Jainism, is known for its strict monastic rules, which include nudity for both monks and nuns. The belief behind this practice is that it symbolizes renunciation of worldly possessions and attachments, emphasizing the importance of detachment from material desires in achieving spiritual purity and liberation. This distinctive practice sets the Digambara sect apart from other religious traditions."
