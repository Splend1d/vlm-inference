In the case of host bird species being exploited by brood parasites like the cuckoo, the host bird is still able to rear its own young alongside the parasitic offspring. This means that the host bird is not being hindered in its ability to pass on its genes to the next generation, despite investing resources into rearing the non-genetically related cuckoo chicks. Therefore, from the perspective of the host bird, there is no negative impact on its fitness, which is why this trait remains in the gene pool of the population.\n\nOptions A, C, and D do not accurately describe the reason these traits remain in the gene pool:\n\n- A suggests that the host birds' response benefits them by allowing them to efficiently rear their own young, but this does not explain why the trait persists if it does not benefit the host birds.\n- C implies that rearing a fledgling is not energetically costly, which may not be true; rearing any offspring requires resources and could potentially come at the expense of the host bird's own survival or ability to breed again.\n- D incorrectly states that the maximum fitness of the cuckoo would be reduced, which is not how brood parasites typically operate. Instead, they are highly successful in exploiting the host's resources for their own offspring."
