While it's not necessarily morally wrong to call the police if someone is committing a crime, it could be seen as potentially aggressive or unnecessary if there were no immediate threat to personal safety and the person had not caused any damage other than entering the vehicle without permission. However, since the act of breaking into a car is generally considered illegal, one might argue that taking action against this act (i.e., calling the police, is not inherently morally wrong.\n\nScenario 2 involves going to your parents' safe deposit box while they are sleeping. This action can be seen as a violation of privacy and trust, especially if you did not have explicit permission from your parents. Without such permission, accessing their safe deposit box would likely be considered morally wrong, as it breaches the trust and boundaries that should exist within familial relationships.\n\nTherefore, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, Scenario 1 is morally questionable but not necessarily wrong, while Scenario 2 is morally wrong."
