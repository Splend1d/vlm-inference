The 'c' in the equation represents the speed of light in a vacuum. This equation tells us that a small amount of mass can be converted into a large amount of energy, as the mass is multiplied by the square of the speed of light, which is an extremely large number. So, while mass and energy are distinct concepts, they are intimately connected through this fundamental relationship."
