After first walking outside on a sunny day, you no longer are blinded by the initial brightness of the light.; and D. After first walking into an anatomy lab, you no longer notice the smell of formaldehyde.; are are examples of sensory or neural adaptation.\n\nSensory adaptation is a phenomenon where sensory receptors in the body adjust to constant stimuli, leading to a decrease in the perception of that stimulus over time. In each of these examples, the individual's sensory system adapts to a new environment or stimulus, reducing their awareness of it as time passes.\n\nTherefore, there isn't an option here that does not represent sensory or neural adaptation. If you were looking for an answer that doesn't fit the criteria given in the options, none exists among the choices provided."
