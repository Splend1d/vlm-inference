As the left ventricle relaxes during diastole (the 'resting' phase between heartbeats), the blood continues to flow through the arterial system due to the arteries' elastic walls. These walls recoil, or bounce back, pushing the blood forward even as the ventricle is not actively pumping. This mechanism helps maintain a steady flow of blood to the body's tissues and organs."
