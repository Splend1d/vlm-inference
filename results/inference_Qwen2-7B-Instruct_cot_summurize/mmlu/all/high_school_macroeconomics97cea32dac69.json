The answer to whether these have \"not changed significantly,\" \"are perfectly constant,\" \"decreased significantly,\" or \"increased significantly\" depends on what aspect is being considered (e.g., population, boundaries, etc.\n\nIf we consider:\n\n- **Population**: Both \"V\" (the states, and \"Q\" the counties, have seen significant changes over time due to migration, urbanization, and other demographic shifts.\n- **Boundaries**: While some counties might have had slight boundary adjustments, most state boundaries have remained relatively stable since their establishment.\n- **Demographics**: There has been significant change in demographics across both states and counties, including shifts in population density, age distribution, racial composition, etc.\n\nGiven this information:\n\n**A. have not changed significantly** - This would not be accurate for either states or counties considering the dynamic nature of population, boundaries, and demographics.\n**B. are perfectly constant** - This is also incorrect because boundaries can change and populations fluctuate.\n**C. have decreased significantly** - This could apply to certain counties if there was a significant decrease in population, but it does not necessarily apply to all or the overall trend.\n**D. have increased significantly** - This might apply to some aspects like county populations, especially in suburban and rural areas experiencing growth, or in the number of states, although the latter is not applicable as there are only 50 states.\n\nSo, without specifying the exact aspect, it's challenging to pick one definitive answer. However, if you're looking at broad trends, options C and D could potentially apply depending on the specific metric being measured."
