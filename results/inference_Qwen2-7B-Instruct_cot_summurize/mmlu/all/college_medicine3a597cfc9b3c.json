Blastocyst, corpus luteum maintenance\n\nThe pregnancy test detects the presence of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), which is produced by the blastocyst during early pregnancy to help maintain the corpus luteum and ensure adequate progesterone production for the pregnancy. The blastocyst is an early-stage embryo that implants into the lining of the uterus. As it implants, it triggers the production of hCG. The corpus luteum is a structure that forms after ovulation and secretes hormones like progesterone and estrogen. In the context of pregnancy, the continued production of hCG supports the corpus luteum to keep functioning properly, which is why the test looks for this hormone as an indicator of pregnancy."
