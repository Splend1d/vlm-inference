These include:\n\n1. **Institutional Inadequacy**: The climate change problem transcends national borders and requires global cooperation. However, international institutions often struggle to effectively coordinate policies and enforcement among diverse nations with different interests and capabilities. This can lead to a lack of coherent action or insufficient ambition in climate policies.\n\n2. **Dispersion of Causes and Effects**: Climate change is caused by a wide range of human activities, including emissions from energy production, industrial processes, agriculture, and deforestation, among others. The effects of these actions are felt globally, but the impacts are not evenly distributed across regions, population groups, or sectors. This dispersion makes it difficult to pinpoint specific sources of responsibility and to allocate the costs of mitigation and adaptation equitably.\n\n3. **Fragmentation of Agency**: Addressing climate change requires a multitude of actors, from governments to businesses, civil society organizations, and individuals. Each actor has varying levels of influence, resources, and responsibilities, leading to a fragmented approach to solving the problem. This fragmentation can result in inconsistent efforts, gaps in coverage, and challenges in achieving collective action.\n\nThese characteristics highlight the complexity of the climate change challenge and the need for comprehensive, cooperative, and adaptive strategies to effectively manage and mitigate its impacts."
