                    "text": "The arrangement of poles and zeros on the negative real axis typically corresponds to passive networks, specifically those involving resistors (R), inductors (L), and capacitors (C). In electrical engineering, the location of poles and zeros in the s-plane (a complex plane used in control theory and signal processing) can help identify the type of network.\n\n- Poles on the negative real axis suggest that there are components like inductors (L) or resistors (R) in the circuit, because these components have a natural tendency to affect the system's behavior by introducing resistance or inductive reactance.\n- Zeros on the negative real axis suggest the presence of capacitors (C), as capacitors can influence the system's response when placed in a specific configuration.\n\nGiven these explanations, the correct answer would be:\n\nD. Both 2 and 3.\n\nThis indicates that both RC and RL networks could potentially have their poles and zeros arranged alternatively on the negative real axis, depending on the specific configuration of the network. However, it's important to note that the presence of both poles and zeros on the negative real axis does not necessarily define an RC or RL network exclusively; rather, it's indicative of configurations that include combinations of RLC circuits. \n\nTherefore, the correct interpretation depends on the specific context of the question, considering whether it's asking for a specific type of network or just any combination of RLC elements that could result in such pole-zero placement."
