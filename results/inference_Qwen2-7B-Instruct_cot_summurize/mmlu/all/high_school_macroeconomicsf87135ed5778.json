The marginal propensity to save (MPS) represents the fraction of additional income that is saved.\n\nGiven:\n\n- Current disposable income = $10,000\n- Consumption spending = $8,000\n- Saving increases by $10 for every $100 increase in disposable income.\n\nFirst, we find the marginal propensity to consume (MPC:\n\n\\[ \\text{MPC} = \\frac{\\text{Change in Consumption}}{\\text{Change in Income}} \\]\n\nTo calculate MPC, let's first determine how much of the income is consumed. Since consumption spending is $8,000 out of a disposable income of $10,000, the consumption-to-income ratio is:\n\n\\[ \\text{MPC} = \\frac{\\$8,000}{\\$10,000} = 0.80 \\]\n\nSo, option A is correct: the marginal propensity to consume is 0.80.\n\nNext, we find the marginal propensity to save (MPS:\n\n\\[ \\text{MPS} = 1 - \\text{MPC} \\]\n\nSince we found the MPC to be 0.80:\n\n\\[ \\text{MPS} = 1 - 0.80 = 0.20 \\]\n\nTherefore, option B is correct: the marginal propensity to save is 0.20."
