The maximum displacement occurs when the waves are in phase (i.e., both have maximum positive displacements or both have minimum displacements at the same time. In this case, the maximum displacement would be the sum of the amplitudes: 4 cm + 6 cm = 10 cm.\n\nThe minimum displacement occurs when one wave has its maximum displacement while the other has its minimum displacement, which would be the difference between the two amplitudes: 6 cm - 4 cm = 2 cm.\n\nTherefore, the possible range for the resultant displacement is from 2 cm to 10 cm."
