It ranges from 0 to 4, with values around 2 indicating no autocorrelation. \n\nIf the Durbin-Watson statistic takes a value close to zero, it suggests a high degree of positive autocorrelation. This means that large errors (positive or negative) tend to follow other large errors of the same sign.\n\nGiven this scenario:\n\n- A. Close to zero: This is not correct because it would suggest low autocorrelation, which contradicts our premise.\n- B. Close to plus one: This is correct. A Durbin-Watson statistic close to zero indicates strong positive autocorrelation, which corresponds to a first-order autocorrelation coefficient (\u03c1) being close to +1.\n- C. Close to minus one: This is incorrect because it would indicate strong negative autocorrelation, which is not suggested by a statistic close to zero.\n- D. Close to either minus one or plus one: This is also incorrect as it does not specifically identify the direction of autocorrelation as positive when the statistic is near zero.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **B. Close to plus one**."
