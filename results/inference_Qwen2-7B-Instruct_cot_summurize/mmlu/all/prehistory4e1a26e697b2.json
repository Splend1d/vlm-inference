It tested the ability of human beings to adapt.\n\nThe transition from the late Pleistocene to the early Holocene, which occurred around 10,000 years ago, was marked by significant climate changes including the end of the last Ice Age and the beginning of a warmer period. This climate change had profound impacts on human populations, forcing them to adapt in various ways. Some groups moved to new territories as their previous environments became uninhabitable or changed significantly, while others developed new technologies and practices to cope with the changing conditions. For example, the development of agriculture and the establishment of permanent settlements were direct responses to these environmental shifts. Therefore, option B accurately reflects the impact of this climatic transition on human societies."
