It involves showing disrespect and cruelty towards individuals who may already be vulnerable or marginalized, which goes against the principles of empathy, kindness, and respect for human dignity.\n\nIn Scenario 2, not voting for a president solely because they want the office for their own personal benefit might be seen as a strategic choice based on one's political beliefs or values. This action itself is not necessarily morally wrong; it depends on how one interprets personal ambition versus public service. However, if the person believes that the president's personal ambition will negatively impact policies or governance, this could align with a moral stance against self-serving actions at the expense of the public good. Yet, without such a belief, it remains a political decision rather than a morally wrong act."
