It demands an end to poverty and racial injustice, to which we are totally committed in our time. But that is just the beginning. The Great Society is a place where every child can find knowledge to enrich his mind and to enlarge his talents. It is a place where leisure is a welcome chance to build and reflect, not a feared cause of boredom and restlessness. It is a place where the city of man serves not only the needs of the body and the demands of commerce but the desire for beauty and the hunger for community. It is a place where man can renew contact with nature. It is a place which honors creation for its own sake and for what it adds to the understanding of the race. It is a place where men are more concerned with the quality of their goals than the quantity of their goods. But most of all, the Great Society is not a safe harbor, a resting place, a final objective, a finished work. It is a challenge constantly renewed, beckoning us toward a destiny where the meaning of our lives matches the marvelous products of our labor.\"\nLyndon Johnson, Remarks at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, 1964\nJohnson's Great Society most represented an extension of which of the following initiatives?\n\nA. The New Deal\nB. The Square Deal\nC. The Truman Doctrine\nD. The Monroe Doctrine\n"

The New Deal\n\nThe New Deal was a series of programs, public works projects, regulations, and reforms enacted by President Franklin D. Roosevelt during the 1930s in response to the Great Depression. It aimed to provide relief to the poor, create jobs through government spending, and reform financial institutions practices to prevent future crises. Lyndon B. Johnson's Great Society built upon this legacy by extending the reach of federal programs into areas like education, healthcare, civil rights, and environmental protection, aiming to eliminate poverty and racial injustice, and to enrich American society as a whole."
