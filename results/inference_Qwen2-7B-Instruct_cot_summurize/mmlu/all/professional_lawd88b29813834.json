With every prescription of this drug distributed, the company inserted a written warning, which stated:\"Use of this drug may cause dizziness. \"In accordance with the prescription, the plaintiff received a four-day supply of the drug from his neighborhood pharmacy, which passed along the warning to the plaintiff. After two days, the plaintiff felt much better and went back to work at a home improvement store, where he was the manager. The plaintiff continued to take the drug until his supply was exhausted. On the fourth day, the plaintiff took his final capsule at 2:00 p. m. While he was driving his car home at 5:45 that afternoon, he became dizzy and crashed into a tree. As a result, he received multiple injuries. The plaintiff decided to consult an attorney, who filed a lawsuit on the plaintiff's behalf against the pharmaceutical company, alleging that the company was responsible for the accident and resulting injuries on the theories of negligence and strict liability. At trial, the plaintiff's attorney attempts to introduce evidence that subsequent to this accident, the company expanded its warning to read: \"Use of this drug may cause dizziness. Do not drive for five hours after use. \"Such evidence is\n\nA. admissible as an indication that the company did not use due care in wording its original warning.\nB. admissible as a declaration against interest, to prove the possibility of alternate warnings.\nC. inadmissible to show that the company was negligent in wording its original warning.\nD. inadmissible, because the subsequent warning is not relevant to the feasibility of a modified warning.\n"

Inadmissible to show that the company was negligent in wording its original warning.\n\nThis reasoning follows from the rules of evidence and the legal standards applicable in such cases. The introduction of the subsequent warning would not be considered relevant or admissible to demonstrate that the company was negligent in drafting the initial warning. The purpose of introducing evidence about the company's actions post-accident (in this case, the expansion of the warning - is not to show that the company was negligent in the past but rather to potentially argue about causation, foreseeability, or other aspects of the case under negligence or strict liability theories.\n\nEvidence of subsequent remedial measures is generally inadmissible to prove negligence or culpable conduct prior to the occurrence in question. This is based on the principle that it is unfair to punish someone for taking reasonable steps to prevent harm after the fact. However, there are exceptions to this rule, such as when the evidence is offered to prove ownership, control, or identity of the instrumentality involved in the incident or to establish a pattern of behavior that could indicate negligence.\n\nIn this scenario, the plaintiff's attorney might argue that the expansion of the warning indicates that the company recognized the risk of dizziness and driving posed by the drug and took steps to mitigate that risk. This could be relevant to argue that the company should have been aware of the potential for dizziness and the dangers of driving while experiencing dizziness caused by the drug, even if the warning was not expanded earlier. However, this argument would need to be made within the context of how the evidence relates to the case's specific legal theories, rather than simply to suggest the company was negligent for not including the expanded warning initially."
