This property is characteristic of matrices that represent rotations or reflections in Euclidean space. \n\nFor a 2x2 matrix \\(A\\), if \\(A = A^{-1}\\), then we have:\n\n\\[AA = I\\]\n\nLet's consider the general form of a 2x2 matrix:\n\n\\[A = \\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix}\\]\n\nThen \\(A^{-1}\\) is given by:\n\n\\[A^{-1} = \\frac{1}{ad-bc}\\begin{pmatrix} d & -b \\\\ -c & a \\end{pmatrix}\\]\n\nGiven \\(A = A^{-1}\\), we equate the two expressions:\n\n\\[\\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{ad-bc}\\begin{pmatrix} d & -b \\\\ -c & a \\end{pmatrix}\\]\n\nThis implies:\n\n1. \\(a = \\frac{d}{ad-bc}\\)\n2. \\(b = -\\frac{b}{ad-bc}\\)\n3. \\(c = -\\frac{c}{ad-bc}\\)\n4. \\(d = \\frac{a}{ad-bc}\\)\n\nFrom (1) and (4), we can see that \\(a = d\\) and \\(a^2 = d^2\\). For these to be equal, \\(a\\) and \\(d\\) must either both be 1 or both be -1, because the only real numbers whose square equals their own value are 1 and -1.\n\nFrom the equation for \\(A^{-1}\\), we also know that \\(ad - bc = 1\\) ( (because \\(A = A^{-1}\\)).\n\nThe trace of \\(A\\) is given by \\(tr(A) = a + d\\).\n\nIf \\(a = 1\\) and \\(d = 1\\), then \\(tr(A) = 1 + 1 = 2\\).\n\nIf \\(a = -1\\) and \\(d = -1\\), then \\(tr(A) = -1 - 1 = -2\\).\n\nHowever, the condition \\(ad - bc = 1\\) rules out the case where \\(a = -1\\) and \\(d = -1\\), because this would imply \\(bc = 0\\), which does not necessarily follow from \\(A = A^{-1}\\) without additional constraints.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. 2"
