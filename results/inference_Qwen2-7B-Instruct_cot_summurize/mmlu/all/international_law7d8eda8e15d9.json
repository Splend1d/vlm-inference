This concept embodies the idea that a state has the supreme authority within its jurisdiction. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Sovereignty means freedom to determine one's own affairs without external interference.\n\nThis definition encapsulates the essence of sovereignty as it implies that a state can make decisions and enact laws that govern its internal affairs, and it has the autonomy to conduct foreign policy, enter into international agreements, and manage its own resources, among other things, without undue influence or control from other states or external entities."
