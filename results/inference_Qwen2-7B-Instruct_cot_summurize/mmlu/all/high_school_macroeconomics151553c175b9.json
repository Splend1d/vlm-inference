                    "text": "When the real interest rate in a country rises, several economic effects occur. The real interest rate is the nominal interest rate adjusted for inflation. A higher real interest rate typically attracts foreign investors seeking better returns on their investments, as the opportunity cost of holding their funds in that country becomes relatively lower compared to other countries with lower real interest rates.\n\nAs a result:\n\n- **Demand for Currency**: Increases. Investors will buy more of the country's currency to access its financial markets and benefit from the higher interest rates.\n- **Value of Currency**: Appreciates. The increased demand for the currency leads to an appreciation of its value against other currencies.\n- **Net Exports**: Decrease. An appreciation of the currency makes the country's exports more expensive for foreign buyers, potentially reducing export volumes. Meanwhile, imports become cheaper, encouraging more consumption of foreign goods. This combination leads to a decrease in net exports ( (exports minus imports).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Decreases   Appreciate   Decreases"
