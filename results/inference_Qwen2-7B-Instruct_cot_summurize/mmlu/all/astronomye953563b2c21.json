The Moon will be further from the Earth and the Earth\u2019s day will be longer.\n\nThe distance between the Earth and the Moon is not constant and has been changing over time due to gravitational interactions between the two bodies. However, these changes are very slow, on the order of centimeters per year, and not enough to significantly impact the length of a day in 20,000 years.\n\nAs for the length of the day, it's primarily determined by the Earth's rotation period. The Earth's rotation is gradually slowing down due to tidal forces exerted by the Moon, which causes the length of each day to increase by about 1.8 milliseconds every century. This means that in 20,000 years, the length of a day would be significantly longer than it is today, but this is not due to the Moon being further away. It's due to the Earth spinning more slowly over time. \n\nSo, the correct answer is C: The Moon will be further from the Earth, and the Earth\u2019s day will be longer."
