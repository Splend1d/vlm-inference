When vitamin K is deficient, these proteins are not fully formed or are not formed at all, leading to an increase in prothrombin levels since the body attempts to compensate by producing more prothrombin precursor molecules. However, because the final carboxylation step is missing, these prothrombin molecules are not as effective at converting to thrombin, which is necessary for the clotting cascade.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. The plasma concentration of prothrombin."
