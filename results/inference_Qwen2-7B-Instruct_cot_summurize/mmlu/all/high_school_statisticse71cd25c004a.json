The exam scores follow a normal distribution with a mean (\\(\\mu\\)) of 80 and a standard deviation (\\(\\sigma\\)) of 9. Estrella scored 90 on the test.\n\nFirst, let's calculate her z-score, which is given by the formula:\n\n\\[z = \\frac{X - \\mu}{\\sigma}\\]\n\nwhere \\(X\\) is Estrella's score ( (90), \\(\\mu\\) is the mean ( (80), and \\(\\sigma\\) is the standard deviation ( (9).\n\n\\[z = \\frac{90 - 80}{9} = \\frac{10}{9} \\approx 1.11\\]\n\nNext, we need to find the percentile rank that corresponds to a z-score of 1.11. We can use a standard normal distribution table or an online calculator to find this value. Looking up a z-score of 1.11 in a standard normal distribution table, we find that it corresponds to a cumulative probability of approximately 0.8665, or the 86.65th percentile.\n\nThis means that Estrella scored higher than about 86.65% of the test-takers, placing her in the top 15% as required for further evaluation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. 86.65; she qualified."
