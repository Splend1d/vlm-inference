His symptoms began 15 minutes after he was stung by a bee and lasted approximately 60 minutes; they resolved before he was treated. He has been stung by bees three times over the past year, and each reaction has been more severe. Examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate recommendation to prevent future morbidity and mortality from this condition?\n\nA. Avoid areas known to have bees\nB. Avoid wearing colorful clothing outside\nC. Carrying diphenhydramine tablets\nD. Carrying self-injectable epinephrine\n"

Carrying self-injectable epinephrine\n\nThe patient described is likely experiencing an allergic reaction to bee stings, which can escalate in severity with repeated exposure. This is indicative of anaphylaxis, a severe and potentially life-threatening allergic reaction. Given that the patient's reactions have become progressively more severe, it is crucial to prevent further episodes and manage potential anaphylactic responses effectively.\n\nCarrying self-injectable epinephrine (such as an EpiPen) allows for immediate treatment upon the onset of symptoms, which can significantly improve outcomes in cases of anaphylaxis. Epinephrine helps to counteract the effects of histamine release, which is a key component of the allergic response. It works by constricting blood vessels, reducing swelling, and increasing heart rate and blood pressure, thus preventing or reversing the symptoms of anaphylaxis.\n\nAvoiding areas known to have bees (and wearing less colorful clothing, while potentially helpful in reducing the likelihood of being stung, do not address the need for immediate intervention during an allergic reaction. Diphenhydramine (found in some antihistamine medications) can provide relief from some allergy symptoms but does not reverse the effects of anaphylaxis and is not recommended as a primary preventive measure for severe allergies."
