This can lead to a decrease in private investment and consumption, effectively \"crowding out\" private sector spending. As a result, aggregate demand (AD) shifts to the left, potentially reducing economic growth and increasing unemployment in the short run. \n\nIt's important to note that option A refers to the rightward shift in AD due to lower interest rates resulting from contractionary fiscal policy, which is not the typical description of the crowding-out effect. Option C describes the money supply increase, which would indeed decrease real interest rates but doesn't specifically describe the crowding-out effect. Option D refers to a statement by a central bank chairperson regarding the state of the economy, which does not directly relate to the crowding-out effect."
