An artist who specialized in making delicate glass sculptures had a studio two blocks away from the laboratory's plant. Late one evening, there was an explosion at the laboratory's plant. The force of the explosion caused the artist's studio to be shaken, which resulted in the destruction of valuable artwork in the studio. The artist now asserts a tort action against the laboratory to recover damages. Which of the following, if established, would furnish the laboratory with its best possible defense?\n\nA. The laboratory used extraordinary care in the manufacture and storage of nitroglycerin and was not guilty of any negligence that was causally connected with the explosion.\nB. The laboratory has a contract with the federal government whereby all the nitroglycerin manufactured at its plant is used in U. S. military weapons systems.\nC. The explosion was caused when lightning (an act of God) struck the plant during an electrical storm.\nD. The harm that the artist suffered would not have resulted but for the abnormal fragility of the artist's work.\n"

If the laboratory can prove that it exercised extraordinary care, it may argue that it did not breach its duty of care, thus negating one of the key elements required for the artist's claim to succeed.\n\nOptions B, C, and D could potentially be relevant to the defense, depending on the specifics of the case:\n\n- Option B suggests that the nitroglycerin is used in military weapons systems, which might not directly affect the laboratory's liability in this case unless it somehow relates to the cause or consequences of the explosion.\n- Option C argues that the explosion was caused by an act of God (lightning), which could be a defense if it can be shown that such an event was unforeseeable and beyond the control of the laboratory.\n- Option D focuses on the fragility of the artist's work, suggesting that the harm would not have occurred but for the nature of the artwork itself. This could weaken the artist's case, as it might shift the focus away from the laboratory's actions and onto the inherent risks associated with the artist's choice of medium.\n\nHowever, none of these options directly addresses the core issue of negligence on the part of the laboratory. Therefore, option A is the most direct and effective defense for the laboratory."
