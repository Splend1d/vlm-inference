The statement \"the explanatory variable is non-stochastic\" means that the variable does not vary randomly or unpredictably across different samples. It implies that the explanatory variable is fixed or deterministic, meaning it has the same value in repeated samples. This concept is often discussed in the context of statistical models where variables are categorized as either stochastic ( random and unpredictable or non-stochastic/deterministic.\n\nLet's quickly review why the other options are incorrect:\n\nA. The explanatory variable being partly random contradicts the definition of being non-stochastic. If a variable is non-stochastic, it means it doesn't have any randomness associated with its values.\n\nC. The explanatory variable being correlated with the errors suggests there's some kind of relationship between the variable and the residuals of the model, which is not what it means to be non-stochastic. A non-stochastic variable should not exhibit such a relationship.\n\nD. The explanatory variable always having a value of one implies a specific, constant value, but this is just one way a non-stochastic variable could behave. The key aspect is that it is not subject to random variation.\n\nThus, option B correctly captures the essence of a non-stochastic explanatory variable: it remains constant across repeated samples."
