According to Newton's third law of motion, for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. Therefore, these two forces form an action-reaction pair.\n\nTo clarify why the other options are incorrect:\nB. Having equal magnitudes but not forming an action-reaction pair doesn't align with Newton's third law.\nC. Unequal magnitudes would violate the principle that these forces must be equal for the person to remain stationary or move at a constant velocity.\nD. Unequal magnitudes and not forming an action-reaction pair also contradicts the principles described above."
