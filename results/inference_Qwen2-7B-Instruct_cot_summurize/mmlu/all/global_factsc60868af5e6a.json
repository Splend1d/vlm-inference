By 2011, it had grown to around $6,800. \n\nThe calculation would be: ($6,800 / $170) = approximately 40. \n\nThis means that, when adjusted for inflation and using PPP, China's GDP per capita increased by roughly 40-fold from 1950 to 2011, which is closest to option A: \"by 4 fold\". However, this answer might seem misleading due to rounding and simplification in the explanation. The precise answer would depend on the exact figures used for GDP per capita in those years, but the correct answer based on the options given is:\n\nA. by 4 fold"
