Concerned that a production process change might have lowered the thrust, an inspector tests a sample of units, calculating a mean of 9350 pounds with a z-score of -2.46 and a P-value of 0.0069. Which of the following is the most reasonable conclusion?\n\nA. 99.31% of the engines produced under the new process will have a thrust under 9350 pounds.\nB. 99.31% of the engines produced under the new process will have a thrust under 9500 pounds.\nC. 0.69% of the time an engine produced under the new process will have a thrust over 9500 pounds.\nD. There is evidence to conclude that the new process is producing engines with a mean thrust under 9500 pounds.\n"

There is evidence to conclude that the new process is producing engines with a mean thrust under 9500 pounds.\n\nExplanation:\n- A z-score of -2.46 indicates how many standard deviations below the mean ( the sample mean (9350 pounds) is. \n- The P-value of 0.0069 represents the probability of observing a sample mean as extreme as 9350 pounds or more extreme if the true mean thrust remains at 9500 pounds. This is typically compared against a significance level (e.g., 0.05). A P-value of 0.0069 is well below common thresholds for statistical significance (like 0.05 or 0.01), suggesting strong evidence against the null hypothesis that the mean thrust has not changed from 9500 pounds.\n  \nThis indicates that the sample data provide strong evidence that the mean thrust of engines produced under the new process is significantly lower than the original mean of 9500 pounds. \n\nOptions A, B, and C either misinterpret the P-value or confuse it with probabilities of future events rather than assessing the current hypothesis about the mean. Option D correctly identifies the statistical evidence for a decrease in the mean thrust under the new process."
