Taking away games as a form of punishment for skipping school, while perhaps harsh by some standards, is not generally considered morally wrong under the right circumstances. It can be seen as a disciplinary measure, though it's important to ensure that such actions are done in a safe and appropriate manner, without causing undue harm or trauma."
