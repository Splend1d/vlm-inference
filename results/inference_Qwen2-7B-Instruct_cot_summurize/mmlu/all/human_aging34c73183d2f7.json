Married for a long time.\n\nResearch suggests that older adults with higher levels of education and self-esteem tend to have stronger, longer-lasting marriages. They often possess better communication skills, emotional intelligence, and problem-solving abilities, which contribute to the stability and longevity of their relationships. However, it's important to note that these factors do not guarantee a long-lasting marriage, as relationship satisfaction can also be influenced by other variables such as shared values, life goals, and compatibility.\n\nRegarding the other options:\nA. Sexual activity in older adults is more complex and influenced by various factors such as health, personal preferences, and societal expectations, rather than solely educational attainment or self-esteem.\nB. Social isolation might be more common among older adults who have lower social engagement, regardless of their education level or self-esteem.\nC. Loneliness can affect anyone regardless of their age, education, or self-esteem; it is often related to feelings of disconnection, lack of meaningful relationships, or health issues."
