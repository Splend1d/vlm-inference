                    "text": "Water lilies like Nymphaea odorata have their leaves adapted to life in water. One of these adaptations is having stomata (the tiny openings that plants use for gas exchange with the atmosphere on the underside of the leaf. This placement helps prevent the leaf from drying out too quickly and allows for efficient gas exchange even when the leaf is submerged or nearly so.\n\nIn addition, because water lilies grow in water, they need to efficiently transport water and nutrients throughout their body. This means they need a dense network of xylem cells (which are are responsible for transporting water up from the roots to the leaves - in the stem rather than directly in the leaves themselves. So, while the leaves may have some xylem cells, it wouldn't have as many as a terrestrial plant to transport water from the soil.\n\nTherefore, based on these considerations, the correct answer would be:\n\nC. stomata on the bottom surface and relatively few water-conducting (xylem) cells"
