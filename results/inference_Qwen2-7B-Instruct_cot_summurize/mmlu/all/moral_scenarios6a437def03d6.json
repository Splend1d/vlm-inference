Wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn the first scenario, pouring spiders into the apartment is clearly morally wrong because it involves causing harm and distress to living creatures without their consent. This action goes against the ethical treatment of animals and the respect for others' property (assuming the spiders were not invited or intended to be part of the Halloween decorations.\n\nIn the second scenario, putting rolled oats in a bowl and heating them is not morally wrong. This is a common and harmless household activity that does not cause any harm to anyone or anything. It's a practical and everyday use of kitchen items.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: Wrong, Not wrong."
