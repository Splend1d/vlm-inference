A stronger or more influential state might create alliances to provide protection for smaller, less powerful countries, which can deter aggression and ensure mutual defense.\n\nB. Smaller or less resource-rich states might join an alliance because they perceive that their own capabilities are insufficient to guarantee their sovereignty and security independently. Alliances offer collective defense, which can be more effective than relying solely on one's own military strength.\n\nC. The presence of a potentially hegemonic or dominant power in the international system can make alliances particularly appealing to other states. This is because alliances can serve as a deterrent against aggression from a dominant power, ensuring that smaller states have some form of collective protection against threats.\n\nTherefore, all three options contribute to the rationale behind a state's decision to join an alliance such as NATO."
