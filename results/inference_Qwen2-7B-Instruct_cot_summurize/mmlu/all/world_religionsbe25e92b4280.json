Ashoka\n\nAshoka was a ruler of the Maurya Empire in ancient India who is best known for his promotion of the dharma, which he interpreted as a path to peace and non-violence after a brutal campaign of conquest. He adopted Buddhism as his religion and worked to spread its teachings, particularly the principles of non-violence (ahimsa), throughout his vast empire. His edicts, found on pillars and rocks across his realm, provide insights into his philosophy and the policies of his administration."
