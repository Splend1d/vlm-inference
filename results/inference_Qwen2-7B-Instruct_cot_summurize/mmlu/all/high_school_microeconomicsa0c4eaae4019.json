I and III only.\n\nIn an oligopoly, there are formidable barriers to entry due to factors like high start-up costs, exclusive control over resources, or patents, making it difficult for new firms to enter the market. Additionally, there are relatively few sellers dominating the market. \n\nHowever, it's important to note that in an oligopoly, the relationship between price (P) and marginal revenue (MR) can vary depending on the specific strategies and interactions among the firms. In some cases, firms might not have MR equal to P, especially if they are engaged in strategic pricing behavior or if their actions significantly affect market prices. Therefore, statement II is not necessarily true for all oligopolies."
