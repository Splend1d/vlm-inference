Rental real estate activities are generally considered passive unless the taxpayer materially participates in them. Material participation means that the taxpayer is involved in the management or operation of the property for more than 500 hours during the year or more than the percentage of hours involved by all participants.\n\nHowever, the amount of loss that can be deducted is limited by the amount of passive income earned by the taxpayer. If there is no passive income, then the entire loss may be carried forward to future years and deducted when passive income becomes available. \n\nFor Smith, if he actively participates in the rental real estate activities and they are considered passive, the deduction for the loss would likely be limited by his other passive income sources. Without knowing the specifics of Smith's other income, it's not possible to accurately calculate the deductible loss amount. \n\nIf Smith has no other passive income, he could potentially carry the full $40,000 loss forward to future years. However, since the question asks about what amount Smith may deduct in determining taxable income, and we do not have information on other passive income sources, the answer cannot be definitively provided based on the information given. \n\nGiven the options:\n\nA. $0 - This option is not correct because Smith does have losses from rental real estate activities.\nB. $15,000 - This is not necessarily correct without additional context about Smith's passive income.\nC. $20,000 - This is also not necessarily correct without additional context about Smith's passive income.\nD. $40,000 - This would only be correct if Smith has no other passive income to offset the loss.\n\nThe correct answer cannot be determined with the information provided. In a real-world scenario, you would need Smith's total passive income to determine how much of the loss can be deducted."
