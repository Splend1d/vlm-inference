A homomorphism \\(f: G \\rightarrow H\\) between two groups \\(G\\) and \\(H\\) is said to be one-to-one ( or injective if for every \\(a, b \\in G\\), \\(f(a = f(b)\\) implies \\(a = b\\). This property is equivalent to the kernel of \\(f\\), denoted as \\(\\ker(f)\\), consisting solely of the identity element of \\(G\\). If the kernel contains any other element besides the identity, then there would exist at least two different elements in \\(G\\) that map to the same element in \\(H\\), contradicting the one-to-one nature of \\(f\\).\n\nStatement 2 is also true. The image of a group under a homomorphism can indeed have fewer elements than the original group. This is because homomorphisms do not necessarily preserve all the elements of the domain; they map elements to elements in the codomain. Given a group with 6 elements, it's possible to map all these elements to distinct elements in another group, resulting in an image of 6 elements. However, the image could also have fewer elements if some elements in the original group map to the same element in the codomain due to the properties of homomorphisms (such as closure and the preservation of the group operation).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. True, True"
