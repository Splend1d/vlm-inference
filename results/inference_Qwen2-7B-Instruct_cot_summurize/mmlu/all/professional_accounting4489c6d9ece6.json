                    "text": "The most likely successful defense in a suit alleging negligence by a CPA would be:\n\nA. Due care.\n\nIn professional liability cases, particularly those involving accountants (CPAs), the standard of care is typically established through the concept of \"due care.\" This means that the professional has exercised the level of skill and diligence that a reasonably competent professional in the same field would have under similar circumstances. The defendant CPA would need to demonstrate that they provided services with the appropriate level of care, skill, and diligence, and that any errors or omissions were not due to negligence or misconduct.\n\nThe other options listed are less likely to succeed as defenses in such a case:\n\nB. Ignorance of the law: While ignorance of the law is generally not a defense in civil cases, it may apply in criminal cases. In a negligence suit against a CPA, this defense is unlikely to hold up if the CPA's actions or inactions violated professional standards expected of CPAs.\n\nC. Lack of intent: Negligence does not require an intent to cause harm. It can result from a failure to take reasonable care, which can occur even when there was no intention to cause damage.\n\nD. Lack of mental capacity: This defense might be relevant in some cases, but it is more likely to be used in situations where the professional was incapable of understanding their duties or making sound judgments due to a mental condition. It would not automatically exonerate the CPA in a negligence suit, as the professional is still expected to perform their duties to the best of their ability given their mental state."
