The defendant acted several days after the provoking events.\n\nFor a voluntary manslaughter charge, the defendant must have acted under an \"overpowering heat of passion\" that was provoked by some adequate cause, such as assault or battery, and which resulted from the provocation. This passion must be so intense that it completely overcomes the defendant's ability to control their actions. \n\nOption A states that the defendant acted several days after the provoking events. This would not typically be considered an \"overpowering heat of passion\" since the passage of time would indicate that the defendant had time to cool off and regain control before acting. Therefore, this would not be proper proof to establish a voluntary manslaughter charge."
