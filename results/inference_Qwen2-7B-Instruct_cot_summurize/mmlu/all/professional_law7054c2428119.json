The parties agreed that the employment would be on an at-will basis. At the end of her first week of work, the employee was given a booklet entitled \"Employment Manual,\" with instructions to read the book in its entirety by the end of the following week. That evening, the employee began reading the manual. The first few pages described the history of the company and provided a personal biography of its president. On page 20, the manual stated that the company treats its employees \"as family\" and that employees will be discharged \"only with good cause. \" The employee finished reading the manual as requested. The employee interpreted the statement on page 20 as insuring continued employment unless good cause existed for termination. Over the next two months, the employee continually complained to her supervisor that the lighting in the accounting department was insufficient. Finally the supervisor, fed up with the complaints, fired the employee. The employee then sued the company, seeking to recover on grounds of promissory estoppel. Which of the following facts, if true and provable, would be most helpful for the employee's cause of action?\n\nA. At the time when the company hired the employee, the company subjectively intended that the employee be given job security.\nB. The employee interpreted the clause in the manual stating that company employees would be treated \"as family\" to mean that she would have job security and could only be fired for good cause.\nC. Just prior to receiving the manual, the employee seriously considered quitting, but continued to work for the company in reliance on the provisions contained on page 20 of the manual.\nD. The employee's complaints regarding the insufficient lighting were factually true and justifIable.\n"

The employee interpreted the clause in the manual stating that company employees would be treated \"as family\" to mean that she would have job security and could only be fired for good cause.\n\nPromissory estoppel is a legal doctrine that prevents a party from going back on a promise, especially one that has relied upon the promise to their detriment. In this case, the employee's interpretation of the \"treated as family\" phrase as implying job security and the requirement of good cause for termination aligns with the essential elements of promissory estoppel:\n\n1. **Promise**: The company made an implicit promise through the language in the Employment Manual.\n2. **Reliance**: The employee relied on this promise in making decisions (such as continuing her employment despite considering quitting.\n3. **Detriment**: The employee suffered a loss or detriment as a result of relying on the promise (in this case, the loss of job security due to the firing without good cause.\n\nTherefore, if the court accepts the employee's interpretation of the manual's language as a promise, it would support her claim under promissory estoppel."
