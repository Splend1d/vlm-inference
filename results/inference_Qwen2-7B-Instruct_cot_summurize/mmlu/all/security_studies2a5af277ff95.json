To address security from a positivist perspective, challenging the dominance of traditional security paradigms, and shifting academic attention to the individual as a referent point.\nC. To question the dominance of liberalism and realism in the international system, to apply critical knowledge to the security dilemma faced by states and to redress the power imbalances that lead to intra-state conflict.\nD. To account for all possible referent objects and expand the definition of security so far as to allow for a broadening of the school to encompass any agent that threatens those referent objects.\n"

This inclusive framework seeks to challenge and transcend conventional boundaries set by realist and liberal theories, which often focus narrowly on state security.\n\nAmong the options provided, option D best alignss with the agenda that would most likely attract scholars to this 'broad church'. This is because it advocates for an expansive definition of security that encompasses not just states but also other agents that threaten various referent objects. This approach acknowledges the complexity of contemporary security challenges, such as economic, environmental, and non-state threats, and encourages a multidisciplinary and inclusive scholarly engagement. By accounting for all possible referent objects and expanding the definition of security, this agenda promotes a more holistic understanding of security issues and fosters interdisciplinary dialogue among scholars from different fields."
