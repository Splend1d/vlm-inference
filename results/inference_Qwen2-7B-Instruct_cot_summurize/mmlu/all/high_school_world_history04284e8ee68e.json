It is surrounded by mountains and can be approached from one side only; it has no crops, trees, or water, but has reservoirs in which rainwater is collected. The Arabs often cut off the inhabitants from their supply of drinking-water until the they buy them off with money and pieces of cloth. It is an exceedingly hot place. It is the port of the Indians, and to it come large vessels from Kinbayat [Cambay], Kawlam [Quilon], Calicut and many other Malabar ports [on the south-west coast of India]. There are Indian merchants living there, as well as Egyptian merchants. Its inhabitants are all either merchants, porters, or fishermen. Some of the merchants are immensely rich, so rich that sometimes a single merchant is sole owner of a large ship with all it contains, and this is a subject of ostentation and rivalry amongst them. In spite of that they are pious, humble, upright, and generous in character, treat strangers well, give liberally to devotees, and pay in full the tithes due to God.\"\nIbn Battuta, ca. 1325\u20131354 C.E.\nWhich of the following led directly to the development of the economic system described in the journal?\n\nA. Military campaigns\nB. Meteorological phenomena\nC. Competition with European trade networks\nD. The presence of highly developed port cities\n"

The presence of merchants from various regions ( Indians, Egyptians, and local Arab traders, along with the specifics of trade routes, suggests a thriving commerce network.\n\nGiven the context, the option that most directly led to the development of this economic system would be:\n\nD. The presence of highly developed port cities\n\nThis is because the existence of well-developed ports like Aden facilitates trade by providing a secure location for ships to dock, enabling the exchange of goods, and supporting logistical operations such as storage and transportation. The presence of such a port city would naturally attract traders and merchants, leading to the establishment of a robust trading network.\n\nOptions A ( Military campaigns, B Meteorological phenomena, and C Competition with European trade networks do not directly lead to the development of the described economic system based on the information provided. Military campaigns might influence trade routes, meteorological phenomena could affect shipping and trade logistics, and competition with European trade networks is a separate historical phenomenon that occurred centuries later during the Age of Exploration."
