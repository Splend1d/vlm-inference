At the criminal trial, the prosecutor called a witness who had participated in the scheme with the defendant. The witness testified about the operation of the scheme and was cross-examined by the defendant's attorney. The case resulted in a mistrial. An investor who was allegedly defrauded by the scheme has now brought a civil action against the defendant. She seeks to introduce the witness's testimony from the criminal trial. The witness has testimony from the criminal trial. The witness has moved to a foreign country. Is the witness's testimony in the criminal trial admissible in the civil action?\n\nA. No, because the burden of proof in a criminal action is different from the burden of proof in a civil action.\nB. No, because the parties are not identical in the two actions.\nC. Yes, because it is prior testimony of an unavailable declarant.\nD. Yes, but only if the investor demonstrates that she was unable to obtain the testimony of the witness by deposition.\n"

Yes, because it is prior testimony of an unavailable declarant.\n\nIn the United States legal system, when a witness becomes unavailable for a subsequent proceeding, their prior testimony can be admitted as evidence under certain circumstances. This is allowed under Federal Rule of Evidence 804(b)(1), which states that a statement made by a witness at a hearing or other proceeding, or in a deposition taken before the court, is admissible if:\n\n1. The party against whom the statement is offered had an opportunity and similar motive to develop the testimony by direct, cross, or redirect examination;\n2. The statement was made under oath or affirmation;\n3. The statement is consistent with the declarant's testimony in the prior proceeding, or the statement's absence from the prior proceeding is explained or the circumstances attending its making raise no substantial doubt concerning its trustworthiness; and\n4. Admitting the statement is not unfair to the party against whom it is offered.\n\nIn this scenario, the witness testified during the criminal trial, which meets the first three conditions. Since the witness has moved to a foreign country and cannot be compelled to testify again, they meet the fourth condition as well. Therefore, their testimony from the criminal trial should be admissible in the civil action as prior testimony of an unavailable declarant."
