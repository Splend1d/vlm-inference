Jefferson was very tall, six feet two-and-a-half inches in height; sandy-complexioned; shy in manner, seeming cold; awkward in attitude, and with little in his bearing that suggested command.\u2026 His skin was thin, peeling from his face on exposure to the sun, giving it a tettered appearance. This sandy face, with hazel eyes and sunny aspect; this loose, shackling person; this rambling and often brilliant conversation, belonged to the controlling influences of American history, more necessary to the story than three-fourths of the official papers, which only hid the truth. Jefferson's personality during these eight years appeared to be the government, and impressed itself, like that of Bonaparte, although by a different process, on the mind of the nation. In the village simplicity of Washington, he was more than a king, for he was alone in social as well as in political pre-eminence. Except the British Legation, no house in Washington was open to general society; the whole mass of politicians, even the Federalists, were dependent on Jefferson and \"The Palace\" for amusement; and if they refused to go there, they \"lived like bears, brutalized and stupefied.\"\n\u2014Henry Adams, History of the United States During the Administration of Thomas Jefferson, 1889\nAlthough Jefferson believed that government should be small and limited, once in office he\n\nA. created a spoils system that bloated the size of the bureaucracy\nB. laid the foundations of the welfare state\nC. called for an ambitious program of road building and public works\nD. vigorously exercised federal power in foreign affairs\n"

He initiated several significant diplomatic and military actions that had a substantial impact on U.S. foreign policy. \n\nFor example, Jefferson dispatched James Madison and Robert R. Livingston to France in 1785 to negotiate the Louisiana Purchase, one of the most significant territorial acquisitions in U.S. history. He also supported the Lewis and Clark Expedition, which aimed to explore the newly acquired territory and establish trade relations with Native American tribes.\n\nIn addition, Jefferson engaged in the Quasi-War with France ( (1798\u20131800), which involved naval battles and a blockade of American ports, in response to French actions against American shipping and interference with American neutrality. This conflict strained relations between the United States and France and highlighted the challenges of maintaining foreign policy independence for a young nation.\n\nFurthermore, Jefferson played a key role in the negotiation of the Adams-On\u00eds Treaty ( (1819), which ceded Florida to the United States and established the boundary between the U.S. and Spanish territories in the West. This treaty significantly expanded the territory under U.S. control.\n\nThus, while Jefferson may have advocated for a smaller government in theory, his actions in office demonstrate that he was willing to use federal power assertively in foreign affairs when he perceived the national interest to require it."
