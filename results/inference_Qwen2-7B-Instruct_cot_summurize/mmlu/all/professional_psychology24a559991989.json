Adverse impact in personnel selection refers to a situation where the total selection process results in unequal outcomes for one or more groups covered by law. This typically occurs when a particular group is selected at a significantly lower rate compared to another group, even after adjusting for job-related criteria. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) uses a 80% rule as a guideline to determine if there might be adverse impact, meaning that a protected group (e.g., based on race, gender, age, etc.) is being not being hired, promoted, or otherwise selected for a job opportunity at a rate that is less than 80% of the rate for the group that is most represented in the applicant pool. This does not necessarily mean that the selection process is \"bad\" or \"unfair\", but rather that there may be an issue with the selection criteria or process that disproportionately affects certain groups."
