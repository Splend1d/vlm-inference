She brought a Title VII civil rights action in federal court for gender discrimination against the employer. At trial, a former co-worker of the woman was not allowed to testify that she heard the human relations manager saying in an informal meeting that the plaintiff and her predecessor were both fired due to what the manager described as \"pregnancy complications.\" The proposed witness had been a vice-president of the company and a close adviser to the president. Without the benefit of that vital testimony, the jury entered a verdict for the defendant employer. On appeal, the plaintiff argued that the testimony should have been allowed and that it was not hearsay under the federal rules. Will the court likely grant the appeal, and order a new trial?\n\nA. No, because the statement is clearly hearsay with no exception to the hearsay rule being applicable.\nB. No, because it was based on things that the co-worker heard from others, making double-hearsay that is never admissible.\nC. Yes, because that kind of testimony is reliable and not excludable as hearsay.\nD. Yes, because it was admissible under the \"spontaneous utterance\" exception to the hearsay rules.\n"

No, because the statement is clearly hearsay with no exception to the hearsay rule being applicable.\n\nIn this case, the statement made by the human relations manager describing the firings as \"pregnancy complications\" would indeed be considered hearsay. Hearsay refers to out-of-court statements offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. In order for the statement to be admissible, there must be an exception to the hearsay rule that applies. None of the exceptions provided by the Federal Rules of Evidence seem to fit the situation here. The statement was made informally, out of court, and was not made under circumstances that would qualify as any recognized exception ( such as for present sense impressions, business records, or declarations against interest, among others.\n\nWithout more context or evidence that might fall under one of these exceptions, the court is unlikely to find that the statement should have been admitted into evidence. Therefore, the correct answer is A: No, because the statement is clearly hearsay with no exception to the hearsay rule being applicable."
