The electro-magnetic pulse occurs when gamma radiation interacts with matter (the atmosphere), \"the Compton effect.\" EMP produces a high voltage charge, harmless to humans but destructive to electronic systems. EMP effects are maximized at high altitude. However thermal-light pulse can produce flash blindness, retinal burn, and fire whilst the airburst can cause severe skin burns.\nB. A nuclear detonation produces a shockwave resulting from a rise in atmospheric pressure and dynamic overpressure sufficient to destroy concrete structures. Blast effects were generally used by military planners to calculate casualty rates in a nuclear attack: It was estimated that 50 percent living in a five mile radius of a one-mgt airburst would be killed or wounded by blast effects.\nC. Nuclear reactions in the initial nuclear detonation or the fallout can cause radiation poisoning, as irradiated debris is picked up by the nuclear fireball and lofted into the atmosphere. A dirty bomb uses chemical high-explosive to disperse radioactive material, relying on radiation to produce a lethal effect. Panic set off by even a limited dispersion of radioactive material might be more costly in terms of the disruption it causes than actual casualties or damage to property produced by a dirty bomb detonation; some observers believe that the blast itself causes the greatest amount of damage.\nD. All of the above\n"

All of the above\n\nNuclear weapons have significant and devastating effects across multiple domains:\n\n1. **EMP (** An electromagnetic pulse (EMP) results from a nuclear explosion and can occur both from the initial burst and from secondary effects such as the interaction of gamma rays with matter in the atmosphere. This can disrupt or damage electronic systems within a wide area, including critical infrastructure, communication networks, and even some electrical appliances.\n\n2. **Thermal-Light Pulse and Airburst Effects:** When a nuclear weapon explodes near the ground, it produces a thermal-light pulse that can cause flash blindness, retinal burns, and fires. Additionally, an airburst\u2014a detonation above ground level\u2014can result in severe skin burns due to the intense heat generated.\n\n3. **Blast Effects:** The shockwave created by a nuclear detonation leads to a rapid rise in atmospheric pressure and dynamic overpressure. This can destroy concrete structures and lead to widespread destruction of buildings and infrastructure. Military planners often use blast effects to estimate casualty rates in a nuclear attack.\n\n4. **Radiation Poisoning:** The nuclear reactions during the initial detonation and in the fallout produce ionizing radiation. Exposure to this radiation can cause radiation poisoning, leading to acute radiation syndrome (which can be fatal if not treated promptly. Fallout also poses long-term risks to human health and the environment.\n\n5. **Psychological Effects:** The psychological impact of a nuclear event includes panic, mass hysteria, and widespread fear. These effects can lead to societal collapse, economic disruption, and other indirect consequences that may be more costly than the direct physical damage caused by the explosion.\n\n6. **Environmental Impact:** Nuclear explosions release large amounts of radioactive materials into the atmosphere and onto the ground. These materials can contaminate water sources, soil, and vegetation, affecting ecosystems and posing long-term health risks to humans and wildlife.\n\n7. **Economic Consequences:** The destruction of critical infrastructure, loss of life, and the costs associated with cleanup and recovery efforts can lead to massive economic losses. These impacts can ripple through economies globally, affecting trade, finance, and international relations.\n\nIn summary, the effects of nuclear weapons are multifaceted, encompassing physical, environmental, psychological, and economic dimensions that can have far-reaching and enduring consequences."
