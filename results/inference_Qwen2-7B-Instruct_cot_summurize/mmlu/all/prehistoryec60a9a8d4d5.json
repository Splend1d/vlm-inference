Crete was populated by Greeks and others, but Minoan culture was a local development.\n\nThe Minoan civilization developed on the island of Crete without any direct evidence suggesting colonization from Egypt. The term \"Minoa\" was used by the ancient Egyptians to refer to the island of Crete, but this does not imply colonization or direct influence from Egypt. Instead, archaeological findings indicate that the Minoans had their own unique culture, which flourished in the Aegean region between about 3000 and 1400 BCE. This culture was characterized by advanced urban planning, monumental architecture, such as the palace of Knossos, and a sophisticated system of trade that extended across the Mediterranean. The Minoans were known for their pottery, frescoes, and the use of a syllabic script called Linear A, which is still not fully deciphered."
