This is generally viewed as morally wrong because it involves knowingly exposing others to harm.\n\nDeleting raunchy photos of one's sister from Facebook without her consent could be seen as violating her privacy and autonomy. This action might not necessarily be illegal, but it breaches ethical standards of respecting personal boundaries and consent. Therefore, it is considered morally wrong under ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020."
