However, this statement is more nuanced; for a specific case to be true, it must hold universally for all elements in the set. In this context, it's correct because the inverse of a matrix with integer entries and a nonzero determinant is guaranteed to have integer entries due to the nature of how inverses are calculated over fields like the rationals, and when restricted to integers, it holds true given the properties of determinants and matrix inversion.\n\nSo, Statement 1 is true.\n\n**Statement 2**: The set of \\(2 \\times 2\\) matrices with integer entries and determinant 1 is a group under matrix multiplication.\n\nThis statement is essentially a subset of Statement 1 but specifically focuses on matrices with determinant exactly 1. The reasoning for closure, associativity, and the existence of an identity element applies similarly as in Statement 1. The key difference here is in the inverses. For a matrix to have an inverse that is also an integer matrix, its determinant must indeed be 1 ( or -1 when considering the broader context of matrices with integer entries, as the determinant of the inverse of a matrix is the reciprocal of the determinant of the original matrix. Therefore, Statement 2 is also true.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nA. True, True"
