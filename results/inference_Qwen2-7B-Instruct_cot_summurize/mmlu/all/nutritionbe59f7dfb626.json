Absorption of fatty acids in the intestine occurs mainly through FABP and FAT/CD36 transport proteins in the enterocytes of the distal duodenum\nB. After absorption, medium chain triglycerides (MCT) enter the lymphatic system, whereas long chain triglycerides enter the portal blood system.\nC. The products of partial digestion of triglycerides (triacylglycerols) can form mixed micelles with pancreatic cholesterol and phospholipids and this increases absorption\nD. Triglycerides (triacylglycerols) must be emulsified and digested before the fatty acids can be transported\n"

Fat digestion begins in the stomach where lipases start to break down fats, but most of the action happens in the small intestine. Bile salts, produced by the liver and stored in the gallbladder, help to emulsify the fats into smaller droplets, increasing the surface area for enzymes to work on. Pancreatic lipase then breaks down the larger triglycerides into their component fatty acids and glycerol. These fatty acids and glycerol are then absorbed through the intestinal wall, not primarily through FABP and FAT/CD36 transport proteins as stated in option A, and are not distinguished by whether they originated from medium or long chain triglycerides as suggested in option B. Option C describes a part of the process but does not specifically address digestion or absorption."
