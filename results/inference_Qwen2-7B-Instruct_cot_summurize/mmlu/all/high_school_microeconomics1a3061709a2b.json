A superstar basketball player's $50 million earnings can be considered an example of an economic rent if the player owns some unique and scarce resource, such as exceptional athletic talent, that generates this high income.\n\nB. Social Security retirement income is not an example of economic rent because it is a government-provided benefit, not a payment for the use of a scarce resource.\n\nC. A welfare payment from social services is also not an example of economic rent; it is typically provided to those in need based on eligibility criteria, not as compensation for the use of a scarce resource.\n\nD. A check to a college student from a parent or guardian might be considered a form of economic rent if the parent's wealth is derived from a scarce resource, but the payment itself does not involve the use of that resource by the student.\n\nTherefore, option A is the most accurate answer among the given options, assuming the basketball player's earnings come from their unique skill set which is a scarce resource."
