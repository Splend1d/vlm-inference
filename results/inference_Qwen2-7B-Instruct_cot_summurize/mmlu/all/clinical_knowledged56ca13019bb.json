Unilateral fixed dilated pupil.\n\nThis represents a third cranial nerve (oculomotor nerve) palsy, which can be a neurosurgical emergency due to the potential for a mass in the orbit compressing the nerve. The presence of a unilateral fixed dilated pupil suggests a loss of pupillary light reflex on one side, a classic sign of oculomotor nerve palsy."
