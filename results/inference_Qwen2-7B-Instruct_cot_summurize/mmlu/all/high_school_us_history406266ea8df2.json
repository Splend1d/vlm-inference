Moreover, I am cognizant of the interrelatedness of all communities and states. I cannot sit idly by in Atlanta and not be concerned about what happens in Birmingham. Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly affects all indirectly. Never again can we afford to live with the narrow, provincial 'outside agitator' idea. Anyone who lives inside the United States can never be considered an outsider anywhere in this country. . . .\"\n\u2014Martin Luther King, Jr., \"Letter from a Birmingham Jail,\" April 16, 1963\nOn which of these documents is Susan B.

The Declaration of Independence includes the phrase \"all men are created equal\" and asserts that governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed. Anthony and other suffragists argued that if all individuals were created equal and had the right to govern themselves, then women should have the same rights as men, including the right to vote. This was a central argument in the women's suffrage movement in the United States during the late 19th and early 20th centuries."
