Highly centralized economies: The Indus Valley Civilization had a well-organized economy with a clear division of labor. There were signs of trade networks that connected various parts of the region, and there is evidence of specialized crafts like pottery, textiles, and metalworking.\n\nB. Carefully planned and designed cities: The cities of this civilization were laid out with a grid-like pattern, which indicates a high degree of urban planning. They included well-designed drainage systems, public baths, and streets lined with brick houses.\n\nC. Standardized weights and measures: The use of standardized units for weights and measures suggests a sophisticated system of trade and commerce. This system allowed for easier exchange of goods and services across the civilization.\n\nThese characteristics demonstrate the advanced nature of the Indus Valley Civilization and its level of organization and sophistication."
