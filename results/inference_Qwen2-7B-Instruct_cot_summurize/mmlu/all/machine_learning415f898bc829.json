                    "text": "The K-means clustering algorithm is a popular unsupervised learning technique used for partitioning a given dataset into a set of clusters. Here's a brief explanation of each option you've listed:\n\nA. **Requires the dimension of the feature space to be no bigger than the number of samples**: This statement is incorrect. The K-means algorithm does not have such a requirement. It can work with datasets having dimensions much higher than the number of samples. However, it may face challenges in high-dimensional spaces due to the curse of dimensionality, which affects the performance of the algorithm.\n\nB. **Has the smallest value of the objective function when K = 1**: This statement is correct. When K = 1, the objective function ( typically the sum of squared distances between each point and the centroid of its assigned cluster, is minimized because every data point is considered its own cluster ( and thus the distance from each point to itself is zero.\n\nC. **Minimizes the within class variance for a given number of clusters**: This statement is also correct. One of the main objectives of the K-means algorithm is to minimize the within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS), which can be interpreted as minimizing the within-class variance under the assumption that clusters are spherical and isotropic.\n\nD. **Converges to the global optimum if and only if the initial means are chosen as some of the samples themselves**: This statement is incorrect. While initializing the centroids with some of the sample points might lead to better results compared to random initialization, K-means does not necessarily converge to the global optimum even if centroids are initialized as some of the samples. The reason is that K-means is prone to getting stuck in local minima. The outcome depends on the choice of initial centroids, data distribution, and other factors. There are no guarantees about convergence to the global optimum regardless of how centroids are initialized.\n\nIn summary:\n- A: Incorrect.\n- B: Correct.\n- C: Correct.\n- D: Incorrect."
