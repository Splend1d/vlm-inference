Sell bonds, Decreases, Decreases, Unemployment\n\nWhen the central bank decides to increase the federal funds rate, it typically does so by selling bonds in the open market (OMO). This action decreases the money supply (MONEY SUPPLY), which in turn reduces aggregate demand (AD). By decreasing aggregate demand, the economy can move closer to full employment, as this helps to reduce unemployment levels without causing excessive inflation."
