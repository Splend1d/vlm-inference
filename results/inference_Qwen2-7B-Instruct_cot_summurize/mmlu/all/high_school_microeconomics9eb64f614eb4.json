                    "text": "The correct answer is C. In monopolistic competition, firms spend money to differentiate and advertise their products. This is because in monopolistic competition, there are many sellers offering similar but slightly differentiated products. Each firm tries to distinguish its product from others through branding, advertising, or product features, which allows it to charge a slightly higher price than its competitors.\n\nLet's examine the other options:\n\nA. Firms earn long-run economic profits: This is generally not true for monopolistically competitive firms. Over time, new firms will enter the market if they see an opportunity to make economic profits, increasing competition and driving down prices until firms only earn normal profits ( i.e., enough to cover all costs including opportunity cost.\n\nB. P = MR = MC = ATC: This statement refers to conditions for profit maximization in a perfectly competitive market, where firms sell identical products, have no control over the market price, and face a horizontal demand curve. Monopolistically competitive firms do not operate under these conditions.\n\nD. In the long run, the market is allocatively efficient: Allocative efficiency occurs when resources are are allocated in such a way that it is impossible to reallocate them to make one individual better off without making someone else worse off. While monopolistic competition can lead to some inefficiencies due to product differentiation, the market is not necessarily allocatively efficient in the long run. The presence of product differentiation can lead to overproduction of certain goods, as firms aim to capture market share rather than producing at the socially optimal level."
