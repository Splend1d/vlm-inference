They can indicate an increased risk, which may then lead to further testing like amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling (CVS) for confirmation.\n\nA. Amniocentesis and B. Chorion villus sampling (CVS) are both invasive procedures used to diagnose neural tube defects with high accuracy.\n\nD. Ultrasonography is also not listed as a technique of no value for diagnosing neural tube defects, but it is often used as a first-line screening method during pregnancy to detect these defects."
