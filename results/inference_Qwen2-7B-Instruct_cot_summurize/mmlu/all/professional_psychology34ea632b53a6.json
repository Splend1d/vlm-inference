Reward and legitimate forms of power.\n\nReward power refers to the ability to give rewards or benefits, such as promotions, raises, or recognition, which can influence others' behavior and decisions. Legitimate power is derived from an individual's position or role within an organization or society, such as being a manager, leader, or having expertise in a particular field. Both forms are crucial in consulting relationships because consultants often need to persuade clients to adopt their recommendations or solutions, which can be facilitated by offering incentives (reward power) and leveraging their position or expertise (legitimate power)."
