                    "text": "The correct answer is C. highly sensitive nerve endings.\n\nDuring menstruation, the uterus contracts to help shed the lining (endometrium) that was not used during the previous menstrual cycle. These contractions can cause pain and discomfort, which is commonly referred to as menstrual cramps or dysmenorrhea. The sensitivity of the nerve endings in the uterus increases during this time, which can amplify the sensation of these contractions leading to pain.\n\nIt's important to note that the other options provided do not accurately describe the primary causes of menstrual cramps:\n\nA. Low levels of prostaglandin: Prostaglandins are substances produced by the body that can cause smooth muscle contractions, including those in the uterus. During menstruation, there is often an increase in prostaglandin levels, which can contribute to cramping.\n\nB. An increased oxygen supply to the uterus: While an adequate oxygen supply is necessary for all bodily functions, an increase in oxygen supply is not typically associated with the development of menstrual cramps.\n\nD. Frequent masturbation: Masturbation does not directly cause menstrual cramps. However, engaging in any physical activity can sometimes exacerbate pre-existing cramps if it involves movements that stimulate the pelvic area."
