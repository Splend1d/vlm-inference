This is because by continuing production, the firm can cover its variable costs and contribute to covering some of its fixed costs, which is better than shutting down and incurring only its fixed costs. Shutting down would only be considered if the price falls below the average variable cost, making it impossible to cover those variable costs even while producing ( option A is incorrect. Option B is also incorrect because for a profit-maximizing firm, it should continue operating as long as marginal revenue (MR > marginal cost (MC, regardless of whether MR equals MC or not. Option D is incorrect because it suggests that the firm should continue operating as long as average variable cost (AVC < average fixed cost AFC, which is not necessarily true for a profit-maximizing firm in the short run."
