But we do not have the right to resort to violence\u2014or the threat of violence\u2014when we don't get our way. Our founders constructed a system of government so that reason could prevail over fear. Oklahoma City proved once again that without the law there is no freedom. Criticism is part of the lifeblood of democracy. No one is right all the time. But we should remember that there is a big difference between criticizing a policy or a politician and demonizing the government that guarantees our freedoms and the public servants who enforce our laws.\"\nPresident Bill Clinton, \"What We Learned in Oklahoma City,\" 2010\n(Written on the 15th anniversary of the Oklahoma City bombing)\n\"If there would not have been a Waco, I would have put down roots somewhere and not been so unsettled with the fact that my government\u2026was a threat to me. Everything that Waco implies was on the forefront of my thoughts. That sort of guided my path for the next couple of years.\"\nTimothy McVeigh, Oklahoma City bomber, 2001\nU.S. Representative John Conyers, Events Surrounding the Branch Davidian Cult Standoff in Waco, Texas: Hearing Before the Committee on the Judiciary, House of Representatives, 1993\nIn the third excerpt, Representative Conyers refers to \"Wounded Knee\" as an example of\n\nA. a violent cult\nB. a federal misuse of power\nC. the site of a bombing\nD. a recent conflict between federal agents and Lakota Indians\n"

This event occurred when the U.S. Army attempted to disarm a group of Lakota, leading to a tragic confrontation. Representative John Conyers may have referenced this historical event in his context to discuss issues related to federal intervention and potential misuse of power in dealings with Native American communities. The mention of \"Wounded Knee\" serves as a historical reference to emphasize concerns about similar situations potentially happening in the present, such as the standoff at Waco."
