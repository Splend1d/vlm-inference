The increase in blood glucose concentration after consuming the food compared with that after consuming an equivalent amount of white bread. \n\nThe Glycemic Index (GI) is a ranking system for carbohydrates based on their effect on blood sugar levels. It measures how quickly and how high carbohydrate foods can raise blood glucose levels. Foods with a GI of 55 or less are generally considered low GI, while those with a GI of 70 or more are are considered high GI. This ranking is typically done by comparing the effect of a food to a reference food like white bread, which has a GI of approximately 80."
