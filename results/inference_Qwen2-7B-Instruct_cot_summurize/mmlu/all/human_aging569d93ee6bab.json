Control: This level refers to the degree to which an individual feels in control of their environment and actions.\n2. Identity: This level involves an individual's sense of self, including their beliefs, values, and goals that shape who they are and how they perceive themselves.\n3. Generativity: This level focuses on the extent to which an individual feels a need to contribute to the well-being of others and future generations through work or family life.\n4. Assimilation: This level pertains to an individual's ability to integrate new experiences and information into their existing cognitive framework.\n\nTherefore, Identity is one of McAdam's levels of personality."
