His concept of status is misrepresented.\n\nThe aphorism \"the movement of progressive societies has hitherto been a movement from Status to Contract\" by Maine refers to the transition in legal and social structures from one based on status (which is largely determined by birth or tradition, such as noble lineage or caste systems - to one based on contract, where rights and obligations are more freely agreed upon and negotiated between individuals. This does not mean it is a prediction, nor does it imply literal application, nor does it suggest his idea is considered inapplicable to Western legal systems. Instead, it points out a historical trend in societal development, particularly in European and North American contexts. Misinterpretation often occurs when people overlook the historical context and the nuanced meaning of \"status\" versus \"contract.\""
