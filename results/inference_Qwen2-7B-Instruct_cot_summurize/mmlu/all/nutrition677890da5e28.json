Antioxidants typically refer to substances that protect cells from damage caused by reactive oxygen species ( (ROS). Vitamin D, on the other hand, plays roles such as regulating the absorption of calcium and phosphorus, promoting normal immune system function, supporting bone health, and influencing the expression of genes related to cell growth and survival. It is fat-soluble, but its primary functions do not include being an antioxidant in cell membranes."
