The surgeon was assisted by a nurse who was assigned to the operation by the hospital. During the patient's early convalescence, he complained of pain not explicable as an ordinary post-operative symptom. On investigation, it turned out that the surgeon, who had bandaged him following the operation, had done so in such a manner as to constrict certain blood vessels. The faulty bandaging had caused acute pain and retarded the patient's recovery. After the patient's eventual recovery, he sued the surgeon for malpractice, claiming $25,000 in damages. In his case-in-chief, the patient called the nurse to testifS' that shortly after the surgery, she saw the surgeon destroy the postoperative x-rays of the patient's abdomen. Upon objection by the surgeon's attorney, the trial judge should rule the nurse's testimony\n\nA. admissible, provided that the judge determines that the surgeon destroyed the x-rays as a cover-up.\nB. admissible, but leave the weight of the nurse's testimony to be determined by the jury.\nC. inadmissible, because the probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.\nD. inadmissible, because it is extrinsic evidence of a collateral matter.\n"

                    "text": "D. inadmissible, because it is extrinsic evidence of a collateral matter.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe nurse's testimony about the surgeon destroying the postoperative x-rays would likely be considered extrinsic evidence of a collateral matter. This is because the primary issue in the lawsuit is the surgeon's alleged malpractice during the appendectomy and the subsequent complications. The destruction of the x-rays might suggest that the surgeon was attempting to hide something or cover up negligence, but it does not directly address the medical issues related to the patient's treatment or the alleged malpractice during the surgery itself.\n\nTo be admissible, evidence must be relevant to the case. While the destruction of the x-rays could potentially be relevant to the question of whether the surgeon acted with intent to conceal or was negligent in their actions post-surgery, it does not necessarily connect back to the core issue of whether the surgeon's actions during the surgery were medically negligent.\n\nTherefore, the judge should likely rule this testimony inadmissible under rules of evidence that exclude evidence which is not relevant to the case at hand. However, if the judge decides to allow the testimony, it should be closely scrutinized to ensure that its probative value ( the ability to prove something important about the case) outweighs any prejudicial effect it may have on the jury. If the judge decides to admit the testimony, they may provide instructions to the jury regarding how to consider this evidence carefully and avoid letting it lead them astray from the main issues of the case."
