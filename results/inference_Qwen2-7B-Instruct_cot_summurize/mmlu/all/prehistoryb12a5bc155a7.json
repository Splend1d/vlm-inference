It laid the groundwork for many aspects of Chinese civilization, including the development of writing, art, and social structures, which continued to evolve over subsequent centuries. However, it's important to note that the influence of Shang Dynasty culture extended well beyond its own time period, with elements of its civilization being incorporated into succeeding dynasties' practices. Therefore, while the direct development might not have lasted until the 17th century, the foundational concepts and technologies certainly did."
