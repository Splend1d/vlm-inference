Bunnies are herbivores and require a diet rich in hay, fresh vegetables, and sometimes supplements to maintain their health. Feeding them a vegan diet could lead to malnutrition, health issues, and possibly death. This action can be seen as neglectful and harmful, which goes against ordinary moral standards.\n\nIn scenario 2, playing the trumpet quietly while your parents are sleeping might be disruptive if you know that they are sensitive to noise or need a quiet environment for rest or other activities. However, without any evidence suggesting that this action caused significant harm or disturbance to others, it can be considered less morally wrong. In many contexts, especially at home, certain activities might be allowed during specific times (like late at night) if done with consideration for others' needs."
