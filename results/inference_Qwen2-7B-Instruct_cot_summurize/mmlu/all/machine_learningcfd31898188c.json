Decrease variance\n\nAveraging the output of multiple decision trees (a technique often used in ensemble learning methods such as Random Forest or Bagging, helps to decrease variance. This is because individual decision trees can be quite sensitive to small fluctuations in the training data, leading to high variance and overfitting. By averaging their predictions, the ensemble method reduces the impact of any single tree's idiosyncrasies, resulting in a more stable and robust model."
