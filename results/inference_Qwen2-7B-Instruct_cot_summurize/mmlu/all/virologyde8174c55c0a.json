This capsid contains the viral RNA genome and associated proteins. The outer layer of the virus, known as the envelope, is derived from the host cell's membrane and gives the virus its distinctive crown-like appearance under electron microscopy, hence the name \"corona\" ( which translates to \"crown\" in Latin. \n\nThe envelope itself is not static; it can vary in thickness and composition. It contains glycoproteins, most notably the Spike ( or S protein, which sticks out like 'club-shaped' spikes and plays a critical role in the virus's ability to bind to and enter host cells. These spikes are actually complex structures made up of two subunits, S1 and S2, which enable the virus to attach to and fuse with the host cell membrane.\n\nSo in summary, coronaviruses have a core capsid made of protein, enclosed within a lipid envelope that contains glycoproteins such as the spike protein, giving them their characteristic crown-like shape."
