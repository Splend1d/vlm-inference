This can lead to prolonged deliberation and increased scrutiny during the confirmation process, potentially causing delays in confirming nominees such as ambassadors. While all of these options can occur under certain circumstances, option D is the most directly associated with the typical functioning of a divided government in the context of executive-legislative relations."
