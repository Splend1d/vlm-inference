This is due to the presence of lone pairs on the oxygen atoms which can be delocalized through resonance. \n\nHere's one possible resonance structure:\n```\n  O-H\n / \\\nH-O-H\n \\ /\n  O-H\n```\n\nAnd here's another possible resonance structure:\n```\n  O-H\n /   \\\nH-O-H\n \\   /\n  H-O\n```\n\nBoth structures contribute to the overall structure of water and help to stabilize the molecule by delocalizing the electron density away from the oxygen atoms and hydrogen atoms. The actual structure is a hybrid of these two forms, with the electrons distributed in such a way as to minimize the repulsion between them."
