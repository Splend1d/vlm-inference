Wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation: In Scenario 1, following someone into a fitting room without permission is considered a clear violation of privacy and personal boundaries, which is generally regarded as morally wrong. This action can be perceived as creepy, disrespectful, and potentially harmful to the individual's feelings or safety.\n\nIn Scenario 2, copying a single page from a library book for personal use and then returning the book is not necessarily morally wrong under ordinary US moral standards. While it might be considered an infringement of copyright law and a violation of library policies, it does not typically involve harm to another person or breach of trust in the same way that Scenario 1 does. It could be seen as unethical, but not necessarily morally wrong in the sense of causing direct harm or violation of someone else's rights. However, it would be considered a breach of legal and ethical norms regarding property and intellectual rights."
