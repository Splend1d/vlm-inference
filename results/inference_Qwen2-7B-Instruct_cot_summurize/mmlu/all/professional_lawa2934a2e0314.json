The man's possession has at all times complied with the requirements of the applicable adverse possession statute in effect. Twelve years after the man took possession, the woman died intestate, leaving her six-year-old son as her only surviving heir. Nine years after the woman's death, when the son was 15, the son's guardian discovered that the man was in possession of the tract. Assume that the statutory period of adverse possession is 20 years and the age of majority is 18. Which of the following correctly describes the state of title to the tract?\n\nA. The man has acquired title by adverse possession.\nB. The man will not acquire title unless he continues in adverse possession for an additional three years, or until the son reaches the age of 18.\nC. The man will not acquire title unless he continues in adverse possession for an additional eight years, making a total of 12 years after the woman's death.\nD. The man will not acquire title unless he continues in adverse possession for an additional 12years, or nine years after the son attains the ageof 18.\n"

The man has acquired title by adverse possession.\n\nHere's why:\n\n- Adverse possession requires meeting certain conditions, such as open and notorious possession, exclusive possession, and continuous possession for a statutory period.\n- In this scenario, the man has been in possession of the property for twelve years before the woman's death, which is less than the required 20-year statutory period for adverse possession. However, upon the woman's death, the property passed to her son as the heir.\n- Since the son was only six years old at his mother's death, he would not have reached the age of majority (18 until 12 years later (making him 15 years old when the guardian discovers the man's possession.\n- The fact that the son's guardian discovers the man's possession does not affect the man's claim to the property under the law of adverse possession. The man has already met the possession requirement of the adverse possession statute for twelve years before the woman's death.\n- Therefore, as long as the man continues to possess the property openly, notoriously, exclusively, and continuously, he will eventually acquire title to the tract after the full 20-year statutory period has elapsed from the date the woman first lost possession to the man. This means the man's possession must continue for an additional eight years, bringing the total to 20 years from the initial date of possession by the man."
