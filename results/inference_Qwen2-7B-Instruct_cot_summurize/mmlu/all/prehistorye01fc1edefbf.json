It allowed populations to grow larger than what was possible in nomadic societies and supported a more diverse social structure.\n\n2. **Specialists**: In a civilization, people began to specialize in different tasks such as farming, trade, construction, and various crafts. This specialization increased efficiency and productivity and contributed to the development of complex societies.\n\n3. **Urban Settlements**: Civilizations typically developed centralized areas with large populations, which were characterized by cities with distinct roles such as administration, trade, and cultural activities.\n\n4. **System of Record Keeping**: This includes methods like writing systems (such as cuneiform, hieroglyphics, or alphabets, which allowed for the recording of laws, transactions, historical events, and other important information. This was crucial for managing large populations and complex societies.\n\nThe other options either include elements that are not universally present in all civilizations ( ( B: a standing army, artwork, and a system of plumbing; C: monumental architecture, religious buildings, and museums; D: museums, libraries, monumental architecture, and artwork) or are incomplete in representing the core aspects of civilizations ( (B, C, and D)."
