                    "text": "Monetarist theory, primarily advocated by economists like Milton Friedman, emphasizes the role of monetary policy conducted by central banks, particularly the Federal Reserve (FED in the U.S., in influencing economic conditions. Here's how each option align with Monetarist thought:\n\nA. The FED should actively conduct monetary policy.\n\nMonetarists believe that the central bank can and should actively manage the money supply to achieve economic stability. They argue that controlling the growth rate of the money supply is crucial for stabilizing the economy, as it helps maintain price stability and full employment without causing inflation or deflation.\n\nD. The FED should allow the money supply to grow at a constant rate.\n\nThis statement aligns more closely with Monetarist theory than option A. Monetarists often advocate for a rule-based approach to monetary policy, where the money supply grows at a steady, predictable rate. This approach is intended to provide a stable environment for the economy, allowing market forces to operate efficiently and minimizing the risk of inflation or recession caused by unexpected changes in the money supply.\n\nOptions B and C are less aligned with Monetarist theory:\n\nB. Changes in the money supply do not have significant effects.\n\nThis statement contradicts the core belief of Monetarism, which posits that changes in the money supply can have significant effects on prices and economic activity. While Monetarists might argue about the magnitude and speed of these effects, they generally agree that the money supply plays a crucial role in economic fluctuations.\n\nC. Fiscal policy is the preferred way of shifting the aggregate demand curve.\n\nMonetarists emphasize the role of monetary policy over fiscal policy. They argue that monetary policy is more effective and less prone to political interference compared to fiscal policy, which involves government spending and taxation. Thus, while Monetarists recognize the importance of both monetary and fiscal policies, their preference leans towards monetary policy as the primary tool for managing the economy.\n\nIn summary, both options A and D align more closely with Monetarist theory, with D being the most direct representation of Monetarist principles regarding the role of the FED in conducting monetary policy."
