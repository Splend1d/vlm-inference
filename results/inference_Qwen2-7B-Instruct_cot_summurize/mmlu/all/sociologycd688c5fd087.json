Among the options you've provided, option D, \"the promise of citizenship was contradicted by continued discrimination,\" captures a significant aspect of their argument. They likely contended that despite the legal gains of the Civil War and Reconstruction, which promised equal rights and citizenship, the reality on the ground was one of ongoing racial discrimination and segregation, which made it difficult for African Americans to fully integrate into the broader society.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that Warner and Myrdal's work is quite nuanced and they likely discussed multiple reasons for the persistence of ethnic differences and the uneven pace of integration. These might include historical, economic, social, and cultural factors, as well as the dynamics of power and privilege within American society."
