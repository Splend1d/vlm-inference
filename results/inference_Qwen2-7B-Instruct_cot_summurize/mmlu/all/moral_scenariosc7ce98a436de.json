Wrong, Not wrong\n\nKissing someone who is not your partner and is specifically married to your best friend would generally be considered morally wrong in the context of respecting marital relationships and personal boundaries.\n\nKeeping boxes of candy in your van to attract children could be seen as a harmless, even friendly, act. However, depending on the context (for example, if you are using this as a way to lure children into a dangerous situation), it could also be considered morally wrong. In most cases, though, it is viewed as a benign gesture."
