In other words, for any two points \\((a, f(a))\\) and \\((b, f(b))\\), the line segment connecting these points lies above or on the curve of \\(f(x)\\).\n\nWe are given two points on the function, \\((-2, 5)\\) and \\((2, 9)\\). Since \\(f(x)\\) is strictly convex, when we consider the chord connecting these two points, the curve must lie entirely below this chord between \\(-2\\) and \\(2\\).\n\nNow, let's consider the value of \\(f(1)\\). Since \\(f(x)\\) is strictly convex, and we have the points \\((-2, 5)\\) and \\((2, 9)\\), we can infer the behavior of \\(f(x)\\) between \\(-2\\) and \\(2\\). The slope of the chord from \\((-2, 5)\\) to \\((2, 9)\\) is given by:\n\n\\[m = \\frac{9 - 5}{2 - (-2)} = \\frac{4}{4} = 1\\]\n\nThis slope tells us how the function changes as \\(x\\) increases. However, because \\(f(x)\\) is strictly convex, its rate of change must increase as \\(x\\) moves away from the midpoint of \\(-2\\) and \\(2\\), which is \\(0\\). This implies that \\(f'(x) > 1\\) for \\(x\\) between \\(-2\\) and \\(2\\), where \\(f'(x)\\) is the derivative of \\(f(x)\\).\n\nGiven the points, at \\(x = 1\\), if \\(f(x)\\) were to be less than \\(8\\), it would violate the condition of strict convexity because the chord from \\((-2, 5)\\) to \\((2, 9)\\) has a slope of \\(1\\), and any value of \\(f(1)\\) less than \\(8\\) would mean that there exists a point \\(x'\\) between \\(-2\\) and \\(1\\) ( or between \\(1\\) and \\(2\\) where the slope of the tangent to the curve is greater than \\(1\\), contradicting the chord condition for strict convexity.\n\nTherefore, the smallest value \\(f(1\\) could take while still maintaining the property of strict convexity given the chord condition would be \\(8\\), but since \\(f(1\\) must be greater than any hypothetical value that would cause the chord condition to be violated, and considering the nature of convex functions, \\(f(1\\) cannot actually equal \\(8\\) without violating the strict convexity condition for some \\(x\\) in the interval \\((-2, 2)\\).\n\nThus, the range of all possible values for \\(f(1)\\) that maintains the strict convexity of \\(f(x)\\) is \\((-\\ininf, 8)\\), which corresponds to option **C.** \\(-\\infin, 8\\)**."
