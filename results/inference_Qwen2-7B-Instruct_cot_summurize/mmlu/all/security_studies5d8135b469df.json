Human security as a concept has struggled to gain recognition amongst scholars of security studies, or in the policy-making community. There is a general failure to recognise the political and academic value of human security as a concept.\nB. The concept of human security gained increasing currency in the mid-1990s, serving to highlight critical issues. In particular, the study of human society has focuses on the problem of intra-state violence, which has become the dominant issue for post-Cold War security studies.\nC. The concept of human security does not challenge traditional state-centric arguments in so far as these concern the protection of the state from external military violence. However, it does show that state-centric realism is insufficient because it does not address the security of people within states.\nD. Human security has become the dominant concept in understanding contemporary security studies. After the end of the Cold War, the state-centric security paradigm was made irrelevant and today there is a universal understanding that human beings and individuals within states should be the focal point of security.\n"

The concept of human security does not fundamentally challenge traditional state-centric arguments concerning the protection of the state from external military violence. However, it does demonstrate that state-centric realism is insufficient because it fails to address the security of individuals within states. This concept emphasizes the importance of protecting individuals from various non-military threats such as poverty, disease, and environmental degradation, thus broadening the scope of security beyond just military defense.\n\nOptions A and D are incorrect because they either suggest that human security has not gained recognition or dominance in security studies, which is not accurate. Option B is partially correct in noting the growing importance of human security in the 1990s, particularly in addressing intra-state violence, but it oversimplifies the complexity and nuance of how human security relates to broader security paradigms and the evolution of security studies."
