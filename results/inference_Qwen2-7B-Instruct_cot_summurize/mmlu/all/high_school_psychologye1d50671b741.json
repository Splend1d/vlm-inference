The psychologist is testing the students in the two schools at two different times. \n\nThis is a potential confounding variable because there may be differences in the students' performance based on when they take the test. For example, the students might perform differently depending on their level of fatigue, hunger, or readiness for learning during the morning versus the afternoon. This could affect the results of the comparison between the two schools, making it seem like there are significant differences in their performance when those differences might actually be due to the time of day rather than intrinsic differences between the schools."
