In the comic strip and later animated series \"Richie Rich,\" the title character has a recurring love interest named Melissa Marcieaux, often referred to as \"Little Rich Girl\" or \"Richie's Crush.\" However, there isn't a widely recognized animated character from a mainstream series that specifically has a crush on \"the Little Red-Haired Girl,\" which seems to be a reference to Charlie Brown's crush on Lucy in the \"Peanuts\" comic strip and animated series. If you meant a different character or context, please provide more details!"
