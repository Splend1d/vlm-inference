This means that one row can be expressed as a linear combination of another row (for instance, the second row is just the first row added to itself, and similarly for the third row. Therefore, there's only one linearly independent row, which implies that the rank of the matrix is 1.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nB. 1"
