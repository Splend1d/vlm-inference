Until now, the patient's postoperative course had been unremarkable and he has been treated with low-dose morphine for pain control. Medical history is remarkable for type 2 diabetes mellitus controlled with metformin and diet. Vital signs now are temperature 36.8\u00b0C (98.2\u00b0F), pulse 80/min and regular, respirations 20/min, and blood pressure 150/92 mm Hg. The surgical incision appears clean and well approximated without abnormal erythema or swelling. The left lower extremity and foot appear pale. Palpation of the left lower extremity discloses a strong femoral pulse, a weak popliteal pulse, and a cool, pulseless foot. Which of the following is the most appropriate management?\n\nA. Bedside compartment pressure measurements\nB. Doppler ultrasonography of the left lower extremity\nC. Intra-arterial tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) therapy\nD. Intraoperative angiography\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer would be B. Doppler ultrasonography of the left lower extremity.\n\nThe patient's symptoms suggest a possible complication related to the bypass graft, specifically an issue with circulation in the foot. The Doppler ultrasonography is the most appropriate first step because it can non-invasively assess blood flow through arteries and veins in the leg and foot, which can help determine if there is a blockage or other problem that might explain the poor circulation and pain in the foot.\n\nThe other options would be more invasive and potentially risky:\n\nA. Bedside compartment pressure measurements: While these could be useful in assessing compartment syndrome, they are not typically used as the initial assessment for a patient with poor circulation and pain in the foot post-bypass surgery.\n\nC. Intra-arterial tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) therapy: This is a treatment for acute ischemic stroke and is not typically indicated for this situation unless there is clear evidence of a clot in the leg or foot arteries that is causing the poor circulation.\n\nD. Intraoperative angiography: This is a diagnostic procedure that involves injecting a dye into the arteries to visualize them on x-ray, but it is usually reserved for when there are are specific indications like recurrent symptoms despite initial imaging or failure of conservative treatments. \n\nGiven the patient's condition and the available options, a Doppler ultrasound seems the most reasonable initial step."
