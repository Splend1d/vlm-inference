                    "text": "The correct answer is D. The purchase of bonds.\n\nWhen facing a recession, the Federal Reserve (Fed) may adopt several monetary policy measures to stimulate the economy. Among these options, purchasing bonds is one such measure. By buying bonds, the Fed injects money into the financial system, which can lower interest rates and encourage borrowing and spending. This action aims to boost economic activity by making it cheaper for businesses and consumers to borrow and invest.\n\nTo clarify why the other options are not typically used by the Fed to counter a recession:\n\nA. Decrease in taxes: This is primarily a fiscal policy tool under the jurisdiction of the government, not the Fed. While tax cuts can stimulate the economy, they are not directly controlled by the Fed.\n\nB. Increase in government spending: Similar to tax cuts, this is also a fiscal policy measure. It can help stimulate the economy but is not within the direct control of the Fed.\n\nC. Increase in the discount rate: Increasing the discount rate actually makes it more expensive for banks to borrow from the Fed, which can have the opposite effect of stimulating the economy. Thus, the Fed would typically lower the discount rate during a recession to encourage lending and spending."
