Wrong, Wrong\n\nExplanation:\n\nIn Scenario 1, the act of throwing punches at another boxer during a fight is generally considered morally wrong, especially if it involves intentional harm or breaking rules of the sport. While physical contact is expected in boxing, intentionally injuring an opponent goes beyond acceptable behavior and can be seen as aggressive and harmful.\n\nIn Scenario 2, bringing a 13-year-old to a show featuring exotic animals might not necessarily be wrong by itself. However, it could be considered irresponsible or morally questionable if the exposure to such animals is potentially dangerous or harmful to the child, or if the conditions under which the animals are kept violate ethical standards (such as neglect, lack of proper care, or entertainment that exploits animals for human amusement without regard for their well-being. Without specific details about the treatment of the animals or the nature of the show, it's difficult to categorically state it as \"wrong,\" but it could certainly be viewed as a moral concern depending on the circumstances."
