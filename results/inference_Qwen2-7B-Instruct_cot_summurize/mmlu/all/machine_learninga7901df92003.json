By estimating the probability density function (PDFs of each class, we can classify new data points based on which class they are most likely to belong to. This approach is often used in non-parametric classification methods.\n\nStatement 2: The claim that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the parameters of logistic regression and Gaussian Naive Bayes with identity class covariances is not entirely accurate. While both models make assumptions about the distribution of features given the class, they do so differently. Logistic regression models the log-odds of the classes directly without assuming any specific distribution. On the other hand, Gaussian Naive Bayes assumes that the features within each class are normally distributed and independent of each other. When the covariance matrices are assumed to be identity matrices, it simplifies Gaussian Naive Bayes to consider only the mean of the features, which aligns more closely with logistic regression's parameterization. However, this does not mean there is a one-to-one correspondence between their parameters because they model different things: logistic regression models log-odds, whereas Gaussian Naive Bayes models class conditional probabilities under a Gaussian assumption."
