If the MPC is 0.90, this means that for every additional dollar of income, 90 cents are spent and 10 cents is saved.\n\nWhen new autonomous private investment is added to an economy, it increases both consumption and investment, shifting aggregate demand to the right. The total increase in aggregate demand can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Increase in Aggregate Demand} = \\frac{\\text{New Investment}}{1 - \\text{MPC}} \\]\n\nGiven:\n- New Investment = $100\n- MPC = 0.90\n\n\\[ \\text{Increase in Aggregate Demand} = \\frac{100}{1 - 0.90} = \\frac{100}{0.10} = 1000 \\]\n\nSo, the aggregate demand would shift to the right by $1,000.\n\nThe correct answer is C. $1,000."
