At the college student's trial for assault, the prosecution called one of the college student's classmates to testify. The classmate was not at the bar during the fight. The classmate offered to testify that the next day at class, he approached the college student and said, \"It was wrong of you to start a fight with the man over a game of pool,\" at which point, the college student bowed his head and walked away.

It reflects the college student's reaction to being confronted about his actions, which could imply that he was aware that starting the fight was wrong.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the exact admissibility can depend on specific legal rules and precedents in different jurisdictions, including issues of hearsay and the specific requirements for admitting admissions in court."
