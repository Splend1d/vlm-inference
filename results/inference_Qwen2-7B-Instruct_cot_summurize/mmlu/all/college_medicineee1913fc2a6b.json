However, since these details are not provided, we will assume that the athlete is performing moderate-intensity exercise, which typically has a MET value around 4. \n\nThe energy expenditure can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nEnergy (kJ = Oxygen uptake (L/min * MET * Weight (kg * Time (min)\n\nGiven that the oxygen uptake is 3.0 L/min, the MET is approximately 4, and assuming an average weight of an adult male as 70 kg, and the time of exercise is 5 minutes, we can calculate the energy expenditure.\n\nEnergy (kJ = 3.0 L/min * 4 MET * 70 kg * 5 min\n\nEnergy (kJ = 12 * 70 * 5\n\nEnergy (kJ = 420 * 5\n\nEnergy (kJ = 2100\n\nThis result doesn't match any of the options given, which suggests there might have been a misunderstanding in the question or the options provided. Given the information and assumptions made:\n\n- Option A (60 kJ is too low.\n- Option B 150 kJ is also too low.\n- Option C 300 kJ is even lower than option B and is unlikely.\n- Option D 500 kJ is still significantly less than the calculated value.\n\nBased on our calculation, the energy expenditure would be much higher than what's listed among the options. If you're looking for a rough estimate and considering the typical range of energy expenditure during exercise, none of the options provided seem correct based on standard metabolic calculations. It might be worth double-checking the question or the context it was comes from."
