                    "text": "When the price of a close substitute, good X, rises, consumers are likely to shift their demand towards good Z, assuming goods X and Z are perfect substitutes or have highly elastic demand. This shift in demand leads to an increase in the demand for good Z. As a result:\n\n- The equilibrium quantity of good Z will increase because more units are being demanded at each price level.\n- The equilibrium price of good Z might also increase if the supply curve is relatively inelastic ( meaning that suppliers are not able to quickly adjust the quantity supplied in response to the higher demand. However, if the supply curve is quite elastic, an increase in demand could lead to an increase in quantity supplied that outpaces the price increase, potentially keeping the price relatively stable.\n\nGiven this scenario, the correct answer would be a nuanced interpretation that considers both possible outcomes depending on the elasticity of supply and demand. However, since none of the provided options exactly capture this complexity, it's important to note that in most cases, especially if the supply is relatively inelastic, the equilibrium price of good Z might rise along with the equilibrium quantity. \n\nSo, while none of the options perfectly match the nuanced economic outcome described above, option C (\"The equilibrium price and the equilibrium quantity will both rise\") would be the closest to accurately reflecting what happens under typical economic conditions, assuming supply is not very responsive to changes in price. In reality, the exact impact would depend on the specific elasticity of supply and demand for good Z."
