The informant gave a detailed description of the two men and the license number of the vehicle. A patrol car was immediately dispatched to the movie theater. A few minutes later, the police saw a car matching the description given parked about two blocks from the movie theater. When the police approached, they saw one man fitting the description provided. The police proceeded to the car and opened the doors of the vehicle. The police then pried open a locked tool case that was situated in the rear of the vehicle. Inside, the police found an envelope that contained about one gram of cocaine. They then placed the driver of the vehicle under arrest. Immediately thereafter, the police opened the glove compartment and found a small amount of marijuana. The driver of the van was subsequently prosecuted and charged with two counts of possession of controlled dangerous substances. He filed a motion to exclude the cocaine and marijuana from evidence. His motion will most likely be\n\nA. granted, as to the cocaine only.\nB. granted, as to the marijuana only.\nC. granted, as to both the cocaine and the marijuana.\nD. denied, as to the cocaine and the marijuana.\n"

However, there are exceptions to this protection, such as the \"plain view\" doctrine. This doctrine allows law enforcement officers to seize evidence without a warrant if it is in plain view during a lawful observation or if they reasonably believe the items seized are illegal or stolen.\n\nIn this scenario, the police were lawfully patrolling the area near the movie theater based on the reliable informant's tip. They observed a car matching the description provided by the informant and proceeded to approach the vehicle. Upon opening the doors of the vehicle, they found an envelope containing about one gram of cocaine in a locked tool case. This would likely fall under the \"plain view\" exception, allowing them to seize the cocaine without needing a warrant.\n\nFurthermore, the police also found a small amount of marijuana in the glove compartment while searching the vehicle. As they had already lawfully entered the vehicle and were conducting a lawful search, finding the marijuana would also likely be considered within the scope of their authority, even without a warrant.\n\nTherefore, the motion to exclude the cocaine and marijuana from evidence is most likely to be denied, as the police had probable cause and were acting within the bounds of the law when they made the seizure."
