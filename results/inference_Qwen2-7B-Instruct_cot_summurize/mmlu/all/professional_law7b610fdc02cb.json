The state law, however, does permit illegitimate children to inherit from and through their mothers. A man died intestate, leaving neither spouse nor any children other than an illegitimate son. The man's wife and his daughter died one year later in a motor vehicle accident. The illegitimate son filed suit in an appropriate court alleging that the state statute, which bars an illegitimate child from sharing in his father's estate is invalid, and that he should be declared the lawful heir of the man's estate. In challenging the validity of the state statute, will the illegitimate son prevail?\n\nA. Yes, because most state laws that discriminate against illegitimate children have been invalidated to ensure that a state's concern over illicit relationships is not the basis for punitive measures against the product of such a relationship.\nB. Yes, because he has been deprived of property without due process, since his fundamental right to inherit has been compromised without a compelling state need.\nC. No, because a state may promote the just and expeditious disposition of property at death by denying intestate succession to all illegitimate children.\nD. No, because discrimination against illegitimate children is not suspect and, therefore, the law does not violate the equal protection clause if it is substantially related to a legitimate state interest.\n"

Yes, because he has been deprived of property without due process, since his fundamental right to inherit has been compromised without a compelling state need**.\n\nThis decision would likely hinge on the interpretation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which prohibits states from denying any person within its jurisdiction \"the equal protection of the laws.\" The Supreme Court has held that laws discriminating against illegitimate children can be unconstitutional if they do not further a compelling state interest and are not narrowly tailored to achieve that interest.\n\nIn this scenario, the illegitimate son argues that the state statute unconstitutionally discriminates against him by denying him the inheritance rights that would otherwise be available to him under the laws governing intestacy. He claims that his fundamental right to inherit from his father's estate has been violated without a compelling state interest justifying such discrimination.\n\nGiven the historical trend towards recognizing the rights of illegitimate children in many jurisdictions, the argument presented by the illegitimate son is likely to resonate with courts that have become more sensitive to the constitutional rights of such individuals. The court might find that the state's interest in promoting traditional family structures (which is often cited as a justification for such statutes) does not outweigh the fundamental right to inherit property, especially when the statute fails to provide a compelling reason for such discrimination.\n\nThus, the court is likely to rule in favor of the illegitimate son, finding that the state statute violates the Equal Protection Clause and is unconstitutional."
