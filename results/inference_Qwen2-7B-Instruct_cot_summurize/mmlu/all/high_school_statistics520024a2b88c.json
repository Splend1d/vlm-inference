He randomly selected 100 female customers and 120 male customers, and asked them, \"Are you interested in shopping at this store on Sundays?\" He counted the number of customers answering \"yes\" and constructed a 95 percent confidence interval for the difference by subtracting the proportions of female from the proportion of male customers in favor of shopping on Sundays. The resulting interval was (\u20130.23, \u20130.18). Which of the following is a correct interpretation of the interval?\n\nA. We are 95 percent confident that the proportion of women interested in shopping on Sundays exceeds the proportion of men interested in shopping on Sundays.\nB. We are 95 percent confident that the proportion of men interested in shopping on Sundays exceeds the proportion of women interested in shopping on Sundays.\nC. We are 95 percent confident that the proportion of women interested in shopping on Sundays is equal to the proportion of men interested in shopping on Sundays.\nD. Because the interval contains negative values, it is invalid and should not be interpreted.\n"

We are 95 percent confident that the proportion of men interested in shopping on Sundays exceeds the proportion of women interested in shopping on Sundays.\n\nThis is because the entire interval is below zero, indicating that the estimated difference in proportions between male and female customers who are interested in shopping on Sundays is consistently in favor of males. In other words, the data suggests that fewer women than men are interested in shopping on Sundays, with a high level of confidence (95% in this case, that this difference holds true in the population. \n\nOption A is incorrect because it suggests that the proportion of women exceeds the proportion of men, which contradicts the interval. Option C is incorrect because it implies equality, which is not supported by the negative values in the interval. Option D is also incorrect because the presence of negative values does not invalidate the interval; rather, it simply indicates the direction of the difference."
