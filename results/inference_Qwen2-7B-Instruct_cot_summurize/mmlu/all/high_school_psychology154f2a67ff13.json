                    "text": "The correct answer is D. They were unable to use binocular cues for depth perception.\n\nExplanation:\n\nVisual depth perception can be achieved through several methods. Binocular vision, which involves using both eyes simultaneously, is particularly important for depth perception because it allows for the comparison of images from each eye. The slight differences in perspective and the convergence of the eyes (the way they turn inward when looking at objects close up) provide information that helps the brain understand distance and shape. This process is known as stereopsis or binocular disparity.\n\nIn this experiment, since the kittens were exposed to only monocular vision ( (vision from one eye at a time), their brains did not receive the necessary information to develop normal binocular depth perception skills. Therefore, as adults, they might struggle with depth perception compared to cats that have developed normal binocular vision. \n\nOptions A, B, and C describe issues related to depth perception, but they refer to different aspects. Interposition depth perception refers to how we perceive depth based on the position of objects relative to each other; perceptual constancy is our ability to recognize objects as being regardless of changes in their appearance due to lighting, angle, etc.; and distinguishing left from right monocular cues refers to recognizing spatial orientation using only one eye. However, these do not directly relate to the specific method of depth perception that this experiment addresses: binocular cues."
