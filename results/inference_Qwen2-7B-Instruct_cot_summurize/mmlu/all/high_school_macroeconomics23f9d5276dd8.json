The Fed sells Treasury securities to commercial banks.\n\nContractionary monetary policy is used by central banks, like the Federal Reserve, to reduce the money supply in the economy and cool down inflation. Selling Treasury securities to commercial banks is one way for the Fed to do this because it takes money out of circulation when banks sell those securities back to the Fed. This reduces the amount of money banks have available to lend, thereby contracting the money supply."
