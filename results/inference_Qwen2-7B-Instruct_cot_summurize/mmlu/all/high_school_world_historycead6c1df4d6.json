Prosperity ripened the principle of decay; the causes of destruction multiplied with the extent of conquest; and, as soon as time or accident had removed the artificial supports, the stupendous fabric yielded to the pressure of its own weight. . . . The victorious legions, who, in distant wars, acquired the vices of strangers and mercenaries, first oppressed the freedom of the republic, and afterwards violated the majesty of the purple. The emperors, anxious for their personal safety and the public peace, were reduced to the base expedient of corrupting the discipline which rendered them alike formidable to their sovereign and to the enemy; the vigour of the military . . . was relaxed . . . ; and the Roman world was overwhelmed by a deluge of Barbarians.\n\u2014Adapted from Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, by Edward Gibbon\nThe author of the above passage claims: \"Prosperity ripened the principle of decay; the causes of destruction multiplied with the extent of conquest.\" What does he mean by this?\n\nA. The rulers became too rich and thus were overthrown.\nB. The empire became too large to control effectively.\nC. Decay begins the minute something begins to grow.\nD. Conquest and prosperity are mutually exclusive.\n"

The empire became too large to control effectively.\n\nThe author is suggesting that as the Roman Empire grew in size through conquest, it also grew in complexity and difficulty to manage. The larger the empire became, the more resources and people it required to govern effectively. This increased complexity could lead to internal strife, corruption, and eventually decay and collapse. The statement implies that prosperity and the expansion of the empire created conditions that made it inherently unstable and prone to decay."
