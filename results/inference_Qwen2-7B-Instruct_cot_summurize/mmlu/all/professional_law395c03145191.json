                    "text": "The correct answer is C. A contingent remainder based upon whether or not cousin has heirs.\n\nIn this scenario, when the man first conveys the property to \"his wife's cousin and the heirs of his body,\" he creates a vested remainder for the cousin and the contingent remainder for his heirs. This means that the cousin holds an immediate interest in the property, and if the cousin has heirs, those heirs will hold a future interest in the property after the cousin's death.\n\nWhen the man then conveys the same property to his niece in fee simple, it creates a new fee simple estate in the niece. However, the original conveyance to the cousin with the right to have heirs in the future does not automatically terminate or be overridden by the later conveyance to the niece. \n\nThus, the niece has a fee simple estate, but the interest in the property held by the cousin ( and potentially his heirs if he has none) remains as a future interest. Therefore, the niece's interest is contingent on the cousin's heirs taking possession if they exist. If the cousin has no heirs, then the property would revert to the cousin, who might be presumed to have died without heirs under certain legal principles, but this would depend on specific state laws regarding succession and property rights."
