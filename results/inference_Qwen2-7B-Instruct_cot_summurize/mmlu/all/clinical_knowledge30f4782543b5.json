Blood type B (rhesus negative) and blood type O (rhesus negative). \n\nWhen giving blood to someone, it's important not to introduce any foreign antigens into their system that they might not have antibodies for. People with blood group B (rhesus negative already lack the A antigen and the Rh factor, so they can only receive blood from donors who also lack these antigens: other blood group B individuals and those with blood group O (rhesus negative. \n\nBlood type AB (rhesus negative (A) cannot donate to a B rhesus negative individual because they have the A antigen which the recipient would have antibodies against. Blood type B (rhesus positive (B) cannot donate to a B rhesus negative individual because they have the Rh factor which the recipient lacks antibodies for. Blood type O (rhesus positive (C) cannot donate to a B rhesus negative individual because they lack both the B antigen and the Rh factor. Therefore, options A, B, and D are are incorrect."
