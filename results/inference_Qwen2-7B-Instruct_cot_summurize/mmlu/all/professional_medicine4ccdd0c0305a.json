His temperature is 38.1\u00b0C (100.5\u00b0F), pulse is 95/min, respirations are 12/min, and blood pressure is 120/80 mm Hg. He appears malnourished. Rhonchi are heard at the left lower lobe of the lung on auscultation. Examination of the heart, lymph nodes, abdomen, and extremities shows no abnormalities. There is a 1-cm area of erythema over the sacrum with intact skin and no induration. Neurologic examination shows quadriparesis. Test of the stool for occult blood is negative. Which of the following is the most effective intervention for this patient's skin lesion?\n\nA. Frequent turning\nB. Use of wet to dry dressings\nC. Whirlpool therapy\nD. Broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy\n"

Frequent turning\n\nFor a patient with a 1-cm erythematous area over the sacrum with intact skin and no induration, the most appropriate intervention would be frequent turning to prevent pressure ulcers. The other options do not directly address the risk factors for skin breakdown in this context:\n\n- B. Use of wet to dry dressings: This might be relevant if there were an open wound or exudate, but given the description of the lesion as erythematous and intact, this wouldn't be the primary focus.\n- C. Whirlpool therapy: This is typically used for muscle relaxation and circulation improvement, not for skin care or prevention of pressure ulcers.\n- D. Broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy: This would be more appropriate if there was evidence of infection, such as pus or signs of systemic infection, but since the stool test for occult blood is negative, it suggests that there is no internal bleeding associated with infection.\n\nPreventing further pressure on the affected area through frequent turning is the most effective initial intervention."
