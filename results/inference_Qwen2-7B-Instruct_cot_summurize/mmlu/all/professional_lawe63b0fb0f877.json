The friend and the co-worker are tenants in common of the northeast quarter of the farm; the friend and the husband are tenants in common of the northwest quarter of the farm; and the nephew is the owner in fee of the south half of the farm.\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. **Joint Tenancy with Right of Survivorship**: When the retiree devised the property to his daughter and friend as joint tenants with right of survivorship, this means that the two would own the property equally and if one dies, their share automatically passes to the survivor. This applies to the entire 100-acre farm initially, but the specific shares change over time due to the subsequent transactions.\n\n2. **Daughter's Deed to Co-Worker**: The daughter's deed conveying her \"right, title, and interest\" in the northeast quarter of the farm to her co-worker makes them tenants in common. This means they now own the northeast quarter together, each having an undivided interest in the property. The original joint tenancy with the friend is no longer applicable to these shares.\n\n3. **Lender's Sale**: The lender's sale to the nephew of the daughter's \"right, title, and interest\" in the south half of the farm makes the nephew the owner in fee simple of this portion. The daughter had previously conveyed her interest in this part of the farm to her co-worker, but the lender's action overrides this, giving the nephew full ownership rights over the south half.\n\n4. **Daughter's Death**: After the daughter's death intestate, her husband becomes her sole surviving heir. However, since the farm is divided into three parts (northeast quarter, northwest quarter, and south half, and each part is owned differently (as tenants in common or by outright ownership, the husband does not automatically inherit the whole farm under these circumstances. His inheritance rights are limited to the portion of the farm that is directly related to his wife's estate.\n\n5. **Ownership Distribution**: \n   - The friend and the co-worker remain tenants in common of the northeast quarter of the farm.\n   - The friend and the husband become tenants in common of the northwest quarter of the farm because the friend originally held a joint tenancy with the retiree, which now includes the husband through the deceased daughter.\n   - The nephew is the owner in fee simple of the south half of the farm after the lender's sale.\n\nTherefore, option C accurately reflects the distribution of ownership after all the transactions described."
