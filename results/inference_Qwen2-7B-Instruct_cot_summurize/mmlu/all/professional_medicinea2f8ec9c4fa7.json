The patient is confined to her home because of severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with cor pulmonale. She was discharged 1 week ago from the hospital following 3 weeks of treatment for pneumonia that required intubation; her hospital stay was complicated by sepsis. She had a prolonged weaning program from intubation. Prior to discharge, the patient and her daughter met with you to review the patient's advance directive. During the discussion, the patient said, \"I'd rather die than be intubated again.\" At that time, both the patient and her daughter signed an addendum to that effect on the patient's advance directive. Today, the patient is dyspneic and is unable to complete a sentence. Vital signs are temperature 37.8\u00b0C (100.0\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 35/min, and blood pressure 100/70 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry shows an oxygen saturation of 84% while the patient is breathing 4 L of oxygen. You ask the patient if she wishes to return to the hospital. She says, \"No, I want to die at home.\" Her daughter takes you aside and says, \"My mother doesn't know what she's saying. I insist that she be admitted to the hospital.\" After further discussion with the daughter regarding support available at home, which of the following is the most appropriate step?\n\nA. Admit the patient to the hospital\nB. Arrange for consultation with a home hospice team\nC. Consult with the hospital ethics committee\nD. Order a home continuous positive airway pressure machine and instruct the daughter in its use\n"

Arrange for consultation with a home hospice team.\n\nGiven the patient's clear preference to die at home and the daughter's concern about the patient's mental state, it's important to ensure that the patient's wishes are being respected while also addressing any potential issues with the patient's understanding or decision-making capacity. Consulting with a home hospice team can provide comprehensive care management, emotional support, and resources to help manage the patient's symptoms, pain, and other needs in the comfort of her home.\n\nThis approach also allows for the assessment of the patient's cognitive function, as well as ensuring that palliative care measures are in place to meet her needs. It can also provide the family with guidance and support, including education on how to care for the patient and manage her condition effectively at home. Additionally, having a hospice team involved can facilitate communication between the patient, family, and healthcare providers, ensuring that everyone's concerns and wishes are are understood and addressed."
