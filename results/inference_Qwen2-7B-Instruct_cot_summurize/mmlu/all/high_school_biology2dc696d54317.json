ATP and NADPH provide the power and raw materials for the Calvin cycle. \n\nDuring the light reactions of photosynthesis, energy from sunlight is captured and converted into chemical energy in the form of ATP (adenosine triphosphate) and NADPH (reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate). These energy carriers then power the Calvin cycle, also known as the light-independent reactions, where carbon dioxide is fixed into organic molecules that can be used by the plant for growth and development."
