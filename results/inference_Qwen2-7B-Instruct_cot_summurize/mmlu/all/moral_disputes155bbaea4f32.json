                    "text": "Marcia Baron's argument against the use of ticking bomb cases, which are hypothetical scenarios often used to justify extreme measures like torture, hinges on the perceived artificiality or contrived nature of these scenarios. The key points she likely makes can be summarized as follows:\n\nA. **The Artificial Assumptions Are, in Fact, Empirical Claims That Are Central to the Debate.** This means that the scenarios used to argue for the necessity of extreme measures underpin real-world ethical and legal debates. By presenting these scenarios as purely hypothetical, Baron might argue that they obscure the empirical evidence and real-world implications that are crucial to the discussion. This could include factors such as the reliability of information obtained through torture, the effectiveness of alternative interrogation methods, or the long-term consequences of endorsing such practices.\n\nB. **All Artificial Thought Experiments Are Philosophically Useless.** While this statement goes beyond Baron's specific critique of ticking bomb cases, it reflects a broader philosophical stance that might be part of her argument. Baron could argue that relying on artificial thought experiments to make decisions about real-world policies is flawed because these experiments do not adequately capture the complexity and nuances of actual situations. They might not account for the full range of variables, ethical considerations, or human behavior that are present in genuine scenarios.\n\nC. **It Leads Us to Believe That Torture Is Always Permissible.** This point directly addresses the potential moral hazard of using ticking bomb scenarios. Baron might argue that these scenarios, by their very nature, can lead to the normalization of extreme measures like torture, even when they are not supported by evidence or ethical principles. This can have serious implications for human rights, international law, and the broader societal values around justice and respect for individuals.\n\nTherefore, **D. All of the Above** could be a fair summary of Baron's arguments, considering her critique focuses on the limitations of artificial scenarios in ethical and policy discussions, particularly those concerning the justification of extreme measures such as torture."
