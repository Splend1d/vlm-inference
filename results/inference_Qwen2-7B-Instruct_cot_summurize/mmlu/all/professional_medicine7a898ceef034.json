He says he intentionally burned his right thigh several times with a cigarette lighter 6 days ago. This morning he soaked his thigh in a tub of hot water and massaged it, after which a large amount of \"greenish fluid\" drained from the wound sites. The patient normally takes lithium carbonate but stopped 3 months ago after he lost his job. Medical history is otherwise unremarkable. Vital signs are temperature 39.2\u00b0C (102.5\u00b0F), pulse 170/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/60 mm Hg. Physical examination shows an edematous right lateral thigh with multiple burn sites with a white exudative appearance. There is erythema surrounding the burn areas with red streaks extending up the thigh. Palpation of the burn sites discloses fluctuance. Results of laboratory studies show a hemoglobin concentration of 14 g/dL and a leukocyte count of 19,000/mm3 . In addition to beginning antibiotic therapy, which of the following is the most appropriate next step?\n\nA. Incision and drainage\nB. Psychiatric consultation\nC. Topical silver sulfadiazine\nD. Transfer to a burn center\n"

Incision and Drainage\n\nGiven the patient's history of self-mutilation, the description of a large amount of \"greenish fluid\" draining from the wound sites, and the physical examination findings of fluctuance at the burn sites, it is likely that the patient has developed an infection at the burn sites. The presence of erythema, red streaks extending up the thigh, and fluctuance all suggest that there may be pus or other infected material beneath the skin. This is a clinical indication for incision and drainage, which would allow for the removal of the infected material and promote healing.\n\nThe patient's history of lithium carbonate use, stopped 3 months ago, may not directly impact the management of this situation unless lithium levels is elevated, which could complicate wound healing. However, given the urgency of addressing the potential infection, immediate attention to the wound care is more critical than monitoring lithium levels in this scenario.\n\nPsychiatric consultation (B might also be considered due to the patient's history of self-mutilation, but this should ideally occur concurrently with the medical intervention rather than as a separate step. Topical silver sulfadiazine (C can be used for minor burns and superficial wounds but is unlikely to address a deep infection requiring incision and drainage. Transfer to a burn center would be appropriate if the patient had extensive burns or severe complications that required specialized care, but based on the information provided, the primary concern appears to be managing the infection at the current location.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate next step is to begin with incision and drainage to address the infection, followed by further assessment and management including psychiatric consultation if needed."
