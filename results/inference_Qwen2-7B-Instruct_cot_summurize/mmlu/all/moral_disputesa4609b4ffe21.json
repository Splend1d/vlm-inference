Human life - This is considered a fundamental good because it is the basis for all other goods and is necessary for the existence and flourishing of a person.\n\nB. Human procreation - Aquinas saw procreation as a means through which individuals could participate in God's creative activity and contribute to the continuation of the human species.\n\nC. Human sociability - This refers to the inherent need humans have for social relationships and community. It is seen as an essential aspect of human dignity and well-being, allowing individuals to fulfill their purpose in society and to care for one another.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. all of the above."
