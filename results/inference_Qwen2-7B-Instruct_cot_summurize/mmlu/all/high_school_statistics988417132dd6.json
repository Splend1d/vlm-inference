E and F are both independent and mutually exclusive.\n\nExplanation:\n- A. p + q > 1: This is possible if the sum of the probabilities of two events occurring individually exceeds 1, which can happen in certain situations where the events do not overlap completely.\n- B. p - q < 0: This is also possible as it simply means that the probability of event E is less than the probability of event F, which is a valid situation depending on the specifics of the events.\n- C. p /q > 1: This indicates that the probability of event E is greater than the probability of event F, which can indeed occur depending on the probabilities assigned to each event.\n- D. E and F are both independent and mutually exclusive: This combination is impossible. Two events cannot be both independent and mutually exclusive at the same time. Independence means the occurrence of one event does not affect the probability of the other, whereas mutual exclusivity means that the occurrence of one event precludes the occurrence of the other. These definitions are contradictory; if two events are mutually exclusive, then knowing that one has occurred automatically affects the probability of the other being 0, thus they cannot be independent."
