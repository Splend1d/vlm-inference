Their astronomical records include tracking the movements of celestial bodies such as Venus, the Sun, and the Moon. They were also skilled in mathematics, using a vigesimal (base-20 numeral system and making contributions to algebra and geometry. While they did keep records of political events and religious practices, their written records are particularly noted for their astronomical and mathematical content."
