Lead to death due to an inability of the cell to pass electrons to oxygen, thus stopping aerobic respiration and asphyxiating the cells.\n\nCytochrome oxidase A3 is the last enzyme in the electron transport chain, where the electrons are passed to molecular oxygen, leading to the reduction of oxygen and the generation of water. If this enzyme is inhibited by a large dose of a substance, the flow of electrons through the electron transport chain is stopped. This results in the inability of cells to generate ATP via oxidative phosphorylation, causing a failure in cellular respiration. As a result, cells will be unable to produce sufficient energy to sustain life, leading to cell death and eventually whole-body asphyxiation."
