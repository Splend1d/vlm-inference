This is because they believe they have the ability to influence the events in their lives, make choices, and take actions that shape their experiences. This sense of agency can lead to a greater sense of purpose, satisfaction, and resilience, which are all key components of crafting meaningful life narratives.\n\nWhile a sense of well-being ( (A), generativity (C), and humor (D) are also important aspects of a full life, they do not necessarily directly correlate with the richness or depth of life stories in the same way that a strong sense of personal control does. However, these other factors can certainly contribute positively to one's overall experience and the stories they tell about their lives."
