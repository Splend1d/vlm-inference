The minor premise must affirm the antecedent or deny the consequent.\n\nThis rule refers to the structure of a valid hypothetical (or conditional) syllogism, also known as modus ponens or modus tollens in formal logic. \n\n- Modus Ponens: If P then Q; P; therefore, Q.\n- Modus Tollens: If P then Q; not Q; therefore, not P.\n\nIn both cases, the minor premise directly relates to the conditional statement by either affirming the antecedent ( (\"If P then Q\" and \"P\") or denying the consequent (\"If P then Q\" and \"not Q\").\n\nOptions A, B, and D do not pertain specifically to the validity of conditional syllogisms:\n\n- A. Every term must be used twice--no more and no less: This pertains to the rule of three terms in categorical syllogisms, not conditional syllogisms.\n  \n- B. If one premise is negative, the conclusion must be negative: This is incorrect because a valid conditional syllogism can have a positive conclusion even if one premise is negative ( (e.g., modus tollens).\n\n- D. The alternatives presented must be mutually exclusive: This seems to refer to a principle that could apply to certain types of logical arguments or decision-making processes but does not specifically define the validity of conditional syllogisms."
