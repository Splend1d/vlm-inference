The school psychologist has worked with the boy and knows him well. Anthony has a mild learning disability and receives academic support. He is doing well on a daily basis but has difficulty performing on tests. The school psychologist discusses ways in which Ms. Harcar could incorporate study-skills training into classroom activities. With regard to study-skills training, the school psychologist should stress which of the following principles while advising Ms. Harcar?\n\nA. The study skills of students with disabilities are improved when they are given a single, specific study strategy to follow for all subjects.\nB. Students with disabilities often develop study skills on their own and need only some guidance and reinforcement by the teacher.\nC. Training in study skills needs to include helping students to guide their own thinking to organize their own study behaviors and to use varied study approaches.\nD. Study strategies are best taught in a small group by having students practice collaborative problem-solving activities modeled by the teacher.\n"

Training in study skills needs to include helping students to guide their own thinking to organize their own study behaviors and to use varied study approaches.\n\nThis approach empowers the student to take an active role in managing their learning process, adapt strategies as needed, and develop flexibility in their study habits. It acknowledges that each student may require different techniques depending on the subject matter, personal learning style, and individual needs. Providing tools and techniques that encourage self-directed learning can help students with disabilities like Anthony to overcome challenges and improve their academic performance."
