However, based on common legal principles, the most likely scenario would be:\n\nD. The restaurant owner, because there was no disturbance of peaceful enjoyment of the neighboring property.\n\nTrespass typically involves an invasion of someone's property rights, often causing damage or interference with the use and enjoyment of the property. In this case, since there was no impact on the surface of the neighboring property or on existing uses, the argument could be made that the neighbor's \"peaceful enjoyment\" was not disturbed. Furthermore, if the work was necessary to ensure the structural integrity of the restaurant and did not violate any local zoning laws or building codes, the restaurant owner might have a strong defense against the claim.\n\nHowever, it's crucial to consider that the neighbor's lawsuit might also hinge on whether the restaurant owner or the contractor was legally responsible for notifying the neighbor about the planned work or obtaining permissions that might have been required by law or the terms of the lease or property agreement. If there were clear obligations to inform or consult the neighbor that were not met, this could weaken the restaurant owner's defense.\n\nIn practice, the outcome would likely be determined by a court after reviewing all the relevant evidence, including contracts, permits, and possibly even the nature of the relationship between the parties involved. It's always advisable for such disputes to be handled by legal professionals who can provide guidance tailored to the specific circumstances and applicable laws."
