Given a (finite) string \\(w\\), is \\(w\\) a prefix of the decimal expansion of \\(\\pi\\)?\n\nThis problem is decidable because there exists an algorithm to compare any finite string \\(w\\) with the known prefixes of the decimal expansion of \\(\\pi\\). Since \\(\\pi\\) has an infinite decimal expansion, but we're only considering finite prefixes, this comparison can be done algorithmically by checking if \\(w\\) matches any segment of the known digits of \\(\\pi\\).\n\n#### II. Given a program and an input, is the program\u2019s output the decimal expansion of \\(\\pi\\)?\n\nThis problem is not decidable in general. Determining whether a given program outputs the exact decimal expansion of \\(\\pi\\) for a specific input would require solving the halting problem, which is known to be undecidable. The halting problem asks whether, given a program and an input, the program will eventually halt or continue to run indefinitely. Without solving the halting problem, we cannot generally determine if a program outputs the decimal expansion of \\(\\pi\\).\n\n#### III. Given a program that takes as input a prefix of the decimal expansion of \\(\\pi\\), is the program\u2019s output always the same for every prefix?\n\nThis problem is also not decidable. Even though the input is restricted to prefixes of \\(\\pi\\), determining if the program's output is consistent across all possible prefixes requires understanding the behavior of the program for potentially infinite inputs. This involves predicting the program's output for all possible prefixes of \\(\\pi\\), which again touches on issues related to the halting problem and computability.\n\nTherefore, only option I is decidable, making the correct answer A. I only."
