One day, the husband had been drinking beer while watching football on television. After his favorite team lost a close game, the husband went into a violent rage. As he was storming around the apartment, he suddenly grabbed his wife and led her outside to their car. He then ordered her to get inside the vehicle. The husband was driving around aimlessly when he negligently collided with another car. The other driver, who was injured in the accident, brought suit against the husband to recover damages. Thereafter, the husband retained an attorney to represent him. At his first consultation with the attorney, the husband was accompanied by his wife. During the conference, the attorney's secretary took notes of the meeting. Two weeks later, the wife separated from the husband. She then hired a lawyer to represent her in a suit against the husband for battery and false imprisonment. At the trial between the husband and the other driver, the other driver's attorney calls the wife to testify. She proposes to testify that her husband was intoxicated at the time of the accident. Upon objection by the husband's attorney, the wife's proposed testimony will most likely be\n\nA. admissible as a proper lay opinion.\nB. inadmissible, under the attorney-clientprivilege.\nC. inadmissible, under the marital privilege.\nD. inadmissible, because the wife is biased.\n"

This privilege exists to encourage open communication within marriage and to protect the privacy of marital relationships. If the wife were to testify about communications that occurred during her marriage with the husband, it could potentially violate this privilege. However, in this case, the wife is not testifying about confidential communications but rather about an observation she made about her husband's state of intoxication at the time of the accident. This type of testimony would generally be admissible under the rules of evidence unless there is some specific exception or rule that applies to such circumstances. Therefore, the correct answer is C, assuming that there is no specific exception that would allow such testimony despite the marital privilege."
