                    "text": "B. The pressure in the neck is equal to the pressure in the knee because of the equal dynamic pressure according to the continuity equation\n\nExplanation: According to Bernoulli's principle and the continuity equation, the flow rate of a fluid remains constant in a steady flow situation. This means that if we have two capillaries with equal cross-sectional areas but different locations (one in the neck and one in the right knee, the velocities of the blood in these capillaries will adjust so that their product by the cross-sectional area is the same. Therefore, the pressures must be equal to maintain this condition. The height difference (or \"pressure head\" as stated in option A and C does not play a role here since it would only affect the velocity if the flow were not steady or if the capillaries had different diameters. Option D is not correct because while density and viscosity do matter for the actual pressure values (and could be factors in more complex scenarios like turbulent flow), they do not change the fact that under steady-state conditions, the dynamic pressure (which is related to velocity and the fluid's density and viscosity) must be the same in both capillaries to maintain conservation of mass."
