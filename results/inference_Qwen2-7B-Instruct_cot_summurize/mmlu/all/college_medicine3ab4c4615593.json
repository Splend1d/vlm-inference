This would result in a codon (a sequence of three nucleotides bases that codes for an amino acid - UAC changes to UCC. UAC codes for tyrosine and UCC also codes for tyrosine. Thus, the protein produced by the modified strand will be similar in size to the original protein since it only involves a single amino acid change. However, slight differences in the amino acid sequence can sometimes lead to proteins with altered function, so it's likely that the protein will be dysfunctional."
