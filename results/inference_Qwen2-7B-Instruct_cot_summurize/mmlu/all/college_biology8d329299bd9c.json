These genes, also known as homeobox genes, play crucial roles in specifying the identity of different body segments during development. When they mutate, it can lead to the loss or misplacement of segments, depending on where the mutation occurs. For example, if a mutation affects the homeotic gene for the second thoracic segment ( (t), it might result in the second and third segments merging or disappearing, rather than just the second segment being altered."
