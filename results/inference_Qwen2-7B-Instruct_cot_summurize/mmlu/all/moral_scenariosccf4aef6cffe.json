Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nRenting out a rundown apartment to college students at a price comparable to its worth isn't considered morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. This is a standard business practice where the landlord seeks to cover costs and possibly gain profit.\n\nGoing fishing for salmon at the sea is also not considered morally wrong, assuming that it's done legally and sustainably. Fishing can be a recreational activity or part of subsistence practices, and as long as it adheres to local laws regarding catch limits and conservation, it's not ethically problematic. \n\nPlease note that specific practices might be subject to change based on environmental regulations and ethical considerations about sustainability and animal welfare."
