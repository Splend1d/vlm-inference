They have fewer mitochondria which means they don't produce energy through aerobic metabolism as efficiently. Instead, they rely more on anaerobic metabolism, which allows for rapid contraction but leads to quicker depletion of energy sources like ATP. The high ATPase activity refers to the enzyme that breaks down ATP into ADP and inorganic phosphate, providing energy for muscle contractions."
