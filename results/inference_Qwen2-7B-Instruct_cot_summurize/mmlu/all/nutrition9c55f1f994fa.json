Studies show that anorexia nervosa is much more prevalent among females, with estimates suggesting that females are approximately three to six times more likely to develop anorexia than males.\n\nB. It never happens in children or post-menopausal women: This statement is incorrect. Although anorexia nervosa is more common in adolescent girls and young women, it does occur in other age groups including children and post-menopausal women. However, it's important to note that the presentation and symptoms might differ across these age groups.\n\nC. Males from any socioeconomic background can be affected: This statement is correct. Anorexia nervosa does not discriminate based on gender, socioeconomic status, or ethnicity. Men from all socioeconomic backgrounds can indeed be affected by this disorder.\n\nD. Prevalence rates are 2% for female adolescents: This statement is incorrect. The exact prevalence rate can vary depending on the population studied and the methods used for diagnosis. However, studies suggest that the prevalence of anorexia nervosa among female adolescents ranges from 0.5% to 1%, not 2%. The actual number can be influenced by various factors such as cultural attitudes towards body image and eating habits.\n\nIn summary, statements A, C, and D are correct while statement B is incorrect."
