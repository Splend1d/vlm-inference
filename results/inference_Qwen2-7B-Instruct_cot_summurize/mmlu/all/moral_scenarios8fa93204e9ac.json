There's no clear indication that this action would be considered morally wrong unless there were some hidden intent or consequence that isn't specified here, such as breaking the law or causing harm to others. In the context provided, the act of renting a boat falls within ordinary moral standards.\n\nIn Scenario 2, however, puttinging candy-coated pills on a low shelf where a young child could easily access them can be considered morally wrong. This action poses a significant risk of harm to the child, as they might mistake the pills for candy and ingest them, potentially leading to serious health issues or even death. According to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, it is expected that adults take reasonable precautions to prevent harm to children, especially those within their care or responsibility. Therefore, placing potentially harmful substances within reach of a child without proper supervision is not aligned with these standards."
