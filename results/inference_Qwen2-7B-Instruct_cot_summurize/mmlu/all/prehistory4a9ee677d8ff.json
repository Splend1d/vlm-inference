Based on the available evidence, it appears that the site was chosen by Paleoindians due to its advantageous location with respect to D. nearby location of migratory routes of large mammals such as bison.\n\nPaleoindians were nomadic hunter-gatherers who relied heavily on the availability of large game for their survival. The presence of bison ( and other large mammals in the area would have been crucial for their hunting activities. By choosing a site along migratory routes, Paleoindians could have more easily tracked and hunted these animals, ensuring a steady food supply. This strategic choice likely played a significant role in the selection of the Gault site as a settlement location."
