The CEO of the new business told the widget maker's manager that a substantial profit hinged on receiving the widgets. The manufacturer discovered it could not produce the widgets due to equipment failures. The business sued the manufacturer for breach of contract, claiming lost profits of $10 million. The CEO testified to the company's projected sales in detail. A qualified expert supported his lost profit projections; there was no expert testimony by the manufacturer. Will the court allow the company to collect its claimed lost profit damages?\n\nA. No, despite the expert testimony, anticipated profits for a new company are too speculative and are not awarded.\nB. No, because the equipment failures were an excusable occurrence that the manufacturer could not foresee.\nC. Yes, the lost profits damages were sufficiently proven by the evidence, including expert testimony.\nD. Yes, a new company can usually collect its lost profits because it is easier to prove than if the company had many accounts to complicate its projections.\n"

No, despite the expert testimony, anticipated profits for a new company are too speculative and are are not awarded.\n\nIn law, particularly when dealing with commercial contracts and claims for lost profits, courts generally require a high degree of certainty and specificity in the evidence presented. For a new business, especially one without a track record or historical financial data, projecting future profits becomes much more speculative. Without a history of operations, financial stability, or market presence, the projections of future sales and profitability can be seen as highly uncertain. This uncertainty makes it difficult for a court to determine with confidence whether the claimed lost profits are a direct result of the breach or simply speculative business risk. As such, courts are likely to be cautious about awarding lost profits damages for a new business's anticipated profits, especially when there is no concrete evidence of past performance or market validation."
