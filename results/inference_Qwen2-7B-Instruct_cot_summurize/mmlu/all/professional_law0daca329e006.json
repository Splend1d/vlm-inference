Finally, the woman hired a handyman to build a wooden stake fence between her property and her neighbor's property for $10,000. The handyman built the fence as agreed, and the woman paid him the sum of $10,000. Two weeks later, the neighbor was operating his lawn mower near the property line between his and the woman's property when a section of the fence suddenly fell on top of him, seriously injuring him. A subsequent investigation revealed that the handyman did not properly reinforce the fence. Which of the following is the handyman's best defense in a contract action brought against him by the neighbor, in which the only damages alleged are those for the neighbor's personal injuries?\n\nA. Damages for personal injuries cannot be recovered in a contract action.\nB. Damages for personal injuries to the neighbor were not within the contemplation of the woman and the handyman at the time they entered into their agreement.\nC. The neighbor is only an incidental beneficiary of the agreement between the woman and the handyman.\nD. The neighbor has no standing to assert such an action, since he was not a party to the agreement between the woman and the handyman.\n"

Damages for personal injuries to the neighbor were not within the contemplation of the woman and the handyman at the time they entered into their agreement.\n\nThis option seems to be the most appropriate defense in this scenario. When the woman and the handyman entered into their contract, they likely focused on the specific terms related to building the fence and the payment for the service. Personal injuries that might occur as a result of the fence construction were not foreseeable or included in their agreement. Thus, the handyman could argue that the damages resulting from the injury were outside the scope of their contract.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that this answer is based on general principles of contract law and may vary depending on specific legal jurisdictions and nuances of the case. For instance, some jurisdictions might consider personal injuries to be foreseeable risks associated with construction work and thus potentially recoverable under certain circumstances. It would also depend on whether there were any express or implied warranties regarding safety in the contract or any negligence claims beyond the contract itself."
