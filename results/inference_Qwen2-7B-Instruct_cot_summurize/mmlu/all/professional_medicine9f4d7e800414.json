                    "text": "The correct answer is D. Osmotic diuretic.\n\nCalcium oxalate stones, which are the most common type of kidney stone and are associated with a high urinary calcium level, can be managed with osmotic diuretics. These medications increase urine output by causing the kidneys to excrete more water, thereby diluting the urine and reducing the concentration of substances that promote stone formation, such as calcium. This strategy aims to prevent stone recurrence by lowering the saturation levels of calcium in the urine, thus decreasing the risk of stone formation. \n\nCarbonic anhydrase inhibitors ( (A), Na+ \u2013Cl\u2212 symport inhibitors ( (B), and Na+ \u2013K + \u20132Cl\u2212 symport inhibitors ( (C) do not have a proven role in preventing calcium stone formation. They may be used in other conditions, but their use in this scenario is not supported by evidence for stone prevention."
