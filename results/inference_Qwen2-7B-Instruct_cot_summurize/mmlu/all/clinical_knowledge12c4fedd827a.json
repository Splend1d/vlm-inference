They are designed to have minimal impact on other hormone receptors, reducing the risk of side effects associated with traditional androgens like anabolic steroids. \n\nSteroids typically refer to a class of compounds including naturally occurring substances (like cortisol and testosterone, as well as synthetic drugs analogues. When we talk about \"acting on androgen receptors,\" we're referring to substances that interact with the androgen receptor protein in cells, influencing gene expression and cellular function. Androgens are a group of hormones that includes testosterone, Dihydrotestosterone ( (DHT), and other related substances, and they play key roles in development and regulation of male sex characteristics.\n\nSo, in essence, SARMs are non-steroidal agents that mimic the effects of androgens by selectively binding to and activating the androgen receptor, hence the name 'selective'."
