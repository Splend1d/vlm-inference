This allows businesses to create more personalized and effective marketing campaigns that resonate with the specific needs and preferences of these groups.\n\nA. Having excess disposable income is not a defining characteristic of micromarketing targets; it could be relevant for targeting high-end or luxury products but is not a general criterion for micromarketing.\nB. Targeting individuals between the ages of 8 and 14 is more related to market segmentation by age group, which can be part of a broader micromarketing strategy but does not specifically define micromarketing.\nD. Consumers who have opted out of customized marketing might not be the primary target of micromarketing, as micromarketing aims to provide customized experiences rather than avoid them."
