The document you're referring to seems to be part of the Journals of the Continental Congress from 1777, which discusses the need for addressing the weaknesses of the Articles of Confederation.\n\nThe major weakness of the Articles of Confederation highlighted in the passage you've mentioned is related to the difficulty in maintaining unity among the states due to their being separate sovereign and independent communities. This issue was addressed by the need for \"uniting all our councils and all our strength\" to \"maintain and defend our common liberties.\"\n\nAmong the options given, the correct answer to describe a major weakness of the Articles of Confederation is:\n\nD. denied the federal government the power to mediate disputes between states\n\nThis weakness meant that the central government could not effectively resolve conflicts or disputes that arose between individual states, as it lacked the authority to enforce decisions or mediate disagreements."
