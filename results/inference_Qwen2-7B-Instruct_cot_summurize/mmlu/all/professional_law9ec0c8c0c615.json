She hired an architect to design a high tech office building with an objective of attracting upscale tech-industry tenants. She approached Microhard and secured a lease agreement for over half of the available square footage. The lease was not recorded, but the agreement allowed Denise to attract other wealthy tenants. She also disclosed the Microhard lease on her application for a $1,500,000 construction loan from Maximum Mortgage Company. Denise executed a mortgage and related promissory note in favor of Maximum. Maximum recorded the mortgage immediately. The office building was completed and Denise had more tenant demand than available space, so the building opened full. One year later, Denise ran into financial trouble and defaulted on the mortgage. Maximum took possession and immediately notified all the tenants that their leases were cancelled, that they were evicted, and that they must vacate immediately unless they were willing to sign a new lease at double the previous rent. The recording statute in the jurisdiction specified \"every conveyance, encumbrance, or lease not recorded is void as against any subsequent party recording first.\" The tenants retained you to compel Maximum to honor the leases at the lower rents. Which of the following statements of advice is the most accurate?\n\nA. All the tenants will prevail (unless otherwise in default on their leases), because Maximum loaned money to Denise with actual knowledge that she intended to enter into binding leases with the tenants.\nB. Microhard is entitled to continue their lease because Maximum had constructive notice of their prior lease.\nC. Microhard is entitled to continue their lease because Maximum had actual notice of their prior lease.\nD. All the tenants should renegotiate their leases with Maximum.\n"

Microhard is entitled to continue their lease because Maximum had actual notice of their prior lease.\n\nExplanation: Under the recording statute mentioned, a subsequent interest holder (in this case, Maximum Mortgage Company - takes the property subject to any previously recorded interests. Since Denise Developer disclosed the Microhard lease on her application for the construction loan, it can be inferred that Maximum had actual notice of the lease. Therefore, Microhard is entitled to continue under their lease terms. However, the other tenants might face challenges based on the recording statute, as Maximum may argue that their recording of the mortgage trumped any unrecorded leases. It's important to consult with a legal expert who can review all relevant documents and local laws to provide specific advice for each tenant's situation."
