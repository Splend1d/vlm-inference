Physical examination shows lesions that are most numerous in the flexural areas including the axillae and groin. The blisters do not break easily, and there are no oral lesions. These blisters are most likely the result of adhesion failure involving which of the following?\n\nA. Basement membrane\nB. Dermal papillae\nC. Langerhans cells\nD. Melanocytes\n"

Basement membrane\n\nThe description of widespread blister formation, particularly in flexural areas like the axillae and groin, suggests a condition known as pemphigus vulgaris. This is an autoimmune disease where the immune system attacks the proteins that hold the skin layers together, leading to blister formation. This adhesion failure occurs at the basement membrane zone ( which is the interface between the epidermis and dermis. \n\nPemphigus vulgaris is characterized by blisters that are not easily broken, and it does not typically involve oral lesions. Therefore, the correct answer is A: Basement membrane."
