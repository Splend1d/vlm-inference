Given that the arrangement is even-lengthed ( due to having at least 2 letters, we can deduce that the first half of the string will determine the second half. This means for each character in the first half, there's a corresponding character in the second half that mirrors it.\n\nGiven the constraints:\n- We can only use the letters M, I, S, and P.\n- We have 1 M, 4 I's, 4 S's, and 2 P's.\n\nThe key to forming a palindrome with these constraints is to pair up identical characters symmetrically around the center, ensuring the middle positions (if odd number of characters were allowed, would also mirror themselves.\n\nLet's break down the cases:\n\n**Case 1: Palindromes of length 2**\n- The only possible palindrome of length 2 using the available letters is 'MM'.\n\n**Case 2: Palindromes of length 4**\n- For a palindrome of length 4, we can have combinations like:\n  - MIIM (Using two I's and one M.\n  - MISI ( Using one I and two S's.\n  - MISP ( Using one I, one S, and one P.\n  - PISM ( Not possible because we only have two Ps and they cannot be mirrored.\n  - PIIM ( Not possible because we don't have enough Is to mirror the P.\n\nSo, for length 4, we have 3 possibilities.\n\n**Case 3: Palindromes of length 6**\n- For a palindrome of length 6, we can have combinations like:\n  - MIIIMS ( Using one M, three I's, and two S's.\n  - MIPISP Using one M, one I, one S, and two P's.\n  - MPIISP Using one M, two I's, one S, and two P's.\n\nSo, for length 6, we have 3 possibilities.\n\n**Case 4: Palindromes of length 8**\n- For a palindrome of length 8, we can have combinations like:\n  - MIIIMISS Using one M, four I's, and two S's.\n  - MIPISPIS Using one M, one I, one S, and three P's.\n  - MPIISISS Using one M, two I's, two S's, and two P's.\n\nSo, for length 8, we have 3 possibilities.\n\n**Case 5: Palindromes of length 10**\n- For a palindrome of length 10, we can have combinations like:\n  - MIIIMISSIP Using one M, four I's, two S's, and two P's.\n  - MIPISPISIP Using one M, one I, one S, three P's, and one I.\n\nSo, for length 10, we have 2 possibilities.\n\nAdding all these possibilities together:\n\\[ \\text{Total} = 1 (\\text{length 2}) + 3 (\\text{length 4}) + 3 (\\text{length 6}) + 3 (\\text{length 8}) + 2 (\\text{length 10}) \\]\n\\[ \\text{Total} = 1 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 = 12 \\]\n\nIt seems there might have been a miscalculation in the breakdown above since the provided options do not match the calculated total. Let's re-evaluate the possibilities more carefully:\n\nFor a string to be palindromic, the first half determines the second half. Given our constraints, let's reconsider the valid combinations:\n\n**Correct Approach:**\n\n**Case 1:** Length 2, only 'MM' is possible.\n\n**Case 2:** Length 4, combinations are:\n- 'MIMI'\n- 'MISP' ( (Not possible)\n- 'PIIM' ( (Not possible)\n- 'SISM' ( (Not possible)\n\n**Case 3:** Length 6, combinations are:\n- 'MIIIMS'\n- 'MPIISP'\n\n**Case 4:** Length 8, combinations are:\n- 'MIIIMISS'\n- 'MPIISISS'\n- 'MIPISPIS'\n\n**Case 5:** Length 10, combinations are:\n- 'MIIIMISSIP'\n- 'MPIISISSIP'\n\n**Case 6:** Length 12, combinations are:\n- 'MIIIMISSIPPI'\n\nAdding these possibilities correctly:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total} = 1 + 2 ("
