International law is built upon multiple sources, each with its own importance:\n\n1. **Treaties Law**: This includes bilateral or multilateral agreements between states, which are are binding under international law.\n\n2. **Customary International Law**: This refers to practices in state conduct followed by states as a matter of legal obligation. It evolves through the consistent practice of states over time, accompanied by opinio juris ( (the belief that the practice is legally obligatory).\n\n3. **General Principles of Law**: These are principles drawn from general legal systems and used to fill gaps in international law where specific rules are absent.\n\n4. **International Judicial Decisions and Opinions of International Tribunals**: These offer interpretative insights into how existing rules are applied and understood.\n\n5. **Conventions and Resolutions of International Organizations**: These can also be sources of international law, especially when they codify existing customary law or set new standards.\n\nThe hierarchy in international law is not absolute; it's more about which source provides greater clarity or is more applicable to a given situation. For example, if there is a conflict between a treaty and a custom, the treaty will generally prevail because it represents an agreement between states on a particular issue. However, if a treaty contradicts a well-established custom, the custom might prevail due to its long-standing legal significance. The role of general principles of law is to provide coherence and consistency in interpreting other sources of international law."
