It is not out of mere arrogance and perversity that I, an individual poor man, have taken upon me to address your lordships. The distress and misery that oppress all the Christian estates, more especially in Germany, have led not only myself, but every one else, to cry aloud and to ask for help. . . . These Romanists have, with great adroitness, drawn three walls around themselves, with which they have hitherto protected themselves, so that no one could reform them, whereby all Christendom has fallen terribly. . . . That the Temporal Power Has no Jurisdiction over the Spirituality . . . That No One May Interpret the Scriptures but the Pope . . . That No One May Call a Council but the Pope. . . . Let us now consider the matters which should be treated in the councils, and with which popes, cardinals, bishops, and all learned men should occupy themselves day and night. . . . It is a distressing and terrible thing to see that the head of Christendom, who boasts of being the vicar of Christ and the successor of St. Peter, lives in a worldly pomp that no king or emperor can equal. What is the use in Christendom of the people called \"cardinals\"? I will tell you. In Italy and Germany there are many rich convents, endowments, fiefs, and benefices, and as the best way of getting these into the hands of Rome, they created cardinals, and gave them the sees, convents, and prelacies, and thus destroyed the service of God.\n\u2014Martin Luther, Address to the Christian Nobility of the German Nation\nIn his letter, Martin Luther avoided speaking about which of the following topics?\n\nA. The wealth of the church\nB. The power of the clergy\nC. The sale of indulgences\nD. The political nature of the church\n"

Luther's letter is a detailed critique of several issues related to the Catholic Church during his time, including the accumulation of wealth by the church, the role and power of the clergy, the sale of indulgences, and the perceived political nature of the church. He criticizes these aspects, particularly focusing on how they detract from the true spiritual duties and the teachings of Christianity.\n\nTherefore, based on the context and content of Luther's Address to the Christian Nobility of the German Nation, it would not be accurate to say that he avoided speaking about any of the listed topics (A, B, C, or D. Instead, he directly addresses and criticizes each of these issues in his text."
