It was found in the Hohlenstein-Stadel cave in Germany. Mobiliary art refers to portable art objects that were moved around, rather than being painted on walls or other surfaces. This term distinguishes it from parietal art, which is art painted or carved onto walls. The \"Lion Man\" is also not a Venus figurine, which typically represent females with exaggerated female sexual characteristics. And while it's true that prehistoric people did engage in long-distance trade for materials, the \"Lion Man\" itself is an example of art created using local materials."
