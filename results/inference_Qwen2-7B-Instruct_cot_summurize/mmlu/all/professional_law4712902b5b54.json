A business owner owns the central parcel in fee simple and maintains his dwelling house thereon. He has a right-of-way, granted in a written agreement, across the eastern parcel for crossing the eastern parcel on foot, by bicycle, or automobile. A landscaper is the owner of the eastern parcel. An investor owns the western parcel and conveys it to the business owner in fee simple. The business owner then builds a 15-story office building, covering the western parcel and the central parcel, which houses 6,000 persons during working hours each day. All of these persons use the right-of-way over the eastern parcel, and the business owner uses the way for delivering as many as 30 loads of supplies per day to the office building. In an action by the landscaper to enjoin the business owner and the office workers from using the right- of-way across the eastern parcel, the court will most likely hold that\n\nA. the business owner's right-of-way would be extinguished due to excessive use by the office workers.\nB. the business owner's right-of-way would be forfeited due to the unauthorized use by the office workers.\nC. the business owner, by making use of the right-of-way beyond the scope of the original privilege, would permanently be enjoined from using the servient tenement.\nD.

                    "text": "In this scenario, the business owner has a right-of-way across the eastern parcel as granted by a written agreement. This right allows access for crossing on foot, by bicycle, or automobile. The question pertains to whether the business owner's right-of-way can be challenged or extinguished due to excessive use by the office workers occupying the building on the central and western parcels.\n\nThe correct answer is D: Although the business owner may continue to use the right-of-way, the office workers would be enjoined from making such use.\n\nExplanation:\n\n- **A** is incorrect because the mere fact that the number of people using the right-of-way exceeds what might have been anticipated when the right-of-way was granted does not necessarily mean the right-of-way is extinguished. The extent of use must be unreasonable or in violation of the terms of the agreement to be considered excessive.\n\n- **B** is incorrect because the term \"forfeit\" suggests a complete loss of rights, which is not necessarily the case here. The issue is not about a loss of rights but rather about potential limitations on how those rights can be exercised.\n\n- **C** is incorrect because while the business owner's use of the right-of-way for delivering supplies to the office building might be within the bounds of the original agreement, the use by the office workers (in the context of entering the building for work) is typically incidental to the business owner's rights under a right-of-way agreement. Unless the agreement explicitly limits who can use the right-of-way, the business owner's right is generally not subject to personal limitations based on the nature of the users.\n\n- **D** is the most accurate answer because it acknowledges that the business owner can continue to use the right-of-way for the purposes stated in the agreement, but it also recognizes that the office workers' use of the right-of-way might be restricted if it is found to be causing significant inconvenience, disturbance, or damage to the eastern parcel owner. The court might consider issuing an injunction against the office workers specifically, rather than against the business owner, if their use of the right-of-way is deemed inappropriate or excessive under the circumstances.\n\nIt's important to note that the specifics of such legal actions can vary significantly based on jurisdictional laws and the precise terms of the right-of-way agreement. However, in general, the principle that the business owner retains the right to use the right-of-way, but the office workers' use could be restricted under certain conditions, aligns with the concept that rights of way are subject to reasonable use and that restrictions might apply if the use becomes burdensome or violates the spirit of the agreement or local law."
