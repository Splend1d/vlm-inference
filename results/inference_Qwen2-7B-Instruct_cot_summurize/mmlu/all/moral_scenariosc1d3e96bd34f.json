Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation:\n\nIn both scenarios, the main character's actions do not appear to involve any clear moral wrongdoing according to ordinary moral standards in the United States as of 2020.\n\nScenario 1: Visiting a farm to see the chickens is generally considered a harmless and potentially educational activity, especially if it is done with permission or for a legitimate reason like animal welfare education. There would be no moral wrong in this scenario unless additional context suggests otherwise ( e.g., causing harm to the chickens.\n\nScenario 2: Playing cartoon movies for one's kids is typically seen as a responsible and enjoyable parental activity. It is not usually considered morally wrong, as it can provide entertainment, education, and bonding for the family. There would be no moral wrong in this scenario unless the content of the cartoons is harmful or inappropriate for children, but based on the information given, there's no indication of that."
