In this case, the school is buying 12 uniforms at $46 each. So, you calculate the total cost as follows:\n\nTotal Cost = Number of Uniforms * Cost per Uniform\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\nTotal Cost = 12 * $46\n\nThis can be simplified to:\n\nTotal Cost = (40 \u00d7 12) + (6 \u00d7 12)\n\nBecause 46 can be broken down into 40 and 6 ( (40+6=46). Thus, the correct equation is:\n\nC. (40 \u00d7 12) + (6 \u00d7 12) = 480 + 72"
