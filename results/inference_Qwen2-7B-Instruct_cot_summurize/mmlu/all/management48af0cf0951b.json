This is because it combines verbal, non-verbal, and contextual cues that allow for a more comprehensive understanding of the message being conveyed. In face-to-face interactions, you can observe body language, facial expressions, tone of voice, and other non-verbal signals that provide additional context and emotional depth to the conversation. These elements are often lost in other forms of communication such as emails, telephone calls, or video conferences."
