                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to find all integer solutions to the inequality $|n| < |n-3| < 9$. Let's break it down into two parts:\n\n### Part 1: $|n| < |n-3|$\n\nThis part of the inequality states that the absolute value of $n$ is less than the absolute value of $n-3$. This implies that $n$ is closer to 0 than it is to 3 on the number line.\n\n#### Case 1: $n \\geq 3$\n\nIf $n \\geq 3$, then $|n| = n$ and $|n-3| = n-3$. The inequality becomes:\n\\[n < n-3\\]\nwhich simplifies to:\n\\[0 < -3\\]\nThis is not possible since 0 cannot be less than -3. Therefore, there are are no solutions for $n \\geq 3$ in this case.\n\n#### Case 2: $n < 3$\n\nIf $n < 3$, then $|n| = -n$ ( (since $n$ is negative or zero) and $|n-3| = 3-n$. The inequality becomes:\n\\[-n < 3-n\\]\nSimplifying this gives:\n\\[0 < 3\\]\nwhich is always true. So, any $n < 3$ satisfies this part of the inequality. \n\n### Part 2: $|n-3| < 9$\n\nThis part of the inequality states that the absolute difference between $n$ and 3 is less than 9. This means $n$ can be in the range of $-6 < n < 12$ because if $n$ were outside this range, the distance from $n$ to 3 would exceed 9.\n\n### Combining Both Parts\n\nFrom Part 1, we know $n < 3$. From Part 2, we know $-6 < n < 12$. Combining these conditions, we get that $n$ must be in the range $-6 < n < 3$.\n\n### Finding Integer Solutions\n\nThe integer solutions within the range $-6 < n < 3$ are are:\n\\[n = -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2\\]\n\n### Summing the Solutions\n\nSumming these values gives:\n\\[\n-5 - 4 - 3 - 2 - 1 + 0 + 1 + 2 = -14\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **B. -14**."
