Over the course of time, the land development company developed two residential subdivisions of the land, an eastern development and a western development, each of which contained 150 acres. These subdivisions were created by separate plats that made no reference to each other. The restrictions in the plats were, however, substantially identical. The plats and each deed provided that \"the use of the land herein conveyed is restricted to single- family dwellings only, and this covenant is intended to apply to each and every lot in the subdivision and runs with the land, binding every lot owner, his heirs, and assigns. \"After all but four lots in each subdivision had been sold by the land development company, it sold 50 acres of the remaining 100 acres of land to a country club by a deed containing the following provisions:\"This deed is executed and accepted with the understanding that the property above described is hereby restricted so that(1) said property may be used as a country club, with a golf course, pool, tennis courts, club house, eating facilities, and other improvements appropriate to a country club. (2) said property may also be subdivided and platted as a residential subdivision similar to the eastern development and the property shall thereafter be used in accordance with and conveyed subject to residential restrictions that shall conform with those restrictions in force against the eastern development. (3) the restrictions herein contained shall be deemed covenants running with the land, and for breach of any covenant herein, grantor \u0080\u0094 land development company, its successors and assigns may, at its option, re-enter and terminate the estate conveyed hereby. \"At the time of this conveyance, the land development company retained title to the remaining 50 acres in the original 400-acre tract. Which of the following would best describe the country club's interest in the SO-acre tract that it purchased from the land development company?\n\nA. Fee simple determinable.\nB. Fee simple subject to condition subsequent.\nC. Determinable fee subject to an executory interest.\nD. Easement appurtenant.\n"

Fee simple subject to condition subsequent.\n\nThis type of estate means that the country club has a fee simple title to the 50-acre tract, but it is subject to conditions that can lead to loss of ownership if certain events occur. In this case, the conditions are outlined in the deed: the property must be used as a country club and can also be subdivided and platted as a residential subdivision in accordance with the restrictions of the eastern development. If these conditions are not met, the land development company ( the grantor in the deed, has the option to re-enter and terminate the estate conveyed. \n\nOptions A, C, and D do not accurately describe the situation presented in the deed. \n\n- A. Fee simple determinable implies that the estate will automatically end after a specified event occurs, without the possibility for the grantor to reclaim the property.\n- C. Determinable fee subject to an executory interest refers to a situation where the estate is terminable upon the happening of some uncertain event or condition, which differs from the clear and enforceable condition in the deed.\n- D. Easement appurtenant is a right or privilege that allows one to use the land of another for a specific purpose, rather than ownership of the land itself."
