The Moscow Treaty on Strategic Offensive Reductions, also known as New START (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty), was a bilateral treaty between the United States and Russia that entered into force in 2011. It aimed to reduce and limit strategic offensive arms, which includes long-range nuclear weapons and delivery systems. Under this treaty, both countries were required to reduce their deployed strategic nuclear warheads to no more than 1,550 each, and their deployed and non-deployed intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), submarine-launched ballistic missiles, and heavy bombers equipped with nuclear weapons to no more than 700 each. This treaty helped to reduce the number of nuclear weapons held by both nations and facilitated cooperation on arms control measures."
