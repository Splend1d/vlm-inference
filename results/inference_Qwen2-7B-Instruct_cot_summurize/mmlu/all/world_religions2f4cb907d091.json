Amitabha is a significant figure in Mahayana Buddhism, revered as the Buddha of Infinite Light and Infinite Life. He is particularly associated with the Western Paradise, also known as the Pure Land, where those who have faith in him and recite his name are said to be reborn there after death. This makes Amitabha especially venerated by those who wish to ensure the salvation of their loved ones, including deceased children."
