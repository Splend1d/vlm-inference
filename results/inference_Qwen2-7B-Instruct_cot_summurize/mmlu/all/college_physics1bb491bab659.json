                    "text": "To determine which wavelength is most strongly reflected, we need to calculate the reflectance for each wavelength and compare them. The phenomenon you're referring to is called destructive interference due to the thin film effect. When light travels through a thin film of oil on top of water, it undergoes multiple reflections at the air-oil and oil-water interfaces. \n\nThe condition for destructive interference in this case is given by the equation:\n\n\\[2d \\cdot n = m \\cdot \\lambda\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\(d\\) is the thickness of the oil layer,\n- \\(n\\) is the index of refraction of the oil (1.5),\n- \\(m\\) is an integer (representing the order of the interference ( typically \\(m = 1\\) for the first minimum, but higher orders can also lead to strong reflection),\n- \\(\\lambda\\) is the wavelength of light.\n\nFor the first minimum ( \\(m = 1\\), we have:\n\n\\[2 \\cdot 500 \\, \\text{nm} \\cdot 1.5 = \\lambda\\]\n\nSolving for \\(\\lambda\\):\n\n\\[\\lambda = \\frac{2 \\cdot 500 \\, \\text{nm} \\cdot 1.5}{1} = 1500 \\, \\text{nm}\\]\n\nThis means that the wavelength at which the first minimum occurs (and thus where the reflection is strongest, is 1500 nm. However, none of the options provided match this wavelength. \n\nGiven the options, we need to find which one comes closest to this calculation:\n\nA. 500 nm - too low, as it's less than the calculated wavelength for the first minimum.\nB. 550 nm - still below the calculated wavelength for the first minimum.\nC. 600 nm - still below the calculated wavelength for the first minimum.\nD. 650 nm - still below the calculated wavelength for the first minimum.\n\nNone of the options exactly matches our calculation. However, since the question seems to imply choosing the option that would be most strongly reflected based on the thin film interference principle, and given the options, **Option D ( 650 nm** would be the closest to the wavelength that could potentially exhibit a strong reflection effect under different conditions not directly accounted for in the question's setup (.\n\nIn reality, the correct approach would involve a more detailed analysis considering the phase difference at the interfaces and the specific conditions of the experiment, which wasn't provided."
