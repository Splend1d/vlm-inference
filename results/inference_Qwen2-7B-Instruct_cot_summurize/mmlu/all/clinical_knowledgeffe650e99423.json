Grade 3/5 on the Medical Research Council (MRC scale indicates that the muscle has some strength but cannot perform a full range of movement against gravity. It does not mean the arm can move only when gravity is eliminated; rather, it means that with gravity present, the muscle is able to produce some movement but not a full range of motion.\n\nB. Flexion at the elbow is actually produced by the biceps brachii muscle, not the triceps muscle. The triceps muscle primarily helps with extension of the elbow joint.\n\nC. The root value of shoulder abduction is actually C5, not C4. Shoulder abduction involves the upper part of the neck and is controlled by the nerves originating from the C5 spinal nerve level.\n\nTherefore, option D is the accurate statement among the provided options."
