One dark evening before the street lights turned on, Rover was chasing cars in the street, and Ginny Grandmother, aged 85, swerved to avoid hitting the dog. As she swerved, Ginny hit a parked car and suffered a head injury. If Ginny brings suit against Doug Dogman under a strict liability theory, the court will likely find for\n\nA. Ginny, because Doug's dog was a cause in fact of Ginny's injuries.\nB. Doug, because Retriever is a domesticated animal.\nC. Doug, unless a statute or ordinance bans unleashed dogs on public streets.\nD. Doug, because the strict liability rule for dogs would not include dogs not displaying vicious propensities.\n"

Doug, unless a statute or ordinance bans unleashed dogs on public streets.\n\nUnder a strict liability theory, the owner (in this case, Doug Dogman, is held liable for damages caused by their animal regardless of the animal's behavior or the owner's intent. However, this liability can be mitigated or negated if there are are specific laws or ordinances in place that regulate the situation. For instance, if there is a statute or ordinance that specifically bans dogs from being out on public streets without being leashed, and Doug was violating that law by allowing Rover to roam freely, this could potentially exonerate him in a lawsuit brought by Ginny. This is because the violation of such a law might be considered contributory negligence on his part, which could be used as a defense against liability."
