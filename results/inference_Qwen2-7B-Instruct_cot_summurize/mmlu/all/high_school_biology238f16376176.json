These differences can be quite pronounced, especially in traits like size, coloration, or secondary sexual characteristics. Sexual dimorphism typically arises due to intersexual selection, which is the process by which one sex (usually males) selects mates based on traits displayed by the other sex. This can lead to exaggerated traits in one sex that may not necessarily be advantageous for survival but increase reproductive success.\n\nFor example, in peacocks, the large and colorful tail feathers are a result of female peafowl selecting males with these traits as potential mates, despite the fact that such large tails make it more difficult for males to escape predators."
