The degree to which the school interest inventory score raises the multiple correlation when it is included as a predictor variable of first-year high school GPA\n\nThis is because including a new predictor variable should ideally increase the predictive power of the model, i.e., the ability of the model to explain the variance in the dependent variable (in this case, first-year high school GPA. If adding the school interest inventory does not significantly increase the multiple correlation, its contribution to the prediction of GPA might be minimal or even redundant if it correlates highly with already included predictors like achievement and aptitude scores. \n\nConsidering intercorrelations among predictors ( (Option A) can also be relevant to avoid multicollinearity issues, which can inflate standard errors and reduce the reliability of the regression coefficients. The zero-order correlation ( (Option C) between the school interest inventory score and first-year high school GPA can provide some initial insight into the potential relationship, but it doesn't necessarily indicate how much that variable will contribute to the overall predictive model. The difference in correlations with other predictors ( (Option D) ) could also be informative, but ultimately, the question is about the incremental value of the new variable in the context of the entire model's explanatory power."
