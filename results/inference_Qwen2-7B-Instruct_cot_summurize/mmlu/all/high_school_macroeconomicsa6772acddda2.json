M2 includes savings deposits.\n\nM1 and M2 are terms used in macroeconomics to describe different measures of the money supply in an economy. \n\nM1 typically includes the most liquid forms of money, such as physical currency, demand deposits (checking accounts), and other highly liquid items like traveler's checks and coins. It represents the money that is readily available for spending or investment.\n\nM2, on the other hand, expands upon M1 by including less liquid but still relatively easily convertible assets. This includes savings deposits, small time deposits (like certificates of deposit under $100,000), and money market funds. Essentially, M2 encompasses all the components of M1 plus these additional, slightly less liquid assets."
