Convert to cups ( (Note: 1 gallon = 16 cups)\n\\[3.75 \\text{ gallons} \\times 16 \\text{ cups/gallon} = 60 \\text{ cups}\\]\nSo, A is equivalent to \\(3\\frac{3}{4}\\) gallons.\n\nB. Convert to quarts ( (Note: 1 gallon = 4 quarts)\n\\[3.75 \\text{ gallons} \\times 4 \\text{ quarts/gallon} = 15 \\text{ quarts}\\]\nSo, B is equivalent to \\(3\\frac{3}{4}\\) gallons.\n\nC. Convert to pints ( (Note: 1 gallon = 8 pints)\n\\[3.75 \\text{ gallons} \\times 8 \\text{ pints/gallon} = 30 \\text{ pints}\\]\nSo, C is equivalent to \\(3\\frac{3}{4}\\) gallons.\n\nD. Convert to quarts ( (Note: 1 gallon = 4 quarts)\nWe already calculated that \\(3\\frac{3}{4}\\) gallons is equal to 15 quarts, so directly converting:\n\\[3.75 \\text{ gallons} = 15 \\text{ quarts}\\]\nThis seems to imply D should also be correct based on our initial calculation, but let's clarify the confusion in the explanation for D. The correct understanding is that 3.75 gallons equals 15 quarts, which matches option B. Therefore, there was a misunderstanding in the explanation leading to option D being incorrectly considered equivalent initially. Let's correct this:\n\nUpon reevaluation, we notice that the direct conversion from 3.75 gallons to quarts was correctly identified as 15 quarts, aligning with option B. This means option D, \"13 quarts,\" is the correct answer to identify as NOT equivalent to \\(3\\frac{3}{4}\\) gallons, as it does not match our conversion.\n\nThus, the correct answer is **D. 13 qt**."
