Solar eclipses would be much rarer.\n\nThe reason for this is that the current inclination of the Moon's orbit relative to the ecliptic plane (about 5.145\u00b0, allows for a variety of alignment scenarios that result in different types of eclipses: total, partial, and annular. When the Moon orbits within the ecliptic plane, it would always align with the Earth and Sun, but due to the slight inclination of its orbit, we do not have solar eclipses every month. Instead, there are about 2 to 5 solar eclipses per year globally. If the Moon's orbit were exactly aligned with the ecliptic, the Moon would always pass directly between the Earth and the Sun during its orbit, leading to solar eclipses every month. However, since the Moon's orbit is also elliptical and the distance between the Earth and Moon varies, not all of these would result in a total eclipse, which requires the Moon to be at a specific phase and distance from the Earth. Thus, while there would be more eclipses overall, not all would be total, making them less impactful in terms of duration and visibility, and they would occur more frequently than currently, but not necessarily every month. The other options ( B, C, and D - regarding duration, frequency, and whether eclipses would not last as long, do not directly follow from the alignment of the Moon's orbit with the ecliptic plane in the way described above."
