Women can achieve equality through political pressure.\n\nMacKinnon's argument suggests that the issue of gender inequality is rooted in power imbalances between men and women, which are largely influenced by societal structures and cultural norms defined by men. Her perspective implies that simply applying political pressure might not address the underlying power dynamics and systemic issues that perpetuate gender inequality. Instead, she advocates for legal reforms and recognition of gender as a socially constructed category rather than a biological fact, which she believes are central to achieving true equality. Therefore, an approach that assumes women can solely achieve equality through political means overlooks the systemic nature of gender inequality that MacKinnon focuses on."
