However, they do not perfectly describe phenomena at everyday low speeds. At these lower speeds, classical mechanics ( like Newton's laws of motion) provides a very good approximation of reality, and the differences introduced by special relativity are negligible. As speeds increase towards the speed of light, the effects described by special relativity become more pronounced and cannot be ignored.\n\nSo while these relativistic equations are theoretically applicable at all speeds, their accuracy and practical relevance are limited to scenarios involving speeds close to that of light. At everyday low speeds, simpler, non-relativistic physics suffice."
