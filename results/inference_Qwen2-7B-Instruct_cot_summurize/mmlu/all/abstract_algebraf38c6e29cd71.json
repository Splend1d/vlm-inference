Let's examine this.\n\nRecall that by definition, for any elements \\(a, b\\) in a group \\(G\\), their product \\(ab\\) has an inverse \\((ab)^{-1}\\) such that \\((ab)(ab)^{-1} = e\\), where \\(e\\) is the identity element of \\(G\\).\n\nGiven: \\((ab)^{-1} = a^{-1}b^{-1}\\)\n\nTo understand what this means, let's apply the definition of inverses and try to simplify:\n\n\\[ab(ab)^{-1} = a(a^{-1}b^{-1})b = ( e\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[ab(a^{-1}b^{-1}) = e\\]\n\nBy rearranging, we get:\n\n\\[b^{-1}a^{-1} = ( (ab)^{-1}\\]\n\nComparing this with our given condition, we see that:\n\n\\[b^{-1}a^{-1} = a^{-1}b^{-1}\\]\n\nThis equality holds for all \\(a, b \\in G\\), which means that for any two elements in \\(G\\), the order in which their inverses are applied does not matter. This directly implies that \\(G\\) is an **abelian** group, as the operation of taking inverses commutes with each other for all elements in \\(G\\).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. abelian group"
