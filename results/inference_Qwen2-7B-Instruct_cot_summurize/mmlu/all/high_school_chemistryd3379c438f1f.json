CuCl2.\n\nIn chemical nomenclature, Roman numerals are used to indicate the charge of a metal ion (cation when it's necessary for distinguishing between multiple possible charges. Copper (Cu has two common oxidation states: +1 and +2. In the compound CuCl2, copper can either be in its +1 state or +2 state depending on the context. To specify the oxidation state, we use Roman numerals:\n\n- For CuCl2 with copper in its +1 state: Cupric chloride\n- For CuCl2 with copper in its +2 state: Cuprous chloride\n\nTherefore, the name of CuCl2 should include Roman numerals to denote the oxidation state of copper."
