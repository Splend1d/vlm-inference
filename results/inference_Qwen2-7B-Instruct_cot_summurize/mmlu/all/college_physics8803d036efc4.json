                    "text": "Einstein's theory of the photoelectric effect describes how light can eject electrons from a metal surface, or in other words, how light can cause an electron to be released from its atom. The key points of this theory are:\n\n- The energy of a photon is directly proportional to its frequency (E = h\u03bd, where E is the energy, \u03bd is the frequency, and h is Planck's constant.\n- The minimum energy required to free an electron from the metal surface is known as the work function (\u03a6.\n- For a given metal, the work function \u03a6 is a fixed value.\n\nBased on these principles, the correct answer would be:\n\nD. Potential difference necessary to stop the emitted electrons is a linear function of the frequency above the threshold frequency.\n\nThe reason for this is that the kinetic energy of the ejected electrons depends on the frequency of the incident light, as higher frequency light provides more energy per photon, allowing electrons to have higher kinetic energies. However, this relationship only holds true above the threshold frequency, which is the minimum frequency of light required to overcome the work function and release an electron from the metal surface. Below this threshold frequency, no amount of light will cause the emission of electrons."
