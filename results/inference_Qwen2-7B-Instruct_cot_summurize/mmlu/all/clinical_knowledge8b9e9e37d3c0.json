Pain assessments often rely heavily on self-reports from patients because they are the only ones who truly experience the sensation. While there are various tools and scales ( like the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS), Faces Pain Scale - Revised ( FPS-R, etc., these are primarily based on patient's perception and report. Therefore, healthcare staff do not have an objective way of assessing pain solely through observation or tests; they need the patient's self-report to understand the severity of pain experienced by the patient."
