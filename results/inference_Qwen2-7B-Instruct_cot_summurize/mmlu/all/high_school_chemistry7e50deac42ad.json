The number of molecules in all the containers is the same.\n\nThis statement is false because the number of molecules in each container depends on the molar amount of the gas (n = moles and Avogadro's number, which relates to the number of molecules per mole (N_A = 6.022 x 10^23 mol^-1. \n\nTo calculate the number of molecules, we can use the ideal gas law: PV = nRT, where P is pressure, V is volume, n is the number of moles, R is the ideal gas constant, and T is temperature. Assuming that the temperature and volume are constant for all gases, we can rewrite this equation as:\n\nn = (PV/RT\n\nSince the temperature and volume are assumed to be constant, we can see that the number of moles (n is directly proportional to the mass (m of the gas (in the form of m = nM, where M is the molar mass). \n\nGiven the masses of the gases:\n- Helium (He: 4.0 g\n- Nitrogen N_2: 28.0 g\n- Carbon Dioxide CO_2: 44.0 g\n\nWe can calculate their respective m = m/M values:\n\n- Helium: \\( \\frac{4.0}{4.00\\,g/mol} = 1.00\\,mol \\)\n- Nitrogen: \\( \\frac{28.0}{28.0\\,g/mol} = 1.00\\,mol \\)\n- Carbon Dioxide: \\( \\frac{44.0}{44.0\\,g/mol} = 1.00\\,mol \\)\n\nFrom this calculation, it becomes clear that the number of moles (n (is the same for all gases since they have been calculated to be 1.00 mol each. Thus, the number of molecules in each container is the same, making statement B true, not false. \n\nThe other statements ( A, C, and D could be true under certain conditions ( but without more information or clarification about the conditions under which these statements are evaluated, we cannot conclusively state that they are always true. However, based solely on the information given and assuming standard conditions, statement B is the false statement among the options provided."
