The man's and the nephew's lots were in an unimproved natural state. The son, however, had lived for 10 years in a house that he had built on his property. In 2009, the man planted trees and shrubbery on his land along the boundary of the nephew's lot. In 2010, the nephew, in preparation for building a house on his lot, carefully excavated an area eight feet deep for the purpose of building a basement. The side of the excavation closest to the man \u0080\u0094 nephew boundary suddenly collapsed, and a quantity of the man's soil, trees, and shrubbery fell into the hole. The nephew hauled away the debris. In an appropriate action by the man against the nephew to recover for the damage to his land, judgment should be for whom?\n\nA. The nephew, if he was conducting the excavation work non-negligently.\nB. The nephew, because he was under no duty to support the man's land in its improved state.\nC. The man, because a landowner is entitled to support of his land in its natural condition.\nD. The man, because a landowner has an absolute right to have his land supported by the neighboring land.\n"

The man, because a landowner is entitled to support of his land in its natural condition.\n\nThe situation presented here involves a legal concept known as lateral and subjacent support, which refers to the obligation of one landowner to support the land of an adjacent landowner when the support of the land is necessary for its natural use or condition. In this case, the man's land was in an unimproved natural state when the nephew excavated an area for building a basement, causing a collapse and damage to the man's land. As such, the man would likely have grounds for a claim against the nephew based on the principle of lateral and subjacent support. Therefore, the appropriate judgment would likely be in favor of the man."
