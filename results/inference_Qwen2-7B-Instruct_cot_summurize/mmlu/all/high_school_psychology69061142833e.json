This is because PKU is caused by a genetic disorder that affects the body's ability to break down the amino acid phenylalanine. A low-phenylalanine diet can help manage PKU and prevent intellectual disabilities and other health problems associated with the condition.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that:\n\nA. Tay-Sachs syndrome is an inherited disorder that cannot be prevented or cured through diet. It involves a lack of the enzyme hexosaminidase A in the body, leading to progressive neurological damage. There is no known cure, but treatments aim to manage symptoms and improve quality of life.\n\nC. Huntington's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the presence of a specific gene mutation. While there is currently no cure for Huntington's disease, dietary changes may help alleviate some symptoms and potentially slow disease progression, but they cannot prevent the expression of the trait.\n\nD. Down syndrome is not caused by a single gene but rather an extra copy of chromosome 21. There is no known diet that can prevent the expression of the traits associated with Down syndrome. However, proper care and early intervention can help individuals with Down syndrome lead fulfilling lives."
