A defendant was marooned on a desert island, along with a victim and another sailor after their boat capsized during a violent storm at sea. The three sailors had gone without food for two weeks and were on the verge of dying of starvation. Each of the sailors, however, still had a small amount of water left in their canteens with which to subsist. One night, the defendant took the water from the victim's canteen and poured it into his own canteen while the victim slept. The defendant did this in the hope that the extra water would make it possible for him to live a couple of more days so that he would be able to walk across the island to look for help. The next day, the victim died from starvation and dehydration. Two days later, the defendant and the other sailor were rescued. The defendant never walked across the island because he was too weak from body weight loss.\nB. A defendant and a victim were on a hiking expedition together. They were longtime hiking buddies who had climbed many steep and precipitous mountains in the past. As the defendant and the victim were climbing a dangerously steep incline, their ropes suddenly became entangled. As a result of the entanglement, the victim fell 50 feet before he was able to regain his balance and footing. However, the victim's fall caused the defendant to lose his balance, and he was in jeopardy of falling off the mountain. In order to avoid falling, the defendant cut the safety rope that held the victim. This caused the victim to fall 400 feet to his death.\nC. A defendant, who was intoxicated, was driving his car home along a heavily traveled highway. In his inebriated condition, the defendant was swerving his vehicle across the highway. Suddenly, a school bus loaded with children made a wrong turn and headed directly into the path of the defendant's auto. In order to avoid crashing head-on with the school bus, the defendant turned his vehicle onto the sidewalk and struck a victim, a paraplegic, who was confined to a wheelchair. The defendant's auto crushed the victim to death.\nD. A defendant, a bank teller, was on duty when two robbers held up the bank. She was taken hostage and ordered to drive their getaway car. As they were being pursued by the police, the defendant was commanded to drive excessively fast to avoid being captured. While driving at a speed of nearly 100 M. P. H. , the defendant approached a busy intersection and saw the victim, a blind person, with a guide dog walking across the street. She slowed down to avoid hitting the pedestrian with the dog. As she did so, one of the robbers stuck a gun against her head and threatened to kill her if she didn't speed through the intersection. Afraid she would be murdered, the defendant accelerated into the path of the victim, killing him and his guide dog.\n"

He acted in self-defense to ensure his survival, taking water from the victim's canteen to extend his own life chances. This action can be considered a form of necessity defense, as the defendant was acting to save his own life under extreme duress.\n\nThe other scenarios involve different forms of criminal actions or accidents:\n\n- **B.** The defendant's action of cutting the safety rope was intentional and led to the victim's death, making it less likely that a necessity defense would apply.\n- **C.** Although the defendant's action was unintentional ( he did not intend to hit the paraplegic, the intoxication and the severity of the accident might lead to criminal liability, especially considering the potential foreseeability of harm.\n- **D.** The defendant was compelled to commit a crime (driving fast and endanger others) by the robbers, but the decision to accelerate towards a pedestrian was a direct consequence of that compulsion. The necessity defense may not fully apply here due to the defendant's awareness of the danger posed to the pedestrian and the choice to prioritize her own safety over that of the victim.\n\nIn summary, option A presents the clearest case for a necessity defense, where the defendant acted under immediate life-threatening circumstances to preserve his own life."
