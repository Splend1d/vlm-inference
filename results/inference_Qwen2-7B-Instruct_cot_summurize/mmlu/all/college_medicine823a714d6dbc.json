However, in the case of intermittent high-intensity exercise (which is often associated with activities like sprinting or weightlifting, the metabolic demands on the body can be managed effectively due to the short bursts of activity. The body adapts by increasing glucose uptake and utilization from the blood to meet these demands. \n\nFor this type of exercise, the blood glucose concentration tends to remain stable or even slightly increase if the individual has adequate carbohydrate intake before or during the exercise session. This is because the body can utilize stored glycogen rapidly and efficiently during high-intensity exercise, and the increase in metabolic rate can also stimulate the release of glucose into the bloodstream. Therefore, options A, C, and D do not accurately describe the typical response of blood glucose levels during intermittent high-intensity exercise."
