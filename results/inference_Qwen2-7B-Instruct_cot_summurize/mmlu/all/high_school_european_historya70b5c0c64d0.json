The success of the revolution discredited conservative ideas; the failure of the revolution discredited liberal ideas. After it, nothing remained but the idea of Force, and this idea stood at the helm of German history from then on. For the first time since 1521, the German people stepped on to the centre of the German stage only to miss their cue once more. German history reached its turning-point and failed to turn. This was the fateful essence of 1848.\nA. J. P. Taylor, The Course of German History, 1945\nThe subject of Taylor's analysis in this quotation is\n\nA. the industrial revolution in the context of German history\nB. the failure of the revolutions of 1848\nC. the rise of the Nazi Party in Germany\nD. the importance of the revolutions of 1848 in modern German history\n"
