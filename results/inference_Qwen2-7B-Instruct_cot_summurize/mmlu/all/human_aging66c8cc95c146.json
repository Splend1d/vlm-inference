However, considering that bridge jobs are typically short-term or temporary roles taken to gain experience, fill gaps in employment, or pursue other opportunities, it's reasonable to infer that many might perceive them as less fulfilling than permanent careers due to factors such as benefits, stability, and career progression.\n\nGiven this context:\n\n- A. Less than 25% might be too low, as some individuals might find value in bridge jobs for specific reasons (e.g., gaining new skills, improving resume, or financial necessity.\n- B. Less than 50% seems plausible if we consider that most people might still view their career jobs as more beneficial overall.\n- C. More than 50% is less likely based on general perceptions, but it could be true for a subset of people who have faced significant challenges in their primary careers or who found exceptional value in a particular bridge job.\n- D. More than 75% would be quite high and would require substantial evidence to support such a claim, as it would suggest that the majority of people view their bridge jobs as superior to their career jobs.\n\nWithout exact data, it's challenging to provide a precise answer. However, based on the typical nature and purpose of bridge jobs, options A or B seem more likely, with option C being a possibility depending on the specific circumstances and personal values of those surveyed. For an accurate answer, one would need access to recent, comprehensive surveys or studies on job satisfaction that include both career jobs and bridge jobs."
