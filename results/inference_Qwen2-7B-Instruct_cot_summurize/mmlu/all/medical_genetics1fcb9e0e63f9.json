Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified many single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that contribute to the genetic variation of BMI, but they collectively explain only a small portion (around 5%) of the variation in BMI. The discrepancy between this finding and the higher heritability estimates from twin and family studies is attributed to the complexity of the genetic architecture of BMI, which involves many genes with small effects, as well as environmental factors."
