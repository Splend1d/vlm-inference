If n is large, no matter what the distribution of the original population.\n\nThis statement refers to the Central Limit Theorem ( which states that given a sufficiently large sample size from a population with a finite level of variance, the mean of all samples from the same population will be approximately equal to the mean of the population. Furthermore, the standard deviation of the sample means (also known as the standard error) will be smaller than that of the population, and the distribution of the sample means will approach a normal distribution, regardless of the shape of the population distribution.\n\nTo clarify why the other options are incorrect:\n\nA. While it's true that if the original population is normally distributed, then the sampling distribution of the sample mean will also be normal regardless of the sample size, this option incorrectly specifies that n must be large for the distribution of the sample mean to be normal when the population is already normal.\n\nB. Knowing the standard deviation of the original population is important in certain calculations and in understanding the variability of the data, but it is not a condition for the sampling distribution of the sample mean to approximate a normal distribution according to the Central Limit Theorem. \n\nD. This option incorrectly suggests that the sampling distribution of the sample mean will always be normal, regardless of the population distribution and the sample size. This is not accurate because the Central Limit Theorem specifically requires a sufficiently large sample size for the approximation to hold true, especially when the population distribution is not normal."
