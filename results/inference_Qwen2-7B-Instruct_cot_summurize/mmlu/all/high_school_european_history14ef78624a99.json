The abolition of feudal dues and rents\n\nThe French Revolution brought significant changes to the feudal system, which had been a part of French society for centuries. Feudal dues and rents were obligations imposed by the nobility and clergy on the peasants who worked their lands. These obligations could include payments in cash or kind, labor services, and other demands that significantly burdened the peasants.\n\nOne of the key grievances of the peasants during the pre-revolutionary period was the heavy taxation and feudal obligations they faced, which often exceeded their capacity to pay. The French Revolution aimed to address these issues by abolishing feudal privileges and the associated dues and rents. This change was highly approved of by the peasants, as it reduced their financial burdens and helped to dismantle the traditional power structures that had oppressed them for generations.\n\nTherefore, among the options provided, the abolition of feudal dues and rents (option B) is the most approved change by the peasants of France during the French Revolution."
