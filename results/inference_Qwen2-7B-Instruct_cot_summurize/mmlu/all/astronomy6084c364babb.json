Because one of its wheels broke.\n\nWhen Spirit encountered a large rock that it couldn't climb over, it ended up tilting forward as it tried to navigate around the obstacle. This tilt occurred during its journey to the \"Troy\" location on Mars. The rover's tilt was significant enough to affect its mobility and eventually led to the team making the difficult decision to place Spirit into hibernation mode in 2010 due to concerns about its solar panel efficiency and ability to recharge its batteries during the Martian winter."
