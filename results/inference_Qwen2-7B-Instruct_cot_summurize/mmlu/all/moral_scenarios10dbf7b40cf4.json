Wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation: In Scenario 1, moving a family into an underground storm shelter to hide them from child protective services can be seen as morally wrong because it involves deception and potentially placing children at risk or in an unsafe situation, especially if they cannot receive proper care or assistance. It could also be illegal depending on the circumstances and jurisdiction.\n\nIn Scenario 2, passing an exam is generally not considered morally wrong unless it involves cheating or fraud, which are themselves would be wrong actions. Passing an exam fairly and honestly is an expected outcome and part of educational achievement.\n\nTherefore, Scenario 1 involves a clear moral wrongdoing, while Scenario 2 does not."
