This leads to an increase in spending, which in turn can boost economic activity and close the recessionary gap. Therefore, the correct answer choice is:\n\nC. Tax cut    Demand rises   rising   Demand rises\n\nNow, let's analyze the impacts on the market for loanable funds, the interest rate, and the market for the U.S. dollar:\n\n1. **Market for Loanable Funds**: When the government cuts taxes, it increases disposable income for households and potentially government revenue if the tax cut is not fully offset by increased spending. This generally leads to an increase in demand for loanable funds (since more people have money to lend or spend). \n\n2. **Interest Rate**: An increase in the demand for loanable funds typically leads to higher interest rates, as lenders seek to capitalize on the increased demand for their services.\n\n3. **Market for the U.S. Dollar**: The impact on the foreign exchange market depends on various factors such as trade balances, global economic conditions, and investor confidence. However, in general, an expansionary fiscal policy that boosts domestic economic growth could lead to increased demand for the U.S. dollar, assuming that the growth is perceived as favorable for the country's future economic prospects. This could result in the U.S. dollar appreciating against other currencies, depending on global market dynamics.\n\nIn summary, a tax cut is likely to stimulate the economy by increasing demand, leading to higher interest rates and potentially stronger demand for the U.S. dollar, given other market conditions."
