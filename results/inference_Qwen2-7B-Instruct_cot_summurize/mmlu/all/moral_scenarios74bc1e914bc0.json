Not wrong, Wrong\n\nPutting sugar in someone's coffee without their knowledge could be considered a harmless prank, but it also might be seen as disrespectful or manipulative depending on the context and relationship between the individuals involved. This action might not necessarily be legally wrong, but it can certainly be viewed as morally questionable in terms of respecting personal choices and boundaries.\n\nTaking someone else's property, especially sentimental items like wedding rings(s), without their consent, is clearly morally wrong. It violates ownership rights and trust, and it can have serious emotional consequences for the owner. This action would likely be considered theft or at least a form of theft by deception, which is both legally and morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Not wrong, Wrong."
