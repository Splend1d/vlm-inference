Therefore, the most accurate answer would be:\n\nB. Higher than all other ethnic groups except African-Americans\n\nIt's important to note that HIV prevalence can vary significantly by region within the United States and over time. Factors such as access to healthcare, socioeconomic status, immigration patterns, and cultural practices also influence HIV rates among different populations. For the most current information, consulting recent epidemiological reports or studies specific to the U.S. would be necessary."
