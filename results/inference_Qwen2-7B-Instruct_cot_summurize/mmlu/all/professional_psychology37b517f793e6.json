This style involves leaders giving clear instructions and setting explicit expectations, which can enhance subordinates' understanding of their roles and tasks, leading to increased productivity and job satisfaction. \n\nIn the context of the path-goal theory, instrumental leadership acts as a directive behavior that removes barriers to task completion, making it easier for subordinates to achieve their goals. This approach is particularly beneficial when subordinates need clear guidance or when the environment is complex and ambiguous. By providing clear rules and procedures, leaders facilitate a smoother workflow and help subordinates navigate their tasks more effectively, thus increasing their motivation and satisfaction."
