The symmetric group \\(S_n\\), which consists of all permutations of \\(n\\) elements, is non-Abelian (i.e., not commutative) for all \\(n \\geq 3\\). This means that for any two permutations \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) in \\(S_n\\) where \\(n \\geq 3\\), it is generally the case that \\(ab \\neq ba\\). For example, consider the permutations \\(a = ( (1 2)\\) and \\(b = ( (1 3)\\) in \\(S_3\\). Then \\(ab = (1 2)(1 3) = (1 2 3)\\) but \\(ba = (1 3)(1 2) = (1 3 2)\\), showing that \\(ab \\neq ba\\).\n\n**Statement 2**: If \\(a\\) is a permutation that is an \\(m\\)-cycle and \\(b\\) is a permutation that is an \\(n\\)-cycle, then \\(\\lvert ab \\rvert = \\text{lcm}(m,n)\\).\n\nThis statement is **False**. The order of the product of two permutations, \\(ab\\), does not necessarily equal the least common multiple (lcm of their orders \\(m\\) and \\(n\\). The order of the product of two cycles depends on how they interact. Specifically, if \\(a\\) is an \\(m\\)-cycle and \\(b\\) is an \\(n\\)-cycle with \\(m \\neq n\\), then \\(ab\\) will be an \\(mn/\\gcd(m,n)\\)-cycle, where \\(\\gcd\\) stands for the greatest common divisor. This is because cycles commute when their lengths are coprime ( i.e., when \\(\\gcd(m,n) = 1\\), but in general, the order of the product is determined by the least common multiple of the cycle lengths divided by their greatest common divisor.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **C. True, False**."
