The woman discovered that the service was selling her personal profile information, and the information pertaining to thousands of other members, to third party purchasers for tracking of their Internet activities and buying habits. In her class action breach of contract action against the service, she alleged two theories of damages. First, she contended that she and the class members suffered \"embarrassment and humiliation\" from the disclosure, and second, that she and the others must be compensated for the market value of the information seized. Will the court likely recognize these allegations as sufficient to state a claim for breach of contract?\n\nA. Yes, because the service breached the duty of good faith inherent in every contract.\nB. Yes, because these are common types of damages that are authorized in breach of contract cases.\nC. No, because Internet laws protect absolutely all communications and downloads of this nature as part of the service's guaranteed scope of free speech rights.\nD. No, because humiliation is not an item of damages in a breach of contract case, and the unauthorized collection of personal data does not establish an economic loss.\n"

Yes, because these are common types of damages that are authorized in breach of contract cases.\n\nIn a breach of contract case, the court will typically consider whether the plaintiff has adequately alleged that the defendant failed to perform the contractual obligations as agreed upon, resulting in damages to the plaintiff. The two theories of damages presented by the woman - embarrassment and humiliation, and compensation for the market value of the information seized - both potentially fall within the realm of damages that could be recognized in such a case.\n\nEmbarrassment and humiliation can often be considered as non-economic damages, which are compensable in breach of contract actions if they are a foreseeable result of the breach. These damages are not always explicitly listed in a contract but can still be recoverable under the doctrine of restitution or quantum meruit, depending on the circumstances.\n\nAs for the second theory, seeking compensation for the market value of the information seized, this would likely be categorized as a form of economic damages. If the plaintiff can prove that the service's actions resulted in a quantifiable loss (for instance, if the information was used to manipulate market prices or influence consumer behavior to the detriment of the plaintiff's business interests, then this could indeed be a valid basis for damages.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the specifics of the case, including the exact terms of the contract, the jurisdiction's laws regarding contract damages, and the evidence presented by the plaintiff, would ultimately determine whether these claims are sufficiently stated."
