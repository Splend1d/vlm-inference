The LCM of 5 and 2 is 10, meaning both computers will back up simultaneously every 10 minutes.\n\nThere are are 6 10-minute intervals in an hour ( (since there are are 60 minutes in an hour), so there are are \\( \\frac{60}{10} = 6 \\) instances where they back up simultaneously in one hour.\n\nGiven that there are are 24 hours in a day, the total number of simultaneous backups within 24 hours would be \\( 24 \\times 6 = 144 \\).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. 144."
