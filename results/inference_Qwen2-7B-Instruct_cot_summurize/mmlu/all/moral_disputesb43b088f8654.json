It is about whether something or someone deserves moral attention and respect. When we say that a person or thing \"needs to be taken into account\" in moral decision-making, it means they have moral standing. This implies that their interests, well-being, or rights should be considered when making ethical choices.\n\nThe other options you've listed do not necessarily follow from having moral standing:\n\nB. Moral permissibility refers to whether an action is allowed or not within certain moral frameworks. It is about the rightness or wrongness of actions, not about the entities that might be affected by those actions.\n\nC. Viability refers to the ability of something to exist or succeed. While this might be relevant in some contexts, it does not capture the essence of moral standing, which is about moral consideration rather than survival or success.\n\nD. Given the explanation above, saying that having moral standing includes \"all of the above\" would not be accurate because moral standing is specifically about being considered as a moral subject, while moral permissibility and viability are separate concepts related to actions and existence, respectively."
