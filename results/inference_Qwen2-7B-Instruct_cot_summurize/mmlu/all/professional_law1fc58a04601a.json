Shortly thereafter, the investor prepared a subdivision plan, which created 90 one-acre residential building lots on this tract with the remaining 10-acre lot proposed for a public school building. In the investor's sales brochure promoting the subdivision, he stated that \"in addition to the close proximity of the proposed school for subdivision residents, the county school district would not need to expend tax money to acquire this property for school construction. \" In 1996, the subdivision plan was recorded with the county recorder's office. During the next few years, the investor sold 50 residential lots to individual purchasers. In 2002, the investor conveyed the remaining 40 lots and the 10-acre tract to a builder by deed that included language identical to that contained in the first 50 deeds. By 2007, the builder had sold all of the 40 lots. Each of these deeds identified each lot as being a part of the subdivision. On January 9, 2008, the builder sold the 10-acre tract to a buyer. This deed made no mention of the subdivision. On January 15, 2008, the county school board voted to build a new school on the 10-acre tract. Two weeks later, the buyer began construction of a pizzeria on the 10-acre tract. In an action by the school board against the buyer to enjoin construction of the pizzeria on the 10-acre tract, the court would grant judgment for\n\nA. the buyer, because his own deed made no mention of the subdivision.\nB. the buyer, because the dedication was not made to the public in general.\nC. the school district, because the 10-acre tract was designated for public use.\nD. the school district, because the 10-acre tract constituted an equitable servitude.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is C. the school district, because the 10-acre tract was designated for public use.\n\nThe key facts that support this conclusion are:\n\n1. The investor originally planned to use the 10-acre lot for a public school when preparing the subdivision plan in 1995.\n2. The investor promoted the subdivision in a sales brochure stating that the proposed school would be close to the residential lots and that the county school district would not need to spend tax money acquiring the property for school construction.\n3. The 10-acre tract was included in the recorded subdivision plan in 1996, which means it was legally designated as part of the subdivision.\n4. The builder who purchased the 40 lots and the 10-acre tract from the investor in 2002 also recognized the 10-acre tract as part of the subdivision, as evidenced by the deeds conveying those properties.\n5. The school board's intention to build a new school on the 10-acre tract align with its original purpose for the land, which was was designated for public use as part of the subdivision plan.\n\nGiven these points, the court would likely rule in favor of the school district, as the 10-acre tract was intended for public use ( specifically for a school - and the buyer's construction plans conflict with this public purpose. The fact that the buyer's deed did not mention the subdivision ( option A does not apply here, as the designation of the 10-acre tract as part of the subdivision was established through the recorded plan and the subsequent conveyance to the builder. Similarly, options B and D do not accurately reflect the legal principles at play, as the dedication was made to the public purpose of education, and the issue pertains to the enforceability of the equitable servitude tied to the land's designated use rather than its public nature."
