These include:\n\nA. They can be interpreted as continuously compounded changes in the prices - This is true, as log-returns represent the natural logarithm of the ratio of consecutive prices.\n\nB. They can be added over time to give returns for longer time periods - This is also correct because the sum of log-returns over multiple periods equals the log-return over the entire period.\n\nC. They can be added across a portfolio of assets to give portfolio returns - This is true as well, since the sum of log-returns for individual assets in a portfolio will equal the log-return of the overall portfolio.\n\nD. They are usually fat-tailed - This statement is not accurate. Log-returns, particularly those from financial assets, tend to follow a normal distribution rather than being \"fat-tailed.\" Fat-tailed distributions refer to probability distributions with tails that are heavier than those of a normal distribution, which implies a higher probability of extreme outcomes compared to what a normal distribution would predict. In contrast, the central limit theorem suggests that log-returns should converge to a normal distribution as the number of periods increases, making their tails thinner rather than fatter."
