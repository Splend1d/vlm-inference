The greater the electronegativity difference, the stronger the acid tends to be, because it leads to a more polar covalent bond and a higher tendency for the bonded atom to attract the shared electrons.\n\nIn terms of electronegativity, fluorine is the most electronegative element, followed by oxygen, then sulfur, and finally selenium ( (F > O > S > Se).\n\n- Fluorine forms the strongest acid (HF, as the electronegativity difference between hydrogen and fluorine is very high.\n- Oxygen forms slightly weaker acids than fluorine, such as H2O, because the electronegativity difference between hydrogen and oxygen is less than that between hydrogen and fluorine.\n- Sulfur forms even weaker acids than oxygen, like H2S, due to the smaller electronegativity difference between hydrogen and sulfur.\n- Selenium, being even less electronegative than sulfur, would form an even weaker acid than H2S.\n\nConsidering this trend, the correct order from strongest to weakest acid is:\n\nH2O (< H2S < H2Se\n\nSo, the correct answer is C. H2O < H2S < H2Se."
