These changes happen within populations and involve the alteration of allele frequencies due to various evolutionary forces such as mutation, genetic drift, migration, and natural selection. While these processes affect individuals within a population, it's the collective genetic changes across a population that lead to evolution. \n\nOptions B and C are incorrect because the gene pool in a population does change over time, and natural selection does affect individuals, but the effects are cumulative and observable at the population level. Option D is also incorrect because while individuals cannot evolve, they do play a role in the process by contributing their genes to future generations. Populations are the units of evolution because it's at this level that we see consistent patterns of genetic change over time."
