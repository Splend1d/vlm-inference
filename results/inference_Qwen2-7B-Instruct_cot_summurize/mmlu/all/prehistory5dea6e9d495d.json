They were skilled at fishing, hunting, and gathering, which allowed them to live in large, permanent villages and develop a rich culture with elaborate social structures, art, and crafts. Their wealth often came from trade, particularly in goods like sea mammal products, salmon, and other marine resources, as well as from the acquisition of prestige items such as cedar canoes, totem poles, and precious materials like obsidian and copper. So, they were not simple foragers but rather affluent foragers due to their advanced resource management and trading systems."
