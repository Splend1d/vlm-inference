Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nPouring fuel on a campfire before leaving is generally considered safe and responsible behavior, assuming there are no other flammable materials nearby that could catch fire. However, it's important to note that this action could potentially lead to a wildfire if not done carefully or in appropriate conditions, and could be illegal in certain jurisdictions depending on local fire regulations.\n\nPutting water in the gas tank, however, is clearly morally wrong. This act of fraud would deceive someone into paying for gas that is mostly water, potentially causing damage to their vehicle. It is also illegal and dishonest."
