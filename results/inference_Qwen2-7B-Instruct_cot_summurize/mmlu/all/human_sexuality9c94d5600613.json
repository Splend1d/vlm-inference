However, it's important to note that the specific terms for these behaviors can vary widely in psychological literature and legal classifications. \n\nDahmer was convicted of the murder of 17 men and boys, and his crimes often involved elements of necrophilia\u2014sexual activity involving corpses or dead bodies\u2014and cannibalism. His behavior also included elements of other paraphilias such as exhibitionism, transvestitism, and pedophilia, but necrophilia is the most prominently documented in his crimes.\n\nIt's crucial to approach this topic with sensitivity and respect for the victims and their families. The term \"scoptophilia\" refers to the sexual arousal from watching others being sexually aroused or engaged in sexual activity, which does not seem to directly apply to Dahmer's actions. Similarly, \"urophilia\" involves sexual arousal from urine, which is not a commonly noted feature of Dahmer's behavior."
