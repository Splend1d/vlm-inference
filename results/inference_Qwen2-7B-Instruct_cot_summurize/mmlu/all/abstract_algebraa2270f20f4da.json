                    "text": "To address these statements, we need to understand the concepts involved:\n\n**Statement 1**: The external direct product of cyclic groups is cyclic.\n\nThis statement is generally **False**. The external direct product of cyclic groups is not necessarily cyclic. For example, consider two cyclic groups \\( \\mathbb{Z}_n \\) and \\( \\mathbb{Z}_m \\). Their direct product \\( \\mathbb{Z}_n \\times \\mathbb{Z}_m \\) will be cyclic if and only if \\( n \\) and \\( m \\) are coprime ( i.e., their greatest common divisor (gcd(n,m) = 1. If they are not coprime, then the direct product is not cyclic because it contains elements of orders dividing both \\( n \\) and \\( m \\), thus preventing the existence of an element that generates the whole group.\n\n**Statement 2**: The external direct product of \\( D_3 \\) and \\( D_4 \\) is isomorphic to \\( D_{12} \\).\n\nHere, we have to consider the structure of each group. \n- \\( D_3 \\) ( also known as \\( D_6 \\), is the dihedral group of order 6, which represents the symmetries of an equilateral triangle.\n- \\( D_4 \\) represents the symmetries of a square and has order 8.\n- \\( D_{12} \\) represents the symmetries of a regular dodecagon and has order 12.\n\nThe direct product \\( D_3 \\times D_4 \\) would have order \\( 6 \\times 8 = 48 \\), which does not match the order of \\( D_{12} \\). However, there seems to be a misunderstanding in the formulation of this statement as \\( D_{12} \\) would typically represent the dihedral group of order 24, not 12. Assuming the intention was to align with standard notation where \\( D_{12} \\) refers to the group of symmetries of a dodecagon (which indeed has order 24, not 12), let's correct this understanding.\n\nGiven the corrected understanding, \\( D_3 \\times D_4 \\) does not directly correspond to \\( D_{12} \\) but rather to a group of order 48. However, if we consider the statement's intent more carefully, aiming for a comparison that aligns with standard notation and group theory principles, we should clarify that \\( D_3 \\times D_4 \\) does not directly equate to \\( D_{12} \\) in terms of direct product structure due to the mismatch in orders. The intended comparison might have been misstated or misunderstood in its application.\n\nConsidering the correction and clarification:\n- Statement 1 is generally false based on the criteria for when the direct product of cyclic groups is cyclic.\n- Statement 2's accuracy depends heavily on the precise interpretation and alignment with standard group theory notation and principles, which suggests that the direct product of \\( D_3 \\) and \\( D_4 \\) does not directly map to \\( D_{12} \\) without further context or clarification.\n\nGiven this analysis, the most accurate choice considering the provided statements and the potential for clarification or misinterpretation in the second statement is:\n\n**C. True, False**\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the second statement might require additional context or correction to be accurately evaluated within the framework of group theory."
