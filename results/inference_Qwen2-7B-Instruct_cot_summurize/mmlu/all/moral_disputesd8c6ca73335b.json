This means that the punishment should fit the crime in terms of severity, ensuring that the punishment is neither too harsh nor too lenient relative to the offense committed. Nathanson's view on retributivism emphasizes fairness and justice in sentencing, advocating for a system where the punishment reflects the moral blameworthiness of the offender."
