The total computation time is 100 seconds.\n\n- Inherently sequential part: \\(100 \\times 0.4 = 40\\) seconds\n- Parallelizable part: \\(100 - 40 = 60\\) seconds\n\nNow, let's consider the effect of adding more processors on the parallelizable part of the computation. According to Amdahl's Law, the speedup \\(S\\) gained by using \\(n\\) processors for a task with a sequential portion \\(s\\) and a parallelizable portion \\(p\\) can be calculated as:\n\n\\[S = \\frac{1}{s + \\left(\\frac{p}{n}\\right)}\\]\n\nHowever, for this specific question, we're asked about the theoretically best possible elapsed times, which implies ideal or perfect parallel processing without any overheads like communication costs between processors.\n\nGiven that the parallelizable part is 60 seconds:\n\n- With 2 processors, each would ideally handle half of the parallelizable part, so the theoretical time would be halved:\n  \\[60 \\div 2 = 30\\] seconds\n\n- With 4 processors, each would again handle an equal share of the parallelizable part, further halving the time:\n  \\[60 \\div 4 = 15\\] seconds\n\nTherefore, the theoretically best possible elapsed times for the program running with 2 and 4 processors, respectively, are are 30 and 15 seconds.\n\nThe correct answer is **B. 30 and 15 seconds**."
