She saw a newspaper ad offering a 1964 Thunderbird sports coupe for $25,000, The ad also gave a website address \"to view a picture of the car,\" which Carol visited, and which showed a T-Bird with a perfect body and interior. Carol paid the $25,000 and signed a sales contract which specified that the Thunderbird was \"used and sold as is.\" When Carol went to pick up the car, she learned it was a 1968 model, which was not at all rare and worth much less than the advertised 1964 model. If Carol brings suit against the seller, the likely outcome is for\n\nA. Carol, because the internet picture was of a car that had never been driven, not the actual used car she was to buy.\nB. The seller, because the buyer was aware the Thunderbird was sold \"as is.\"\nC. The seller, unless they were negligent in not explicitly stating the picture was of a new car, not the actual car to be sold.\nD. Carol, because the \"as is\" disclosure was not totally effective.\n"

If the seller was not negligent and made a reasonable effort to ensure that the information provided ( both in the advertisement and through the website where the picture was displayed - accurately represented the car being sold, then the \"sold as is\" clause might protect them from liability. However, if there was a clear misrepresentation or omission that led to Carol's belief about the car's year, this could potentially undermine the \"sold as is\" clause.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the description of the internet picture as having \"never been driven\" does not align with the given facts, which suggest the car was described as a 1964 model that was actually available for sale, not as a brand new car.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the \"sold as is\" clause typically protects the seller from claims related to the condition of the vehicle. However, this protection can be limited if the seller engaged in fraudulent or misleading practices.\n\nOption D suggests that the \"as is\" disclosure was not totally effective, but without more details about the specifics of the seller's representations and actions, it's hard to conclude definitively. The effectiveness of the \"as is\" clause would depend on the seller's conduct and whether they clearly communicated any discrepancies between the advertised car and the actual car.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most accurate answer based on the information provided is option C, assuming the seller was not negligent in not explicitly stating that the picture was of a new car, not the actual car to be sold."
