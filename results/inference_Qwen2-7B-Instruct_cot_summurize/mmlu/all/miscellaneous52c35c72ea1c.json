In the case of a clothes dryer set to run for 30 minutes, the system will run for the full duration regardless of whether the clothes are actually dry or not. The timer acts as a fixed input, and the dryer does not adjust its operation based on the moisture level of the clothes ( hence it is an example of an open loop control system."
