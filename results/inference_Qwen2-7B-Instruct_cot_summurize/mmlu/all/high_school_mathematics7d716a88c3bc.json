The smallest positive integer that satisfies this condition is \\(n = 0\\). However, since \\(0\\) is not among the options provided, we look for the smallest positive integer \\(n\\) that makes the entire expression divisible by \\(7\\).\n\nLet's consider the expression after simplification:\n\n\\[x^2 + xy + y^2 + n = 7(?) + n\\]\n\nFor the expression to be a multiple of \\(7\\), \\(n\\) must ensure that when added to the term inside the parentheses (which is clearly a multiple of \\(7\\)), the result is also a multiple of \\(7\\). Since the question asks for the smallest positive integer \\(n\\), and considering the structure of the expression, it suggests that \\(n\\) should make the entire expression divisible by \\(7\\) without relying on the specific values of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\n\nGiven the nature of the problem, the focus is on making the expression a multiple of \\(7\\), and looking at the options provided:\n\n- **Option A ( 2**: This would not necessarily ensure the whole expression is a multiple of \\(7\\).\n- **Option B. 6**: This could potentially work, but let's test it for clarity.\n- **Option C. 4**: Similarly, testing it for clarity.\n- **Option D. 5**: Testing it for clarity.\n\nConsidering the goal is to find the smallest positive integer \\(n\\) that works universally, let's evaluate \\(n = 6\\) as a potential solution. The expression becomes:\n\n\\[x^2 + xy + y^2 + 6\\]\n\nGiven the modular arithmetic properties involved (and considering the need to directly address the question's intent rather than exhaustively proving each option against all possible \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) values, recognizing the direct approach might involve leveraging the structure of the equation more succinctly:\n\nGiven \\(x^2 + xy + y^2\\) is inherently tied to being being constructed from terms involving \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) which themselves are multiples of \\(7\\) plus or minus constants, adding \\(6\\) (which is itself \\(6 \\mod 7\\), ensures that if \\(x^2 + xy + y^2\\) is already structured to align with divisibility by \\(7\\) through its construction based on \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) being \\(3\\) away from multiples of \\(7\\), the addition of \\(6\\) (making the total sum \\(6 \\mod 7\\) + whatever \\(x^2 + xy + y^2\\) contributes modulo \\(7\\) = a sum that is still aligned to be divisible by \\(7\\), due to the specific structure of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) being designed around multiples of \\(7\\).\n\nThus, the reasoning indicates that **option B, 6**, serves to maintain the divisibility by \\(7\\) property of the overall expression, given the construction and constraints specified. This conclusion is based on understanding how the original conditions on \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) influence the structure"
