He argued that certain individuals are born with \"criminal\" characteristics that predispose them to commit crimes. This perspective, known as criminology of difference or biological determinism, suggested that individuals who displayed specific physical traits ( like baldness, ears that stuck out, or facial hair at a young age, were more likely to engage in criminal behavior due to their supposed \"criminal types.\" Lombroso's theories heavily influenced the development of the field of forensic psychiatry and the concept of the \"born criminal,\" although they have largely been discredited by modern scientific research on the causes of criminal behavior."
