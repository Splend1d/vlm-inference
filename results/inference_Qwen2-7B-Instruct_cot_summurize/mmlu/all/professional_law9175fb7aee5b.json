The construction crew started tearing out the old sidewalk and railing, but stopped work when it started to get dark. The construction crew left without putting up a warning sign or barrier around the work area. A few hours later, a jogger came along the sidewalk. Not realizing the construction work was in progress there, the jogger stumbled and fell at the spot where the construction crew had torn up the sidewalk and railing. The jogger fell into the lake. As the jogger was attempting to stay afloat, he began screaming, \"Help! Help! I can't swim. I'm drowning. \" His screams attracted the attention of a person who was passing on his bicycle. The cyclist immediately hurried to assist the jogger. As the cyclist was leaning over the edge of the lake, trying to help the jogger get out of the water, he lost his balance and fell into the lake. Both the jogger and cyclist suffered serious bodily injuries before they were pulled out of the water by police. In a negligence action by the cyclist to recover for his personal injuries, the construction company will most probably\n\nA. be held liable, because the cyclist's attempt to rescue the jogger was foreseeable.\nB. be held liable, because the construction company would be strictly liable to anyone injured by the failure to put adequate warnings or barriers around the site of the sidewalk repairs.\nC. not be held liable, because the cyclist assumed the risk by leaning over the edge of the lake.\nD. not be held liable, because the construction company could not foresee that anyone would be hurt while trying to rescue someone from the lake.\n"

By failing to put up warning signs or barriers around the work area, they created a dangerous situation that could foreseeably result in harm to others. The jogger and cyclist were injured as a direct result of this lack of safety measures, making the construction company liable for their injuries under the principle of negligence. The cyclist's actions of attempting to rescue the jogger do not absolve the construction company of liability, as their duty of care extended to preventing any foreseeable risks to bystanders, including those who might try to assist in an emergency."
