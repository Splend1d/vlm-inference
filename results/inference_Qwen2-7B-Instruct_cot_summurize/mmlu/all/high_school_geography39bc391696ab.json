It greatly improved crop yields in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nThe Green Revolution, which occurred from the 1940s to the 1970s, was a period during which agricultural productivity was dramatically increased through the introduction of high-yielding crop varieties, modern farming techniques, and the use of fertilizers and pesticides. While it had significant impacts on agricultural productivity in many parts of the world, including Asia and Latin America, its effects on sub-Saharan Africa were more mixed and complex. The region faced various challenges such as inadequate infrastructure, limited access to resources, and political instability, which hindered the full implementation and benefits of the Green Revolution technologies. Therefore, it did not \"greatly improve crop yields\" uniformly across sub-Saharan Africa as it did in other regions."
