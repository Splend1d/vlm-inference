Interacting with a virus-infected cell.\n\nAntibody-producing cells, also known as B cells, are stimulated when they encounter antigens, which are typically foreign substances like bacteria or viruses. When a virus infects a cell, it can be recognized by the immune system as a threat. The infected cell will display pieces of the virus on its surface in the form of viral antigens. These viral antigens are then recognized by circulating antibodies or by B cells that have receptors matching these specific antigens (a process called antigen presentation. \n\nWhen a B cell encounters an antigen, it is activated and begins to divide and differentiate into either plasma cells (which produce antibodies to fight off the infection, or memory B cells, which remain in the body and can quickly respond if the same infection is encountered again in the future. This activation process involves interactions between the B cell and other components of the immune system, including T helper cells, but the initial trigger for B cell activation is the interaction with the antigen-presenting cell displaying the antigen."
