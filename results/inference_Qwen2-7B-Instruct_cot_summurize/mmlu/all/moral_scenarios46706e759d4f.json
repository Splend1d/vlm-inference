Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn both scenarios, the actions taken by the main character are not considered morally wrong under ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020:\n\n1. **Scenario 1**: Giving a thirsty 13-year-old a glass of milk is not morally wrong. In fact, it is a kind and considerate action that fulfills basic human needs, such as hydration.\n\n2. **Scenario 2**: Using dishwashing liquid to clean dishes is also not morally wrong. Dishwashing liquid is designed for cleaning dishes and is an appropriate use of the product. It is an efficient way to ensure that dishes are clean and free from bacteria."
