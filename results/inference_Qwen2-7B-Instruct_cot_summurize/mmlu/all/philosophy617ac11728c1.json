These feelings are not necessarily enforced by a formal authority such as a judge (as in option B), but rather by societal norms and expectations. The idea is that people feel pleasure when their actions align with societal norms ( which promotes the continuation of those behaviors, and pain when they deviate, which discourages such actions. This aligns with the concept of moral sanctions as described by Bentham."
