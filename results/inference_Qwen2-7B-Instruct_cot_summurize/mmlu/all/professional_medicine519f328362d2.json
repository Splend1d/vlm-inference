This allows for better healing and prevents further spread of infection.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that this is a medical decision that should be made by a healthcare professional based on a thorough examination and assessment of the patient's condition. Depending on the extent of the damage, the health of the remaining tissue, and other factors, additional treatments might also be necessary, including antibiotics, wound care, and in severe cases, amputation as a last resort. The use of hyperbaric oxygen therapy (D. could also be considered in some cases as it can help increase blood flow and promote healing, but it is typically used after the initial stabilization of the condition and removal of necrotic tissue."
