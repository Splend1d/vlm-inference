                    "text": "A farmer owned a 40-acre tract of farmland located in a small southern town. The farmer leased the property and building thereon to a tenant for a term of seven years commencing on February 15, 2000 and terminating at 12:00 noon on February 15, 2007. The lease contained the following provision:\"Lessee covenants to pay the rent of $5,000 per month on the 15th day of each month and to keep the building situated upon said leased premises in as good repair as it was at the time of said lease until the expiration thereof. \" The lease also contained a provision giving the tenant the option to purchase 10 acres of the tract for $150,000 at the expiration of the lease term. Before the lease was executed, the farmer orally promised the tenant that he (the farmer) would have the 10-acre tract surveyed. During the last year of the lease, the tenant decided to exercise the option to purchase the 10 acres of the tract. Without the farmer's knowledge, the tenant began to build an irrigation ditch across the northern section of the property. When the tenant notified the farmer that he planned to exercise the option, the farmer refused to perform. The farmer also informed the tenant that he never had the 10-acre tract surveyed. If the tenant brings suit for specific performance, which of the following is the farmer's best defense?\n\nA. The option agreement was unenforceable under the parol evidence rule.\nB. The farmer's failure to survey the 10-acre tract excused him from further obligations under the contract.\nC. The description of the property was too indefinite to permit the remedy sought.\nD. The option was unenforceable because it lacked separate consideration.\n"

                    "text": "The farmer's best defense against a specific performance claim by the tenant would likely be:\n\nC. The description of the property was too indefinite to permit the remedy sought.\n\nSpecific performance is an equitable remedy that courts may grant when monetary damages are not sufficient to compensate the injured party. It requires that the relief requested be definite and capable of being determined and enforced. If the description of the 10-acre tract to be purchased is vague or ambiguous, the court might find it difficult to enforce the specific performance of the option agreement due to the lack of definiteness in the property description. This could be a strong defense against the tenant's request for specific performance.\n\nA. The parol evidence rule typically refers to the principle that, in the absence of fraud, oral statements made prior to or contemporaneously with a written contract will not be admitted to vary its terms. While this rule might apply to limit what oral promises can alter the written lease terms, it does not directly address the enforceability of the option itself.\n\nB. The farmer's failure to survey the property might be relevant to the tenant's decision-making process but does not necessarily excuse the farmer from performing under the lease. The tenant's reliance on the farmer's promise to survey the property might be considered in determining whether the farmer should be held liable for damages if the tenant is unable to purchase the property, but it would not automatically negate the tenant's right to seek specific performance based on the option agreement.\n\nD. The enforceability of an option agreement often depends on whether it has separate consideration. The absence of consideration for the option might make it unenforceable, but without information about the nature of the consideration given for the option, this cannot be assumed as the farmer's defense. If there was valid consideration, the lack of separate consideration might not be a defense against specific performance."
