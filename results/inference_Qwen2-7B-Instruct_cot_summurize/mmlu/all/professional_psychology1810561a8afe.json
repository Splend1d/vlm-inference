When you sleep, your brain processes and consolidates the information you've learned during the day, making it easier to recall later. This process is important for long-term memory storage.\n\nThat being, while all of the options listed can have some benefits for overall health and potentially cognitive function, sleeping is specifically linked to enhancing memory retention. Studying a related or unrelated subject might help with short-term memory retention and engagement, but they do not facilitate the deep processing and consolidation that sleep does for memory. Exercise can improve overall cognitive function and mood, which could indirectly aid learning and memory, but its direct impact on memory retention isn't as well-established as sleep's."
