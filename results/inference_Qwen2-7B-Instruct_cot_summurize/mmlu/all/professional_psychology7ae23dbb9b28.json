Lack of control and insufficient reward\n\nLack of control over one's work and insufficient reward ( both in terms of recognition and tangible benefits like salary or promotions - can significantly increase the likelihood of burnout. This is because these factors directly impact an individual's sense of autonomy, competence, and relatedness at work, all of which are are crucial for maintaining psychological well-being and job satisfaction.\n\nExternal locus of control refers to the belief that outcomes are determined by external forces rather than personal actions, which might not directly increase burnout risk as much as the other options provided do. \n\nPositive environments and micro-management are generally associated with better job performance and lower stress levels, so they are not typically linked to increased burnout.\n\nAge and quality of life could play indirect roles in burnout risk, but they are not primary factors that directly lead to burnout. For instance, older employees might face more physical challenges or retirement planning concerns, while younger employees might struggle with balancing work and personal life or career uncertainty. However, these effects would likely be mediated through the other factors mentioned, such as lack of control or inadequate rewards. Quality of life can influence how these other factors impact an individual's resilience against burnout."
