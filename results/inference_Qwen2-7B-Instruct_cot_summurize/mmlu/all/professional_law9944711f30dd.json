On March 7, the woman sent the following purchase order to a manufacturer of widgets:\"Promptly ship 1,000 widgets, catalogue #B4-IEU, at the current wholesale price to our warehouse. Thank you for your attention to this matter. \"This order was received by the manufacturer on March 9. The next day, the manufacturer replied by fax:\"Your order has been received. Shipment date will be March 12. Price $50 for each widget delivered. Be advised that these are the last widgets, under catalogue #B4-IEU, that we can deliver, since this variety is no longer being manufactured. \"Upon receipt of the fax, the woman immediately sent the following fax:\"Cancel our previous order for 1,000 widgets under catalogue #B4-IEU. Price too high. \"Assume $50 per widget was the current wholesale market price. Was an enforceable contract in effect between the woman and the manufacturer?\n\nA. No, because the woman's order was too indefinite to constitute an offer, since it didn't contain a price term.\nB. No, because even if the woman's order was a valid offer, it was effectively revoked prior to acceptance.\nC. Yes, because the woman's order created a valid option contract.\nD. Yes, because the manufacturer's fax of March 10 constituted an acceptance of the woman's offer.\n"

No, because even if the woman's order was a valid offer, it was effectively revoked prior to acceptance.\n\nAn enforceable contract requires a meeting of the minds between two parties, where there is a clear offer made and accepted with all necessary terms agreed upon. In this scenario, the woman's initial purchase order did not specify a price term, which is a crucial element in a contract for the sale of goods (as per Section 2-201 of the Uniform Commercial Code ((UCC). Therefore, her order might not have been a valid offer initially.\n\nHowever, even assuming that the order could be considered a valid offer based on other circumstances or context, it would still not be enforceable. The woman then immediately sent a revocation of the offer through her subsequent fax message, canceling the previous order before the manufacturer had a chance to accept it. Once an offer is revoked, it cannot be accepted, and thus, no contract comes into existence. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. The woman's offer was effectively revoked prior to acceptance, so there was no enforceable contract in place between the woman and the manufacturer."
