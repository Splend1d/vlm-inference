During this period, she has had tingling in the right ring and small fingers most of the time. She has no history of serious illness and takes no medications. She is employed as a cashier and uses a computer at home. She played as a pitcher in a softball league for 5 years until she stopped 2 years ago. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows full muscle strength. Palpation of the right elbow produces a jolt of severe pain in the right ring and small fingers. Sensation to pinprick and light touch is decreased over the medial half of the right ring finger and the entire small finger. The most likely cause of these findings is entrapment of which of the following on the right?\n\nA. Median nerve at the wrist\nB. Musculocutaneous nerve at the forearm\nC. Radial nerve at the forearm\nD. Ulnar nerve at the elbow\n"

                    "text": "The most likely cause of these findings is entrapment of the **Median nerve at the wrist** ( (Option A).\n\nThe symptoms described\u2014numbness and tingling in the right ring and small fingers, with pain elicited upon palpation of the right elbow\u2014suggest compression or entrapment of a peripheral nerve. The location of the symptoms and the response to pressure on the elbow point to a problem affecting the median nerve. The median nerve provides sensation to the thumb, index finger, and the first half of the second (or ring) finger, and motor control to the muscles that bend the wrist and fingers. Compression of the median nerve typically occurs near the wrist, often due to conditions like carpal tunnel syndrome.\n\nOptions B, C, and D involve nerves that do not primarily supply the ring and small fingers in the way described:\n\n- **Musculocutaneous nerve at the forearm** provides sensation to the lateral aspect of the forearm and supplies muscles like the biceps brachii.\n- **Radial nerve at the forearm** primarily innervates muscles in the upper arm and forearm but does not supply the fingers directly.\n- **Ulnar nerve at the elbow** supplies sensation to the little finger and half of the ring finger, but the symptoms described do not match those of ulnar nerve entrapment.\n\nThus, based on the symptoms and the site where pain is elicited upon palpation, the correct answer is A: Median nerve at the wrist."
