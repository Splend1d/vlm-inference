Interest, Uncertain, Speculative, Tangible assets.\n\nIslamic finance prohibits the charging and paying of interest ( known as \"riba\" in Arabic. This is one of the most fundamental differences from conventional finance. It also prohibits uncertain or speculative transactions (\"maysir\") and requires that all financial products be backed by tangible assets rather than intangible ones like stocks or derivatives. This is often referred to as the principle of \"Qard al-Hassan\" which translates to \"a loan without exploitation\". \n\nTherefore, the other options are incorrect:\n\nA. The term \"Certain\" does not fit in this context.\nB. The term \"Assured\" does not fit in this context.\nD. The term \"Intangible assets\" contradicts the principle of backing financial products with tangible assets in Islamic finance."
