This process happens at specific points called crossover points or recombination hotspots.\n\nGiven the options:\n\nA. If two genes (1 and 2) are located right next to each other on chromosome A, they would not undergo crossover because they are physically close together on the same chromosome, and there's no opportunity for one non-sister chromatid of one gene to swap material with the non-sister chromatid of the other gene.\n\nB. If gene 1 is located on chromosome A, and gene 2 is on chromosome B, there is no possibility of crossover occurring between these two genes since they are on different chromosomes.\n\nC. If genes 1 and 2 are located near each other on the X chromosome, they could potentially undergo crossover during meiosis. This is because they are on the same chromosome, so there is a chance for non-sister chromatids to exchange segments.\n\nD. If gene 1 is located on chromosome A; gene 2 is located far away but on the same chromosome, there is still a possibility for crossover. Although the genes are not adjacent, they can still undergo crossover if they are far enough apart that the homologous chromosomes have enough length to allow for the exchange of segments between non-sister chromatids.\n\nTherefore, the most likely scenario for crossover would be **C**. Genes 1 and 2 being located near each other on the X chromosome."
