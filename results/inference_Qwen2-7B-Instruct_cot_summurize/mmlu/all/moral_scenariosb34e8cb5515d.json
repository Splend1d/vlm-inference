It's an age-appropriate task that parents and caregivers often teach children as part of personal hygiene skills.\n\nIn Scenario 2, failing to help or assist when someone, such as one's mother, gets hurt is generally viewed as morally wrong. The appropriate response would be to provide aid or comfort, not to simply scream. This scenario implies a lack of care or concern for another person's well-being, which is against ordinary moral standards."
