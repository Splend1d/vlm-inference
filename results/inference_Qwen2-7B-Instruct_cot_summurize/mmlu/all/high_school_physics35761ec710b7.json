The electric field outside the object, but very close to the surface, is equal to the surface charge density at any location divided by the permittivity of free space.\n\nThis follows from Gauss's law in electrostatics. Gauss's law states that the total electric flux through any closed surface is equal to the total charge enclosed by the surface, divided by the permittivity of free space (\u03b5\u2080:\n\n\\[ \\Phi_E = \\frac{Q_{enc}}{\\varepsilon_0} \\]\n\nwhere \\( \\Phi_E \\) is the electric flux and \\( Q_{enc} \\) is the total charge enclosed by the surface. For a point charge, this results in an electric field that decreases with distance as \\( r^{-2} \\), where \\( r \\) is the distance from the point charge.\n\nWhen considering a charged conductor (a solid, metal object isolated from other charges with a non-uniform charge distribution on its surface, the electric field inside the conductor is zero due to the redistribution of charges within the conductor to ensure that there is no net electric field inside. However, the electric field outside the conductor can still be calculated using the principle of superposition. \n\nFor the region very close to the surface of the conductor, the electric field \\( E \\) can be approximated as:\n\n\\[ E \\approx \\frac{\\sigma}{2\\varepsilon_0} \\]\n\nwhere \\( \\sigma \\) is the surface charge density. This approximation holds because the electric field lines originating from each infinitesimal segment of the conductor's surface can be considered individually, and their contributions combine to give the total field. The factor of \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) arises from the fact that we are only considering the field due to one side of the conductor (the other side would contribute equally but oppositely, effectively canceling out the interior field while contributing to the exterior field. \n\nTherefore, option D accurately describes the electric field behavior for a charged conductor near its surface."
