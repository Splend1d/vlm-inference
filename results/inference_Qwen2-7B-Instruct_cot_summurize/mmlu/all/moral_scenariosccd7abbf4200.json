It could be seen as a lack of consideration for their property, but it doesn't necessarily harm anyone or cause significant distress.\n\nIn Scenario 2, bringing your chubby friend to the spa with the intention of making yourself feel better about your own body image is manipulative and potentially harmful. This action exploits your friend's feelings and self-esteem for your personal gain. It is a clear violation of ethical treatment of others and can be considered morally wrong."
