The federal and state judiciaries are generally autonomous, but there are instances where federal courts can hear cases involving state court decisions, particularly when they involve questions of federal law or the Constitution. Federal courts can indeed overturn state court decisions if they find that the state court decision conflicts with federal law or the U.S. Constitution. However, it's important to note that this does not mean federal courts are \"higher\" in all contexts; for example, state courts typically serve as trial courts while federal courts often serve as appellate courts. The relationship is complex and involves both autonomy and interrelation under the U.S. system of dual sovereignty."
