Monism posits that international and domestic law are part of the same legal order. \n\nMonism is a legal theory that suggests there is a single, unified legal system which includes both international and domestic law. Under this theory, international law is directly applicable within a state's domestic legal system without the need for any legislative incorporation. This contrasts with dualist theories where international law and domestic law are considered separate systems that interact through a process of incorporation or implementation by the domestic legislature."
