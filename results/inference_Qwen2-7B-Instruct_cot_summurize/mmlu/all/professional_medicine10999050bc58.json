Presence of an S3\n\nAn S3 heart sound can indicate left ventricular failure or increased left atrial pressure, which may occur in patients with PAH due to right-to-left shunting or volume overload. However, it's important to note that the presence of an S3 alone does not necessarily confirm PAH; it should be considered along with other clinical findings and diagnostic tests.\n\nIncreased jugular venous pressure (A, P2 louder than A2 B, and peripheral edema C are are more commonly associated with left-sided heart failure rather than PAH. While they may occur in the setting of PAH, they do not specifically indicate PAH as the underlying cause."
