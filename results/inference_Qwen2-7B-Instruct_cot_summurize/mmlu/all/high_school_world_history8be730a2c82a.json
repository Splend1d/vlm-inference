Take this winter:\nThe Shanxi troops were never sent home.\nThe District Officers are demanding the land tax,\nBut where will it come from? You can't get blood from a stone!\nI honestly think it's bad luck to bear a son now,\nIt's better to have a daughter: at least she can marry\nAnd live with the neighbors next door.\nBut a son will end up lying on some distant prairie.\"\nDu Fu, \"Ballad of the Army Carts,\" ca. 750 C.E.\nBased on the poem and your knowledge of history, Tang relations with western nomadic peoples and frontier peoples relied on which of the following?\n\nA. Adroit diplomacy and establishment of client relationships with bordering nomads\nB. The ability of the Tang emperor to project military power on the frontier in order to impose his will\nC. The permanent settlement of Han Chinese in frontier zones\nD. The payment of tribute to nomadic rulers\n"

                    "text": "The poem by Du Fu provides insight into the Tang Dynasty's interactions with frontier and nomadic peoples, particularly through the lens of conscription and the military's role in maintaining control over these regions. The poem reflects the challenges faced by the soldiers, including long tours of duty, harsh conditions, and the ongoing need to quell unrest. It also highlights the economic pressures placed on the local population, such as demands for taxes and the lack of resources due to the disarray of agriculture.\n\nGiven this context, the answer that best aligns with the information provided by the poem is:\n\nB. The ability of the Tang emperor to project military power on the frontier in order to impose his will\n\nThis is because the poem indicates the constant need for military presence and force to maintain control and manage unrest in the frontier areas, which suggests reliance on military might rather than diplomacy or tributes. While the poem does not directly address the specifics of how the Tang Dynasty managed its relations with nomadic groups, the focus on military necessity and the hardships endured by soldiers point to the use of military power as a central strategy."
