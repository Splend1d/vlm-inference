Insight refers to a person's ability to understand their own thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. Early in therapy, the focus is often on building rapport, establishing a therapeutic alliance, and helping the client become aware of unconscious processes and patterns that may contribute to their issues. This increased awareness is foundational for further therapeutic work."
