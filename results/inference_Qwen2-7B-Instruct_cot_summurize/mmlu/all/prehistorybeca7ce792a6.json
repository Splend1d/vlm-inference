The arrival of Europeans in the New World brought with them diseases, weapons, and military tactics that were unknown to indigenous populations, giving Spanish conquistadors like Pizarro a significant advantage. The introduction of horses and firearms was particularly intimidating to the Incas, who had no experience or defense against these new technologies. This combination of surprise, fear, and technological superiority allowed Pizarro's forces to subdue the vast Inca Empire relatively quickly."
