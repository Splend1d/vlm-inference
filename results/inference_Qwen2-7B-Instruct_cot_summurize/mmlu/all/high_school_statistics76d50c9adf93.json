Her procedure results in a simple random sample.** This statement is incorrect because a simple random sample requires that every individual in the population has an equal chance of being selected, without any specific pattern (like grouping by alphabetical order. The method described here does not ensure that every customer has an equal chance of selection due to the structured way names are grouped by initial letters.\n  \n- **C. Each customer has an equal probability of being included in the survey.** This statement is also incorrect for the reasons explained above regarding B. The alphabetical grouping of names means that customers' chances of being selected are influenced by the initial letter of their name, which is not random.\n  \n- **D. Her procedure introduces bias through sampling error.** While this could be argued as a possible outcome depending on the context, it's not the most accurate choice given the options provided. The procedure itself does introduce structure, which might not be unbiased but rather systematic, not necessarily introducing bias through sampling error unless it systematically excludes certain groups.\n  \n- **A. Her procedure makes use of chance.** This is the most accurate choice because, despite the structure imposed by the alphabetical grouping, there is still an element of randomness involved in selecting four names from those starting with a particular letter using a random number table. This aspect of randomness allows us to consider her procedure as making use of chance, even though it is not a perfectly random sample due to the systematic grouping."
