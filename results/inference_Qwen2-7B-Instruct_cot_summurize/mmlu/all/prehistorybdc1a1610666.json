It was characterized by colder temperatures and lower sea levels, leading to significant changes in the environment. This period is known for causing a temporary abandonment of many areas in northern Europe by humans, as the harsh conditions made it difficult to sustain settlements and agriculture. The Younger Dryas is also notable for its abrupt onset and termination, which contrasts with the more gradual changes seen in other periods of the Ice Age."
