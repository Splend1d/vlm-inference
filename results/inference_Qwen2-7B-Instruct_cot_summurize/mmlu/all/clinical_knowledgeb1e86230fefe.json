Pressure in the root of the neck reduces the impulse\n\nThis phenomenon is known as the carotid sinus reflex, which is an autonomic response to compression of the carotid sinus, a specialized area in the wall of the common carotid artery where baroreceptors are located. When pressure is applied to this area, it can cause vasodilation and a reduction in heart rate, suggesting an arterial origin of the pulsation.\n\nA. A waggling earlobe ( can be associated with carotid artery disease but does not specifically indicate arterial pulsation.\nB. Positive for hepatojugular reflux indicates venous pulsation rather than arterial.\nC. No variation with posture is more indicative of a venous pulsation, as venous pulsations tend to be less variable with changes in position compared to arterial pulsations."
