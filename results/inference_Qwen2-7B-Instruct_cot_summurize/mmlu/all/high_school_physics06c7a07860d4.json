                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to understand that in a magnetic field, a charged particle like a proton will experience a force perpendicular to both its velocity and the magnetic field direction due to the Lorentz force law:\n\n\\[ \\vec{F} = q(\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B}) \\]\n\nwhere \\(q\\) is the charge of the particle (for a proton, \\(q = +1.6 \\times 10^{-19}\\) C, \\(\\vec{v}\\) is the velocity vector, and \\(\\vec{B}\\) is the magnetic field vector.\n\nThe force causes the proton to move in a circular path, and since there is no acceleration along the magnetic field direction, the speed of the proton remains constant throughout its motion in the magnetic field. This means that the speed of the proton 4 seconds after entering the magnetic field is the same as its initial speed.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. \\(1.5 \\times 10^6\\) m/s"
