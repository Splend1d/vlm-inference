This makes both expressions `f(x,x)` and `f(x,1)` respectively, which are not exactly identical but the structure is the same. The second parameter in expression I doesn't need a substitution because it's fixed at `w` and we're substituting `w` with `x` in expression I.\n\n- For I and III: We can unify these two by making the substitution `w -> y` and `z -> x`. This makes both expressions `f(y,y)` and `f(y,g(x))` respectively. While they're not exactly identical, their structure is the same with just a difference in parameters.\n\n- For II and III: These cannot be unified. In order to unify them, we would need a substitution that would make the first argument of `f` in both expressions the same, but the first argument in II is a variable `x`, while in III it's a variable `y`. Additionally, the second argument in II is a constant `1`, while in III it's a function application `g(z)`. So, no substitution can make these two expressions lexically identical.\n\nTherefore, only the pairs (I, II) and (I, III) are pairs of unifiable expressions."
