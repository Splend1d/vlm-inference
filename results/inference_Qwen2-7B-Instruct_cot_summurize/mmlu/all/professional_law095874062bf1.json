Fred's unqualified acceptance on April 10 will not create a contract.\n\nAccording to the offer made by James, it is irrevocable for a ten-day period, which ends on April 11 ( (April 1 as the start date + 10 days). Since Fred's acceptance was sent on April 10, it would have to reach James by April 11 at the latest for it to potentially create a contract within the terms of the offer. However, if mail delivery times are considered, it might not necessarily arrive by that date due to postal services' varying delivery times. Therefore, assuming standard mail delivery times, Fred's acceptance on April 10 might not reach James in time, and thus, it may not create a contract based on the terms set forth by James in his offer.\n\nIt's important to note that other factors such as postal delays or misdelivery could affect whether the acceptance reaches James in time, but based solely on the information provided, option A is the most accurate choice given the details about the timing of the offer, acceptance, and the stated revocability period."
