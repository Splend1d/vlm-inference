Both a and c.\n\nn-3 and n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids, as well as monounsaturated fatty acids, can have beneficial effects on plasma LDL (low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol levels. \n\nn-3 fatty acids, particularly those found in fish oil, have been shown to help reduce triglyceride levels and increase HDL (high-density lipoprotein) cholesterol, while also having some beneficial effects on LDL cholesterol. They work by reducing the overall production of cholesterol in the liver.\n\nMonounsaturated fatty acids, which are abundant in foods like olive oil, avocados, and nuts, can help lower LDL cholesterol when they replace saturated fats in the diet. These types of fats can help improve the ratio of good to bad cholesterol.\n\nSaturated and trans unsaturated fatty acids, on the other hand, tend to raise LDL cholesterol levels when consumed in excess, which is why they are often recommended to be consumed in moderation or avoided where possible in a heart-healthy diet."
