                    "text": "In a skewed distribution where the tail is extended to the left, the data tends to have a longer tail on the lower end, indicating that there are a few values significantly smaller than the rest. In such cases:\n\n- The **mean** ( (option D) is pulled in the direction of the skew. Since the tail is to the left, the mean will be less than the median because it is influenced by the extreme values in the lower end of the distribution.\n  \n- The **median** ( (option C) is the middle value when the data is ordered from smallest to largest. It is less affected by extreme values and thus provides a more central tendency in a skewed distribution.\n\n- The **mode** ( (option B) is the most frequent value in the dataset. In a unimodal skewed distribution, the mode can be either on the left or right side depending on the shape of the distribution. However, it's not necessarily the highest value as the distribution might not be strictly increasing.\n\n- The **standard deviation** ( (option A) measures the dispersion or spread of the data points relative to the mean. In a skewed distribution, the standard deviation can still be calculated, but it does not directly indicate the highest value; instead, it gives information about how far the data points are from the mean.\n\nGiven these explanations, the answer to your question would be:\n\nC.
