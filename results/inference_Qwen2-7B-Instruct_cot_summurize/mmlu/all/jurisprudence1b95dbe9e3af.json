Hart, often reject a metaphysical approach to law because they prioritize empirical methods over speculative or abstract ones. They are inclined towards understanding law through its observable effects, practices, and applications rather than through abstract principles or inherent meanings that cannot be directly observed or tested. This empirical focus allows them to analyze law as it actually operates within society, rather than as it might be conceived in an idealized or metaphysical sense."
