It was the first war won by airpower alone\n\nThe NATO intervention in Kosovo, which took place from 1999, is indeed notable for being the first war where airpower was used extensively and effectively to the point of winning the conflict without significant ground operations. This was due to the nature of the conflict, which was largely a conflict between ethnic Albanians and Serbian forces, and the logistical challenges in deploying large numbers of troops into the region. The use of precision-guided munitions, or \"smart weapons,\" also played a crucial role in this campaign, but it was the reliance on airpower that set this conflict apart from previous military engagements."
