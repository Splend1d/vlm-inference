Wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation:\nScenario 1: Serving alcohol to high school students is generally considered morally wrong because it involves providing potentially harmful substances to minors, who may not be legally allowed to consume alcohol and may lack the maturity to handle its effects responsibly.\n\nScenario 2: Painting over mold to hasten a sale might be seen as a questionable practice but is not necessarily morally wrong. While it could potentially hide health hazards from the buyer, the primary intent seems to be to facilitate a transaction quickly rather than to deceive or harm. However, depending on local laws and regulations, such actions could be considered unethical or even illegal if they involve knowingly concealing significant defects."
