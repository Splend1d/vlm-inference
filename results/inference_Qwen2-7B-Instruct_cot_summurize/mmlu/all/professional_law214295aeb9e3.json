Since Friday was the Fourth of July, the judge asked the jurors to return on Monday. The trial began again on Monday morning at 8:30. By late evening the judge had instructed the jury. Due to the lateness of the hour, the jurors were sequestered for the evening to allow them to get an early start the next morning. The jurors returned Tuesday morning and were unable to reach a verdict. Unable to reach a verdict, the trial judge allowed the jurors to go home that evening. On Wednesday morning, the jury assembled and returned a verdict of guilty. On appeal, which of the following is Billy's strongest issue for seeking a reversal?\n\nA. The fact that the jurors did not begin to consider evidence until several days after they were empaneled.\nB. The fact that the jury was allowed to go home after being sworn.\nC. The fact that the jury took several days to return a verdict.\nD. The fact that the jury was allowed to go home after they began deliberations.\n"

The fact that the jurors did not begin to consider evidence until several days after they were empaneled.\n\nThis is Billy's strongest issue for seeking a reversal because the delay in the jury considering the evidence could potentially have prejudiced the outcome of the case. Delays can introduce new information into the public domain (that may influence the jurors' opinions, or cause the jurors to lose focus on the case. Additionally, the delay might have allowed more time for rumors or external influences to affect the jurors. \n\nThe other options are not as strong issues for appeal:\n\nB. The fact that the jury was allowed to go home after being sworn - While this might be an issue regarding the safety and impartiality of the jurors, it's less directly related to the fairness of the trial process itself.\n\nC. The fact that the jury took several days to return a verdict - This is not necessarily an issue unless there is evidence that the delay was due to factors beyond the jury's control or if the delay led to any undue prejudice.\n\nD. The fact that the jury was allowed to go home after they began deliberations - This could be a concern for similar reasons to option B, but since the jury was able to return a verdict the next day, the concern about the impact of this decision on the final verdict is mitigated."
