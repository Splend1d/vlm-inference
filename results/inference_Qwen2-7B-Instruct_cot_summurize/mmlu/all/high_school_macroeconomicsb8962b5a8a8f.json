The demand curve would shift up increasing the equilibrium interest rate.\n\nWhen a financial planner convinces more Americans to save for retirement, this increases the amount of money that people want to lend or deposit into savings accounts. This action effectively increases the demand for loanable funds, causing the demand curve to shift upwards. As a result, the equilibrium interest rate will increase because lenders can charge higher rates due to the increased demand for their funds."
