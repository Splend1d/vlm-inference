Postcolonialism uniquely considers the nation or community group as a valid referent object in security studies.\n\nThis is not necessarily unique to postcolonialism, as many security theories and frameworks consider the nation or community group as relevant objects of analysis. What sets postcolonialism apart more fundamentally might be its emphasis on historical legacies of colonialism, power dynamics, cultural dimensions, and the role of discourse and representation in shaping understandings of security."
