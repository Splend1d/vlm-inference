Engaging in homosexual acts - The Church teaches that sexuality is meant to be lived in the context of marriage between one man and one woman. Homosexual acts are considered contrary to this natural law order.\n\nB. Engaging in heterosexual acts outside of marriage - This is considered sinful because marriage is viewed as a sacred union between a man and a woman, consecrated by God. Sexual activity outside of this sacramental union is not seen as fulfilling the purpose of sex as intended by God.\n\nC. Taking the birth control pill - The use of contraception, including the birth control pill, goes against the Church's teachings on the openness of marriage to the transmission of life. It is argued that contraception can lead to a lack of respect for the intrinsic value of human life and can undermine the unity and openness required for marriage to flourish."
