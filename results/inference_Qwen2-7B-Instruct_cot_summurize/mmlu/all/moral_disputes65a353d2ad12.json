It also includes acts of oppression such as subordination ( where a group is kept in a lower social position, exploitation where resources or labor are unfairly taken from a group, and cultural imperialism which refers to the imposition of one culture over another often leading to loss of identity and autonomy for the minority culture. Therefore, it involves both violence and forms of oppression."
