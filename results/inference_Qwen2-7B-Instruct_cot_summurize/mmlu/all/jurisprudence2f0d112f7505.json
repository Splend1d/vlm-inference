A presupposition that facilitates our understanding of the legal system.\n\nKarl Llewellyn Hartley Kelsen, an Austrian jurist, developed the concept of the Grundnorm (or basic norm. This concept serves as a foundational element in his theory of law. It is not the ultimate source of morality within a legal system (option A), nor does it solely distinguish norms from mere habits of obedience (option B). Instead, Kelsen's Grundnorm is a fundamental principle or rule that underlies all other norms in a legal system. It acts as a presupposition, enabling us to understand how legal systems operate and how individual norms derive their validity from it. \n\nOption C is incorrect because while the constitution can indeed be seen as a Grundnorm in some contexts, Kelsen's Grundnorm is more general and applies to any legal system, not just constitutional ones. \n\nThus, option D accurately captures the role and nature of the Grundnorm in legal theory: it is a basic assumption that helps explain the structure and functioning of legal systems."
