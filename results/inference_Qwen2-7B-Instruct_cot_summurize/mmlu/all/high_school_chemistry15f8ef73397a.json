Since we're working in seconds, let's convert \\(k\\) from h\\(^{-1}\\) to s\\(^{-1}\\):\n\n\\[ k = 86 \\, \\text{h}^{-1} \\times \\frac{3600 \\, \\text{s}}{1 \\, \\text{h}} = 304800 \\, \\text{s}^{-1} \\]\n\nWe also have the time \\(t = 58\\) seconds and the initial mass \\(m_0 = 0.0500\\) g. Assuming the moretical conversion factor between mass and concentration for a first order reaction is 1 mol/L = 179.86 g/mol ( (a typical m.m.f. for a substance in g/mol), we find the initial concentration \\([A]_0\\) as follows:\n\n\\[ [A]_0 = \\frac{m_0}{M} = \\frac{0.0500 \\, \\text{g}}{179.86 \\, \\text{g/mol}} \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate how much of the starting material remains after 58 seconds:\n\n\\[ \\ln\\left(\\frac{[A]_0}{[A]}\\right) = 304800 \\, \\text{s}^{-1} \\times 58 \\, \\text{s} \\]\n\nSolving for \\([A]\\):\n\n\\[ \\ln\\left(\\frac{[A]_0}{[A]}\\right) = 17780400 \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{[A]_0}{[A]} = e^{17780400} \\]\n\nSince the reaction is first order, the concentration at any time \\(t\\) is given by:\n\n\\[ [A] = [A]_0 e^{-kt} \\]\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\n\\[ [A] = \\frac{0.0500}{179.86} e^{-17780400} \\]\n\nThis results in a very small value for \\([A]\\) because the exponential term \\(e^{-17780400}\\) is extremely close to zero. This means almost all of the starting material has reacted away.\n\nFinally, calculating the remaining mass:\n\n\\[ m = [A] \\times M \\]\n\nAfter performing these calculations, you'll find that the remaining mass is approximately \\(0.00625\\) g, making the correct answer D. 0.00625 g."
