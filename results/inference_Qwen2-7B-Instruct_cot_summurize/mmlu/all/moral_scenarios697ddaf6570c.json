This is generally considered a violation of privacy and trust, which are are important moral principles. \n\nScenario 2 involves serving a drink that you have already tasted to a customer. While this may seem like a small act, it can potentially be dangerous if the drink was contaminated or had a different substance mixed into it. It's also an act of dishonesty, as you did not disclose that you had tasted the drink before serving it."
