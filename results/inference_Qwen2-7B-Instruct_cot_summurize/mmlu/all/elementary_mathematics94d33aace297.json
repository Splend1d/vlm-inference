This gives us:\n\\[ 2 \\times 5 = 10 \\] cookies for the first week.\n\nFor the second week, he ate 2 cookies each day for 4 days. This gives us:\n\\[ 2 \\times 4 = 8 \\] cookies for the second week.\n\nAdding these two totals together gives us the total number of cookies eaten over the two weeks:\n\\[ 10 + 8 = 18 \\]\n\nNow let's look at the options given:\n\nA. \\(2 \\times 5 \\times 4\\) - This would calculate the total cookies for one week with 5 days and then multiply by 4, which doesn't match our calculation.\n\nB. \\(2 \\times ( (5 + 4)\\) - This option correctly adds the number of days from both weeks before multiplying by the daily consumption. So it calculates \\(2 \\times ( (9) = 18\\), matching our total.\n\nC. \\((2 \\times 5) \\times ( (2 \\times 4)\\) - This multiplies the total for one week by the total for the other week, not adding them, resulting in \\(10 \\times 8 = 80\\), which is incorrect.\n\nD. \\((2 + 5) \\times (2 + 4)\\) - This adds the daily consumption for each week to the number of days for each week, resulting in \\(7 \\times 6 = 42\\), which is also incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **B**."
