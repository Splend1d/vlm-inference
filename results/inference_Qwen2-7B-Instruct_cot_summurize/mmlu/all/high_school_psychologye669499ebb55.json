Influencing patients by controlling the consequences of their actions.\n\nBehavioral therapy, as a form of psychotherapy, primarily focuses on changing the behavior of the patient through conditioning and other techniques. It aims to influence a patient's behavior by altering the consequences of their actions. This can involve rewarding desired behaviors (positive reinforcement) or removing rewards or introducing penalties for undesired behaviors (negative reinforcement). The goal is to modify specific behaviors that may be contributing to psychological distress or dysfunction. \n\nA. Helping patients identify a hierarchy of anxiety-arousing experiences is more related to exposure therapy, a technique often used in cognitive-behavioral therapy, which helps individuals confront and overcome their fears or anxieties by gradually exposing them to the source of their fear in a controlled environment.\n\nB. Vigorously challenging clients' illogical ways of thinking is a technique more commonly associated with cognitive therapy, rather than behavioral therapy. However, both cognitive and behavioral therapies often work together, where cognitive therapy might challenge irrational thoughts and beliefs, and behavioral therapy might then address the resulting behaviors.\n\nD. Repeating or rephrasing what a client says during the course of therapy is a technique used in various forms of therapy, including behavioral therapy, but it is not the primary method for altering patterns of responding. It is often used to ensure understanding, clarify statements, or to help guide the conversation, but it does not directly alter the patterns of responding."
