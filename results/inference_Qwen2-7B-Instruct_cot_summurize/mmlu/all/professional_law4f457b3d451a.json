The interrogatories stated that they were to be answered within 30 days after service. The defendant is likely to succeed in obtaining a protective order on which of the following grounds?\n\nA. Interrogatories are only proper to discover facts, not contentions.\nB. Interrogatories may not be served until an answer to the complaint is filed.\nC. Interrogatories may not be served until the parties have conferred to arrange for initial disclosures and prepare a discovery plan.\nD.

The interrogatories exceed the number permitted without permission from the court or an agreement between the parties.\n\nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure (Rule 33 sets forth the requirements for interrogatories. Specifically, Rule 33(b)(1) states that \"the party propounding them may serve written interrogatories requiring the other party to state its answers, or to make a computation of damages or other relief sought, under oath.\" However, there is no specific limit given on the number of interrogatories that can be served. The rule does not restrict the number of interrogatories that can be served but suggests that the number should be reasonable and proportionate to the needs of the case.\n\nInterrogatories that are overly burdensome, require information that is already known or easily obtainable through other means, or are that are not reasonably related to the subject matter of the litigation, might be deemed excessive and subject to a protective order. In this scenario, if the defendant believes that the 25 interrogatories are excessive or inappropriate, they could argue that the number exceeds what is reasonable for the case at hand, thus seeking a protective order.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the specific ground for a protective order would depend on the particular circumstances of the case, including the content of the interrogatories and how they relate to the case. For instance, if the interrogatories are clearly designed to harass the defendant or seek irrelevant information, the court might agree that the number of interrogatories is excessive based on the nature of the questions rather than just their quantity."
