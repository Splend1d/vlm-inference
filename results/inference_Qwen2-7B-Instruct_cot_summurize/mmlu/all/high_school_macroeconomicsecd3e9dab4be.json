During economic expansions, when incomes tend to increase, automatic stabilizers cause government expenditures to rise ( as spending on programs like welfare and unemployment benefits goes up due to more people qualifying for them. At the same time, taxes tend to fall or rise less than proportionally with income, because higher incomes trigger higher tax brackets but not necessarily at the same rate. This helps to stabilize the economy by reducing the burden on individuals and businesses, preventing overheating, and potentially moderating the pace of growth."
