He emphasizes on the concept of \"ideal rules\" which are hypothetical rules that an ideally rational agent would follow in all circumstances to achieve the best overall outcomes. These rules are considered 'ideal' because they are not bound by any specific context or practical limitations, rather they represent the ultimate ethical guidelines for actions.\n\nThus, according to Brandt, what is right or wrong is determined by whether our actions align with these ideal rules. The aim is to act in ways that promote the greatest good for the greatest number when viewed through the lens of these idealized principles."
