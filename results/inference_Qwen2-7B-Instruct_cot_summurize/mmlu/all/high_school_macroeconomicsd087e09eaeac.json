A greatly depreciated currency\n\nAn expansionary supply shock refers to a situation where there is a sudden increase in the economy's productive capacity, leading to lower prices and higher output. When a currency depreciates significantly, it makes a country's exports cheaper for foreign buyers and imports more expensive for domestic consumers. This generally leads to increased demand for exports and a boost in production, thus stimulating economic growth. This is considered an expansionary supply shock because it increases the supply of goods and services in the market."
