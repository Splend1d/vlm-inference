In this case, the defendant grabbed the unattended pocketbook with the intent to run away, which demonstrates an attempt to take property from the victim's immediate possession through force ( (the act of grabbing) or fear ( (the victim becoming frightened). Additionally, the victim was injured (knocked unconscious) as a result of the defendant's actions, further supporting a charge of robbery."
