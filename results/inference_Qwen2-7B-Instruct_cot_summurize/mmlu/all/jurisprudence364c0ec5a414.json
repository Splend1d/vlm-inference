A person with a physical disability must act as would a reasonable person with the same disability.\n\nThe reasonable person standard is a legal concept used to determine whether a person has acted negligently or with due care. It assumes that a hypothetical \"reasonable person\" would have acted in a certain way under similar circumstances. This standard does not change based on individual differences such as physical or mental disabilities. Instead, it considers what a person with similar characteristics (like age, experience, education, etc.) would reasonably do. Thus, for someone with a physical disability, the comparison is made to a reasonable person with the same disability, not to an average person without any disability."
