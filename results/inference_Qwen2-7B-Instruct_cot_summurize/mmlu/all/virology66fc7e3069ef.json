This means they can infect a wide range of cell types and tissues within the body, not being restricted to specific organs or systems. Clinical manifestations of infection can vary widely depending on the specific aranavirus involved, but common symptoms might include fever, malaise, and sometimes respiratory symptoms. \n\nOptions B, C, and D refer to specific conditions that could be associated with certain infections, but they are not uniquely characteristic of clinical infection by an arenavirus.\n\n- B. Signs of malaria: Malaria is caused by Plasmodium parasites and is characterized by symptoms such as fever, chills, and fatigue. It's not typically associated with an arenavirus infection.\n  \n- C. Short 2-3 days incubation: The incubation period for an infection can vary greatly depending on the virus and the individual infected. Some viruses have very short incubation periods while others may have much longer ones. There isn't any specific evidence suggesting that all anareviral infections have a consistently short 2-3 day incubation period.\n\n- D. Hepatitis: While some viral infections can cause hepatitis ( inflammation of the liver, this is not a unique symptom of an anareviral infection. Many different viruses can cause hepatitis including those in the hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E families."
