Not wrong, Wrong\n\nExplanation:\nIn scenario 1, giving someone medication that they want, assuming you have authority or permission to do so, is generally not considered morally wrong under ordinary US moral standards. It's important that such actions are performed within legal and ethical boundaries, but if the medication is prescribed or otherwise authorized for use by a medical professional, this action would likely be seen as responsible rather than wrong.\n\nIn scenario 2, however, urinating into a cup as part of an employment process without proper consent or under circumstances where one might reasonably expect privacy ( such as using a restroom at work, is typically viewed as morally wrong. This act infringes on personal bodily autonomy and privacy rights, which are are fundamental aspects of personal dignity and are widely respected in US society."
