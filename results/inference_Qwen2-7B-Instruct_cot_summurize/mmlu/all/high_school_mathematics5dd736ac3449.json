However, we don't have a direct value for \\(f(5\\), but since we're only considering the provided points, the only way \\(f(x)\\) can result in 5 from the given data is if \\(f(1) = 5\\).\n- Similarly, for \\(f(x) = 3\\), we see \\(f(2) = 3\\).\n- Lastly, for \\(f(x) = 1\\), we see \\(f(3) = 1\\).\n\nSo, the outputs that could potentially act as inputs are \\(5\\), \\(3\\), and \\(1\\). This means we should look at the combinations of these values as potential \\(x\\) and \\(f(x)\\) pairs.\n\nLet's map out the possible points \\((a, b)\\) and \\((c, d)\\):\n\n- For \\(b = 5\\), the possible \\(x\\) values are \\(1\\) ( because \\(f(1) = 5\\).\n- For \\(d = 3\\), the possible \\(x\\) value is \\(2\\) because \\(f(2) = 3\\).\n- For \\(b = 3\\) or \\(d = 1\\), no such \\(x\\) values exist within our given points because \\(f(x) = 3\\) or \\(f(x) = 1\\) does not correspond to an input \\(x\\) in our set of known points.\n\nThus, the points that must be on the graph of \\(y = f(f(x))\\) based on the given information are \\((1,5)\\) and \\((2,3)\\).\n\nTherefore, \\(ab + cd = ( 1*5 + 2*3 = 5 + 6 = 11\\).\n\nNone of the provided options match \\(11\\), suggesting there might have been a misunderstanding in interpreting the question or a misalignment with the provided options.
