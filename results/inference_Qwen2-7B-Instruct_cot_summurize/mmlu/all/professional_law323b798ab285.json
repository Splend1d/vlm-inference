This service is authorized under a certificate of convenience and necessity issued by the Interstate Commerce Commission, pursuant to federal statute. The certificate does not, however, specify particular highways, streets, or locations for the bus service. The company's advertising stresses that it picks up and delivers passengers at the center of each city that it serves. The company's management regards this as a particularly effective advertising point in competition with the airlines and the railroads, because short-haul traffic supplies a major part of the bus company's revenues. One of the major cities on the east coast, acting to relieve traffic congestion and air pollution, has recently enacted an ordinance that prohibits (a) the operation of all trucks and buses in a five- square- mile central business area, known as center city, between the hours of 10:00 A. M. and 4:00 P. M. on weekdays, and (b) all on-street parking of passenger automobiles in center city between the same weekday hours. The company's bus station in this city is located in the heart of the center city area. According to its transportation schedules, more than 75 buses either enter or leave this station between the hours of 10:00 A. M. and 4:00 P. M. each weekday. If the company brings suit challenging the constitutionality of the city ordinance, the court will most likely declare the ordinance\n\nA. constitutional, because it is within the city's police power to regulate transportation services in the center city business district.\nB. constitutional, because it is a valid exercise of municipal regulation in the area of intrastate commerce.\nC. unconstitutional, because it violates the dormant commerce clause.\nD. unconstitutional, because the ordinance is discriminatory per Se.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is C. unconstitutional, because it violates the dormant commerce clause.\n\nThe Dormant Commerce Clause refers to the principle that Congress, and by extension, state and local governments, cannot pass legislation that discriminates against or excessively burdens interstate commerce. In other words, state and local laws must not unduly favor in-state economic interests over out-of-state competitors. \n\nIn this case, the city's ordinance appears to disproportionately affect the operations of the bus company, which provides intercity transportation services. The ordinance restricts the bus company's ability to operate within the central business district during peak hours, potentially leading to significant disruptions in their service and financial losses due to reduced passenger traffic during those times. \n\nIf the bus company successfully challenges the constitutionality of the ordinance in court, the court would likely find that the ordinance violates the dormant commerce clause, as it discriminates against interstate commerce by imposing restrictions specifically targeting the bus company's operations without providing a compelling state interest or reasonable justification that outweighs the burden on interstate commerce."
