                    "text": "To find the range of customers served on the middle 50 percent of days for a normally distributed variable, we can use the concept of interquartile range ( or IQR. In a normal distribution, the first quartile (Q1) is approximately at the 25th percentile, the median (Q2) is at the 50th percentile, and the third quartile (Q3) is at the 75th percentile. The IQR, which is the difference between Q3 and Q1, represents the range where the middle 50% of the data lies.\n\nGiven that the distribution is normal with a mean (\\(\\mu\\)) of 3,250 customers and a standard deviation (\\(\\sigma\\)) of 320, we can calculate Q1 and Q3 using the Z-scores associated with these percentiles. For a normal distribution:\n- Q1 corresponds to about -0.6745 standard deviations below the mean.\n- Q3 corresponds to about +0.6745 standard deviations above the mean.\n\nLet's calculate Q1 and Q3:\n\n\\[ Q1 = \\mu - Z_{Q1} \\cdot \\sigma \\]\n\\[ Q3 = \\mu + Z_{Q3} \\cdot \\sigma \\]\n\nWhere \\(Z_{Q1}\\) and \\(Z_{Q3}\\) are are the Z-scores for the first and third quartiles, respectively. These Z-scores are approximately -0.6745 and 0.6745.\n\n\\[ Q1 = 3250 - 0.6745 \\times 320 \\]\n\\[ Q3 = 3250 + 0.6745 \\times 320 \\]\n\nCalculating these:\n\n\\[ Q1 = 3250 - 0.6745 \\times 320 = 3250 - 215.84 \\approx 3034.16 \\]\n\\[ Q3 = 3250 + 0.6745 \\times 320 = 3250 + 215.84 \\approx 3465.84 \\]\n\nRounding off to the nearest whole number, we get:\n\n\\[ Q1 \\approx 3034 \\]\n\\[ Q3 \\approx 3466 \\]\n\nTherefore, the range of customers served on the middle 50 percent of days is approximately from 3034 to 3466, which corresponds to option A.
