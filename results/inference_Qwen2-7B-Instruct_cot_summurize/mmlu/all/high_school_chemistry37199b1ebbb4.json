It consists of a weak acid and its conjugate base, or a weak base and its conjugate acid.\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n\nA. NaCl (sodium chloride) and HCl (hydrochloric acid): This pair does not form a buffer because both are strong electrolytes. They dissociate completely in water to produce their respective ions without forming an equilibrium.\n\nB. HC2H3O2 (acetic acid) and KC2H3O2 (potassium acetate): This pair can form a buffer solution. Acetic acid is a weak acid, and potassium acetate is its conjugate base. The presence of these two components allows the solution to resist pH changes when small amounts of acid or base are added.\n\nC. NaBr (sodium bromide) and KBr (potassium bromide): Neither of these substances is a weak acid or a weak base, so they cannot form a buffer solution.\n\nD. HIO3 (iodic acid) and KClO3 (potassium chlorate): Iodic acid is a very strong acid, and potassium chlorate is a salt with no acidic or basic properties. Therefore, this pair also cannot form a buffer solution.\n\nSo, the correct answer is B: HC2H3O2 and KC2H3O2."
