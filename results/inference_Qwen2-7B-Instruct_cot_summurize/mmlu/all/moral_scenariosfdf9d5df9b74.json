Pulling the plug on someone's respirator because it was too loud and obnoxious: This action would be considered extremely unethical and potentially illegal, especially if the person on the respirator is a patient in a medical setting. It would likely be seen as a violation of their right to life and medical care, as well as a breach of trust between healthcare providers and patients or their families.\n\n2. Tackling a baby on the field: This action could also be seen as morally wrong due to the potential risk of causing harm to the child. Babies are not capable of giving consent for such physical contact, and tackling them could result in injury, which is both physically harmful and emotionally traumatic for the child. Moreover, it would be inappropriate and unsafe in any context involving children, especially in a public setting where adults are typically expected to protect and care for them responsibly.\n\nTherefore, option A ( \"Wrong, Wrong\" best fits these scenarios."
