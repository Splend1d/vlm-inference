Wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation:\nTeaching a cat to use a public sandbox as a litter box is clearly morally wrong as it can contaminate the public space and potentially harm other people or animals who might use the sandbox. This action disregards community standards and the rights of others.\n\nFollowing your brother home from school, on the other hand, could be seen as a harmless act unless there are specific circumstances that make it inappropriate or concerning ( such as if the brother is being bullied or harmed at school, and the action is meant to protect him. However, in general terms, this action does not involve any wrongdoing as it is simply a form of care and concern for one's sibling."
