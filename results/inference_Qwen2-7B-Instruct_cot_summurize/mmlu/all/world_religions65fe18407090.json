Soto Zen. \n\nSoto Zen Buddhism, originating in China and later spreading to Japan, emphasizes the path of gradual enlightenment or \"jikishiki.\" This path involves a series of stages where practitioners progress through deeper levels of understanding and realization. It contrasts with other traditions like Pure Land Buddhism which often focus more on instantaneous rebirth into a Pure Land (or Nirvana) through faith and devotion.\n\nIt's important to note that all Buddhist traditions aim for enlightenment, but they differ in their methods and teachings."
