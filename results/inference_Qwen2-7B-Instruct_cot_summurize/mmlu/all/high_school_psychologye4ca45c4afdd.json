This is because these are the fundamental parts that define a chair. \n\nOptions A, C, and D all go beyond the basic definition of a chair and introduce additional elements or concepts that aren't necessarily part of a chair's standard construction. For example, a desk and/or table ( (A) is a separate piece of furniture, feelings of anxiety associated with school ( (C) are are emotional responses, and an armchair, a chairlift, and a wheelchair ( (D) are are specialized types of chairs designed for different purposes."
