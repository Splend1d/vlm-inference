More frequent for women than men: This statement is not universally true. The frequency of remarriage does not necessarily differ significantly between men and women based on available data. It depends on various factors including age, previous marital status, and personal circumstances.\n\nB. Typically more successful: There is no definitive answer to this question as the success of remarriages can be highly subjective and varies greatly from one relationship to another. Success in a remarriage can be measured in different ways\u2014financial stability, emotional fulfillment, longevity, etc. Some remarriages might thrive because the individuals involved bring valuable life experiences and maturity. However, others might struggle due to unresolved issues from their previous marriages or difficulties blending families. There isn't enough evidence to claim that remarriages are typically more successful.\n\nC. Typically less successful: Similar to the previous point, there isn't enough evidence to suggest that remarriages are typically less successful. Success in remarriages can depend on numerous factors, including the quality of communication, willingness to work through challenges, and the ability to create a strong bond with a new partner. Some remarriages can be very successful, while others might face more challenges compared to first marriages due to the complexities of blending families or dealing with past traumas.\n\nD. Most common among those who have never been married before: This statement is also not necessarily accurate. Remarriages can occur at any stage of an individual's life, regardless of whether they were previously married or not. People may choose to remarry after a divorce, the loss of a spouse, or for other reasons such as finding someone they wish to spend their life with. Data suggests that remarriages happen across all marital statuses, not just among those who have never been married before.\n\nIn summary, the frequency and success of remarriages cannot be generalized and depend on a multitude of individual circumstances."
