Additionally, the cycle generates enough energy to produce up to 12 molecules of ATP (adenosine triphosphate). However, this 12 ATP is generally not directly produced from the cycle itself but rather from the oxidation of the NADH and FADH2 molecules generated in the cycle in the electron transport chain. \n\nSo, while you might see '12 ATP' associated with the Krebs cycle because it produces the precursors for ATP production, technically the Krebs cycle itself does not directly produce that many ATP molecules through its own reactions. The total amount of ATP generated through the Krebs cycle and the electron transport chain can be much higher, often in the range of 36-38 ATP per glucose molecule under optimal conditions."
