She began looking for a home to purchase in the mountain community. She found one suitable location offered for sale by the owner. The asking price for the home was $100,000. Although the teacher was very interested in purchasing the home, she told the owner that she was not sure it would fit within her budget. The owner the grabbed a piece of paper and wrote the following:\"December 1In consideration of one dollar, receipt of which is acknowledged, I hereby offer to sell to you my home for $100,000. This offer shall remain open until 4:00 p. m. December 30. \" The owner then signed the paper and handed it to the teacher, who left without paying the $1. On December 15, the owner sent the teacher a letter in which the owner stated, \"Please be advised that I am hereby withdrawing my offer to sell you my home. \" This letter was received and read by the teacher on December 16. The next day, the teacher tendered a cashier's check to the owner in the amount of $100,001 (which included the $100,000 purchase price plus the $1 consideration) and demanded a deed of conveyance to the property. The owner refused to accept the cashier's check. The teacher has now brought suit against the owner for specific performance. In her pleadings, the teacher admits that the recited $1 was not in fact paid to the owner when their written agreement was executed. Assume the teacher lives in a jurisdiction that follows the Restatement of Contracts. As a result, which of the following is the teacher's best argument that such failure of payment does not bar her claim to specific performance?\n\nA. The recited consideration was only a sham pretense of bargained-for consideration, and was therefore de minimis and of no legal significance.\nB. The teacher's inclusion of the $1 in her tendered check on December 17 was a timely cure of an immaterial breach of a bilateral real estate option contract.\nC. By promising to hold the offer open until December 30 in a signed writing, the owner could not revoke the offer prior to December 30.\nD. The written instrument embodied a proposal for a fair exchange within a reasonable time period and was therefore an enforceable option contract, regardless of whether the nominal consideration recited was bargained for or paid.\n"

The written instrument embodied a proposal for a fair exchange within a reasonable time period and was therefore an enforceable option contract, regardless of whether the nominal consideration recited was bargained for or paid.\n\nThis argument rests on the fact that the document presented by the owner clearly outlines the terms of the offer, including the price, the duration of the offer, and the condition that the $1 consideration must be paid. Even though the teacher did not pay the $1 at the time of signing, the document still represents a binding agreement to enter into a future transaction under specified conditions. The nominal consideration ($1) serves as evidence of the intent to enter into a real estate transaction and does not necessarily preclude the enforceability of the contract.\n\nThe other options may not apply as effectively:\n\nA. The concept of de minimis consideration suggests that a small or insignificant amount of consideration might not negate the existence of a contract, but in this case, the nominal consideration is part of the written offer and its presence is essential to the structure of the agreement.\n\nB. The teacher's tendering of the $100,001 check after the owner's withdrawal of the offer would not be considered a timely cure since the offer had already been revoked before the check was tendered.\n\nC. While the promise to hold the offer open until December 30 might suggest the owner cannot revoke the offer during that period, the key factor in determining the enforceability of the option contract is the existence of a valid offer and acceptance, which was interrupted by the owner's revocation of the offer."
