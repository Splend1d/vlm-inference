He famously argues against the view, prevalent at his time, that goodness is essentially a form of pleasure (as suggested by some utilitarian thinkers, or a matter of fulfilling one's desires.\n\nMoore argues that there is a fundamental, indefinable, and non-empirical quality to goodness. He introduces the concept of \"intrinsic value\", meaning that something is good in itself, irrespective of its consequences or the desires it fulfills. \n\nTherefore, none of the options A, B, or C accurately capture Moore's definition of \"good\". So the answer would be D. none of the above."
