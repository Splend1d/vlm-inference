This makes the demand for that good more elastic because consumers are more likely to adjust their consumption significantly in response to price changes. \n\nLet's briefly explain why the other options are not correct:\n\nB. the period of time to respond to a price change is short: This statement implies that the elasticity of demand might be higher if consumers can react quickly to price changes. While it's true that consumers might respond more quickly to price changes, this factor doesn't necessarily make the demand more or less elastic; rather, it affects how quickly the market adjusts to the new equilibrium.\n\nC. the number of substitute products is limited: The availability of substitutes generally increases the elasticity of demand. If there are are few alternatives available, consumers may not have many options when prices change, making demand less responsive to those changes.\n\nD. the product is a necessity: Necessities often have inelastic demand because people need them regardless of price changes. However, this statement is not universally true, as even necessities can have elastic demand under certain conditions ( for example, when there are significant price fluctuations or availability issues."
