This tool culture reflects a significant advancement in tool-making techniques, including bifacial flaking, which allowed for more uniform and precise shaping of stone tools.\n\nThe Mousterian tool culture, associated with Neanderthals (and also used by anatomically modern humans, evolved from the earlier Oldowan tool culture. Mousterian tools include a variety of flaked stone tools such as scrapers, points, and blades. The development of the Mousterian tool culture represents an important stage in the evolution of human tool-making abilities and is often considered evidence of cognitive advancements in Homo sapiens.\n\nTherefore, both Acheulean and Mousterian technologies are associated with anatomically modern Homo sapiens."
