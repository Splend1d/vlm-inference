The specification should be modified to indicate what should be done if there is more than one index of larger values.**\n\nWhen writing code, it's essential to ensure that the requirements are clear and unambiguous. In this case, since the original specification doesn't provide guidance on how to handle multiple occurrences of a larger value, modifying the specification to clarify this behavior is necessary. This could involve deciding whether to return all indices, the first or last index found, or perhaps even an error condition if multiple occurrences are not desired.\n\nOptions A, B, and D do not address the issue of ambiguity in the original specification and may lead to unexpected behavior or confusion about the intended functionality. Option C ensures that the implementation aligns with the actual needs or expectation by providing clear guidelines from the start."
