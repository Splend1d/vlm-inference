Salivary amylase digests the dextran film on tooth enamel form from dietary sucrose.\n\nSalivary amylase does not digest dextran films on tooth enamel; instead, it breaks down starches into simpler sugars in the mouth. The dextran film mentioned here likely refers to a layer that forms on teeth due to the breakdown of carbohydrates, including sucrose, by oral bacteria, but the direct digestion of this film is not carried out by salivary amylase."
