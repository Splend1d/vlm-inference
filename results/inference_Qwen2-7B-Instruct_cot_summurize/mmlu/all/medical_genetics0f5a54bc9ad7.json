Tay-Sachs disease.\n\nEnzyme assays are commonly used in medical genetics to detect enzyme deficiencies associated with various genetic disorders, including Tay-Sachs disease. These tests measure the activity level of the affected enzyme in question. In the case of Tay-Sachs disease, the enzyme Hexosaminidase A is typically assessed. Carriers of the Tay-Sachs disease mutation may have reduced activity of this enzyme, which can be detected through an enzyme assay. \n\nThe other options listed ( Cystic fibrosis, Fragile X syndrome, and Oculocutaneous albinism - are typically diagnosed through genetic testing rather than enzyme assays."
