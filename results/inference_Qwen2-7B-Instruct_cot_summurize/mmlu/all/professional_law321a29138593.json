In response to the complaint, the plumber filed a motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. The court denied the motion. Thereafter, the plumber did not file an answer or any other response to the company's action. Sixty days after the court's order denying the motion to dismiss, the company asked the clerk to enter default, and the clerk did so. The company applied to the court for the entry of a default judgment and notified the plumber three days before the default judgment hearing. After an ex parte hearing in which the court received evidence on the damages amount, the court entered a default judgment for the full amount sought. Ten days later, the plumber filed a motion to set aside the default judgment. Is the court likely to grant the plumber's motion?\n\nA. No, because the court could fix the amount of damages even without hearing the plumber's evidence.\nB. No, because the plumber failed to plead or otherwise defend against the company's action.\nC. Yes, because the plumber was not given adequate notice of the hearing on the company's application for the entry of a default judgment.\nD. Yes, because the State A federal court lacked personal jurisdiction over the plumber as a State B citizen.\n"

Yes, because the plumber was not given adequate notice of the hearing on the company's application for the entry of a default judgment.\n\nWhen a defendant fails to respond to a complaint within the time allowed by the rules of procedure, the plaintiff may seek a default judgment. However, once a default judgment has been entered, the defendant may move to set it aside under certain circumstances, such as showing that they were unaware of the lawsuit and the judgment (or that there was some other reason for their failure to respond. In this case, the plumber argues that they were not properly notified of the hearing on the company's application for the entry of a default judgment, which is a crucial procedural step that affects their rights. This lack of notice can be considered a sufficient basis for setting aside a default judgment, especially if the defendant demonstrates reasonable diligence in attempting to learn of the proceeding.\n\nTherefore, if the plumber can show that they were not adequately notified of the hearing, the court would likely grant their motion to set aside the default judgment to ensure due process and fairness in the legal proceedings."
