The correct answer is:\n\n**D. Higher spending**  \n**Higher taxes**  \n**Lowering the discount rate**\n\nHere's why:\n\n- **Higher spending** helps stimulate the economy by increasing government demand for goods and services, which can boost economic activity and employment.\n- **Higher taxes** counteracts some of the increased government spending, helping to avoid a large budget deficit. By raising taxes, the government collects more revenue, which can be used to fund other programs or pay down debt.\n- **Lowering the discount rate** encourages banks to borrow more from the central bank, which in turn allows them to lend more to businesses and consumers at lower interest rates. This stimulates borrowing and spending in the economy.\n\nThis combination aims to boost aggregate demand ( without significantly increasing the budget deficit, as higher taxes offset the additional cost of increased spending. It also uses monetary policy to facilitate the fiscal stimulus by making credit more accessible and affordable."
