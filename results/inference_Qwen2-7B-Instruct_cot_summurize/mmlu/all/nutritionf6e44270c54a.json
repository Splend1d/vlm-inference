Most vitamin D in the body does not come from food so access to food is not an important determinant of vitamin D status.\n\nThe primary source of vitamin D for most people comes from sunlight exposure, particularly ultraviolet B (UVB) rays. The skin converts these rays into vitamin D3, also known as cholecalciferol. This process occurs naturally and does not depend on dietary intake, hence why access to food alone is not an important determinant of vitamin D status. However, it's important to note that dietary sources like fatty fish, egg yolks, and fortified foods can provide vitamin D, especially in individuals who may have limited sun exposure or cannot synthesize enough vitamin D through sunlight. Additionally, supplements can be crucial in ensuring adequate vitamin D levels, especially in populations with high risk of deficiency."
