This means that after the sale, the woman retains an undivided one-half interest in the land.\n\n**Step 2:** The woman then sells her remaining undivided one-half interest to the husband and his brother on June 1, 2006. The deed specifies that they hold the property as joint tenants, not tenants by the entirety or tenants in common. This means that the husband and his brother each own half of the remaining interest.\n\n**Step 3:** The husband then sells his interest in the two deeds from the woman to his cousin. Since the husband held an equal share with his brother, when he sold his interest, he transferred half of the remaining half-interest (to the cousin.\n\nSo, originally, there was the whole tract of land. After the first transaction, the woman owned 1/2 of the land, and the husband and wife owned the other 1/2. After the second transaction, the land was split into four equal parts:\n\n- Woman owns 1/4 ( (she sold 1/2 to the husband and wife, who then sold back their half to the brother)\n- Husband owns 1/4 ( (he sold his half to the cousin)\n- Wife owns 1/4 \n- Brother owns 1/4 \n\nGiven this, when the husband died, he passed his 1/4 interest to his cousin. Therefore, the cousin now owns **an undivided one-quarter interest in the land**.\n\nCorrect answer: B. an undivided one-quarter interest in the land."
