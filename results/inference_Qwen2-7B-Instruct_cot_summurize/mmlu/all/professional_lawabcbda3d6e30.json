                    "text": "A woman owned four beach houses. Each house had star-shaped windows. As the hurricane season was approaching, she hired a carpenter to build storm windows for the star-shaped and deliver them to the four houses. Because of the unique shape of the windows, the carpenter had to do all work by hand. The carpenter and woman signed a contract under which the carpenter promised to build and deliver the storm windows to all four beach houses within 30 days, and the woman promised to pay $8,000 ($2,000 per beach house) within one week of completion of the job. Two weeks after the contract was signed, a fire destroyed the carpenter's workshop, where he was storing all the completed storm windows before delivery. The carpenter then sent a letter to the woman that read:\"The fire destroyed my equipment and inventory \u0080\u0094 including the storm windows, which had been completed and which were awaiting delivery. I am dead broke and cannot complete my obligations under the contract. \" The woman then telephoned the carpenter and told him, \"Unless you fulfill your contractual obligations, I will sue you!\"In an action for specific performance to compel the carpenter to build and deliver the storm windows, the woman will most likely\n\nA. succeed, because the carpenter's loss of the inventory would not excuse his duty of performance.\nB. succeed, because the beach houses would suffer severe damage in the event a hurricane struck without the storm windows having been installed.\nC. not succeed, because the carpenter's performance would be excused by the unforeseeable act of God.\nD. not succeed, because the carpenter's loss of inventory would render his performance impossible.\n"

Specific performance is an equitable remedy that compels a party to perform their contractual obligations, particularly when monetary damages are inadequate or impractical. \n\nThe fact that the carpenter's workshop burned down and the storm windows were destroyed does not automatically excuse the carpenter from performing the contract. The key question is whether the destruction of the inventory was foreseeable or an unforeseeable act of God. If the fire was not due to any fault or negligence on the part of the carpenter (for example, if it was caused by natural events such as lightning or an earthquake), it might be considered an unforeseeable act of God, potentially excusing the performance. However, if the fire resulted from the carpenter's own actions (like neglecting safety measures, this could negate the defense of an unforeseeable act of God.\n\nGiven the information provided, there is no indication that the fire was due to any fault or negligence on the part of the carpenter, and it occurred two weeks after the contract was signed, suggesting it might have been an unforeseeable event. Therefore, the woman might argue that the destruction of the inventory does not relieve the carpenter from his obligation to perform under the contract, especially since he still has the ability to construct new storm windows and fulfill his contractual duties. \n\nThus, the most likely outcome would be that the woman succeeds in her action for specific performance, assuming she can meet the legal requirements for such a remedy. The court would consider whether the carpenter's obligations under the contract are still feasible and whether the woman would suffer significant harm if the relief were not granted."
