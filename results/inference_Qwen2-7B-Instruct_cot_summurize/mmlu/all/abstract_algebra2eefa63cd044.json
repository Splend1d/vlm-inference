A polynomial is considered irreducible over a field if it cannot be factored into non-constant polynomials with coefficients from that field.\n\n### Over \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\)\n\nFor \\(4x - 2\\), let's consider its factors. We can factor out a 2 from \\(4x - 2\\) to get \\(2(2x - 1)\\). Since this factorization involves an integer coefficient (2) and another polynomial (which is linear and thus irreducible over \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\)), \\(4x - 2\\) is reducible over \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\) because it can be expressed as a product of non-constant polynomials with integer coefficients.\n\n### Over \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\)\n\nOver \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\), the field of rational numbers, \\(4x - 2\\) can be rewritten as \\(2(x - \\frac{1}{2})\\). This representation shows that \\(4x - 2\\) is also reducible over \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\), as it can be factored into a constant (2 and a linear polynomial \\(x - \\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGiven the above analysis:\n\n- Statement 1 is False.\n- Statement 2 is also False.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **B. False, False**."
