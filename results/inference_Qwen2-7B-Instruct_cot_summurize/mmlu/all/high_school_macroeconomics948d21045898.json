It includes consumption ( (household spending on goods and services), investment (spending by businesses on capital goods), government spending (on goods and services), and net exports ( (exports minus imports).\n\nOf the options given:\n\nA. Federal government purchases of goods and services: This is included in the calculation of GDP as part of government spending.\n\nB. Imports: Imports are not included in GDP calculations. Imports reduce the total output because they represent goods and services that were produced outside the country but are counted as consumption within the country.\n\nC. State and local government purchases of goods and services: This is included in the calculation of GDP as part of government spending.\n\nD. Exports: Exports are included in GDP calculations under the net exports component. They represent the value of goods and services produced domestically but sold to foreign buyers.\n\nTherefore, the option that is NOT included in GDP is B. Imports."
