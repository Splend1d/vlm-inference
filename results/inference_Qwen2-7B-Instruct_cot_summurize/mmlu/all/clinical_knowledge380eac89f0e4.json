Ingestion of carnitine during exercise.\n\nWhile the intake of supplements like carnitine may have some potential benefits for athletic performance, it is not a factor that universally influences success in sports. Success in sports is influenced by a complex interplay of factors including natural ability, skill development, physical conditioning, psychological resilience, tactical understanding, nutrition, and recovery strategies. The ability to handle heavy training without getting ill or injured (option A), tactics (option B), and dietary choices (option C) are all more directly linked to athletic success."
