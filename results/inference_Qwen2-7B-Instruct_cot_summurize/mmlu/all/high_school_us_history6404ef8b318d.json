We of the Progressive party here dedicate ourselves to the fulfillment of the duty laid upon us by our fathers to maintain the government of the people, by the people and for the people whose foundations they laid. We hold with Thomas Jefferson and Abraham Lincoln that the people are the masters of their Constitution, to fulfill its purposes and to safeguard it from those who, by perversion of its intent, would convert it into an instrument of injustice. In accordance with the needs of each generation the people must use their sovereign powers to establish and maintain equal opportunity and industrial justice, to secure which this Government was founded and without which no republic can endure.\n\"This country belongs to the people who inhabit it. Its resources, its business, its institutions and its laws should be utilized, maintained or altered in whatever manner will best promote the general interest. It is time to set the public welfare in the first place.\"\nProgressive Party Platform, 1912\nProgressive Theodore Roosevelt's \"Big Stick\" policy in Latin America was best characterized by his\n\nA. repudiation of the Monroe Doctrine\nB. belief that European nations had the right to protect their economic interests in any remaining colonies throughout the region\nC. recognition of the sovereignty of newly independent nations in the Western hemisphere\nD. belief that the United States had an obligation to protect security and stability by assuming a protective role throughout the Western hemisphere\n"

This policy reflected his belief that the United States had a responsibility to intervene in Latin American affairs when necessary to preserve order, protect U.S. economic interests, and prevent European imperialist actions in the region. Roosevelt justified this interventionist approach based on the notion that the U.S. could act as a stabilizing force and protector of democracy in Latin America, particularly when European nations were perceived to be undermining the sovereignty of newly independent nations or interfering in their domestic affairs. \n\nIn essence, the \"Big Stick\" policy was not about repudiating the Monroe Doctrine but rather expanding its scope to include a more proactive stance by the U.S. in maintaining stability and order in the Western Hemisphere, particularly in the context of Latin American countries. Therefore, option D best characterizes Roosevelt's \"Big Stick\" policy in Latin America."
