These memory cells allow for a much faster and stronger response if the same antigen is encountered again in the future, providing long-lasting immunity. \n\nWhile antibodies (A, T cells (B), and clonal expansion (D) are all important components of the adaptive immune system, they do not possess the unique memory function that distinguishes it from innate immune responses."
