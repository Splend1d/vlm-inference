It essentially represents the benefit that consumers receive from purchasing a product at a price lower than what they are willing to pay.\n\nAmong the options provided, the event that would most likely increase consumer surplus for Reds fans is:\n\nA. The Reds offer discounted parking for all home games.\n\nThis is because offering discounted parking effectively lowers the cost of attending a game for fans, allowing them to realize more value from each ticket they purchase. This reduction in the total cost of attending a game increases their surplus, as they are able to enjoy the benefits of the game at a lower effective cost than they were willing to pay. \n\nThe other options either decrease the surplus (B and C) or do not directly impact it (D). Increasing hot dog prices might affect the overall spending but does not necessarily change the consumer surplus related to tickets. The construction project could increase the travel time and inconvenience for fans, decreasing their surplus. And increasing ticket prices to afford the most talented players would decrease the surplus for fans, as they would be paying more for less disposable income."
