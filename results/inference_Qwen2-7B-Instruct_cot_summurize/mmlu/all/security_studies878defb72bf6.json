Nations are defined by the boundaries and borders of the state.\n\nWhile it's true that nations often have boundaries that align with states, this definition doesn't fully capture the complexity of what a nation encompasses. Nations are typically composed of people who share a common culture, history, language, and identity, which can transcend political borders. Therefore, the boundaries and borders of the state alone do not define a nation; they are more intricately tied to cultural and social factors as well."
