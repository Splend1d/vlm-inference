A woman made the highest bid, which was $100, and the auctioneer slammed the gavel down, completing the transaction. Before the day's auction ended, an art historian told the auctioneer in private during a break that the piece was an original by Claude Monet, worth about $1 million. The auctioneer quickly told the successful bidder that the amount was rejected by the seller and that the piece would be withdrawn from the sale that day. The woman sued the auctioneer, claiming that there was a binding contract and requesting specific performance. Based strictly on the rules of offer and acceptance, is the auctioneer in danger of losing the painting to the successful bidder and, if so, why?\n\nA. No, the auctioneer can always reject an offer made by a bidder at a public auction sale.\nB. No, the auctioneer is the offeree at a no-reserve auction and, as such, the offeree has the absolute power to reject the offer if it is not accepted by the owner.\nC. Yes, in a no-reserve auction there is a binding contract based on the highest amount offered by the winning bidder.\nD. Yes, in a no-reserve auction there is a binding contract as soon as the bidding starts, with each bid being a new binding contract.\n"

Yes, in a no-reserve auction there is a binding contract based on the highest amount offered by the winning bidder.\n\nIn a no-reserve auction, once the highest bid is placed, a binding contract is formed between the seller (via the auctioneer) and the winning bidder. The auctioneer acts as an agent for the seller, and when the gavel falls, the auctioneer accepts the highest bid on behalf of the seller. This action constitutes a legal acceptance of the offer, creating a binding contract. The fact that an expert later confirms the item's true value does not affect the initial contract that was formed. Therefore, the auctioneer cannot unilaterally reject the sale or the contract without facing potential legal consequences, such as the need to fulfill the terms of the contract through specific performance, where the bidder would receive the item."
