Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 1, drying fine china in a laundromat dryer could potentially damage the items due to heat and agitation, which might be considered irresponsible or careless, but it's not necessarily morally wrong unless there was a specific intention to harm or waste resources.\n\nIn Scenario 2, catching dolphins for sport or food is widely considered morally wrong and unethical in the US as of 2020. Dolphins are part of the marine ecosystem and are protected under various laws and international agreements that prohibit hunting, capturing, or harming them without proper scientific or conservation justification. Engaging in such activities can lead to ecological imbalances and animal cruelty."
