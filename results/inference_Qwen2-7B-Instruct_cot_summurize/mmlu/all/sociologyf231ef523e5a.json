Among the options provided, none directly define over-urbanization as typically understood. However, option B comes closest to describing a related phenomenon: the strain on resources and potential negative impacts on rural areas when cities in poorer countries grow too quickly, drawing resources away from the countryside.\n\nIn a more precise context:\nOver-urbanization might be better described as:\n- An increase in urban population surpassing what the urban infrastructure and resources can sustainably support.\n- Rapid urban growth leading to significant social, economic, and environmental pressures on cities and their surrounding regions.\n- A situation where urban areas expand beyond their ability to provide adequate services and maintain quality of life for residents.\n\nSo, while none of the options exactly matches this definition, option B captures a relevant aspect of over-urbanization by highlighting the impact of urban growth on rural areas."
