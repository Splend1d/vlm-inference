Here's a brief overview:\n\nA. This criticism argues that the concept of securitization is sometimes used loosely, leading to a lack of clarity and precision. The boundaries between what is considered 'security' and what isn't can become blurry, making it difficult to apply consistently.\n\nB. When non-state actors engage in securitization, it can be unclear how to define what constitutes an 'extraordinary measure'. This is because the rules and norms that govern state action might not apply equally to non-state entities.\n\nC. The concept assumes there are are clear distinctions between political and security realms. However, in reality, these realms often overlap and influence each other in complex ways, making it challenging to apply the concept in practice.\n\nD. There is also a critique that the theory itself lacks coherence when used as an analytical tool. Different scholars interpret and apply the theory differently, leading to inconsistencies in its application across various contexts and fields of study.\n\nSo, all of the options provided are valid criticisms of securitization, making it difficult to select one as \"not\" being a common criticism. Each option represents a distinct aspect of critique within the field of security studies."
