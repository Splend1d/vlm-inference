                    "text": "Argon is a noble gas and does not form molecules, so it doesn't have dipole-dipole interactions or hydrogen bonding. The only intermolecular force it has is van der Waals forces, which include both instantaneous dipoles and induced dipoles.\n\nThe strength of these van der Waals forces depends on the distance between atoms. At higher temperatures, the kinetic energy of the atoms is greater, causing them to move faster and increasing the distance between them, which weakens the intermolecular forces. As a result, it becomes easier to liquefy gases.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. the very low temperature. Argon can be liquefied at low temperatures because at such temperatures, the kinetic energy of its atoms is reduced, allowing the intermolecular van der Waals forces to dominate and overcome thermal motion, enabling the substance to transition from a gas to a liquid state."
