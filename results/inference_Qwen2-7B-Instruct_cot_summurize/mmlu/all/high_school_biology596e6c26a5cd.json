Silent mutations\n\nSilent mutations, which are substitutions in DNA that do not change the resulting amino acid sequence, can accumulate without affecting the protein function. This can make it seem like two proteins are more closely related based on their amino acid sequences than they actually are based on their genetic makeup. In contrast, nucleotide substitutions directly affect the amino acid sequence when they occur in coding regions ( making it more straightforward to infer evolutionary relationships from them."
