Yes, because states can regulate aliens.\n\nExplanation: In the United States, each state has the authority to regulate professions within their borders, including teaching. This means that states can set requirements for individuals who wish to practice certain professions within their state, such as requiring them to be citizens or residents. Therefore, if a state law requires that all teachers must be citizens, a non-citizen like Liang would not be able to meet this requirement and thus would likely be prevented from teaching in that state without further legal action or exception granted by the state legislature or courts. The other options either do not accurately reflect the legal framework (C and D) or misstate the potential impact of state laws on non-citizens (B)."
