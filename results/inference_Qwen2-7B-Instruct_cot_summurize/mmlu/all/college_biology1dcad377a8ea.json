They consist of a core of eight histone proteins, each of which has two separate domains. The N-terminal tails of these histones (H3, H4, H2A and H2B) project outward from the core and interact with other proteins that help package and organize DNA into chromosomes. Each nucleosome contains about 146 base pairs of DNA wrapped twice around the histone octamer. The linker DNA, which is not part of the nucleosome core, connects adjacent nucleosomes. \n\nSo, a subunit of DNA and protein consisting of 134-base-pair long stretches of DNA surrounding a protein octomer (which is essentially the description of a nucleosome."
