Government authority is created as the result of a social contract.\n\nBoth Thomas Hobbes and John Locke believed in some form of social contract theory, though they had different interpretations of it. Hobbes argued that in the state of nature, life was \"solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.\" He believed that individuals would naturally agree to give up some of their freedoms to a sovereign to ensure peace and order. Similarly, Locke believed in a social contract between the people and their government, but he emphasized individual rights more than Hobbes did. Locke believed that people had natural rights to life, liberty, and property, and that governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed. \n\nStatements B, C, and D do not align with their theories:\n\n- B. Government must enforce religious law to prevent moral decay. This statement is more aligned with the ideas of certain religious leaders or thinkers rather than Hobbes or Locke, who focused on secular governance.\n  \n- C. Government must enforce the majority's will regardless of the wishes of the minority. While Locke believed in the rule of the majority, he also stressed the protection of minority rights and property, suggesting that the government should not enforce policies that infringe on these rights.\n  \n- D. Government must bend to the will of the educated minority. This statement implies a specific subset of the population having undue influence over the government, which neither Hobbes nor Locke supported. Both philosophers believed in the importance of the common good and the consent of the governed, not necessarily the domination by an educated elite."
