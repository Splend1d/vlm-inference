The President issued an executive order requiring all executive branch employees to use exclusively one brand of ballpoint pens and pencils as their writing utensils. According to a study, the federal government could save in excess of $250,000 a year in office supply costs if all executive agencies were to use standardized pens and pencils.\nB. The President issued an executive order requiring all executive branch employees to wear only white shirts and blouses during regular working hours. According to the President's directive, executive employees are prohibited from wearing colored (e. g. , blue or yellow) or striped shirts and blouses while on duty. The President issued the order in an effort to establish a uniform dress code for all executive employees.\nC. In 1887, Congress passed a law establishing a federal Commission of Birdwatchers. The Commission, which is still in effect, consists of seven members who are appointed by the President. The Commission's main function is to go on periodic retreats to photograph and study North American birds and their migratory habits. Believing that the Commission is archaic, the President decides that any future funding will simply be a waste of money. He thus executes an executive decree abrogating the Commission of Birdwatchers.\nD. A devastating hurricane damages an island which is part of a foreign country. The storm destroys many homes, resulting in death and injury to thousands. In response to a request from the foreign government for emergency aid, the President, without seeking the advice and consent of the Senate, issues an executive decree authorizing U. S. Army troops to the island to provide medical and humanitarian assistance.\n"

                    "text": "Executive Order C is the most likely to be found unconstitutional.\n\nThe Constitution of the United States vests the power of the purse in Congress, as stated in Article I, Section 9, Clause 7: \"No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law.\" This means that Congress must pass legislation to authorize spending of public funds. Executive Order C attempts to abrogate ( terminate or rescind) the funding for the Federal Commission of Birdwatchers, which would effectively eliminate the funding without going through the legislative process. This action would likely be seen as exceeding the President's constitutional authority and would therefore be considered unconstitutional.\n\nIn contrast, Executive Order A might be challenged on procedural grounds ( such as not providing adequate notice or opportunity for public comment), but it would not necessarily be unconstitutional based on the content alone. Executive Order B involves a uniform dress code, which is more in line with administrative powers but could be questioned if it infringes on employees' rights or if there was no compelling reason for such a directive. Executive Order D raises concerns about the President acting unilaterally on foreign policy matters without consulting Congress, potentially violating the separation of powers, but it is less clear-cut than Executive Order C regarding constitutional violations."
