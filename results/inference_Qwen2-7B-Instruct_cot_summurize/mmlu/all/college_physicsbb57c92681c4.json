                    "text": "The correct answer is D. The entropy of the system and its environment must increase. In a reversible thermodynamic process, the change in entropy (\u0394S_system + \u0394S_environment is always positive. This is because entropy is a measure of disorder or randomness, and for a reversible process, there are no losses or gains of energy to or from the surroundings, but the process occurs in such a way as to minimize any increase in entropy outside the system. Thus, the total entropy of the system plus its environment increases, adhering to the second law of thermodynamics."
