For societal security dilemmas ambiguity can stem from two sides of nationalism; cultural (positive) and ethnic (negative). Ethnic (political) nationalism is often described as more malign and linked to state disintegration, whereas cultural nationalism is often seen as benign, working within existing state structures.\nB. Clear distinctions between cultural nationalism and political nationalism are difficult to make: cultural nationalism may sometimes be compelled to change itself from a solely cultural movement into a political movement and be conflated with political nationalism.\nC. Dominant actors may exaggerate threat perceptions with the intent of mobilizing political support which can result in action reaction processes.\nD. All of these options.\n"

This statement addresses how societal identities can influence security dilemmas through the lens of nationalism. Nationalism, whether cultural or ethnic, can create ambiguity and tension because it can be interpreted in ways that promote either unity and progress or division and conflict. Cultural nationalism might seek to preserve and enhance national identity without causing significant disruption, while ethnic nationalism could lead to more divisive politics and potentially threaten state cohesion, contributing to a security dilemma.\n\nB. This option highlights the fluid nature of nationalism, where cultural movements might evolve into political ones. This transformation can blur the lines between cultural and political nationalism, making it challenging to distinguish between them. The conflation of these forms can exacerbate security dilemmas by leading to misunderstandings about intentions and threats, thus complicating international relations and domestic policy-making.\n\nC. This statement underscores how dominant actors in a society might manipulate perceptions of threats for political gain. By exaggerating perceived threats, these actors can mobilize support for their agendas, which can trigger a chain reaction of actions and counteractions that escalate tensions and insecurity. This dynamic is a classic example of a security dilemma, where each side's actions increase the risk of the other side's worst-case scenario.\n\nTherefore, all of these options are relevant to understanding how societal identity shapes and complicates security dilemmas in various contexts."
