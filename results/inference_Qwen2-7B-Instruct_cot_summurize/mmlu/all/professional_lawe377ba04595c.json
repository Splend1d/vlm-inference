Shortly thereafter, the investor prepared a subdivision plan that created 90 one-acre residential building lots on this tract with the remaining 10-acre lot proposed for a public school building. In the investor's sales brochure promoting the subdivision, he stated that \"in addition to the close proximity of the proposed school for subdivision residents, the county school district would not need to expend tax money to acquire this property for school construction. \" In 2007, the subdivision plan was recorded with the county recorder's office. On January 15, 2009, the county school board voted to build a new school on the 10-acre tract. The investor's proposed designation of the 1 0-acre tract for construction of a school building would best be described as a (an)\n\nA. equitable servitude.\nB. restrictive covenant.\nC. unenforceable restriction.\nD. easement for public use.\n"

These covenants are typically found in deeds and other legal documents related to the sale or transfer of real estate. They can limit what a property owner can do with their land, such as prohibiting certain types of development or requiring the property to be used for specific purposes. In this case, the investor's statement in the sales brochure could potentially be interpreted as a restrictive covenant, stipulating that the 10-acre lot must be used for a public school. \n\nAn equitable servitude would also restrict the use of property but is more focused on the fairness between parties, often involving easements where one party has the right to use another's land for a specific purpose. An unenforceable restriction might refer to a condition that is legally not binding due to some defect in its creation or enforcement. An easement for public use is a separate legal concept that grants the public a right to use private land for a particular purpose, like a public road or a sidewalk. While this situation could potentially lead to an easement for public use if the school is built, the term does not describe the initial proposal made by the investor."
