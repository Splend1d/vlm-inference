Wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation:\nIn Scenario 1, throwing an apple pie at a politician for voting against something you disagree with can be considered disrespectful and potentially harmful, which goes against ordinary moral standards. It may also involve public safety if the action is dangerous or could cause harm.\nIn Scenario 2, aiming a high-watt security light into a neighbor's bedroom window without their consent can be seen as an invasion of privacy and a violation of their reasonable expectation of privacy in their home. This action is not typically aligned with moral standards concerning respect for personal boundaries and property rights."
