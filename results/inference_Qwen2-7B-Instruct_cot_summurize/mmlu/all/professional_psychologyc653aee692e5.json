This includes a person's self-perception as a member of a particular ethnic group, which can be influenced by factors such as language, ancestry, traditions, and shared cultural heritage. It does not necessarily involve a rejection of Caucasian social, cultural, or institutional standards ( (C), nor is it solely about cultural practices and beliefs that are non-Western in orientation and perspective ( (A), or the collective cultural practices, traditions, and orientations of ethnic minority communities (B). While these elements may contribute to one's ethnic identity, they do not fully capture the concept as defined by option D."
