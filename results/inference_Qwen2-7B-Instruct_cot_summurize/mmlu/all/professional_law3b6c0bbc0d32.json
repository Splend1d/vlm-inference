Prior to the signing of the contract, the homeowner and the painter orally agreed that their contract would be null and void unless the homeowner was able to obtain a $3,000 loan from National Bank before April 1. On March 31, the homeowner was informed by National Bank that his loan application had been rejected. The next day, the homeowner telephoned the painter and informed him that the deal was off. If the painter brings an action for breach of contract against the homeowner, would the latter's inability to secure the loan provide him with a valid defense?\n\nA. No, because the homeowner is estopped to deny the validity of the written contract.\nB. No, because the agreement regarding the loan varied the express terms of the writing.\nC. Yes, because the agreement regarding the loan constituted a valid modification of the writing.\nD. Yes, because the loan agreement was a condition precedent to the existence of the contract.\n"

Yes, because the loan agreement was a condition precedent to the existence of the contract.\n\nIn this scenario, the oral agreement about the loan being a condition precedent to the contract's validity is crucial. This means that the contract itself did not come into effect until the homeowner secured the $3,000 loan from National Bank. Since the homeowner was unable to fulfill this condition (obtaining the loan by April 1), the main contract (to paint the house for $3,000\u2014never came into existence in the first place. Therefore, the homeowner cannot be held liable for breaching a contract that never legally existed."
