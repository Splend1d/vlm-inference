Increasing respiration rate: This helps in increasing the rate of heat loss through the process of evaporative cooling, as more carbon dioxide is expelled from the lungs and moisture is released through sweating.\n\nC. Increasing heart rate: This enhances blood flow to the skin's surface, facilitating heat dissipation.\n\nD. Increasing water lost through skin: Perspiration or sweating increases, which helps in cooling the body as the sweat evaporates.\n\nA. Decreasing salt retention is not typically a primary mechanism for the body to compensate for increased environmental temperatures. While salt retention might be part of the body's response to other conditions ( such as dehydration, it does not directly help in thermoregulation during heat exposure. However, in hot environments, the body may increase salt intake to replace what is lost through excessive sweating."
