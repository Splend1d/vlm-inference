                    "text": "To determine where the curve \\( r = \\sin 3\\theta \\) has a vertical tangent in the first quadrant, we need to understand that a vertical tangent occurs when the derivative of \\( r \\) with respect to \\( \\theta \\) is undefined or infinite. This typically happens when the slope of the tangent line at a point on the curve is vertical.\n\nFor polar curves, we can find the slope of the tangent line using the formula:\n\n\\[ \\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{\\frac{dr}{d\\theta}\\sin(\\theta) + r\\cos(\\theta)}{\\frac{dr}{d\\theta}\\cos(\\theta) - r\\sin(\\theta)} \\]\n\nGiven \\( r = \\sin(3\\theta) \\), let's find \\( \\frac{dr}{d\\theta} \\):\n\n\\[ \\frac{dr}{d\\theta} = 3\\cos(3\\theta \\]\n\nPlugging \\( r \\) and \\( \\frac{dr}{d\\theta} \\) into our formula for \\( \\frac{dy}{dx} \\), we get:\n\n\\[ \\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{3\\cos(3\\theta)\\sin(\\theta) + \\sin(3\\theta)\\cos(\\theta)}{3\\cos(3\\theta)\\cos(\\theta) - \\sin(3\\theta)\\sin(\\theta)} \\]\n\nFor a vertical tangent, \\( \\frac{dy}{dx} \\) should approach infinity. This happens when the denominator approaches zero and the numerator doesn't cancel it out. Let's simplify the expression for the denominator:\n\n\\[ 3\\cos(3\\theta)\\cos(\\theta) - \\sin(3\\theta)\\sin(\\theta) = 3\\cos(3\\theta)\\cos(\\theta) - \\sin(3\\theta)\\sin(\\theta) \\]\n\nWe know that \\( \\sin(3\\theta) \\) and \\( \\cos(3\\theta) \\) will be non-zero values in the first quadrant, so we focus on when the denominator equals zero:\n\n\\[ 3\\cos(3\\theta)\\cos(\\theta) - \\sin(3\\theta)\\sin(\\theta) = 0 \\]\n\nThis equation can be rewritten using the trigonometric identity for the cosine of a sum:\n\n\\[ \\cos(a + b) = \\cos(a)\\cos(b) - \\sin(a)\\sin(b) \\]\n\nSo, setting \\( a = 3\\theta \\) and \\( b = \\theta \\), we get:\n\n\\[ \\cos(4\\theta) = 0 \\]\n\nSolving for \\( \\theta \\) in the first quadrant (\\( 0 < \\theta < \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\)):\n\n\\[ 4\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2}, \\frac{3\\pi}{2} \\]\n\nOnly the first solution is relevant for the first quadrant:\n\n\\[ 4\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\]\n\\[ \\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{8} \\]\n\nConverting \\( \\frac{\\pi}{8} \\) radians to degrees ( (since one radian is approximately equal to 57.3 degrees):\n\n\\[ \\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{8} \\times \\frac{180}{\\pi} \\approx 22.5^\\circ \\]\n\nNone of the provided options exactly matches this value. However, since the question asks for a specific answer choice, it seems there might be an error either in the question or the options given. Based on the calculations, none of the options A, B, C, or D directly corresponds to the precise answer derived from the problem setup. The correct angle is approximately \\( 0.3927 \\) radians, which is not listed among the choices provided. Therefore, based on the information given and assuming the options were meant to represent possible solutions within the range of \\( \\theta \\), the closest match to our calculated angle would likely be option B, \\( \\theta = 0.39 \\), acknowledging this is a close but not exact match."
