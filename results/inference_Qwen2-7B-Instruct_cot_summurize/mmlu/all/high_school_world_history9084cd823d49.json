It is surrounded by mountains and can be approached from one side only; it has no crops, trees, or water, but has reservoirs in which rainwater is collected. The Arabs often cut off the inhabitants from their supply of drinking-water until the they buy them off with money and pieces of cloth. It is an exceedingly hot place. It is the port of the Indians, and to it come large vessels from Kinbayat [Cambay], Kawlam [Quilon], Calicut and many other Malabar ports [on the south-west coast of India]. There are Indian merchants living there, as well as Egyptian merchants. Its inhabitants are all either merchants, porters, or fishermen. Some of the merchants are immensely rich, so rich that sometimes a single merchant is sole owner of a large ship with all it contains, and this is a subject of ostentation and rivalry amongst them. In spite of that they are pious, humble, upright, and generous in character, treat strangers well, give liberally to devotees, and pay in full the tithes due to God.\"\nIbn Battuta, ca. 1325\u20131354 C.E.\nThe views expressed in this journal passage are best seen as evidence of which of the following concerning medieval Islamic societies?\n\nA. The absence of religious orthodoxy\nB. Hostility toward outsiders\nC. Limited economic opportunities\nD. The supremacy of piety\n"

                    "text": "The views expressed in this journal passage best align with option D: The supremacy of piety. Ibn Battuta describes Aden as a place where its inhabitants, despite their wealth and business acumen, are \"pious, humble, upright, and generous in character.\" He also mentions that they treat strangers well and give generously to devotees, paying their tithes in full to God. This reflects a strong emphasis on religious devotion and ethical conduct within the society, suggesting that piety held significant importance in medieval Islamic societies.\n\nOptions A, B, and C do not accurately capture the essence of the passage:\n\nA. The passage does not suggest the absence of religious orthodoxy; rather, it highlights the high value placed on religious practices and adherence to Islamic principles.\n\nB. While the passage does not directly address hostility toward outsiders, it does not provide evidence for such a stance either. Instead, it portrays the inhabitants as treating strangers well, which is inconsistent with hostility.\n\nC. The description of Aden's economy as thriving with merchants, porters, and fishermen suggests that there were economic opportunities, contrary to the idea of limited economic prospects. Ibn Battuta even notes the wealth of some merchants, indicating a certain level of prosperity.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: The passage supports the notion of the supremacy of piety in medieval Islamic societies, as evidenced by the inhabitants' devout behaviors and values."
