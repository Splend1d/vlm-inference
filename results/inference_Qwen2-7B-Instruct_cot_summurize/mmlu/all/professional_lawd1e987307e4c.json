When the friend refused to return the card during a later conversation in a bar, the man pointed a handgun at the friend, held his finger on the trigger, and said, \"Give it back!\" A bystander screamed and threw a beer bottle at the man. The bottle struck the man's hand and caused the gun to discharge, killing the friend instantly. The man was convicted of murder in a jurisdiction that follows the common law of homicide. On appeal, he argues that the evidence, which essentially set out the facts above, was insufficient to support a verdict of murder. Should the man's conviction be reversed?\n\nA. No, because the evidence was sufficient to support a verdict of depraved-heart murder.\nB. No, because the evidence was sufficient to support a verdict of felony murder.\nC. Yes, because the evidence showed that the man did not intentionally pull the trigger.\nD. Yes, because the evidence showed that the man's intent was not to kill the friend, but to take property from him under a claim of right.\n"

However, based on the general principles of criminal law, especially in jurisdictions that follow the common law of homicide, the options provided might not fully capture the complexity of the situation. Here\u2019s an analysis:\n\n**A. No, because the evidence was sufficient to support a verdict of depraved-heart murder.**\nDepraved-heart murder is typically characterized by the act of committing a dangerous act with knowledge that it is likely to cause death or serious injury, but without the intent to kill. In this scenario, if the man was pointing a loaded gun at someone, even if it wasn't his intention to kill, the act itself could potentially support a charge of depraved-heart murder, given the extreme risk involved.\n\n**B. No, because the evidence was sufficient to support a verdict of felony murder.**\nFelony murder occurs when a death occurs during the commission of a felony, regardless of whether the death was intentional or accidental. If the friend's refusal to return the debit card led to the man pointing a gun at him, and the subsequent death occurred during the commission of the robbery ( or attempted robbery, the evidence might support a felony murder charge.\n\n**C. Yes, because the evidence showed that the man did not intentionally pull the trigger.**\nThis option seems to imply that the man did not intend to fire the weapon, which could potentially negate a charge of first-degree murder, where intent to kill is required. However, even if the man did not intend to pull the trigger, the discharge of the weapon and resulting death could still support a charge of second-degree murder or manslaughter, depending on the jurisdiction's laws regarding the use of deadly force under duress or self-defense.\n\n**D. Yes, because the evidence showed that the man's intent was not to kill the friend, but to take property from him under a claim of right.**\nThis argument suggests that the man's actions were more akin to theft or robbery rather than murder. If the jury believes that the man acted with the intent to reclaim property and not to cause death, and that the death was an unintended consequence, this could lead to acquittal or a lesser charge. However, this defense is often scrutinized as it may not meet the legal standards for justifying the use of lethal force in most jurisdictions.\n\nGiven the information provided, **Option B ( No, because the evidence was sufficient to support a verdict of felony murder** might be the most accurate choice if the death occurred during the commission of a felony ( in this case, the attempted recovery of the debit card. However, the precise answer would require a detailed understanding of the applicable laws and the specifics of the case, including any mitigating circumstances and the legal definitions used by the court."
