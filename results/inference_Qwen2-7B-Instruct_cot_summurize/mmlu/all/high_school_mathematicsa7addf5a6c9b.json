Therefore, the interval for \\(u\\) is:\n\n\\[u \\in [-\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{20}]\\]\n\nHowever, since \\(\\frac{1}{20}\\) is approximately \\(0.05\\), and given the options provided, the correct representation of this interval in terms of the options given would be:\n\n\\[u \\in [-\\frac{1}{2}, -\\frac{1}{20}]\\]\n\nThus, the correct answer is **C.** \\([- \\frac{1}{2}, - \\frac{1}{20}]\\)."
