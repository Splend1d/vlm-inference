His temperature is 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F). Examination findings are consistent with a diagnosis of a common cold. The physician refers to a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial that evaluated the effectiveness of a new drug for the treatment of the common cold. The mean time for resolution of symptoms for patients receiving the new drug was 6.4 days, compared with a mean time of 6.7 days for patients receiving the placebo (p=0.04). Which of the following is the most appropriate interpretation of these study results?\n\nA. The findings are clinically and statistically significant\nB. The findings are clinically insignificant but statistically significant\nC. The findings are clinically significant but statistically insignificant\nD. The findings are neither clinically nor statistically significant\n"

The findings are clinically insignificant but statistically significant\n\nThe statistical significance (p=0.04) indicates that the observed difference in the mean time for resolution of symptoms between the group receiving the new drug (6.4 days) and the placebo group ( 6.7 days) is unlikely due to chance alone. However, the difference in means (only 0.3 days) is small and might not be considered clinically significant. This means that while the results are statistically significant, they may not have a meaningful impact in a real-world clinical setting."
