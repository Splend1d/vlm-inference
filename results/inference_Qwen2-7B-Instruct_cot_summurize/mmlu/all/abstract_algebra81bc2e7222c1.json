False, True.\n\nLet's analyze each statement:\n\n**Statement 1** claims that if a finite group \\(G\\) has order \\(n\\), then the group contains a subgroup of order \\(d\\) for every positive divisor \\(d\\) of \\(n\\). This statement is false. While it's true that by Sylow's Theorems or other group theory results, there exists a subgroup of prime power order for certain types of groups, it does not guarantee a subgroup of any arbitrary divisor order. For example, consider the cyclic group \\(Z_{15}\\) ( which has order 15. It contains subgroups of orders 3 and 5 (since \\(15 = 3 \\times 5\\)), but it does not contain a subgroup of order 4, as 4 does not divide 15.\n\n**Statement 2** states that if \\(a\\) belongs to a finite group \\(G\\), then the order of \\(a\\), denoted \\(|a|\\), divides the order of \\(G\\). This statement is true. This is a direct consequence of Lagrange's Theorem, which asserts that for any finite group \\(G\\) and any subgroup \\(H\\) of \\(G\\), the order of \\(H\\) divides the order of \\(G\\). When considering an element \\(a\\) of \\(G\\), the set of all powers of \\(a\\) forms a subgroup called the cyclic subgroup generated by \\(a\\). Thus, the order of \\(a\\) ( which is the smallest positive integer \\(k\\) such that \\(a^k = e\\) ( where \\(e\\) is the identity element of \\(G\\), corresponds to the order of this cyclic subgroup. Therefore, according to Lagrange's Theorem, the order of \\(a\\) must divide the order of \\(G\\).\n\nSo, while Statement 1 is false, Statement 2 is true, making the correct answer D. False, True."
