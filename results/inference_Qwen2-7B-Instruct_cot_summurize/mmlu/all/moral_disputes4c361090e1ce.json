The goodness or value of such entities is determined by how well they fulfill their functions. For example, the function of a table is to provide a surface for placing objects, and a table is considered good when it efficiently serves this purpose. Thus, the goodness of an object or action is directly related to its function, as per Aristotle's concept of teleology."
