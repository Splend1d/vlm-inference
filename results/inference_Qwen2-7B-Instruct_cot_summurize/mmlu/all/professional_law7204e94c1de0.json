The company's property was separated from the golf course by a fence on which the company had posted signs warning people not to enter the property because of the dangers of balloons landing. A golfer on the golf course hit an errant shot onto the company's property, ignored the warning signs, and jumped over the fence to retrieve her golf ball. At about the same time, one of the company's balloons experienced mechanical problems and had to make an emergency landing to avoid crashing. The balloon, which was out of control when it landed, struck the golfer and injured her. The jurisdiction has decided that hot-air ballooning is an abnormally dangerous activity. In an action by the golfer against the company, does the company have any affirmative defenses?\n\nA. No, because the balloon was out of control when it struck the golfer.\nB. No, because the company was engaged in an abnormally dangerous activity.\nC. Yes, because the balloon landed to avoid crashing.\nD. Yes, because the golfer assumed the risk by coming onto the company's property.\n"

Yes, because the golfer assumed the risk by coming onto the company's property.\n\nWhen engaging in activities that involve inherent risks, such as playing golf near properties where hot-air balloons operate, individuals generally assume the risk of those potential hazards. The company's posting of warning signs indicates that they made reasonable efforts to mitigate risks by alerting people to the dangers associated with their operations. By ignoring these warnings and entering the property despite the known risks, the golfer voluntarily exposed herself to harm.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that jurisdictions may have different laws regarding the liability of companies for abnormally dangerous activities. In some places, the doctrine of abnormally dangerous activities might limit the applicability of assumption of risk or other defenses if the company's actions were particularly egregious or posed a unique danger. Therefore, while assumption of risk is a common defense in cases like this, the specific legal outcome could depend on the local laws and how they interpret the balance between the risks involved and the precautions taken by the company."
