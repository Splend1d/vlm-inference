The original three-year term had long since expired, but the student had continued to pay his rent, and the widow continued to accept it.

Therefore, the student could argue that the terms of the original lease hold binding force, and the widow cannot evict him without providing proper notice as per the terms of the lease.\n\nThe other options are not necessarily correct based on the information provided:\n\nA. \"Void ab initio\" means that a contract was never valid from the beginning. In this scenario, since the student has been paying rent and the widow has been accepting it, it suggests that the original contract might have been valid, and any claim of invalidity would need substantial evidence beyond what is mentioned.\n\nB. \"Requisite notice\" refers to the required notice period for terminating a tenancy. However, this concept applies when either party wishes to terminate the tenancy. In this case, the student would only need to be given notice if the landlord decides to terminate the tenancy, which seems to be the widow's position, not the student's.\n\nC. \"Requisite notice for terminating a term of years\" refers to the specific notice period needed when a lease has a fixed term and is nearing its end. Since the lease term has already expired, the issue is not about giving notice to terminate a term of years, but rather about the continuation of the tenancy based on the original lease terms."
