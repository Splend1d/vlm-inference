Each count in an indictment is considered separately by the jury, and they can find a defendant guilty or not guilty on each count based on their evaluation of the evidence related to that specific charge. If the jury has followed the instructions of the judge and deliberated fairly, their decision stands. Therefore, the court would likely deny the motion to set aside the guilty verdict on the felony murder charge. \n\nThe defendant's proper remedy if they believe the trial was unfair or that legal errors were made during the proceedings would typically be to seek an appeal through the appropriate legal channels, rather than challenging the verdict on the basis of the inconsistency between the two counts."
