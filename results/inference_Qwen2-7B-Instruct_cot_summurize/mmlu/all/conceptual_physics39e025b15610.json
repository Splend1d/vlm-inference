Both of these\n\nWhen you brush your hair, especially if you're using a plastic or synthetic brush, electrons can be transferred from your hair to the brush due to friction. Since electrons are negatively charged, this transfer leaves your hair with a net positive charge (because protons, which carry a positive charge, remain mostly in place in the nucleus of atoms that make up your hair. At the same time, the brush gains a net negative charge because it now has an excess of electrons.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C, as both your hair and the brush end up with opposite charges after the process."
