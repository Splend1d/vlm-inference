Those who are willing or forced to leave a state often have substantial interests in living in another state: This suggests that emigrants typically have reasons for moving, which could include better economic opportunities, safety, family reunification, or other factors.\n\nB. Preventing potential immigrants from settling in a different state can be detrimental to their well-being: This highlights the negative consequences of restricting migration on individuals who may be seeking better living conditions or opportunities elsewhere.\n\nC. Closing borders can have significant costs to potential immigrants: This points out that limiting immigration has direct impacts on those who would otherwise benefit from entering a new country, including economic disadvantages, separation from families, and loss of potential for personal development.\n\nTherefore, Fine's conclusion likely supports the idea that emigration and the policies surrounding it have substantial implications for both the individuals involved and the broader social, economic, and political contexts."
