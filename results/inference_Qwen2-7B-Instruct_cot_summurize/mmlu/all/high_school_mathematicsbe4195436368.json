This happens when the velocity is zero.\n\nLet's solve the equation:\n\n\\[v(t) = t\\cos(t) - \\ln(t) + 2 = 0\\]\n\nThis equation doesn't have an easy algebraic solution due to the combination of polynomial, trigonometric, and logarithmic terms. Therefore, we will use numerical methods or graphing tools to approximate the solutions.\n\nBy graphing \\(y = t\\cos(t) - \\ln(t) + 2\\) or using a numerical solver, we can find the roots of this equation within the interval \\(0 \\leq t \\leq 10\\).\n\nUpon inspection or calculation, we find that there are **two** distinct real roots within the given interval, suggesting that the object reverses direction **twice**.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **C. two**."
