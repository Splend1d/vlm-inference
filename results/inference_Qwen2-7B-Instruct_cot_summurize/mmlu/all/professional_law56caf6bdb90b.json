In his defense, the defendant has testified that he had no intention of keeping the car but got caught up in marital problems and simply delayed returning it. The defendant calls a witness to testify that the defendant told him, during the two days, \"I'm going to return this car as soon as I work things out with my wife.\" Is the witness's testimony admissible?\n\nA. No, because it is a self-serving statement by an accused.\nB. No, because it is hearsay not within any exception.\nC. Yes, as a prior consistent statement of the defendant.\nD. Yes, as a statement by the defendant of his then-existing state of mind.\n"

Yes, as a statement by the defendant of his then-existing state of mind.\n\nIn legal terms, the witness's testimony qualifies as a statement made by the defendant regarding his thoughts or intentions at the time of the alleged event (i.e., his state of mind. Such statements are often admitted under exceptions to the hearsay rule, specifically when they are offered to show the declarant's state of mind, which is relevant to proving an element of the case. \n\nOption A is incorrect because a self-serving statement is generally not an absolute bar to admissibility. Its admissibility would depend on whether it falls under an exception to the hearsay rule, such as the one described above.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the testimony does fall within an exception to the hearsay rule \u2013 it is a statement of the defendant's then-existing state of mind, which is relevant to understanding the context of the events.\n\nOption C is incorrect because prior consistent statements are typically admitted to rebut an implication that the declarant is now fabricating their story. Here, there is no implication that the defendant is fabricating; rather, the statement supports his claim that he intended to return the car.\n\nTherefore, the appropriate choice is D, as the statement is being relevant to the defendant's state of mind and therefore admissible under the proper exception to the hearsay rule."
