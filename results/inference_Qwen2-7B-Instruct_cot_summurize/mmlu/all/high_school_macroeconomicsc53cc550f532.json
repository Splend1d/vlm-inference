                    "text": "If the aggregate supply (AS) curve shifts to the left, it means that at any given price level, firms are willing to supply less output. This typically happens due to factors such as an increase in input costs, decrease in productivity, or other constraints that make production more expensive or less efficient.\n\nIn the context of a Classical aggregate supply curve, which is typically vertical, this curve represents the idea that changes in demand will only affect the price level, not the quantity of output produced in the short run because all resources are already fully employed.\n\nHowever, for the sake of understanding how a shift in the aggregate supply curve affects both price level and quantity of output, let's consider a scenario where we're looking at the aggregate supply-demand model, which is more common in macroeconomic analysis:\n\nA. The equilibrium price level increases while the equilibrium quantity of output decreases.\n\nThis statement accurately describes what happens when the aggregate supply curve shifts to the left. As firms are willing to supply less output at every price level, the quantity of output supplied decreases. To sell the same amount of output, the price level must rise to attract more sellers into the market. Therefore, the equilibrium price level increases while the equilibrium quantity of output decreases. \n\nSo, the correct answer is A."
