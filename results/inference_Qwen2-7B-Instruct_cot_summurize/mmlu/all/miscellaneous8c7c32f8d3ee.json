Over the course of a 24-hour period, this amounts to approximately 14,400 to 20,160 liters. However, the given options suggest a significantly lower rate of breathing than what is typical for resting adults. Thus, option B falls within a more reasonable range considering typical breathing rates and daily activities that increase respiratory needs."
