                    "text": "To address this question accurately, let's break down each statement:\n\n**A. The probability of committing a Type I error is 0.1.**\n- A Type I error occurs when we incorrectly reject a true null hypothesis (H0). The probability of committing a Type I error is denoted by \u03b1, which is also known as the significance level of the test. This information isn't directly provided in the problem statement, so we cannot conclude that the probability of committing a Type I error is 0.1 based solely on the given data.\n\n**B. If Ha is true, the probability of failing to reject H0 is 0.2.**\n- This statement refers to the probability of a Type II error, denoted by \u03b2. The power of the test, which is given as 0.8, is defined as \\(1 - \\beta\\), meaning the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when it is false ( (H0 is false and Ha is true). Therefore, if the power of the test for Ha: p = 0.7 is 0.8, then \\(1 - 0.8 = 0.2\\) represents the probability of failing to reject H0 when it is actually false ( (committing a Type II error). So, this statement is correct.\n\n**C. The probability of committing a Type II error is 0.3.**\n- Given that the power of the test for Ha: p = 0.7 is 0.8, we can deduce that the probability of committing a Type II error (\u03b2) is \\(1 - 0.8 = 0.2\\). Thus, this statement is incorrect as it claims the probability of committing a Type II error is 0.3, which contradicts our calculation.\n\n**D. All of the above are valid conclusions.**\n- Based on the analysis above, only statement B is correct, while statements A and C are incorrect. Statement D is therefore not valid as it includes an incorrect conclusion (statement C).\n\nThe correct answer is **B**."
