Most of the DNA in your liver cells will be transcribed in the nucleus and translated in the cytoplasm.\n\nLiver cells, like all human cells, contain the complete set of DNA (the human genome. This DNA is transcribed into RNA within the nucleus. The resulting mRNA then moves to the cytoplasm where it is translated into proteins. However, not all genes in the DNA are active or expressed in every cell type. Liver cells express genes that are important for their function, such as those involved in metabolism, detoxification, and storage of glycogen.\n\nA. This statement is incorrect because while humans have 46 chromosomes (23 pairs, each cell type has a specific subset of genes turned on or \"expressed\" based on its function. Therefore, liver cells do not necessarily contain exactly the same DNA as white blood cells.\n\nB. This statement is incorrect because most of the DNA in liver cells would indeed be transcribed into RNA, which can then be translated into proteins, rather than being \"transcribed but not translated.\"\n\nD. This statement is also incorrect because while liver cells might have more genes related to glycogen storage compared to other cell types due to the liver's role in carbohydrate metabolism, all human cells contain the full complement of DNA with the potential to express any gene. The difference lies in which genes are actually expressed in each cell type."
