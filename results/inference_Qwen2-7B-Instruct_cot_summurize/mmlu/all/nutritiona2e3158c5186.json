No, technological and institutional innovations have permitted food supplies to more than keep pace with population growth.\nB. Yes, it is only because of widespread famines that population has not overwhelmed food supplies altogether.\nC. No, but it is only because of the introduction of genetically modified food that supplies have kept pace with population growth.\nD. No, but supplies are not likely to keep pace with population growth over the next 10 years.\n"

Malthus's theory suggested that population growth would eventually outstrip the ability of food production to increase, leading to famine and other societal issues. However, this view has been challenged by historical data and modern understanding. Technological advancements in agriculture, such as improved farming techniques, crop breeding, and the Green Revolution, have allowed for significant increases in food production that have kept pace with (and even exceeded population growth rates in many parts of the world. This has led to improvements in global nutrition and reductions in hunger."
