However, the combination step includes duplicates between both lists before sorting, which means removing duplicates might not remove all duplicates since it only looks for duplicates within the same list. Also, combining lists first can lead to duplicates being added to the final list.\n\n- **Option B:** This first sorts each list individually before combining them. While this ensures that the final list after combining will be sorted, it does not address the removal of duplicates across both lists effectively. The duplicates in the combined list are not removed until after sorting, potentially leaving duplicates in the final list.\n\n- **Option C:** This approach first removes duplicates from each list individually (`listl` and `list2`) before combining them. It then sorts the combined list. This method ensures that there are no duplicates within each list before they are combined, and the final combined list is sorted. This is the correct approach as it meets the requirements of creating a list that contains the names of all books found in either list, in alphabetical order, with duplicate entries removed.\n\n- **Option D:** This option first removes duplicates from each list and then sorts each list individually before combining them. Although it removes duplicates within each list before combining, it still combines the lists first, which could result in duplicate entries if the same book exists in both lists. After combining, the sorting occurs, but there's no explicit step to remove duplicates from the combined list, which may not fully achieve the goal of removing duplicates across both lists.\n\nTherefore, **Option C** is the correct choice to create `newList` as described."
