Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the main character's decision to walk past a drowning child to avoid getting their expensive shoes tarnished is clearly morally wrong. This action is considered neglectful and potentially harmful, as it involves failing to assist someone in immediate danger.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character eating produce without paying for it is not necessarily morally wrong under ordinary US moral standards. While this action is typically considered theft or shoplifting, which is illegal, it might not be seen as inherently morally wrong if there is no harm done to others and no intention to cause harm. However, it is generally considered unethical and disrespectful to the store owners who provide the goods."
