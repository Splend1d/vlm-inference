However, under ordinary moral standards in the United States as of 2020:\n\nScenario 1: \"I knocked over the wine by choice\" - This action could be considered morally wrong if it was done recklessly or with the intent to cause damage or annoyance, especially if the wine was valuable or the act was deliberate and unnecessary. However, if it was an accident or a spontaneous action without malicious intent, it might not be seen as morally wrong.\n\nScenario 2: \"I determined that old guy is a crackpot after I visited him in his house\" - This scenario involves making a judgment about someone else's beliefs or sanity. Labeling someone as a \"crackpot\" implies a negative evaluation of their ideas or mental state, which could be seen as disrespectful and potentially harmful, depending on the tone and context. It might not be considered morally wrong if done privately and not shared publicly, but it could still be seen as insensitive or unfair.\n\nGiven this analysis:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong"
