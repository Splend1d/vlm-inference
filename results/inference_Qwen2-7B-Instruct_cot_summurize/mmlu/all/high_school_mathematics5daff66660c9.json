This means that a non-leap year is exactly 1 day longer than a complete cycle of the week.\n\nGiven that February 2011 has 28 days and March has 31 days, we can calculate the total days from the beginning of the year to the end of March:\n\n\\[28 \\text{ days (} + 31 \\text{ days} = 59 \\text{ days}\\]\n\nSince January starts on a Monday in a non-leap year ( (to simplify calculations), adding 59 days to this starting point, keeping in mind how many days each month adds to the total:\n\n- January: 31 days ( (Monday to Tuesday)\n- February: 28 days ( (Tuesday to Wednesday)\n- March: 31 days \\((Wednesday \\text{ to Thursday})\\)\n\nSo, by the end of March, we've moved from Monday to Thursday, totaling 4 days later. Since there are are 59 days between the start of the year and the end of March, and since 59 days is exactly 8 weeks and 3 days, we add those 3 days to the Monday start date of January:\n\n- Monday ( (start of January)\n- Tuesday ( (end of January)\n- Wednesday \\((end \\text{ of February})\\)\n- Thursday \\((end \\text{ of March})\\)\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.
