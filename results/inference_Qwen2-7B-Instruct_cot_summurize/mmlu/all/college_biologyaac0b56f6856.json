Stomatal guard cell\n\nStomatal guard cells undergo a type of programmed cell death called autophagy, which is essential for their function in controlling the opening and closing of stomata to regulate gas exchange and water loss in plants. This process allows the guard cells to maintain their shape and function, facilitating the necessary physiological processes in the plant."
