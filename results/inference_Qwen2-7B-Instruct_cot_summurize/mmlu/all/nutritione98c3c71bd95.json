No account is taken of waste or losses of food: Food balance sheets typically provide an overview of the supply and demand of food at a national level, but they do not account for food waste or losses that occur during production, storage, transportation, or preparation.\n\nB. Consumption estimates give higher values than those derived from other types of surveys: Food balance sheets estimate total food consumption based on production and trade data. These estimates may be higher than those obtained from household surveys or other direct measurement methods because they include not only what is consumed by households but also what is used in industries, animal feed, and other non-consumptive uses.\n\nC. No information is available on the distribution of consumption within a country: Food balance sheets provide aggregate data on total food production, imports, exports, and consumption. They do not offer detailed information on how this food is distributed among different population segments, such as urban versus rural areas, or between different socioeconomic groups within a country. This can make it difficult to assess food security and nutritional status at a more granular level."
