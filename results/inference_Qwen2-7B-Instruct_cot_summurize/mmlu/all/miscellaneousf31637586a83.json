Therefore, teaching them the correct toothbrushing technique is developmentally appropriate for this age group.\n\nA. The growth of permanent teeth usually begins around the age of 6 years old, so this topic might be more suitable for slightly older children.\nB. While it's important for toddlers to learn proper eating habits, teaching them about the specific use of incisors might not be as critical as teaching them general concepts like chewing and swallowing.\nD. Understanding the evolution of the human tooth is an advanced concept that would likely not be comprehensible to toddlers. This topic would be more appropriate for older children or adults."
