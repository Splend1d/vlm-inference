Since there is no lis pendens rule in international law and all depends on the consent of the parties to a dispute, there is no priority or hierarchy among international courts and tribunals.\n\nInternational law does not establish a clear hierarchy among international courts and tribunals. Each court's jurisdiction is based on its creation treaty or the consent of the parties involved in the dispute. This means that if two international courts claim jurisdiction over the same case, the matter may need to be resolved through diplomatic channels or according to the rules established by the specific treaties or conventions under which the courts operate. The principle of \"consent of the parties\" is fundamental in international law, meaning that courts can only hear cases with the voluntary agreement of the states involved."
