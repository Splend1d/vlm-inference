This process is used in food preservation, particularly for things like drying fruits, meats, and spices, because it can kill bacteria, viruses, and insects that might cause spoilage or disease. However, it's important to note that the food itself does not become radioactive in the sense that it would pose a long-term health risk like a naturally radioactive substance would. The radioactivity diminishes quickly, making the food safe to eat."
