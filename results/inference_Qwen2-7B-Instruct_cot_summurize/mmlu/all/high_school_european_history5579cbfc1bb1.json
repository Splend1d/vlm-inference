Lenin.\nThe independence of our country cannot be upheld unless we have an adequate industrial basis for defense. And such an industrial basis cannot be created if our industry is not more highly developed technically. That is why a fast rate of development of our industry is necessary and imperative. We cannot go on indefinitely, that is, for too long a period, basing the Soviet regime and socialist construction on two different foundations, the foundation of the most large-scale and united socialist industry and the foundation of the most scattered and backward, small commodity economy of the peasants. We must gradually, but systematically and persistently, place our agriculture on a new technical basis, the basis of large-scale production, and bring it up to the level of socialist industry. Either we accomplish this task\u2014in which case the final victory of socialism in our country will be assured, or we turn away from it and do not accomplish it\u2014in which case a return to capitalism may become inevitable.\n\u2014Vladimir I. Lenin Industrialization of the Country and the Right Deviation in the C.P.S.U., November 19,1928\nWhat was the result of Stalin's attempt to fix this problem?\n\nA. The Soviet Union saw steady growth in both industry and agriculture.\nB. The Soviet Union saw steady growth in industry and a decline in agriculture.\nC. The Soviet Union saw steady growth in agriculture but industrial production fell behind.\nD. The Soviet Union saw steady decline in both industry and agriculture.\n"

The Soviet Union saw steady growth in industry and a decline in agriculture.\n\nStalin's policies, known as \"industrialization\" and \"collectivization,\" aimed to rapidly modernize the Soviet economy and transform it into one based on large-scale industry. This was achieved through forced industrialization, which led to significant increases in industrial production. However, this came at the cost of agricultural collectivization, which involved the consolidation of small farms into collective farms. This process often involved coercion and resulted in widespread famine, particularly in Ukraine, which is known as the Holodomor. Thus, while industrial output increased, agricultural production suffered, leading to food shortages and economic strain."
