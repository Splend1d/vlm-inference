This is the midpoint of the cycle, assuming the first day of menstruation is considered day 1. It's important to note that the length of a menstrual cycle can vary from woman to woman and from month to month, so this is an average estimate. Some cycles might be shorter or longer than 28 days, affecting when exactly ovulation occurs within each cycle."
