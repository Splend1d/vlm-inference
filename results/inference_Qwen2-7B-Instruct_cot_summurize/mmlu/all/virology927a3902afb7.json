According to the study results, alcohol consumption is strongly associated with lung cancer (OR = 2.5). The researchers then divide the study subjects into two groups: smokers and non-smokers. Subsequent statistical analysis does not reveal any association between alcohol consumption and lung cancer within either group. The scenario described is an example of which of the following?\n\nA.

However, when the subjects are divided into smokers and non-smokers, there is no longer an association between alcohol consumption and lung cancer within each group. This suggests that smoking was a confounding variable - it influenced the relationship between alcohol consumption and lung cancer, masking the true association. Confounding occurs when a third variable (in this case, smoking) affects both the exposure (alcohol consumption) and the outcome (lung cancer), leading to misleading associations."
