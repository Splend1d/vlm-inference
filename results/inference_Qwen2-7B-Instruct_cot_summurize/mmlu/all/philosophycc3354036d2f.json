In this view, since there is no pre-existing meaning or purpose in the universe ( as suggested by the absence of a god, individuals are free to create their own meaning through their actions. This also implies that there are no inherent moral values, so what is considered right or wrong becomes subjective and can vary based on personal choice and circumstances."
