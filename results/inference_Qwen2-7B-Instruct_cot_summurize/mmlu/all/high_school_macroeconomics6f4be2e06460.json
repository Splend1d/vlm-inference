At the same time, if the price level falls (i.e., there's deflation, it could be because technological advancements have reduced costs of production, making goods cheaper. However, it's important to note that the other options can also lead to a combination of rising real GDP and falling prices:\n\nC. An increase in government spending can stimulate economic growth (thus increasing real GDP. If this spending is financed through measures that do not significantly increase the money supply or lead to inefficiencies, it might not necessarily cause inflation, allowing for the possibility of falling prices. \n\nD. A decrease in government spending can reduce demand in the economy, potentially leading to lower prices (deflation. If this reduction in spending is part of a broader effort to improve efficiency or productivity, it might also lead to higher real GDP as the economy adjusts.\n\nA. Stagflation refers to a situation where there is both high inflation and high unemployment, typically without any clear trend in either direction. Falling prices and rising real GDP would not typically be associated with stagflation, as stagflation usually involves rising prices.\n\nTherefore, while all these options can contribute to rising real GDP, only B. an advance in technology directly implies falling prices in the context described."
