One afternoon, the lift suddenly broke down because of a power failure in the area. A customer was suspended in his lift chair, one-third of the way up the hill and 50 feet above the ground. The customer remained on the lift for five hours until power was restored. He was then returned uninjured to the bottom of the hill.

Negligence typically involves a duty of care owed by one party to another, a breach of that duty, and resulting damages. Here, the ski resort had a duty to ensure the safety and proper functioning of the lift system to prevent harm to its patrons. The breakdown of the lift and the subsequent injuries (in this case, the fear or anxiety experienced due to the situation\u2014can be seen as a breach of that duty, leading to potential damages (the customer's time spent stranded and any emotional distress experienced.
