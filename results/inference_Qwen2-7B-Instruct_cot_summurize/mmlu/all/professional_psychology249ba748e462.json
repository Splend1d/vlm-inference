Given the scenario where you received a request from the Ethics Committee regarding a former client, the most appropriate action would likely be option C: cooperate with the Committee's request by sending the information you believe to be relevant to the case after confirming that the client has signed a release.\n\nHere's why:\n\n1. **Confidentiality**: As a therapist, you have an ethical duty to protect the confidentiality of your clients' records. However, there are exceptions to this rule when it comes to legal requests or to prevent harm to others or oneself.\n\n2. **Client Consent**: Before releasing any information, especially sensitive records, it is crucial to obtain the client's consent. This ensures that the client is aware of the information being shared, the purpose of sharing it, and who will receive it. This step respects the client's autonomy and rights under privacy laws.\n\n3. **Ethical Obligations**: Depending on the jurisdiction, therapists may have specific ethical guidelines they must follow regarding the retention and disposal of client records. It's important to adhere to these guidelines as well as any legal requirements.\n\n4. **Supporting Professional Standards**: By cooperating with the Ethics Committee, you are contributing to maintaining high standards within the profession. This helps ensure that the therapy community operates ethically and effectively.\n\nTherefore, after obtaining the client's signed release, you can provide the relevant information requested by the Ethics Committee. This approach balances the need for confidentiality with the obligation to support regulatory oversight and the pursuit of justice in cases involving complaints against therapists."
