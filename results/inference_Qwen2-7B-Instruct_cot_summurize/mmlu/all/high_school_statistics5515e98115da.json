Each of the options you've provided can help reduce bias under certain circumstances:\n\nA. **Following up with those who did not respond to the survey the first time** - This can help ensure that all segments of the population are represented, reducing selection bias.\n\nB. **Asking questions in a neutral manner to avoid influencing the responses** - This helps maintain question neutrality, which can reduce response bias by ensuring that the respondent's answers are not skewed by the way the question is phrased.\n\nC. **Using stratified random sampling rather than simple random sampling** - Stratified random sampling involves dividing the population into distinct subgroups (strata and then randomly selecting samples from each stratum. This can reduce bias by ensuring that specific subgroups are adequately represented in the sample.\n\nD. **Selecting samples randomly** - Random selection inherently reduces bias by giving every member of the population an equal chance of being included in the sample, which is crucial for ensuring representativeness.\n\nHowever, the option that is **least likely to reduce bias** in a sample survey would be one that does not address any of these issues effectively or introduces additional sources of bias. None of the options listed directly increases bias, but if we must choose one that might be considered less effective at reducing bias compared to the others, it could be argued that:\n\n**C. Using stratified random sampling rather than simple random sampling** might be considered less effective because it requires prior knowledge about the population structure. If the strata are not defined appropriately or do not reflect meaningful differences within the population, this method could potentially introduce bias rather than reduce it. However, this is a nuanced argument, as proper use of stratified random sampling is designed to enhance the precision and representativeness of the sample. \n\nIn general, all of these methods are intended to minimize bias, and their effectiveness depends on how they are implemented. For most practical purposes, the choice that most directly reduces bias would be one that ensures high levels of participation, neutrality in question formulation, appropriate representation across the population ( through either simple or stratified random sampling, and unbiased selection methods."
