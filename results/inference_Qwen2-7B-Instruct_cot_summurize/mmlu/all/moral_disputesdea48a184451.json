They are value-based: Consequentialism focuses on the outcomes or consequences of actions, evaluating them based on values such as happiness, pleasure, utility, or well-being. The morality of an action is determined by its contribution to overall good.\n\nB. The idea of alternative actions open to the agent: Consequentialists consider what actions are available to the agent and which of those actions will lead to the best possible outcome. This involves comparing different options and their potential results.\n\nC. Strongly impartialist moral theory: Consequentialism often assumes that one should consider the welfare of all affected parties equally ( without privileginging certain individuals over others, unless there is a compelling reason to do so. This implies that the moral worth of an action is determined by its impact on everyone involved, not just on the person performing the action or the people directly involved in it."
