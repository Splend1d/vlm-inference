It has announced that the South shall be excluded from the common territory, that the judicial tribunal shall be made sectional, and that a war must be waged against slavery until it shall cease throughout the United States. The guarantees of the Constitution will then no longer exist; the equal rights of the states will be lost. The slaveholding states will no longer have the power of self-government or self-protection, and the federal government will have become their enemy.\n\"We, therefore, the people of South Carolina, by our delegates in convention assembled, have solemnly declared that the Union heretofore existing between this state and the other states of North America is dissolved; and that the state of South Carolina has resumed her position among the nations of the world, as [a] separate and independent state, with full power to levy war, conclude peace, contract alliances, establish commerce, and to do all other acts and things which independent states may of right do.\"\nSouth Carolina defines the causes of secession, 1860\nIn the excerpt above, the reference to \"the sanctions of a more erroneous religious belief\" most probably refers to\n\nA. Southern Baptist justification of slavery on the grounds of white racial superiority\nB. the Puritan abolition of slavery in New England states\nC. Jewish acceptance of slavery in the Torah\nD. Christian abolitionist rejection of slavery on moral grounds\n"

Southern Baptist justification of slavery on the grounds of white racial superiority\n\nThis choice aligns with the historical context of the time when many Southern Christians, particularly those within the Baptist denomination, defended slavery based on biblical interpretations that emphasized the institution's compatibility with their understanding of God's will. They often cited passages that they believed supported the idea of racial hierarchy, which justified the enslavement of African Americans under the belief that they were destined for subservience. This theological defense played a significant role in maintaining the institution of slavery in the South until its eventual abolition."
