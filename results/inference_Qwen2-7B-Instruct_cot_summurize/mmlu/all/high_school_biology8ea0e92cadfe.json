As these individuals reproduced, their traits were passed on to the next generation. Since the distribution of weights was already shifted towards heavier individuals, the offspring would also likely have a higher mean weight compared to the original population, due to genetic inheritance of the traits associated with greater body mass. This is an example of natural selection favoring certain traits over others in response to environmental pressures."
