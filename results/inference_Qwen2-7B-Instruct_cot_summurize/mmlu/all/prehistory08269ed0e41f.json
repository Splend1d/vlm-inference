This adaptability allowed them to migrate out of Africa and populate the entire world, adapting to diverse climates, landscapes, and resources. Their ability to innovate, learn, and modify their environment has been crucial for survival and success.\n\nWhile options A, B, and C also played roles in human evolution and culture, they do not capture the overarching importance of adaptability as a key factor for human survival and success. Controlling fire provided warmth, food preparation, and protection from predators, producing art reflects cultural development, and hunting large mammals was an important part of the diet and lifestyle in certain periods and environments. However, these abilities alone do not explain the success of Homo sapiens in comparison to other hominids."
