This mechanism allows for dosage compensation between males (XY) and females, ensuring that the X-linked genes are expressed at levels comparable to those in males ( who have only one X chromosome (XY).\n\nThe inactivation process typically occurs randomly during early embryonic development and involves the inactivation of one of the two X chromosomes in each cell. This means that in any given cell of a female mammal, one copy of each gene on the X chromosome will be active, while the other copy is silenced. The inactive X chromosome becomes condensed and transcriptionally silent, often referred to as being \"turned off\".\n\nIt's important to note that this process does not make the X chromosome itself genetically inactive; rather, it leads to the inactivation of one of the two copies of each gene on the X chromosome. This ensures that females do not express twice the amount of X-linked genes compared to males."
