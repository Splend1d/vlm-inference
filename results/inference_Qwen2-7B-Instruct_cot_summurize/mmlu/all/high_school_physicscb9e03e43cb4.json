                    "text": "For an isothermal expansion of a confined ideal gas, the temperature remains constant. According to the first law of thermodynamics, for an isothermal process ( (\\(\\Delta U = 0\\)), the change in internal energy (\\(\\Delta U\\)) is zero since no work is done by or on the system under adiabatic conditions ((\\(\\Delta Q = 0\\)). However, since work is being done by the system ( (\\(W = -150\\) J), we can infer that heat must be transferred out of the system to maintain thermal equilibrium and satisfy the first law of thermodynamics.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. 150 J of heat was removed from the gas."
