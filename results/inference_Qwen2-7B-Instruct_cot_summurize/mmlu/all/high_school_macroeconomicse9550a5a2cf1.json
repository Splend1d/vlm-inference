The theory suggests that controlling the growth rate of the money supply can effectively manage economic fluctuations.\n\nThe correct answer is C: because interest rates change and so do many other factors that affect spending. When the money supply increases, it typically leads to lower interest rates due to an abundance of funds in the market. Lower interest rates encourage borrowing and investment, which can stimulate spending and boost economic activity. Conversely, if the money supply decreases, interest rates tend to rise, leading to reduced borrowing and spending. This change in spending patterns can affect various sectors of the economy, including consumption, investment, and employment.\n\nThus, while changes in the money supply do affect interest rates, they also have broader implications for the economy through their influence on interest rates and subsequent changes in consumer and business spending behaviors."
