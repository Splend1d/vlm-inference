They can purchase goods from manufacturers directly, from distributors, or sometimes even from wholesalers. \n\nA. Distributors generally work as intermediaries between manufacturers and retailers or other businesses that need the product. They stock large quantities of products and supply them to various retailers or other businesses as needed.\n\nB. Franchising is a business model where an individual or group (the franchisee) pays a fee to a larger company (the franchisor) for the right to operate their business under the franchisor's brand name, using their established methods and systems. While franchises involve purchasing and selling products, they are not direct sellers to consumers but rather operate retail outlets based on the franchisor's brand.\n\nC. A merchant is a general term for someone who buys and sells goods. In the context of your question, it could potentially refer to any of the options listed above, depending on the specifics of the business operation. For example, a merchant might be a retailer, distributor, or even a wholesaler. However, without more context, it's difficult to pinpoint a specific meaning.\n\nSo, among the options given, \"Retailers\" ( is the one that best fits the description of entities that sell directly to end consumers and may purchase directly from manufacturers and/or deal with wholesalers."
