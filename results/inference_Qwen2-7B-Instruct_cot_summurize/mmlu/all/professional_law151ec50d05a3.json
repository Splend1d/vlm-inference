The sisterlater mortgaged her interest in the land. The brother then died testate, leaving his entire estate to a cousin. Thesister later paid off her mortgage debt, and the mortgage was released. At the present time, who owns the land?\n\nA. The answer depends on whether the jurisdiction follows the lien theory or the title theory ofmortgages.\nB. Title is entirely in the sister as the surviving joint tenant.\nC. Title is in the sister and the cousin as equal tenants in common.\nD. Title is in the sister and the cousin as tenants in common, with the sister having a 20% interest and thecousin having an 80% interest.\n"

Title is entirely in the sister as the surviving joint tenant.\n\nIn a common law joint tenancy, when one of the joint tenants dies, their interest in the property automatically passes to the surviving joint tenants without going through probate. In this case, since the brother died testate ( meaning he left his entire estate to a cousin, but did not own any interest in the jointly held property, the property remains solely in the name of the sister as the surviving joint tenant.\n\nOptions A, C, and D involve complications not present in this scenario:\n\n- Option A refers to differences between lien theory and title theory regarding how mortgages affect the ownership of property. However, since the question does not specify which theory applies, and because the death of the brother does not involve a change in ownership due to inheritance, this distinction does not impact the answer here.\n  \n- Option C suggests that the title would be split between the sister and the cousin. This would only happen if the brother had owned an interest in the property, which he did not since it was held in joint tenancy with the sister.\n  \n- Option D incorrectly divides the title into percentages based on the initial investments. While the sister's payment for the property affects her equity interest, it does not change the fact that she remains the sole owner upon the brother's death, given the nature of joint tenancy with right of survivorship."
