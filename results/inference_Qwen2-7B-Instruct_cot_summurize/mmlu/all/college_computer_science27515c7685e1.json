This is the number of defective chips from Company Y divided by the total number of defective chips.\n\nSo, the probability is:\n\\[P(\\text{Y|Defective}) = \\frac{\\text{Number of defective chips from Y}}{\\text{Total number of defective chips}} = \\frac{2}{3}\\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. 2 / 3."
