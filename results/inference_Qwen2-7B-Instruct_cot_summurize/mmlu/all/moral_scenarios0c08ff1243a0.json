On the contrary, it can be seen as a kind and hospitable act.\n\nFrequently encouraging the police force to counteract criminals, however, could be viewed as morally wrong depending on the context. While supporting law enforcement's efforts to maintain public safety is generally acceptable, encouraging excessive or unjustified actions by the police could lead to violations of human rights, such as unlawful arrests or use of excessive force. It's important to respect due process and legal procedures when advocating for any action, especially by authorities."
