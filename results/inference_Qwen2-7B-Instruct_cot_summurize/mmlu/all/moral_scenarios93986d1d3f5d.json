However, this act might not necessarily be considered morally wrong under ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, unless the behavior is habitual or shows disregard for the needs and comfort of others.\n\nScenario 2 involves taking pictures of women walking on a runway, which could potentially be considered invading someone's privacy if the individuals were unaware or uncomfortable with being photographed. This action might be viewed as morally wrong if it violates consent or dignity, particularly if the women felt their personal boundaries were crossed without their permission.\n\nGiven this analysis:\n\nA.
