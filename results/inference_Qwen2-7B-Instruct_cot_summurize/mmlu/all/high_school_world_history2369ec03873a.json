It does not explicitly detail specific reforms that Peter the Great embraced, but it does indicate that he was influenced by the ideas of civil and political rights of individual men, which were prominent in Protestant Europe during his time.\n\nGiven this context, the closest option that aligns with the spirit of the passage is:\n\nB. Declarations of human rights - This suggests that Peter the Great was inspired by the concept of individual rights and liberties that were being developed in European constitutions and bills of rights. However, it's important to note that the passage doesn't specify if he directly implemented or endorsed such declarations in Russia.\n\nIt's worth mentioning that none of the options A ( Creation of an elected assembly, C Development of a constitutional monarchy, and D Reduction of aristocratic influence are explicitly mentioned or implied in the passage. The passage focuses more on Peter's ambition to lead the transformation of Russia rather than the specifics of the reforms he planned to implement."
