Since there are 5 dice and 5 rolls, the number of ways to achieve this is \\(5\\) choose \\(1\\) (\\(5C1\\)) for choosing which die shows a prime number, times \\(2^4\\) for the combinations of showing 1s on the other four dice, resulting in \\(5 \\times 16 = 80\\) ways.\n\nGiven that each die has 6 faces, there are a total of \\(6^5 = 7776\\) possible outcomes when rolling 5 six-sided dice.\n\nThus, the number of outcomes where the product is not composite (either 1 or a prime number) is \\(1 + 80 = 81\\).\n\nTherefore, the probability that the product is not composite is \\(\\frac{81}{7776}\\).\n\nSop the probability that the product is composite is the complement of this event:\n\n\\[P(\\text{composite}) = 1 - P(\\text{not composite}) = 1 - \\frac{81}{7776} = \\frac{7776 - 81}{7776} = \\frac{7695}{7776}\\]\n\nHowever, this fraction simplifies to \\(\\frac{485}{486}\\), as \\(7695 = 485 \\times 16\\) and \\(7776 = 486 \\times 16\\).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **A. \\(\\frac{485}{486}\\)**."
