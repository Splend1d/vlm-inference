Wrong, Not wrong\n\nKilling spiders for someone out of kindness might be seen as going too far, especially if it's not necessary or harmful to other beings or the environment. This action could be considered morally wrong because it potentially infringes on the rights and existence of living creatures without a justifiable reason.\n\nOn the other hand, buying cigarettes for one's husband is generally considered a personal choice that others might judge based on their views on smoking and its health impacts. While it could be seen as enabling a potentially harmful habit, it's not universally regarded as morally wrong in the context of personal freedom and choice. However, it might be viewed negatively by those who strongly oppose smoking due to its health risks."
