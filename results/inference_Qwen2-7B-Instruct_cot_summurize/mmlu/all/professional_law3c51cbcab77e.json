The bond agreement provided that for the first five years the stadium was in operation, at least $2 from each admission charge would be used to repay the bond debt. The bond agreement further stipulated that if the proceeds from the admission charges during the first five years were not sufficient to repay the bondholders, then at least $1 from each admission charge for the next five years would be applied to make the necessary bond payments. Assume that three years after the stadium had been in operation, a subsequent session of the state legislature passed a bill entirely prohibiting baseball because four players were killed in playing mishaps. This statute is probably\n\nA. constitutional, because it is a justifiable exercise of the state's police power.\nB. constitutional, because of the clear and present danger of baseball playing in the state.\nC. unconstitutional, because it impairs the obligation of the bondholders'contract.\nD. unconstitutional, because it violates the due process rights of the baseball team owners.\n"

The bond agreement established terms for the repayment of the bond debt, which included using a portion of the admission charges to repay the bondholders. When the state legislature passed a bill that prohibited baseball, it directly impacted the ability to generate revenue through admission charges as stipulated in the bond agreement. This action could be seen as impairing the obligation of the bondholders' contract because it reduces the resources available for debt repayment, thereby changing the terms of the original agreement without their consent.\n\nWhile the other options may have some merit in different contexts ( such as the police power argument being relevant in cases where the state's actions are aimed at public welfare or safety, and due process rights being applicable when individual rights are directly affected by governmental actions), option C directly addresses the issue of contract impairment, which seems to be the most pertinent concern here based on the information provided."
