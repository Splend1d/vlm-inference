                    "text": "Given \\(3x + 7y\\) is divisible by 11, we have:\n\n\\[3x + 7y = 11k\\]\n\nwhere \\(k\\) is some integer.\n\nWe need to check which of the given options must also be divisible by 11 for all positive integers \\(x\\) and \\(y\\).\n\n**Option A:** \\(4x + 6y\\)\n\nTo see if this is divisible by 11, let's manipulate the original equation. We can try to express \\(4x + 6y\\) in terms of \\(3x + 7y\\). However, it's not straightforward to directly relate \\(4x + 6y\\) to \\(3x + 7y\\) through simple algebraic manipulation due to the coefficients involved.\n\n**Option B:** \\(x + y + 5\\)\n\nSimilarly, it's challenging to directly relate \\(x + y + 5\\) to \\(3x + 7y\\) without knowing specific values of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\).\n\n**Option C:** \\(9x + 4y\\)\n\nAgain, it's not immediately clear how \\(9x + 4y\\) relates to \\(3x + 7y\\) without further algebraic manipulation.\n\n**Option D:** \\(4x - 9y\\)\n\nLet's examine this option carefully. We know that \\(3x + 7y = 11k\\). We want to see if \\(4x - 9y\\) can be manipulated or related back to this condition.\n\nConsider multiplying the original equation by 4 (and then subtracting an appropriate multiple of the original equation to match the form of \\(4x - 9y\\):\n\n\\[4(3x + 7y) = 4(11k)\\]\n\\[12x + 28y = 44k\\]\n\nNow, we want to get \\(4x - 9y\\) from this. Notice that if we could somehow subtract a multiple of \\(3x + 7y\\) to get \\(4x - 9y\\), we might find a connection. Let's see if we can manipulate our equations to get closer:\n\nGiven:\n\\[3x + 7y = 11k\\]\n\nMultiply both sides by 4:\n\\[12x + 28y = 44k\\]\n\nWe want to get \\(4x - 9y\\). Let's see if we can adjust our approach. Instead of directly aiming for \\(4x - 9y\\), let's consider a more direct manipulation approach:\n\nGiven \\(3x + 7y = 11k\\), let's aim to express something in terms of \\(3x + 7y\\) that could lead us to \\(4x - 9y\\). \n\nNotice that if we add and subtract multiples of \\(3x + 7y\\) in a way that aligns with our target expression, we can manipulate the equation effectively. However, a direct path to \\(4x - 9y\\) from \\(3x + 7y\\) without additional information or a specific strategy isn't immediately apparent through simple algebraic manipulation alone.\n\nUpon reevaluation, a more direct approach to prove or disprove any of these options requires a systematic method to transform one into the other using the given condition. Given the complexity and the lack of a straightforward algebraic route from \\(3x + 7y\\) to \\(4x - 9y\\) or any of the other options, we should instead look for a more intuitive or proof-based approach to confirm the divisibility.\n\nUpon deeper reflection and considering the nature of modular arithmetic, let's correct the oversight:\n\nGiven \\(3x + 7y = 11k\\), we aim to determine which expression is necessarily divisible by 11. A key insight is to leverage the properties of numbers modulo 11.\n\nFor \\(4x - 9y\\) to be divisible by 11, we can directly test the conditions implied by \\(3x + 7y = 11k\\).\n\nBy \\(4x - 9y\\) being divisible by 11 can be indirectly proven by recognizing that \\(3x + 7y\\) being a multiple of 11 allows for adjustments in \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) that maintain the divisibility by 11 when considering linear combinations of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\).\n\nGiven the structure of the problem and the provided options, the correct approach to directly prove the divisibility of \\(4x - 9y\\) by 1 involves understanding the implications of \\(3x + 7y\\) being a multiple of 1 on linear transformations involving \\(x\\) and \\(y\\).\n\nUpon reevaluation and ensuring clarity and accuracy:\n\n**Correct Option:**\n\nConsidering the direct manipulation and divisibility requirements, it's crucial to clarify that proving \\(4x - 9y\\) being divisible by 1"
