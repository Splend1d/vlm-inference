New plant varieties being patented\n\nThe development and use of genetically modified (GM) plants often lead to the creation of new plant varieties that may be patented by the companies or researchers who developed them. Patents can provide exclusive rights to produce, sell, or use the patented product, which can influence market dynamics and access to these technologies.\n\nA. Reduced cost of plant seeds: While GM seeds might initially cost more due to research and development expenses, they may not necessarily always result in reduced costs for farmers in the long run due to factors like higher input costs, specialized equipment, and potential resistance management strategies.\n\nC. Increased genetic diversity within a planted field: The opposite is more likely. GM plants often involve selective breeding or genetic modification that targets specific traits, which can reduce genetic diversity within a field if those traits are selected against natural genetic variation.\n\nD. Less oversight and fewer regulations than for unmodified crops: This statement is generally false. In fact, genetically modified organisms (GMOs) often face additional scrutiny and regulation compared to non-GM crops due to concerns over their environmental impact, potential health risks, and the novelty of introducing foreign genes into crops. Regulations vary by country but typically aim to ensure safety and transparency."
