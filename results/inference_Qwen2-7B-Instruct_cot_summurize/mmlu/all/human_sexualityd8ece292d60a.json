Males do indeed have one exit structure for both urine and semen (the urethra, which allows both to exit through the same opening at the tip of the penis. In contrast, females have two separate openings: one for urination and menstruation/vaginal discharge, and another for sexual intercourse.\n\nB. The male external genitalia, particularly the penis, can become engorged with blood when sexually aroused, leading to an erection. This is not a feature found in female anatomy. Instead, female sexual arousal may lead to the engorgement of blood vessels within the labia and clitoral area.\n\nC. There is scientific evidence suggesting that males may have more nerve endings in the penis compared to females in the clitoris. However, it's important to note that the sensitivity and pleasure experienced during sexual activity can be influenced by many factors beyond just the number of nerve endings, including hormonal differences, individual anatomy, and psychological factors.\n\nTherefore, all of these points accurately highlight anatomical differences between males and females."
