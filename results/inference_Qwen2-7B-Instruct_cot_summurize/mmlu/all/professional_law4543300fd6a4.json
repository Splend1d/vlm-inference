In order to protect his livestock from these attacks, the rancher erected a fence around his property. In addition, the rancher installed electrical wiring on the fence. The wiring transmitted an electric current, which would emit a shock upon contact with the fence. Although the voltage was calculated to frighten animals away from the fence, it was of such low intensity that it posed no risk of injury to a human being, even a small child. Consequently, the rancher did not post any notice of the electrical wiring device. One day, a cowboy was riding his horse along the outskirts of the rancher's property, when a gust of wind blew his hat onto the fence. The cowboy, who had undergone major heart surgery, wore a pacemaker. When the cowboy touched the top of the fence to retrieve his hat, the electric current short- circuited his pacemaker, resulting in the cowboy's death by electrocution. In a wrongful death action by the cowboy's estate against the rancher, the installation of the electrical wiring device would most likely constitute\n\nA. the legal cause of the cowboy's death, but not the cause-in-fact.\nB. the cause-in-fact of the cowboy's death, but not the legal cause.\nC. the legal cause and the cause-in-fact of the cowboy's death.\nD. neither the legal cause nor the cause-in-fact of the cowboy's death.\n"

The cause-in-fact, on the other hand, is the actual cause that directly leads to the result without which the result would not have occurred. \n\nIn this case, the installation of the electrical wiring device on the fence is both the cause-in-fact ( (because it directly led to the cowboy's death) and the legal cause ( because it was the action taken by the rancher that resulted in the cowboy's death. The rancher's decision to install the fence and the wiring, without proper warning, led to the cowboy's accidental electrocution, which was the direct cause of his death. The fact that the voltage was safe for humans does not negate the responsibility for the fatal outcome, given the circumstances."
