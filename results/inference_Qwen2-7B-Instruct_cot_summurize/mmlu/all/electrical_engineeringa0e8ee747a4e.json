This is because, in such systems (like induction motors for example, if you maintain a constant input voltage and vary the flux, the motor's speed will change but the product of speed and torque ( which represents power, will remain relatively constant assuming other factors like load do not change drastically. Hence, the system can provide a constant output power despite changes in speed or torque."
