No.\n\nExplanation: In this scenario, the normal force exerted by the floor on the man is perpendicular to his displacement when he stands still in the elevator moving upward. Work is defined as the product of force and displacement in the direction of that force. Since the man is not moving horizontally relative to the floor ( (assuming he stands still), there is no component of the normal force that acts in the direction of his displacement. Therefore, no work is done by the normal force on the man."
