This means that more inhibitor molecules will decrease the effective concentration of substrate that can be bound by the enzyme, thereby decreasing the rate of the reaction without altering the enzyme itself. The inhibitor does not change the enzyme's structure or function permanently; it simply reduces the efficiency of the enzyme-substrate interaction.\n\nA. Irreversibly forming covalent links with the enzyme is characteristic of a non-competitive or uncompetitive inhibitor, which binds to the enzyme at a site other than the active site and changes the enzyme's shape so that it cannot effectively bind substrates.\nB. Irreversibly modifying some of the amino acid residues that help to comprise the enzyme's active site describes what happens in the case of an irreversible inhibitor, which binds to the enzyme in such a way that the enzyme loses its activity permanently.\nC. Competing with the substrate molecule for the same enzyme but a different binding site than the substrate binding site is not how competitive inhibitors work. Competitive inhibitors compete with the substrate for the same binding site on the enzyme."
