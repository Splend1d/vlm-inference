Up on the Huanacavelica range there are 3,000 or 4,000 Indians working in the mercury mine, with picks and hammers, breaking up the ore. And when they have filled up their little sacks, the poor fellows, loaded down, climb up those ladders and rigging, so distressing that a man can hardly get up them. That is the way they work in this mine, with many lights and the loud noise of the pounding and great confusion. Nor is that the greatest evil; that is due to thievish and undisciplined superintendents. According to His Majesty's warrant, the mine owners at Potos\u00ed have a right to the mita of 13,300 Indians. These mita Indians earn each day 4 reals. Besides these there are others not under obligation, who hire themselves out voluntarily: these each get from 12 to 16 reals, and some up to 24, according to how well they wield their picks or their reputation for knowing how to get the ore out.\nAntonio Vasquez de Espinosa, report on mining in Huanacavelica and Potos\u00ed, 1620s\nThe third principal reason the local Yakut and Tungus natives are ruined is that from the time they first came under Russian control, they have been forced to pay yasak tribute. Some have paid in sables, others in red foxes, still others in cash. At first there were plenty of furbearing animals there, but now there are no sables and not many foxes in those lands, from the shores of the Arctic Ocean all the way south to the great Lena River. Moreover, almost half the natives cannot hunt because they no longer have horses, many of which have been pawned to the yasak collectors.\nHeinrich von F\u00fcch, \"On the Treatment of Natives in Northeast Siberia,\" 1744\nWhich of the following factors, not mentioned in the second passage, would have been most likely to create added difficulties for native Siberians attempting to fulfill their tribute obligations?\n\nA. The arrival of rival hunters from China and Japan\nB. The impact of epidemic diseases brought by Russian settlers\nC. The general warming of the climate during this time period\nD. The reduced demand for furs among European and Asian elites\n"

                    "text": "The factors mentioned in the second passage related to the difficulties faced by the local Yakut and Tungus natives in fulfilling their tribute obligations include:\n\n1. Forced payment of yasak tribute ( (first sentence)\n2. Reduction in availability of furbearing animals ( (second sentence)\n3. Loss of horses, which are were crucial for hunting ( (\"almost half the natives cannot hunt because they no longer have horses\")\n\nAmong the options given, none directly address the issues presented in the second passage. However, considering the context of the questions and the content provided:\n\n- A. The arrival of rival hunters from China and Japan: This factor is not mentioned in the second passage. It could potentially create additional difficulties for the native Siberians as it would increase competition for resources, making it harder to fulfill their own tribute obligations.\n\n- B. The impact of epidemic diseases brought by Russian settlers: This factor is also not explicitly mentioned in the passage. Although it could lead to population decline and make it more challenging to meet tribute demands, it is not one of the direct causes listed in the text.\n\n- C. The general warming of the climate during this time period: This factor is not discussed in the passage. While climate change might affect the availability of furbearing animals over time, it is not directly linked to the issue of fulfilling y asak tribute obligations as described in the passage.\n\n- D. The reduced demand for furs among European and Asian elites: This factor is not mentioned in the passage either. While a decrease in demand could reduce the economic value of the tribute, the passage focuses on the immediate challenges of reduced availability and increased costs of fulfilling the tribute itself.\n\nGiven the options, **A. The arrival of rival hunters from China and Japan** would be the most likely factor to create added difficulties for native Siberians attempting to fulfill their tribute obligations, as it directly increases competition for the limited resources necessary to pay the tribute."
