The city was laid out on a grid system, which suggests that it was carefully designed and organized. This grid pattern included major avenues running north-south and east-west, intersecting at right angles, creating a well-structured layout for the city's buildings, temples, and residential areas. \n\nWhile Teotihuac\u00e1n was a significant urban center, it does not necessarily mean that it had sophisticated plumbing and cooling systems ( (A), was subject to constant outbreaks of plague and disease ( (B), or was surrounded by an enormous agricultural hinterland as its influence and resources extended beyond its immediate surroundings ( (C). However, its urban planning is a defining feature that sets it apart and contributes to its historical significance."
