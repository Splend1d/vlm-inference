Wrong, Not wrong\n\nSlamming on the brakes to miss a ball coming into the road could potentially cause an accident or harm to others if there are are other vehicles close by or pedestrians in the vicinity, especially if the action was sudden and unexpected. This might be considered morally wrong depending on the circumstances, as it involves a deliberate decision that could lead to harm for others.\n\nTeaching one's child to play the xylophone is generally not considered morally wrong. It is a positive activity that can contribute to the child's development and enjoyment of music. However, the way in which the activity is carried out (e.g., teaching methods, amount of practice, etc.) would also matter in assessing the morality of this action."
