However, the broader influx of Asian immigrants began after 1965 with the Immigration and Nationality Act, which abolished national origins quotas and allowed for more diverse immigration patterns. Therefore, it's not accurate to categorize the significant immigration from Asia within the 1870-1914 time frame without considering the restrictive policies context."
