                    "text": "This problem describes an exponential decay scenario, where the rate of contaminant removal is proportional to the amount of contaminant remaining. Mathematically, this can be represented by the equation:\n\n\\[ Q(t) = Q_0 \\cdot e^{-kt} \\]\n\nwhere \\(Q(t)\\) is the amount of contaminant remaining after time \\(t\\), \\(Q_0\\) is the initial amount of contaminant, \\(k\\) is the proportionality constant (and \\(e\\) is the base of the natural logarithm.\n\nGiven that 20% of the contaminant is removed in the first minute, we can say that 80% remains after one minute. Thus, \\(Q(1) = 0.8Q_0\\). Plugging this into our equation gives us:\n\n\\[ 0.8Q_0 = Q_0 \\cdot e^{-k \\cdot 1} \\]\n\nSimplifying this to find \\(e^{-k}\\):\n\n\\[ 0.8 = e^{-k} \\]\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides to solve for \\(k\\):\n\n\\[ \\ln(0.8 = -k \\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ k = -\\ln(0.8 \\]\n\nNow, to find out how long it takes to reduce the contaminant to 2% ( (since 98% needs to be removed to make the water safe), we set \\(Q(t) = 0.02Q_0\\) and solve for \\(t\\):\n\n\\[ 0.02Q_0 = Q_0 \\cdot e^{-k \\cdot t} \\]\n\nSubstituting \\(k\\) back in:\n\n\\[ 0.02 = e^{(\\ln(0.8) \\cdot t)} \\]\n\nTake the natural log again to solve for \\(t\\):\n\n\\[ \\ln(0.02 = (\\ln(0.8)) \\cdot t \\]\n\n\\[ t = \\frac{\\ln(0.02)}{\\ln(0.8)} \\]\n\nUsing a calculator to compute the values:\n\n\\[ t \\approx \\frac{\\ln(0.02)}{\\ln(0.8)} \\approx \\frac{-3.912}{-0.2231} \\approx 17.54 \\]\n\nSo, the decontamination process will take approximately 18 minutes to reduce the contaminant to 2%, making the answer:\n\nC. 18 min"
