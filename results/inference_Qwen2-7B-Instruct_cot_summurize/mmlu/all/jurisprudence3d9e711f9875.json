Organic solidarity leads to restitutive law.\n\n\u00c9mile Durkheim, a French sociologist, identified two types of social solidarity: mechanical ( or collective, and organic. \n\nMechanical solidarity is typical of societies with simple economic structures where people have similar roles and duties. In these societies, the law tends to be repressive, focusing on maintaining social order through punishment for those who break the norms and values shared by all members of the society.\n\nOn the other hand, organic solidarity characterizes more complex societies where individuals have diverse roles and functions. The law in such societies becomes more restitutive, aimed at restoring the equilibrium disrupted by an individual's actions. This is because each person's contribution is unique and interdependent, necessitating a legal system capable of resolving conflicts arising from this complexity."
