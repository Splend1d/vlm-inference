He suggests that we should consider the nature of the pleasures themselves and how they are are valued by those who experience them. Therefore, according to Mill, determining which pleasure is more valuable involves understanding what most experienced people prefer, as this reflects the intrinsic value of the pleasure beyond mere intensity or duration."
