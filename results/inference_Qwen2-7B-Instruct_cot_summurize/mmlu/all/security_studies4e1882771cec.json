All of these options.\n\nSecuritization, in the context of policy and governance, refers to the process of framing an issue as a matter of security, which can significantly influence how that issue is addressed and the resources allocated to it. Here's how each option align with this perspective:\n\nA. By framing an issue as a security threat, securitization can indeed create a sense of urgency that leads to a sustained mobilization of political support and resources directed towards addressing the perceived threat.\n\nB. Seemingly contradictory to the typical perception of securitization, it often involves simplifying complex issues to make them more manageable and prioritized within the political system. This can lead to more efficient handling of certain problems, especially those deemed critical or urgent in a security context.\n\nC. By declaring certain issues as security-related, securitization can indeed mobilize popular support. People are more likely to back measures when they are framed in terms of protecting national or personal safety, potentially leading to greater allocation of resources towards those ends.\n\nTherefore, all three options highlight aspects of how securitization can be viewed as having tangible benefits, particularly in terms of enhancing political mobilization, efficiency in addressing issues, and garnering public support for resource allocation."
