Reading difficulties usually do not reach normal levels as these children reach adulthood.\n\nResearch indicates that individuals with specific reading disabilities, often referred to as dyslexia, may face persistent challenges throughout their lives. While some improvements might occur, particularly with appropriate interventions and support, many individuals continue to experience difficulties with reading fluency, comprehension, and other related skills as they grow older.\n\nIt's important to note that the other options provided are not accurate representations of findings from longitudinal studies on children with specific reading disabilities:\n\nA. Subtle hearing disorders are not consistently linked to specific reading disabilities. While hearing issues can affect reading ability, they are not a common underlying factor for specific reading disabilities like dyslexia.\n\nC. There is no evidence to suggest that children with specific reading disabilities typically excel in sports. While some children might show exceptional abilities in certain areas, reading difficulties do not generally correlate with athletic prowess.\n\nD. A low vocabulary level is indeed commonly associated with specific reading disabilities. However, it's a symptom rather than an accurate statement about the typical profile of such children. Many children with reading disabilities have a vocabulary that is below average for their age, but this is not the defining characteristic of their condition."
