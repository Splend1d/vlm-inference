It works by interfering with microtubule function, which prevents the proper separation of chromosomes during cell division. This results in the duplication of the chromosome set and the formation of polyploid cells.\n\nPenicillin, tetracycline, and puromycin are not known to induce polyploidy; they are antibiotics used to inhibit bacterial growth by targeting specific components of bacterial cells."
