Neither position nor momentum can be known exactly.\n\nThe Heisenberg uncertainty principle states that the more precisely the position of some particle is determined, the less precisely its momentum can be known, and vice versa. This means that for a quantum mechanical particle in the lowest energy level ( or ground state of a one-dimensional box, it's impossible to know both the exact position and exact momentum at the same time. The more accurately you measure one, the less accurately you can know the other. \n\nIn the context of a particle in a one-dimensional box, this means that while the particle will be found within the box with certainty ( since outside the box there is no potential energy and thus no force to keep it confined, its exact position cannot be pinpointed due to the inherent probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics. Similarly, while the particle's momentum can theoretically be calculated based on the wave function describing its state in the ground state, it cannot be known exactly because the precise position of the particle cannot be determined."
