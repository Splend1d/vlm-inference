                    "text": "The force between two electrically charged objects is determined by Coulomb's Law:\n\n\\[ F = k \\frac{|q_1 q_2|}{r^2} \\]\n\nwhere \\( F \\) is the force between the charges, \\( k \\) is Coulomb's constant, \\( q_1 \\) and \\( q_2 \\) are the magnitudes of the charges, and \\( r \\) is the distance between the centers of the charges.\n\nSince the question states that the charge on each ball remains the same, the product \\( |q_1 q_2| \\) in the equation remains unchanged. The only variable that changes is the distance between the balls. Doubling the mass of one of the balls does not affect the distance between them, so the denominator in the equation remains the same.\n\nTherefore, doubling the mass of one of the balls has no effect on the electric force between the balls according to Coulomb's Law. The new force between the balls would still be:\n\n\\[ F_{\\text{new}} = F_{\\text{old}} = 50 \\, \\mu\\text{N} \\]\n\nSo the correct answer is A. 50 \u03bcN."
