Recovery of the contract price of the car.\n\nWhen a party breaches a contract, the non-breaching party can seek various forms of relief, including damages, specific performance, or rescission. In this scenario, since the buyer has already tendered a $10,000 cashier's check to the seller, which was rejected, and the seller failed to deliver the car as per the contract, the buyer is entitled to recover the contract price of the car, which is $10,000.\n\nSpecific performance might also be considered if the item (in this case, the car) is unique or hard to replace, but it is not automatically granted and would depend on additional factors such as whether it would be unjust to enforce specific performance.\n\nDamages typically refer to compensation for losses suffered due to the breach, but in this context, the buyer is seeking to recover the exact amount they agreed to pay under the contract terms.\n\nRecovery of the market price of the car ( (option D) would be a remedy that seeks to put the non-breaching party in the position they would have been in had the breach not occurred, essentially compensating for the loss rather than enforcing the original agreement directly. This is often done when the specific item cannot be returned to its original state or is too unique to be replaced exactly as it was.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate choice given the information provided would be option B: Recovery of the contract price of the car."
