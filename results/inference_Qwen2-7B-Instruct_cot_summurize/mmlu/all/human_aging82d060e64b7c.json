Neuroticism is one of the \"Big Five\" personality traits, which also includes openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, and agreeableness. High levels of neuroticism have been linked to various health issues and behaviors that can contribute to poorer health outcomes, including increased stress, anxiety, and depression. These factors can lead to poorer health management, increased medical complications, and potentially earlier mortality. However, it's important to note that this association does not necessarily imply causation and other factors can play a role as well."
