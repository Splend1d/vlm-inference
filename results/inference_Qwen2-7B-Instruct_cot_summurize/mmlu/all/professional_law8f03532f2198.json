The defendant moved to dismiss the action, and the court granted the motion in an order that stated: \"The defendant's motion to dismiss is granted, and this action is dismissed with prejudice.\" The court accordingly entered judgment for the defendant. The plaintiff then filed the same claim against the defendant in federal court, invoking diversity jurisdiction. The defendant has asserted the defense of res judicata (claim preclusion) in its answer. Should the federal court give preclusive effect to the state court judgment?\n\nA. No, because the judgment was entered by a state court, not a federal court.\nB. No, because the state court did not rule on the merits in its dismissal.\nC. Yes, because a dismissal with prejudice operates as a judgment on the merits.\nD. Yes, because a judgment for failure to prosecute operates as a judgment on the merits under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n"

Yes, because a dismissal with prejudice operates as a judgment on the merits.\n\nExplanation:\n\nRes judicata, or claim preclusion, is a principle in law that prevents the same parties from relitigating the same claim or cause of action after a final judgment has been rendered. Whether a judgment is given preclusive effect depends on several factors, including whether it was a final judgment on the merits and whether the party seeking to assert preclusion has had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue.\n\nIn this case, the state court's order granting the defendant's motion to dismiss and dismissing the action with prejudice indicates that the court considered the merits of the case. A dismissal with prejudice typically means that the plaintiff is barred from refiling the same claim against the same defendant unless new evidence or circumstances arise that justify reopening the case. This suggests that the court made a determination on the merits that was final and conclusive.\n\nGiven this context, the federal court should give preclusive effect to the state court's judgment under the principles of res judicata. The fact that the judgment was issued by a state court rather than a federal court does not preclude the application of res judicata; rather, it is the nature of the judgment and the principles of finality and comity that determine its preclusive effect across jurisdictions. Therefore, option C correctly identifies that the federal court should give preclusive effect to the state court judgment because it was a dismissal with prejudice, which operates as a judgment on the merits."
