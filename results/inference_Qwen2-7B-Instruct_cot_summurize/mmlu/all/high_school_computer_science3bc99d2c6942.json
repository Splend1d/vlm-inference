Starting with the middle element, if it's not the target value, you can eliminate half of the remaining elements in each step. Specifically:\n\n- After the first comparison, at most half of the elements ( (which is \\( \\lceil \\frac{500}{2} \\rceil = 250 \\) ) remain.\n- After the second comparison, at most half of those remaining elements are left, which is \\( \\lceil \\frac{250}{2} \\rceil = 125 \\).\n- This process continues until you either find the target or determine it's not in the list.\n\nTo find the maximum number of elements that will be examined, we continue this process until we reach a single element. The number of times we can halve 500 before reaching 1 is given by the formula \\( \\lceil \\log_2(500) \\rceil \\), which is approximately 9 ( since \\( 2^8 = 256 \\) and \\( 2^9 = 512 \\). However, this gives us the number of steps required to reduce the list size to 1 from 500, not the exact number of elements checked. \n\nIn practice, the number of elements checked would be less than this because we stop as soon as the target is found or the list is reduced to a single element that isn't the target. The key insight is that the number of elements examined is significantly less than 500, making options D and C incorrect. Between A and B, B (50 is closer to the actual maximum number of elements that might be examined in the worst-case scenario, especially considering the logarithmic nature of the binary search algorithm."
