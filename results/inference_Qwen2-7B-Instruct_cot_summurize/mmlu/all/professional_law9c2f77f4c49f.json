If the uncle does move, the interest shifts to the brother. This shifting of interests based on the occurrence of an event (the uncle moving to another state) makes it a shifting executory interest. \n\nA \"pur autre vie\" clause means \"for the life of another,\" so the uncle's interest is for the duration of his life, and similarly for the brother's interest should it come into play. The shifting executory interest part comes from the condition that triggers the shift - in this case, the uncle moving to another state."
