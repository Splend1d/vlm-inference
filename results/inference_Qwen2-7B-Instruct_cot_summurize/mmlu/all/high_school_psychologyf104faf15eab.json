They argue that these traits are relatively stable characteristics that influence how individuals behave in various situations. Trait theories suggest that personality can be described by a set of dispositions or tendencies that are relatively consistent over time and across different contexts. These traits are believed to have both genetic (nature) and environmental (nurture) origins, contributing to their development and stability."
