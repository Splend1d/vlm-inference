Following the killings, the police issued an \"all-points-bulletin\" for the arrest of a 40-year-old Caucasian male (height, 6 feet; weight, 150-155 pounds), who had been seen near the location of the bank robbery. On Friday, a security guard at a local department store was walking down Main Street when he noticed a tall, African American man who fit the bank robbery suspect's description in age, height, and weight. The security guard approached the person (and believing him to be the bank robbery suspect), pulled a gun and arrested him. The security guard held the man in custody until the police arrived a short time later. The police officer informed the security guard that he had arrested the wrong person. The man had told the security guard that he was not the man who had committed the bank robbery and shot the police officers. The man was humiliated by the false arrest. If the man asserts a claim for assault against the security guard, he will\n\nA. succeed, if the man saw the security guard pointing the gun at him.\nB. succeed, if the security guard's mistaken belief was unreasonable.\nC. not succeed, because the security guard did not intend to injure the man.\nD. not succeed, because the man did not suffer any injury from the security guard's act.\n"

In this case, the security guard's actions led the man to fear imminent harm when the guard pulled out a gun and arrested him under the mistaken belief that he was the bank robbery suspect. \n\nFor the man to successfully assert a claim for assault against the security guard, it would need to be established that:\n1. The security guard's actions were intentional or reckless.\n2. The man apprehended the imminent harmful or offensive contact (in this case, being shot or physically harmed.\n3. The security guard's belief that the man was the bank robbery suspect was unreasonable.\n\nReasonableness of the belief is often a key factor in determining liability for assault. If the security guard had reasonable grounds to believe the man was involved in the bank robbery based on clear and specific evidence (such as eyewitness accounts identifying the suspect, CCTV footage, or a distinctive physical description that matched the suspect closely, then his belief might have been considered reasonable. However, since the description provided to the security guard was vague (mentioning only height, age, and weight without any distinguishing features or other specifics, his belief could be deemed unreasonable.\n\nGiven the lack of additional identifying details that would make the match more specific, the security guard's reliance on a broad and common set of characteristics (which could apply to many individuals in the community - would likely be viewed as unreasonable. Therefore, if the man can prove that the security guard lacked reasonable grounds to believe he was the suspect, he may succeed in his claim for assault."
