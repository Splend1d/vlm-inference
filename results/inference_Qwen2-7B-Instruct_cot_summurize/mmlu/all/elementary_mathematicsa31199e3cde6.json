This is because the entrance allows for a diverse range of individuals who are actively shopping at the mall to participate in the survey, rather than limiting the sample to specific areas or locations within the mall which might introduce bias. Options A and D are likely to result in samples that are not representative of the entire mall population since they focus on either a single type of store or outside the mall premises. Option B could also introduce bias as it might only capture those who specifically go to shoe stores, potentially missing other demographics."
