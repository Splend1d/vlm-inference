The rate of blood lactate accumulation is determined by the difference between the rate of lactate appearance ( primarily from muscle anaerobic glycolysis during high-intensity exercise when oxygen supply is insufficient for energy demand - and the rate of lactate clearance, which includes both lactate uptake by the liver for gluconeogenesis and lactate diffusion out of muscles into other tissues for utilization. When lactate production exceeds its clearance, blood lactate levels accumulate."
