Instead, he hit and injured a hiker. The hunter had not realized that the hiker was there. Does the injured hiker have an actionable battery claim against the hunter?\n\nA. No, because the hunter did not intend to shoot the hiker.\nB. No, because the hunter did not make direct physical contact with the hiker.\nC. Yes, because the bullet from the hunter's rifle made direct physical contact with the hiker.\nD. Yes, because the hunter intentionally shot the rifle.\n"

Yes, because the bullet from the hunter's rifle made direct physical contact with the hiker.\n\nBattery is a legal term used when one person touches another without consent or permission. In this scenario, the bullet from the hunter's rifle made direct physical contact with the hiker, which would typically be considered battery under the law. Even if the hunter did not intend to shoot the hiker, the act of shooting a rifle that resulted in harm to the hiker can still constitute battery. The intent to harm the hiker is not necessary for a battery claim to be established; it is sufficient that there was an unauthorized physical contact resulting in harm."
