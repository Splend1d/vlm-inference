The law code first promulgated by Chinggis Khan ordered human interaction. The result was an important new stage in international contact. From eastern Europe to southern China, merchants and travelers could move across the well-policed Mongol domains without fear for their lives or property. The great swath of Mongol territory that covered or connected most of Europe, Asia, and the Middle East served as a bridge between the civilizations of the Eastern Hemisphere. The caravans and embassies that crossed the Mongol lands transmitted new food, inventions, and ideas from one civilized pool to others and from civilized pools to the nomadic peoples who served as intermediaries. Secure trade routes made for prosperous merchants and wealthy, cosmopolitan cities. They also facilitated the spread of foods [and] inventions . . . a major force for economic and social development and the enhancement of civilized life.\n\u2014Robert Guisepi, 1992\nWhich of the following was a long-term consequence of the Mongol conquest of Russia in the 1200s?\n\nA. Russia was excluded from Western European developments (like the Renaissance).\nB. Russia benefited by becoming the administrative center of Mongol political activity.\nC. Islam became the dominant religion of Russia.\nD. Russia developed a centralized bureaucracy.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is D. Russia developed a centralized bureaucracy.\n\nThe Mongol conquest of Russia in the 13th century, particularly under the rule of the Golden Horde, led to a period of significant administrative reforms in Russia. One of the key outcomes was the establishment of a more centralized bureaucratic system, which helped to organize the vast territories under Mongol control and laid the groundwork for later developments in Russian governance.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while there were cultural and intellectual differences between Russia and Western Europe during this time, Russia was not entirely isolated. There were still interactions and exchanges, and eventually, Russia did adopt some aspects of Renaissance culture and ideas, albeit with significant delays compared to Western Europe.\n\nOption B is incorrect because while the Mongols had a significant impact on the political landscape of Russia, they did not make Moscow the administrative center of Mongol political activity. Instead, they ruled through local khanates, including the Golden Horde, which was centered in the region around the Volga River.\n\nOption C is incorrect because while Islam did influence parts of Russia due to the proximity of Muslim-ruled territories and trade connections, it never became the dominant religion in the entirety of Russia. Christianity remained the predominant faith throughout the country's history.\n\nTherefore, the long-term consequence of the Mongol conquest of Russia in the 1200s was the development of a centralized bureaucracy, which is option D."
