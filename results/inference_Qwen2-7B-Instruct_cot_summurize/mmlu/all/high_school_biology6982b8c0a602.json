This happens because water moves from areas of high concentration to areas of low concentration through a process known as osmosis. \n\nThe cell's semi-permeable membrane allows water to pass through but restricts the passage of solutes like sodium and chloride ions. As a result, the cell will swell as it takes in water, potentially reaching a point where it can no longer expand and may rupture or lyse due to the increased pressure inside the cell. This is the phenomenon called \"swelling\" and ultimately \"lysis\".\n\nOptions A, C, and D do not accurately describe the scenario described:\n\nA. Plasmolysis usually refers to the separation of the cell membrane from the cell wall in plant cells, not a typical response in animal cells which lack a rigid cell wall.\n\nC. Endocytosis is a cellular process by which cells take in substances by engulfing them, not by passingively absorbing water.\n\nD. Shriving refers to a cell losing water and shrinking, which would occur if the cell were placed in a hypertonic solution (where the external solution has a higher solute concentration than the cell. In this case, the cell would lose water, not gain it."
