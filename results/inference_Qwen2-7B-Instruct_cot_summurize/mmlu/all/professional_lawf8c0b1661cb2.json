A lawyer for the movie studio negotiated an agreement with the screenwriter whereby the movie studio would pay the screenwriter $5,000 for the rights to the screenplay, and 10 percent of the gross receipts earned by the distribution of the movie, should the studio decide to film the screenplay. Both sides signed the agreement. Two weeks later, the screenwriter was at a birthday party for a close friend when she discovered she had forgotten to purchase a gift for her friend. She quickly grabbed a piece of paper and wrote on it:\"I promise that my friend is entitled to 5 percent of the proceeds I will receive for the distribution of the movie to be made from my screenplay. \"The screenwriter then signed the paper, placed it in an envelope, and handed it to the friend. The promise to pay 5 percent of the proceeds to the friend may best be interpreted as a (an)\n\nA. equitable lien.\nB. conditional assignment.\nC. irrevocable assignment.\nD. gratuitous assignment of future rights.\n"

However, this promise does not have the same legal effect as an actual assignment of rights, which is typically a formal agreement between parties. In law, a gratuitous assignment (also known as an assignment nul et pour rien) refers to an assignment of future rights made without consideration, or in exchange for something of nominal value. It's important to note that such an arrangement might not always be legally binding, especially if it contradicts the original agreement with the movie studio. \n\nAn equitable lien, on the other hand, refers to a legal right that allows one party to retain a claim over certain property until a debt or obligation is paid. A conditional assignment involves an assignment of rights subject to a condition precedent, meaning the assignment only takes effect once a specific event occurs. An irrevocable assignment, as the name suggests, is an assignment that cannot be rescinded or revoked once made.\n\nIn this context, since the promise is made without any compensation to the friend and potentially in conflict with the screenwriter's obligations under the contract with the movie studio, it could be seen as a gratuitous assignment of future rights. However, its enforceability would depend on local laws and the specifics of the situation, including whether the movie is produced and how much the screenwriter actually earns from it."
