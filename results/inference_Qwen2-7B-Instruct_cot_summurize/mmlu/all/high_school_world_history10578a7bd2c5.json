One is inhabited by Muslims and has twelve mosques, salaried imams and muezzins, and jurists and scholars. In the environs are wells with sweet water, from which they drink and with which they grow vegetables. . . . The king's interpreters, the official in charge of his treasury and the majority of his ministers are Muslims. Only royalty may wear sewn clothes. All other people wear robes of cotton, silk, or brocade, according to their means. . . . The king adorns himself like a woman, wearing necklaces round his neck and bracelets on his forearms. . . . He sits . . . in a domed pavilion around which stand ten horses. When people who profess the same religion as the king approach him they fall on their knees and sprinkle dust on their heads, for this is their way of greeting him. As for the Muslims, they greet him only by clapping their hands. [The people's] religion is paganism and the worship of idols. . . . On every donkey-load of salt when it is brought into the country their king levies one golden dinar, and two dinars when it is sent out. From a load of copper the king's due is five mithqals, and from a load of other goods ten mithqals. . . . The nuggets found in all the mines of his country are reserved for the king, only this gold dust being left for the people. But for this the people would accumulate gold until it lost its value. Beyond this country lies another called Malal, the king of which was sincerely attached to Islam, while the common people of his kingdom remained polytheists. Since then their rulers have been given the title of al-musulmani .\n\u2014The Book of Routes and Realms , by Abu Ubaydallah al-Bakri, eleventh-century Muslim historian and geographer\nWhat evidence is there in the passage that Ghanians were engaged, directly or indirectly, in trade with Asia?\n\nA. They kept horses in their court, which would have come from the Mongols.\nB. The Ghanian king had adopted the Chinese tradition of the kow-tow .\nC. The king adorned himself with gold and jewels, probably from India.\nD. The people in his court wore silk robes.\n"

                    "text": "The passage does not provide explicit evidence of direct or indirect trade between Ghanians and Asia. However, based on the context and historical knowledge, we can infer some connections:\n\nC. The king adorned himself with gold and jewels, probably from India: This could be an indication of trade, as luxury items such as gold and precious stones were often traded across long distances. India, in particular, was known for its wealth in these commodities and for extensive trade networks that reached as far as West Africa.\n\nD. The people in his court wore silk robes: Silk production originated in China and was highly valued for its quality and rarity. The presence of silk in Ghanian society suggests that there might have been a trade route linking them to Asia, possibly through the Islamic world where silk was also a popular trade item.\n\nWhile the passage does not explicitly mention any Asian trade partners, the presence of luxury items and the adoption of practices like those associated with Chinese traditions (as implied by option B (the king's attire resembling that of a Chinese ruler) suggest broader interactions within the Islamic world that facilitated trade. However, without more specific details, we cannot definitively conclude that Ghanians traded directly with Asia based solely on the passage provided."
