                    "text": "The correct answer is D. The atrioventricular ( AV bundle, also known as the His-Purkinje system, is formed of Purkinje fibers and serves as an important electrical pathway connecting the atria to the ventricles. This structure is crucial for the conduction of electrical signals that coordinate the heartbeat, ensuring that the ventricles contract after the atria have done so. While there are other pathways involved in the conduction system of the heart, the AV bundle is specifically mentioned in option D as being formed of Purkinje fibers and serving as one of the key connections between the atria and ventricles."
