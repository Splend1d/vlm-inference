It is a proto-oncogene that can function as an oncogene when mutated or overexpressed, leading to uncontrolled cell growth and potentially cancer. The other options listed ( A. APC, B. NF1, and C. RB1 are are indeed tumor suppressor genes. APC (adenomatous polyposis coli) is involved in the development of colon cancer, NF1 (neurofibromin 1) is associated with neurofibromatosis type 1, and RB1 (retinoblastoma protein 1) is linked to retinoblastoma and other cancers."
