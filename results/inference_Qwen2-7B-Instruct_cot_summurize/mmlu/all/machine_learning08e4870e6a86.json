A 1-nearest neighbor classifier can still make errors on its training data, especially if there are are ties in the distances between the query point and the training points or if the decision boundary is not perfectly aligned with the data points.\n\nStatement 2: As the number of data points grows to infinity, the Maximum A Posteriori ( (MAP) estimate approaches the Maximum Likelihood Estimate (MLE) for all possible priors. This statement is true. When the amount of data is very large, the influence of the prior distribution diminishes relative to the likelihood of the data. Thus, as the sample size increases, the MAP estimate converges to the MLE estimate, making the choice of prior less significant.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **D. False, True**."
