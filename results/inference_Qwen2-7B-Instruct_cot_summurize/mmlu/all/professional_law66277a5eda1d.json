By the terms of the lease, the tenant expressly covenanted to pay a monthly rental of $300 and to pay the taxes on the premises during the term of the lease. The lease also stipulated that the tenant, as lessee, may not assign or sublease the said premises. The tenant and his family lived in the house for two years. Then the tenant, still owing the landlord three months back rent, assigned his leasehold interest in the property to a student, who was unaware of the prohibition against assignments. This written assignment expressly provided that the student would pay the landlord the monthly rental of $300, but was silent concerning the payment of taxes. The landlord never objected to this assignment. Six months after the assignment, the landlord conveyed his property interest in the premises to a new owner. The student failed to pay the taxes on the property. The new owner, after paying the taxes, brought suit against the student for the amount paid. Judgment should be for\n\nA. the new owner.\nB. the student, because he did not contract with the tenant to pay the taxes on the property.\nC. the student, because the covenant to pay taxes will not \"run with the land,\" unless the intent is clearly expressed in the original lease.\nD. the student, because the covenant to pay taxes is merely collateral and does not \"run with the land. \"\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is C. the student, because the covenant to pay taxes will not \"run with the land,\" unless the intent is clearly expressed in the original lease.\n\nIn real estate law, a covenant or condition in a lease or deed that runs with the land generally binds not only the parties to the original agreement but also subsequent owners. For such a covenant to bind future owners, it must either be express in the document or have been intended by the original parties to run with the land. In this case, the original lease between the landlord and the tenant did not require the tenant to pay taxes, and it explicitly prohibited assignments of the lease. However, when the tenant assigned their lease to the student without the landlord's consent (which was required by the lease terms), the assignment was void. \n\nWhen the landlord later sold the property to a new owner, the covenant to pay taxes, which was not part of the original lease and not intended to run with the land, did not automatically bind the new owner. The new owner was not bound by any covenant to pay taxes unless there was clear language in the lease or some other binding agreement that made such a payment obligation a condition of the sale or tenancy.\n\nTherefore, since the covenant to pay taxes was not part of the original lease agreement between the landlord and the tenant, and there is no indication that the tenant intended for this covenant to bind the new owner upon the sale of the property, the new owner would not be legally obligated to pay the taxes if they were not previously aware of this obligation. Hence, the judgment should be for the student, as the covenant to pay taxes did not run with the land and was not a condition that the new owner assumed through the purchase of the property."
