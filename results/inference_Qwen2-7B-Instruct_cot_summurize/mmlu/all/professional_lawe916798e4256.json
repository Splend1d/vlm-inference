The niece and her husband took immediate possession of the farm and lived there with their daughter and son. Thereafter, the husband died in an automobile accident. In 1972, two years after her father's death, the daughter moved to another state. The son lived with his mother on the farm until her death intestate in 1980. The son continued in exclusive possession of the farm until his death in 2001. In his will, the son devised the farm to a local charity. When he was alive, the son was unaware that his sister was still alive and that title to the farm had descended to the two of them as their mother's sole surviving heirs. Since his mother's death in 1980, the son has held himself out as the owner of the farm, maintaining it and paying all of the taxes on the property. The sister had not communicated with either her mother or her brother since her redomiciling in 1972. The jurisdiction in which the farm is located has a 20-year limitation period for the acquisition of property by adverse possession. What interest, if any, does the sister have in the property?\n\nA. None, because of her own laches.\nB. None, because the brother acquired title to the farm by adverse possession.\nC. An undivided one-half interest because the brother's possession was not adverse to her title.\nD. An undivided one-half interest because the 20-year limitation period did not run against her because she was unaware of the brother's exclusive possession.\n"

An undivided one-half interest because the 20-year limitation period did not run against her because she was unaware of the brother's exclusive possession.\n\nThe sister would have an undivided one-half interest in the farm due to the principle of tenancy by the entirety. Tenancy by the entirety is a type of joint ownership reserved exclusively for married couples, giving each spouse an equal and indivisible interest in the property. Upon the death of one spouse, the property automatically becomes owned solely by the surviving spouse, unless there is a valid will stating otherwise. \n\nIn this case, when the niece ( and therefore the sister, passed away in 1972, the farm should have automatically become solely owned by her husband, who then passed away in 1980. After the death of the sister's husband, the farm should have reverted to the sister and her brother as sole heirs, given that they were the only surviving children of their deceased parents. \n\nSince the sister was unaware of her brother's exclusive possession of the farm, the 20-year limitation period for adverse possession did not apply to her. Adverse possession requires continuous, open, and notorious possession of land for a certain period, during which time the true owner is aware of the possession but chooses not to contest it. As the sister had no knowledge of her brother's actions, she cannot be considered to have acquiesced in any adverse possession claim by her brother.\n\nTherefore, the sister would maintain her undivided one-half interest in the farm until her death, and upon her death, the farm would pass according to the laws of intestacy in the jurisdiction, potentially leading to the division of the farm among her heirs as determined by law."
