This means that even if an adversary gains access to the current session keys or long-term keys after the fact, they cannot decrypt previous messages that were encrypted with older session keys or long-term keys. This property directly addresses Alice and Bob's concern about an adversary potentially compromising their encrypted messages by gaining access to their systems during the final exam."
