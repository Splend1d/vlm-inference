The contractor who installed the shutters did so by drilling screws and brackets into the exterior window frames and the shutters. The man later agreed to sell the home to a buyer. The sales agreement did not mention the shutters, the buyer did not inquire about them, and the buyer did not conduct a walkthrough inspection of the home before the closing. The man conveyed the home to the buyer by warranty deed. After the sale closed, the buyer noticed that the shutters and brackets had been removed from the home and that the window frames had been repaired and repainted. The buyer demanded that the man return the shutters and pay the cost of reinstallation, claiming that the shutters had been conveyed to him with the sale of the home. When the man refused, the buyer sued. Is the buyer likely to prevail?\n\nA. No, because the sales agreement did not mention the shutters.\nB. No, because the window frames had been repaired and repainted after removal of the shutters.\nC. Yes, because the shutters had become fixtures.\nD. Yes, because the man gave the buyer a warranty deed and the absence of the shutters violated a covenant of the deed.\n"

Yes, because the shutters had become fixtures.\n\nIn real estate transactions, when items become \"fixtures,\" they are considered part of the property and are conveyed with it upon sale. Fixtures are generally defined as items that are attached to the land or building in such a way that their removal would cause damage or destruction to the item or the property. Examples of fixtures include built-in cabinets, lighting fixtures, window treatments like shutters, and appliances. \n\nIn this scenario, since the shutters were installed by drilling screws and brackets into both the exterior window frames and the shutters themselves, it's plausible that they had become fixtures. Given that the sales agreement did not mention the shutters, the lack of inquiry by the buyer, and the absence of an inspection prior to closing, the shutters could be considered a part of the property conveyed under the warranty deed given by the seller.\n\nWithout evidence to the contrary (such as an express agreement stating otherwise or clear evidence that the shutters were intended to remain with the seller upon conveyance\u2014especially considering the repairs made to the window frames after the shutters were removed\u2014the court is likely to rule that the shutters were part of the property and should have been included in the sale. Therefore, the buyer might prevail in their claim against the seller for returning the shutters and covering the cost of reinstallation."
