It shifts the bits of the number to the right and fills 0 on voids left as a result. \n\nSo, when you perform `x >> 1` with `x = 8`, you're shifting the binary representation of 8 one position to the right. \n\nBinary representation of 8 in Python is `1000`. When you shift it one position to the right (`1000 >> 1`), it becomes `10` which is equivalent to decimal number `2`.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nC. 2"
