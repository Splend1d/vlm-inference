The president of the bank has told us that most of the State banks exist by its forbearance. Should its influence become concentrated, as it may under the operation of such an act as this, in the hands of a self-elected directory whose interests are identified with those of the foreign stockholders, will there not be cause to tremble for the purity of our elections in peace and for the independence of our country in war? Their power would be great whenever they might choose to exert it; but if this monopoly were regularly renewed every fifteen or twenty years on terms proposed by themselves, they might seldom in peace put forth their strength to influence elections or control the affairs of the nation. But if any private citizen or public functionary should interpose to curtail its powers or prevent a renewal of its privileges, it cannot be doubted that he would be made to feel its influence.\"\nPresident Andrew Jackson, Veto of the Bank of the United States, 1832\nWhich of the following events most directly caused the formation of the Second Bank of the United States?\n\nA.

Efforts by Alexander Hamilton to stabilize the national economy\n\nAlexander Hamilton, the first Secretary of the Treasury, advocated for the creation of a national bank to help stabilize the nation's financial system after the American Revolution. The First Bank of the United States, established in 1791, played a crucial role in stabilizing the economy, managing federal debt, and facilitating the nation's economic growth. However, it faced opposition from President Thomas Jefferson and his Democratic-Republican Party, which led to its charter expiration in 1804.\n\nFollowing the War of 1812 and the subsequent financial challenges, the need for a stable banking system became evident again. President James Madison, influenced by Hamiltonian principles, supported the establishment of a second national bank. This led to the passage of the Second Bank of the United States Act in 1816, which created the Second Bank of the United States, led by Nicholas Biddle. The bank continued to play a significant role in the nation's financial system until it was dissolved by President Andrew Jackson in 1836 due to political disagreements over its powers and influence."
