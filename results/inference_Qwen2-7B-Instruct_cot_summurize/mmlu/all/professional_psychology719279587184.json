They are used for ordinal and nominal data\n\nParametric tests are typically used when the data is assumed to follow a specific distribution (usually the normal distribution. These tests make assumptions about the population parameters, such as the mean and variance. Ordinal and nominal data, however, do not have numerical values that can be used in these calculations. Ordinal data has a natural order, but the differences between the categories cannot be quantified, while nominal data consists of categories without any intrinsic order.\n\nNonparametric tests, on the other hand, do not assume a specific distribution and can often be applied to ordinal or ranked data. Therefore, it would not be correct to say that parametric tests are used for ordinal and nominal data."
