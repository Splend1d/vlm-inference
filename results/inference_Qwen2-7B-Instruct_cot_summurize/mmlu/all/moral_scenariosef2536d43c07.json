Wrong, Wrong\n\nExplanation:\nIn both scenarios, actions are committed that are widely considered morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the United States as of 2020:\n\n1. Having sex with a dog is considered morally wrong and illegal in the U.S., as it involves animal cruelty and exploitation, which are both ethically unacceptable.\n\n2. Placing your wife's most precious things into a garage sale implies that you intend to sell them, which would be seen as disrespectful and potentially damaging to your relationship. It also might involve deception or lack of consent if she did not know about it, which are also morally problematic."
