                    "text": "A retailer agreed to purchase an orchard's total cherry production for a 12-month period. The contract included this provision: \"Terms: Cash upon delivery \u0080\u0094 deliveries to be made at least twice per month.\" The deliveries went as scheduled. At the beginning of the fifth month, the orchard sent notice to the retailer that a load of cherries was ready for pick up. The truck driver, however, forgot to take the retailer's check with him. The orchard turned over the cherries but advised the retailer to pay within three days. The retailer sent the check by mail but it arrived late by two days. The orchard refused to deliver any more cherries. The retailer sued the orchard for breach of the installment contract and demanded the difference in price between the cherries on the open market and what he would have paid under the contract. The orchard claimed that the delayed payment impaired the value of the contract and moved to dismiss. Will the court grant the orchard's motion to dismiss?\n\nA. Yes, the agreement called for cash at delivery, which was not done when the driver forgot to deliver the check.\nB. Yes, the failure to make an installment on time was a breach because time is of the essence in all installment agreements.\nC. No, there is always a grace period of ten days for any single payment pertaining to an installment contract.\nD. No, the delay in one payment under these facts was not enough to impair the value of the contract under the Uniform Commercial Code.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is D. No, the delay in one payment under these facts was not enough to impair the value of the contract under the Uniform Commercial Code.\n\nIn the context of installment contracts, the Uniform Commercial Code ( UCC) generally recognizes that installment sales agreements are conditional sales contracts. Under the UCC, time may or may not be of the essence depending on the contract terms. If the contract specifically states that time is of the essence, then a single late payment could indeed be considered a material breach entitling the seller to terminate the contract. However, if the contract does not explicitly state that time is of the essence, the seller might still have to provide notice of default and a reasonable opportunity to cure before terminating the contract.\n\nIn this scenario, since the contract mentions \"cash upon delivery\" and deliveries were made at least twice per month without issues, it suggests that the retailer has been adhering to the payment terms despite the specific mention of cash upon delivery. The fact that the retailer sent the check by mail, albeit late by two days, indicates an attempt to fulfill the payment obligation. The retailer's action of sending the check suggests they intended to pay according to the contract terms.\n\nGiven that the orchard refused to deliver any more cherries after the retailer sent the late payment, it seems the orchard perceived the payment delay as a significant breach of the contract, possibly due to the specific language about cash upon delivery. However, without explicit evidence that the contract makes time of the essence or that the orchard provided a reasonable notice period for the retailer to rectify the delay, the court might rule that the delay in one payment did not impair the value of the contract sufficiently to justify immediate termination.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided and the general principles of installment contracts under the Uniform Commercial Code, the court is unlikely to grant the orchard's motion to dismiss the retailer's claim. The retailer could potentially argue that the delay was minor and that the contract was not breached to the extent that it justified the immediate cessation of further deliveries."
