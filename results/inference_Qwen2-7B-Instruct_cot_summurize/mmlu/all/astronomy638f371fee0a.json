As the solar nebula cooled, heavier elements like metals (iron, nickel, etc.) sank towards the center due to gravity, forming the cores of the terrestrial planets. This process is known as core differentiation. The molten state allowed these heavier materials to migrate towards the center, accumulating to form the dense cores we see today."
