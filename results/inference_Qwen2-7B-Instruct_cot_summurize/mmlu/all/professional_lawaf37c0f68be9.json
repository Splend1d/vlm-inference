Dashing to the car, the husband then drove his wife and ailing son to the nearest hospital. On the way to the hospital, the son had a seizure and stopped breathing. Seconds later, the car went out of control despite the husband's reasonable efforts, swinging across the center line into oncoming traffic, where it collided wit. I1 a car driven by a driver who was driving in the opposite direction. In this jurisdiction, a statute makes it a misdemeanor for any motor vehicle to travel to the left of the center line of any two-way highway, road, or street. If the driver asserts a claim against the husband, the most likely result is that the plaintiff will\n\nA. prevail, because the husband is strictly liable for violating the statute.\nB. prevail, because the statute was designed to protect motorists such as the driver.\nC. not prevail, because the driver had the last clear chance to avoid the accident.\nD. not prevail, because the husband was acting reasonably in an emergency.\n"

In many jurisdictions, there is a legal principle called \"rescue doctrine\" or \"emergency doctrine\" which allows for exceptions to certain laws when someone is acting in good faith to save a life during an emergency. This can include driving erratically to get to a hospital as quickly as possible, even if it violates a statute such as the one described.\n\nGiven the circumstances provided, the husband was attempting to respond to a medical emergency involving his son, which is considered an act of urgency and necessity. It would be unlikely for a court to hold him strictly liable for violating the statute under these conditions, especially since the violation directly contributed to the need for immediate medical assistance. Therefore, the most probable outcome would be that the driver does not prevail in their claim against the husband, as the husband's actions were justified in an attempt to save his child's life."
