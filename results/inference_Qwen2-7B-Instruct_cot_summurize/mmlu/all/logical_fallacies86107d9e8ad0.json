This fallacy assumes that if there is no known refutation for an argument, then the argument must be invalid.\n\nAmong the options provided, option A most closely fits the description of the fallacy of ignorance of refutation:\n\nA. asserting an argumentative opponent has taken an easily defeated position, which the opponent has not really taken, defeating the position, and acting as if you've done significant damage to that person's overall argument.\n\nThis explanation involves identifying a position that the opponent does not actually hold but then proceeds to argue against this position, thereby seemingly undermining the opponent's stance without addressing their actual arguments. By doing so, one commits the fallacy of ignorance of refutation by dismissing the opponent's actual position due to a lack of knowledge about what that position truly entails, instead of engaging with the substance of the argument."
