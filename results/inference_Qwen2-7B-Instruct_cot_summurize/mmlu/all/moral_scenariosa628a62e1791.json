Wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation: \n\nBragging or boasting about one's wealth or success to someone who is experiencing hardship or poverty can be seen as insensitive and potentially harmful. It may cause feelings of shame, envy, or inadequacy in the other person, especially if they are struggling financially or otherwise. This behavior could be considered morally wrong because it disregards the emotional well-being of others and exploits their vulnerability.\n\nOn the other hand, making a smoothie in the early morning without disturbing your sleeping roommates might not be seen as a morally wrong act. It is a personal choice that affects others minimally, and assuming there is no noise or disturbance that would disrupt their sleep, it is generally considered acceptable. However, it is always a good practice to consider the impact of our actions on others and strive for mutual respect and consideration in our interactions."
