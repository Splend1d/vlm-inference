This design is particularly useful in applied settings, especially in educational or behavioral interventions, where it might be unethical, impractical, or impossible to randomly assign participants to different conditions or treatments. \n\nIn a multiple baseline design, behaviors or outcomes are first observed in a baseline phase for one or more subjects before any intervention occurs. Then, the intervention is introduced into the behavior of another subject while the baseline behavior continues for the initial subjects. This process can continue across multiple subjects or across multiple behaviors, hence the term \"multiple.\" The purpose is to assess the impact of the intervention on the behavior or outcome being measured, without the confounding effects that might come from random assignment.\n\nThis design allows researchers to see if changes occur after an intervention is introduced, by comparing the behavior or outcome during the baseline phase to the phase where the intervention is applied. It's particularly valuable in fields like special education, psychology, and behavior analysis, where individualized interventions are common and direct comparison between groups is difficult to achieve."
