Rigorous exercise\n\nWhile rigorous exercise can be beneficial for overall health and well-being, there is not strong evidence to suggest that it has been shown to be an effective standalone treatment for depression in older adults. However, it may complement other treatments such as therapy or medication.\n\nB. Life review: This technique involves helping individuals reflect on their past experiences, which can enhance their sense of meaning and purpose. It has been found to be effective in improving mood and reducing symptoms of depression in some studies.\n\nC. Mental stimulation: Engaging in mentally challenging activities, such as puzzles, reading, or learning new skills, can help maintain cognitive function and improve mood in older adults. Studies have shown that mental stimulation may contribute to a reduced risk of depression.\n\nD. Anti-depressant drugs: These medications have been widely studied and prescribed for treating depression in older adults. They can be effective in managing depressive symptoms when used appropriately under medical supervision."
