The efferent limb of the pupillary light reflex is not carried in the optic nerve. Instead, it involves cranial nerves III (oculomotor nerve and VII (facial nerve.\n\nC. The pupillary light reflex is not a consensual reflex. A consensual reflex involves both pupils reacting simultaneously to light in one eye, whereas the pupillary light reflex involves only one pupil reacting to light presented to either eye.\n\nD. The afferent limb of the pupillary light reflex is carried in the optic nerve, not the oculomotor nerve. The afferent limb detects the change in light intensity and sends signals through the optic nerve to the brainstem for processing."
