The defendant purchased a ski mask and then went into the liquor store, put his gun into the face of the clerk, and demanded the money from the register. Terrified, the clerk gave him the money from the register. The defendant pocketed the money, grabbed a bottle of tequila off the shelf for his celebration, and then ran back to the car and drove off. About an hour later, the defendant was slowly approaching his hideout in the outskirts of town when a young child suddenly darted in front of the defendant's car. He applied the brakes but couldn't stop in time. The car struck the child, killing her. For the child's death, the defendant should be found guilty of which, if any, of the following crimes?\n\nA. Felony murder.\nB. Involuntary manslaughter.\nC. Voluntary manslaughter.\nD. No crime.\n"

                    "text": "The defendant's actions leading to the child's death would likely be considered under the concept of \"felony murder\" or \"involuntary manslaughter,\" depending on the specifics of how the law is defined in the jurisdiction where this incident took place. Felony murder laws hold that a person can be charged with murder if someone dies during the commission of a felony, even if the death was unintentional. Involuntary manslaughter typically refers to a killing that occurs due to reckless behavior or criminal negligence, without the intent to kill.\n\nGiven the context provided:\n\n1. The defendant was engaged in a planned felony (robbery of a liquor store) at the time of the incident.\n2. The death occurred unintentionally while the defendant was driving away from the scene.\n3. The defendant's actions (driving recklessly, not stopping in time - could be seen as grossly negligent.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, the death caused by the defendant's reckless driving after committing a felony might fall under the felony murder rule, which does not require proof of intent to kill. However, it's important to note that the specific legal implications can vary significantly based on local laws and the interpretation of those laws by the court system.\n\nTherefore, based on the information given, the most appropriate answer would likely be:\n\nA. Felony murder.\n\nThis conclusion assumes that the jurisdiction recognizes a felony murder rule that applies when a death occurs during the commission of a felony, regardless of the intent to kill. However, it's crucial to consult the specific laws of the jurisdiction in question for a definitive answer."
