The first verse from the Qur'an (Sura 5:89) is a prohibition against alcohol, games of chance, and idol worship, reflecting Islamic teachings and practices. The second verse from the Rub\u00e1iy\u00e1t of Omar Khayy\u00e1m suggests a more permissive attitude towards these activities, as seen in some Persian or Islamic societies where such practices might have been more widely accepted or even celebrated.\n\nA comparison between these two verses does not support the other options:\n\nA. Many Muslims inclined toward atheism in the premodern era. This statement is not supported by the information provided; rather, it seems to imply a lack of faith, which is not evident from the verses given.\n\nC. Christian missionaries were steadily winning converts among Muslim populations. The verses do not provide any information about missionary activities or conversions between religions.\n\nD. Muslim intellectuals were generally hostile to traditional religious practice. While the Qur'anic verse presents a clear prohibition, the Rub\u00e1iy\u00e1t does not necessarily reflect the views of all Muslim intellectuals, nor does it provide evidence for widespread hostility to traditional religious practices among them.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate conclusion based on the information provided is that religious restrictions were not universally observed by all Muslims, as evidenced by the differing attitudes expressed in the two verses."
