Duty to the client: This involves ensuring that the practitioner acts in the best interest of the client, providing competent services, maintaining appropriate confidentiality, and avoiding conflicts of interest.\n\nB. Confidentiality: This principle requires practitioners to protect the privacy of their clients' information and only disclose it under specific circumstances as outlined by law or ethical guidelines.\n\nC. Duty to the profession: This refers to upholding the standards and reputation of the profession through adherence to ethical codes, continuing education, and maintaining high levels of competence.\n\nD. Legal defensibility: While important, this principle focuses on ensuring that one's actions can withstand legal scrutiny, which is more of a practical consideration rather than an overarching ethical principle.\n\nIn many professional settings, especially in psychology, law, and medicine, \"Duty to the client\" might be considered the most fundamental ethical principle, as it directly impacts the quality of service and trust between the practitioner and the client. However, the specific hierarchy or emphasis of these principles can vary depending on the field and the ethical codes governing that profession."
