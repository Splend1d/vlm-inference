Transition metals all have a minimum of two unpaired electrons.\n\nTransition metals, which are in groups 3-12 on the periodic table, typically have d-orbitals that can hold multiple electrons. This allows them to easily form compounds by losing one or more of these d-electrons, often resulting in a +2 oxidation state. The presence of at least two unpaired electrons in the d-orbitals is a key factor in this behavior."
