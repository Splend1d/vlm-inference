The painter telephoned a handyman who had done painting work for the painter in the past, and asked if he would be willing to paint the homeowner's house for him. The painter said that if the handyman would paint the house, the handyman could keep the $10,000 that the homeowner promised to pay. The handyman agreed. The next day, the handyman went to the homeowner's house to begin the painting job. The homeowner had already left for work, so the handyman began to paint the house. When the homeowner arrived home that evening, he saw the handyman painting his house. Confused, the homeowner asked the handyman why he was doing the painting instead of the painter. The handyman told the homeowner of the arrangement he had with the painter. Although the handyman was only 50% finished with the painting, the homeowner told the handyman to immediately get off his land, so the handyman left. If the handyman brings an action against the homeowner, he will most likely\n\nA. recover for unjust enrichment.\nB. recover under the doctrine of substantial performance.\nC. not recover, because his arrangement with the painter was not in writing.\nD. not recover, because there was no contract between the handyman and the homeowner.\n"

The agreement between the painter and the handyman does not create a contractual relationship between the handyman and the homeowner. The homeowner is not obligated to pay the handyman under the terms of that agreement since they did not enter into it directly. Therefore, the handyman would not likely recover from the homeowner based on any legal theory such as unjust enrichment or substantial performance, as these theories generally apply when there is a contract in place between the parties involved."
