To determine the number of real roots, we can use the Intermediate Value Theorem and Descartes's Rule of Signs.\n\n**Descartes's Rule of Signs:**\n\n1. **Positive Roots:** Count the number of sign changes in the coefficients of the terms when the polynomial is written in descending order. For \\(2x^5 + 8x - 7\\), there is one sign change (from \\(+8x\\) to \\(-7\\). This means there is exactly one positive root.\n\n2. **Negative Roots:** Substitute \\(-x\\) for \\(x\\) and count the sign changes in the new polynomial. So, \\(f(-x) = -2x^5 - 8x - 7\\). There are no sign changes, indicating there are zero negative roots.\n\nHowever, Descartes's Rule of Signs only gives us an upper bound on the number of positive and negative roots and does not guarantee the exact number. It tells us that there is at least one positive root but no negative roots.\n\n**Intermediate Value Theorem:**\n\nTo find if there are any real roots, we evaluate the function at different points to see if it changes signs, which would indicate a root between those points.\n\n- At \\(x = 0\\), \\(f(0) = -7\\).\n- As \\(x\\) approaches \\(\\pm\\infty\\), \\(f(x)\\) will approach \\(\\pm\\infty\\) depending on the sign of the leading coefficient. Since the leading term is \\(2x^5\\), as \\(x\\) becomes very large, \\(f(x)\\) becomes very large and positive, and as \\(x\\) becomes very small (negative, \\(f(x)\\) becomes very large and negative.\n\nGiven these evaluations, since \\(f(x)\\) changes from negative to positive as \\(x\\) increases, there must be at least one real root by the Intermediate Value Theorem.\n\nSince Descartes's Rule of Signs indicates there is exactly one positive root and no negative roots, and considering the behavior of the polynomial, it's clear that there is **exactly one real root**.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **B. One**."
