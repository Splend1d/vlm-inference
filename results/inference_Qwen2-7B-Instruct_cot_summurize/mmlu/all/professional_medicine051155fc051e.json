Results show an increased incidence of upper respiratory tract infections among these students during finals week. It is hypothesized that the stress of studying for examinations adversely affects the immune system, making the students more susceptible to infection. Which of the following laboratory findings in these students during examination week is most likely to support this hypothesis?\n\nA. Decreased AM serum cortisol concentration\nB. Decreased macrophage activity\nC. Increased basophil count\nD. Increased lymphocyte count\n"

Decreased macrophage activity\n\nMacrophages are part of the innate immune system and play a critical role in the body's defense against infections by engulfing and digesting pathogens and cellular debris. When stress occurs, it can lead to a decrease in macrophage activity due to the release of stress hormones such as cortisol. This decreased activity could make the body more susceptible to infections, supporting the hypothesis that stress affects the immune system.\n\nThe other options are less likely to directly support this hypothesis:\n\nA. Decreased AM ( morning cortisol concentration - Cortisol is often associated with the body's stress response. While low cortisol levels might suggest stress, it doesn't necessarily indicate a specific immune function issue.\n\nC. Increased basophil count - Basophils are involved in allergic reactions rather than fighting infections directly. An increase in their number might be indicative of an allergic reaction or inflammation, not specifically related to the immune response to infection under stress conditions.\n\nD. Increased lymphocyte count - Lymphocytes are important components of the adaptive immune system. An increase in lymphocyte count might suggest the body is responding to an infection or stress, but it doesn't necessarily imply a decrease in immune function."
