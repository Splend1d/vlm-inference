Therefore, the correct answer is closest to option A but not exactly as stated in the choices provided:\n\nPluto has:\n- Charon ( which is significantly larger than Pluto's other moons and essentially a binary system with Pluto.\n- Nix and Hydra, which are smaller moons discovered in 2005.\n- Kerberos, discovered in 2011, which is among the smallest known moons in our solar system.\n- Styx, discovered in 2015, which is also quite small.\n\nSo, the most accurate choice from the given options would be:\n\nA. one medium sized satellite ( (Charon) and two small satellites ( (Nix and Hydra). \n\nHowever, it's important to note that Pluto does not have a \"medium-sized\" moon; Charon is considered significant enough to be considered a satellite rather than Pluto's \"medium-sized\" moon."
