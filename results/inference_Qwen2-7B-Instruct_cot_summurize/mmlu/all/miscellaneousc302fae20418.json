This nickname comes from its historical association with royalty and nobility, particularly in Europe during the 15th and 16th centuries when syphilis was first recognized as a distinct disease. The term \"disease of kings\" likely stems from the higher rates of infection among the wealthy and powerful who had more frequent contact with infected individuals, often through prostitution or as a result of their social status."
