A pedestrian was struck by the defendant's car as she was crossing the street and was seriously injured. A criminal complaint was filed against the defendant and, at trial, he testified that he did not intend to injure anyone, but admitted that he was indifferent as to the consequences of driving recklessly.

Since there was no specific intent to kill (as implied by the term \"murder\" in option A), and the injury was unintentional, options C (assault with intent to cause serious bodily injury, and D battery, which involve intentional harm, do not fit the scenario described. Attempted manslaughter focuses on reckless conduct that leads to serious injury without the intent to kill, which aligns with the defendant's testimony and actions."
