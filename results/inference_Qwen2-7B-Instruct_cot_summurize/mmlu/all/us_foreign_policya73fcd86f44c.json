Both can be viewed as different means of achieving the same liberal ends\n\nExceptionalism, in the context of U.S. foreign policy, refers to the belief that the United States has unique responsibilities and capabilities due to its political system, military strength, economic power, and cultural influence. This belief can manifest in both isolationist and internationalist strategies.\n\nIsolationism is a policy of avoiding involvement in external affairs, particularly in military conflicts or alliances. From an exceptionalist perspective, an isolationist strategy might be seen as a way for the U.S. to maintain its status as a global leader by selectively engaging only when it has significant leverage or when its national interests are directly threatened. Exceptionalism here supports the idea that the U.S. should lead by example, setting standards for others, even if this means not being involved in every international issue.\n\nInternationalism, on the other hand, involves active engagement in global affairs. An internationalist approach from an exceptionalist standpoint could mean using the country's unique capabilities to promote democratic values, human rights, and economic stability worldwide. Exceptionalism justifies such engagement by arguing that the U.S.'s superior resources and influence should be used to shape the international order in ways that benefit not only the U.S. but also the global community.\n\nIn both cases, the underlying liberal ends\u2014such as democracy, free markets, and human rights\u2014are pursued, albeit through different means. Isolationism seeks to preserve the U.S.'s position as a global leader through selective engagement, while internationalism actively promotes these ideals globally. Thus, exceptionalism can link these two strategies by providing a rationale for their use based on the belief in the U.S.'s unique role and responsibility in the world."
