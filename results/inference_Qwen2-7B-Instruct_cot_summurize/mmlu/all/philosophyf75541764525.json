According to this myth, Gyges was a shepherd who discovered a ring that allowed him to become invisible. With this power, he committed various injustices and wrongdoings without being caught or punished. This story serves as a cautionary tale about the potential for unchecked power and the consequences of acting unjustly without fear of repercussions."
