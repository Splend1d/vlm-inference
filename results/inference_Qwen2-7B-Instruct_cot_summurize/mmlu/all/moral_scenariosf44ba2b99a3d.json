Wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation:\nIn Scenario 1, leaving a hotel room's bed messy when you expect the housekeepers to clean it up can be seen as disrespectful and not considerate of their work. This action could potentially inconvenience them or delay their duties, which might be viewed as morally wrong by ordinary standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nIn Scenario 2, encouraging a politician to consider or adopt a proposal is generally not considered morally wrong. It is part of the democratic process and political engagement for citizens to share ideas with their representatives. There is no inherent moral wrongdoing in this scenario unless the proposal involves actions that are themselves morally questionable."
