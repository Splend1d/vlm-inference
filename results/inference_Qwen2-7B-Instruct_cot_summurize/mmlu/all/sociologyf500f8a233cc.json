They may include environmentalism, human rights, gender equality, civil liberties, and other causes that resonate with individuals' personal values or cultural identities. While economic interests still play a significant role in political mobilization, the rise of new social movements highlights the increasing importance of non-economic factors in shaping public opinion and driving political action."
