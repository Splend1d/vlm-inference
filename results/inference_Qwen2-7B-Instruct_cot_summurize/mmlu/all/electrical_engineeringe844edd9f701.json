So, if you consider any small segment of the wire in the circular loop, the magnetic field would be perpendicular to that segment as well as perpendicular to the plane of the loop. This is due to the right-hand rule: if you point your thumb in the direction of the current, your fingers curl in the direction of the magnetic field. Since the wire is circular, this rule applies consistently around the entire loop."
