The iMac was originally introduced in 1998 and came in a few different bright colors including:\n\n- Blue\n- Green ( often referred to as \"Kiwi\" color\n- Pink ( often referred to as \"Strawberry\" color\n- Orange\n\nHowever, \"Tangerine\" is not listed among the original colors of the first iMacs. The correct answer would be A. Tangerine. It's possible that this question is based on a specific time frame or a limited edition model that might not have been widely released or is not part of the general knowledge base for the original iMac release.\n\nApple has released various special edition and limited edition iMacs with different colors over the years, so it's always good to check the specific context of the question if it's related to a particular year or event."
