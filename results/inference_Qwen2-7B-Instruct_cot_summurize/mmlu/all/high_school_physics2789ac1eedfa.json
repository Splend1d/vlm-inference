It would oscillate back and forth from one opening to the other indefinitely.\n\nIn this scenario, assuming no friction or air resistance and considering only the gravitational force pulling the object towards the Earth's center, the object would indeed accelerate as it falls towards the Earth's core due to gravity. However, upon reaching the center, it would experience a change in direction because the gravitational forces from both sides of the Earth would act equally on it but in opposite directions. This means that once the object reaches the center, it would start moving away from the center at the same acceleration it had when it was falling towards it. \n\nGiven that the gravitational force is proportional to the distance from the center of the Earth (F = -G * M1 * M2 / r^2 ( where F is the force, G is the gravitational constant, M1 and M2 are the masses (and here we assume they are equal since we're talking about the Earth), the force acting on the object would decrease as it moves away from the center of the Earth. When the object reaches the surface on the other side, it would have lost most of its kinetic energy to the gravitational potential energy it gained by going through the Earth, so it would not just \"fly off\" into space but would instead oscillate back and forth between the two openings due to the continuous balance of gravitational forces from both sides of the Earth."
