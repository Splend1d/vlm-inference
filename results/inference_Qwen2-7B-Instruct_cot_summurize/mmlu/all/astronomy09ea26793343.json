                    "text": "The correct answer is C. The sky appears blue because the Earth's atmosphere preferentially scatters short wavelengths, particularly in the blue and violet range of the light spectrum. This phenomenon is known as Rayleigh scattering. \n\nMolecules and small particles in the atmosphere scatter light in all directions when sunlight passes through them. Shorter wavelengths (like blue and violet) are scattered more efficiently than longer wavelengths like red and orange. This is why the sky looks blue during the daytime, especially at sunset and sunrise when the light has to travel through more of the Earth's atmosphere to reach your eyes, causing even more scattering of the shorter wavelengths.\n\nOptions A, B, and D are not accurate:\n\nA. The Earth's atmosphere does not have a blue-ish color; it is transparent to visible light.\nB. The sky does not reflect the color of the Earth's oceans; it is the scattered light from the atmosphere that gives the sky its color.\nD. The Earth's atmosphere does not preferentially absorb all other colors; it absorbs some wavelengths (like infrared and ultraviolet) more than others, but it doesn't absorb blue light completely."
