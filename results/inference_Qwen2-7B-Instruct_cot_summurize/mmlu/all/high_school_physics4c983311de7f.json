The vertical speed decreases on the way up and increases on the way down.\n\nExplanation:\n- A. This statement is incorrect because the acceleration due to gravity acts downwards, always opposite to the vertical component of the velocity, not opposite to the velocity vector in general. The horizontal component of velocity remains constant throughout the flight.\n- B. This statement is incorrect because the speed at the top of the trajectory is not zero; it is actually the horizontal component of the initial velocity since there is no vertical component (the vertical velocity becomes zero at the peak.\n- C. This statement is incorrect because the total kinetic energy (and thus the total speed) changes due to the loss of potential energy into kinetic energy and back as the projectile rises and falls.\n- D. This statement is correct because the vertical component of velocity ( \\(v_y = v_0 \\sin(\\theta)\\), where \\(v_0\\) is the initial velocity and \\(\\theta\\) is the launch angle, changes direction but its magnitude changes with time due to the constant downward acceleration of gravity. It decreases as the projectile ascends and then increases as it descends.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D."
