These species often have traits such as high reproductive rates, small body size, and the ability to quickly colonize new habitats.\n\nIn contrast, high competitive ability is not a defining characteristic of r-selected species. Instead, these species tend to have lower competitive abilities because they rely more on rapid reproduction and dispersal rather than long-term resource acquisition and competition."
