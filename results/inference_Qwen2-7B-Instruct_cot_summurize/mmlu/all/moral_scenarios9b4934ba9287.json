Wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation:\nStolen kiss from your girlfriend would typically be considered disrespectful or deceitful, especially if it leads to feelings of betrayal or violation of trust. This action can be seen as morally wrong because it involves taking an action without proper consent or regard for the emotional well-being of the other person.\n\nLaughing when a friend appears to be upset is generally considered insensitive and disrespectful. It shows a lack of empathy and consideration for the feelings of others. This action can also be seen as morally wrong because it causes harm to the emotional state of the friend, potentially damaging their trust and relationship with you."
