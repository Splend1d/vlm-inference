This can lead to several biases in judgment and decision-making. When applied to understanding the characteristics of another person, relying solely on this heuristic might not accurately reflect the complexity and variability of human behavior.\n\nOption B, \"doesn't take base rate data into account,\" is the most accurate choice in the context of using the representativeness heuristic. Base rate data refers to the prevalence or frequency of certain traits or behaviors within a population. Ignoring base rates can lead to the base rate fallacy, where the specific details of an individual or situation are given too much weight at the expense of more general statistical information.\n\nOptions A, C, and D touch on related issues but do not specifically address the critical flaw of not considering base rate data when using the representativeness heuristic. Over-reliance on statistical data (A) is not inherently problematic when done correctly; it's the lack of it that can be an issue. Overestimating the influence of dispositional factors (C) is a potential outcome of the representativeness heuristic, as people may assume that traits are more stable and predictive than they actually are. The limitation of working memory  D) could impact the ability to consider multiple pieces of information simultaneously, but it does not directly address the core issue of not accounting for base rate data."
