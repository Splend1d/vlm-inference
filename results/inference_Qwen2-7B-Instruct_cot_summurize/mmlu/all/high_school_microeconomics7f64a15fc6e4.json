Opportunity costs or implicit costs of a \"Mom & Pop\"-owned business are equal to earnings or profits that could have occurred using resources elsewhere. \n\nImplicit costs, also known as opportunity costs, refer to the potential income that an owner of a business could earn if they were to use their resources (like time, money, or assets) in alternative ways. For instance, if Mom and Pop own a business but could have potentially earned more by investing in stocks, real estate, or another venture, the difference in potential earnings represents the implicit cost.\n\nAccounting costs, on the other hand, refer to the actual monetary expenses incurred by the business, while accounting profits are calculated by subtracting explicit costs ( (like wages, rent, and utilities) from revenue. Earnings or profits that occurred for Mom & Pop's business would be reflected in their accounting profits, not necessarily their implicit costs."
