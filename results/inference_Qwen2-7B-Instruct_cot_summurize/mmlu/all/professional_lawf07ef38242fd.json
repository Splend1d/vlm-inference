The trapped hook caused her to cough blood uncontrollably, and she was rushed to a hospital for emergency surgery. The restaurant later defended the customer's lawsuit by showing that it had done everything reasonable to eliminate foreign objects from its product and there was no negligence. Will the lawsuit be dismissed and judgment entered for the restaurant?\n\nA. No, because even without negligence there is strict liability imposed for selling an unreasonably dangerous product.\nB. Yes, because a customer voluntarily assumes the foreseeable risk that fish will contain metal fish hooks.\nC. Yes, because customers are expected to know that a fish sandwich will often have foreign objects in it.\nD. No, because the seller did not post a warning that its fish might contain fish hooks.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer would likely be B. Yes, because a customer voluntarily assumes the foreseeable risk that fish will contain metal fish hooks.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, when consuming food products, consumers implicitly accept the risks associated with the natural contents of the food (like bones or seeds). Fish, by nature, can contain small foreign objects such as bones or, in this case, fish hooks. Therefore, if the restaurant has taken reasonable steps to minimize the presence of these hazards, it may be argued that they cannot be held liable for any injuries resulting from the consumption of their product under the assumption of risk doctrine.\n\nHowever, this answer is highly dependent on the specific laws and legal doctrines of the jurisdiction where the incident occurred. Other factors could include whether the hook was a hidden defect, the reasonable foreseeability of such an occurrence, and whether there were any specific warnings given about the potential for hooks in their fish sandwiches. It would also depend on the specifics of the restaurant's policies regarding cleanliness and foreign objects, and whether those policies were followed. \n\nLegal decisions like this can be complex and nuanced, and often involve detailed examination of evidence and interpretation of applicable law by judges and juries."
