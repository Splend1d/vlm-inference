                    "text": "Pence's main objective in the article \"Will Cloning Harm People?\" is to argue against the use of consequentialist arguments as a basis for determining the morality of cloning. Consequentialism is a moral theory that suggests an action is right if it produces good outcomes, and wrong if it produces bad outcomes. In the context of cloning, some proponents of the technology argue that its benefits outweigh any potential harms.\n\nHowever, Pence objects to this approach, suggesting that consequentialist arguments might not be the most appropriate framework to evaluate the ethical implications of cloning. Instead, he likely employs Kantian ethics, which focuses on the intrinsic moral worth of actions based on whether they respect the dignity of individuals involved (this is often referred to as the 'humanity formulation' or the 'categorical imperative'). According to Kantian ethics, one should act only according to that maxim whereby you can, at the same time, will that it should become a universal law.\n\nThus, the correct answer would be:\n\nC. to use Kant's's humanity formulation to show that cloning is immoral\n\nThis interpretation assumes that Pence argues that cloning does not respect the dignity and autonomy of human beings, which is a common criticism from those who oppose cloning on ethical grounds."
