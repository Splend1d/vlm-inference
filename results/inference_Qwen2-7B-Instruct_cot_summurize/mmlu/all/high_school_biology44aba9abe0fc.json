The wings of a bird and those of an insect\n\nExplanation: Homologous structures are features that have similar structures and development but may serve different functions in different organisms. These are typically the result of common ancestry. The wings of a bat and the arms of a human, the hemoglobin of a baboon and that of a gorilla, and the mitochondria of a plant and those of an animal are all examples of homologous structures because they share a common ancestor. However, wings of a bird and those of an insect are not homologous because they are both evolved independently for flight from a common ancestor that did not fly. They have similar functions (flight) but they are not homologous because they are derived from different ancestral structures."
