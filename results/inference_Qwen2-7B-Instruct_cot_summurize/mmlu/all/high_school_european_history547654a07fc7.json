The genius of Napoleon is astounding. All branches of human knowledge seemed alike familiar to his gigantic mind. His conversations at St. Helena, scattered through the numerous and voluminous memorials of those who gleaned them, are replete with intensest interest. During the long agony of his imprisonment and his death, he conversed with perfect freedom upon the events of his marvelous career, and upon all those subjects or morals, politics, and religion, which most deeply concern the welfare of our race. There is no mind which will not be invigorated by familiarity with these profound thoughts, expressed with so much glow of feeling and energy of diction.\n\u2014John S. C. Abbott, historian, Napoleon at St. Helena, 1855\nNapoleon helped make the French Revolution an international movement in the areas he conquered\n\nA. By imposing a universal currency based on the French franc\nB. By the brutal suppression of guerrilla resistance\nC. By abolishing feudalism and manorialism\nD. By encouraging the use of French as the universal language\n"

                    "text": "The excerpt from John S. C. Abbott's book \"Napoleon at St. Helena\" does not provide information about Napoleon's actions related to making the French Revolution an international movement in the areas he conquered. Therefore, it is impossible to determine whether the statement is true or false based on the given information.\n\nHowever, regarding the options provided:\n\nA. Imposing a universal currency based on the French franc: This was not a significant aspect of Napoleon's policies during his conquests. He did introduce a new monetary system in France, but there is no evidence that he tried to impose this system universally across the territories he conquered.\n\nB. Brutal suppression of guerrilla resistance: While Napoleon's military campaigns often involved harsh tactics against resistance movements, there is no specific mention of this action contributing to the internationalization of the French Revolution.\n\nC. Abolishing feudalism and manorialism: Napoleon did indeed carry out reforms that abolished feudalism and manorialism in the territories he conquered, aiming to establish a more centralized and modern administration. This could have had some impact on spreading revolutionary ideas, as it aligned with the principles of the French Revolution, such as equality and the abolition of privileges.\n\nD. Encouraging the use of French as the universal language: There is no evidence that Napoleon actively promoted the use of French as a universal language during his conquests. While French became the official language of the Napoleonic Empire, its widespread adoption as a universal language was not a policy directly associated with Napoleon.\n\nWithout further context or information, it is not possible to definitively answer whether the statement is true or false based solely on the provided excerpt. The excerpt focuses on Napoleon's intellectual capabilities and conversations rather than his actions related to the French Revolution's international spread."
