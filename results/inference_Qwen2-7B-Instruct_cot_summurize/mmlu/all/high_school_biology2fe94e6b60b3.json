Change the ratio of phospholipids with double covalent bonds in their tails to those without double covalent bonds in their tails.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe fluidity of the plasma membrane is largely determined by the properties of the phospholipids that make up its bilayer structure. The presence of unsaturated fatty acids (which contain double covalent bonds) in the hydrophobic tails of phospholipids makes them more flexible compared to saturated fatty acids (which do not contain double bonds). In colder environments, increasing the proportion of unsaturated fatty acids can help maintain membrane fluidity and function. Conversely, in warmer temperatures, decreasing this ratio might help reduce excessive fluidity and maintain structural integrity. \n\nOptions A, C, and D are do not directly address the regulation of membrane fluidity in response to temperature changes. Increasing solute concentration ( (A) could lead to osmotic stress rather than affecting membrane fluidity. Replacing phospholipids with glucose ( (C) would disrupt the normal function of the cell membrane. Exchanging phospholipids between the two sides of the membrane ( (D) could potentially affect membrane asymmetry but does not inherently alter the fluidity properties for temperature regulation."
