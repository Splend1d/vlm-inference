It will be located above the equilibrium price. \n\nA price floor is a minimum price set by the government or other regulatory body, which is intended to support producers or certain industries. When a price floor is set above the equilibrium price, it creates a situation where the quantity supplied exceeds the quantity demanded at that price, resulting in a surplus. This is because producers are incentivized to supply more at the higher price, while consumers may demand less."
