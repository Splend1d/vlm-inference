So, it includes items that are reported under the other comprehensive income.\n\nIn this case, the items that contribute to comprehensive income are:\n\n- Net income: $11,000\n- Positive net cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle: $1,000 ( (This would be added as it's a gain)\n- Foreign currency translation adjustment: $2,000 ( (Also added as it's a gain)\n\nThe items that are not included in comprehensive income are:\n\n- Unrealized loss on available-for-sale securities: $3,000 ( (Subtracted as it's a loss)\n- Increase in common stock: $6,000 ( (Not included as it's related to owner's investment)\n\nSo, the calculation for comprehensive income would be:\n\nComprehensive Income = Net Income + Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle + Foreign Currency Translation Adjustment - Unrealized Loss on Securities\n\nComprehensive Income = $11,000 + $1,000 + $2,000 - $3,000\n\nComprehensive Income = $11,000\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **C. $11,000**."
