This indicates that when people engage with information in a way that involves deeper cognitive processing, such as understanding the emotional significance of words, they tend to remember the material better.\n\nIn the context of memory theory, this alignss with the idea of **semantic features** ( being processed more deeply and encoded more meaningfully into long-term memory than **echoic features** ( or **shallow processing** which might involve surface-level encoding without much deeper meaning or context.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer would be:\n\nA. semantic features\n\nThis choice reflects the notion that attending to the deeper, conceptual or associative meanings of words ( in this case, their emotional impact - enhances memory retention compared to focusing only on auditory aspects of the words."
