The price is determined by the forces of supply and demand in the market. Since the price is constant, the average revenue (AR, which is the price per unit sold, also remains constant. Similarly, marginal revenue (MR, which is the additional revenue gained from selling one more unit, is also equal to the price because each additional unit sold fetch the same price as the previous units. Therefore, in a perfectly competitive industry, average revenue equals marginal revenue."
