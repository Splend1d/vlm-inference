Additionally, it goes against the ethical principle of harming others, even indirectly by keeping them in the streets.\n\nOn the other hand, fixing a clogged toilet is generally seen as a responsible and helpful action, especially when one realizes they caused the issue. This scenario does not involve taking anything from someone else or causing intentional harm."
