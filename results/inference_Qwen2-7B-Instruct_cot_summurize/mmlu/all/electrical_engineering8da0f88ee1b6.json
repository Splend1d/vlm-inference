It quantifies how strongly a material opposes the flow of electric current. Different materials have different resistivities, which is why we use various materials for different applications. For example, metals like copper and aluminum have low resistivity and are used in wiring, while materials like rubber and plastic have high resistivity and are used to insulate wires."
