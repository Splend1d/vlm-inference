P is invertible.**\nThis is not necessarily true. For example, consider \\(P\\) as the projection transformation onto a one-dimensional subspace (like projecting \\(\\mathbb{R}^2\\) onto the x-axis. Here, \\(P\\) satisfies \\(P^2 = P\\), but it is not invertible because it \"collapses\" information in a way that loses uniqueness for its output.\n\n**II. P is diagonalizable.**\nWhile this statement might seem plausible at first, it's not guaranteed by the given condition alone. A transformation being idempotent (\\(P^2 = P\\)) does not inherently imply it is diagonalizable. However, it does imply that the eigenvalues of \\(P\\) can only be 0 or 1 ( because if \\(v\\) is an eigenvector of \\(P\\) with eigenvalue \\(\\lambda\\), then \\(Pv = \\lambda v\\) and \\(P^2v = P(Pv) = P(\\lambda v) = \\lambda^2 v\\). Given \\(P^2 = P\\), we have \\(\\lambda^2 v = \\lambda v\\), leading to \\(\\lambda^2 = \\lambda\\), which means \\(\\lambda\\) can only be 0 or 1. This doesn't directly prove diagonalizability but it constrains the possible forms of \\(P\\).\n\n**III. P is either the identity transformation or the zero transformation.**\nThis statement is incorrect based on our counterexample of a projection transformation, which shows \\(P\\) can be neither the identity nor the zero transformation while still satisfying \\(P^2 = P\\).\n\nGiven these analyses, none of the statements I, II, or III must necessarily be true based solely on \\(P^2 = P\\). Therefore, the correct answer is **A. None**."
