The urban middle class\n\nThis is because the urban middle class typically had better access to education and resources compared to other segments of the population, such as rural peasants or members of the clergy. As literacy rates increased across society, the gains would be most pronounced for those who were already more likely to be literate, including the urban middle class.\n\nWhile all segments of the population saw increases in literacy rates over time, the absolute gains would be larger for those who started with higher initial literacy rates, which was more common among the urban middle class due to their greater exposure to education and societal advantages."
