This tactic diverts from the actual issues at hand by focusing on personal traits or actions of the individual rather than addressing the substance of their arguments.\n\nB. Asserting that an opposing arguer has taken an easily defeated position without providing evidence or logical reasoning for why this is so can be misleading and is often used as a straw man fallacy. A straw man argument misrepresents the opponent's position to make it easier to attack.\n\nC. Causing confusion during an argument by a lack of ability to engage in refutation can be seen as a failure to communicate effectively, but it is not typically labeled as a specific argumentative fallacy. It may lead to misunderstandings but does not specifically aim to undermine the argument through deceit or misdirection.\n\nD. Using threats of harm instead of reasoning to gain agreement is a clear violation of ethical norms and can be considered coercion, which is not an argumentative strategy but rather a form of intimidation.\n\nIn summary, while all these approaches can negatively impact an argument's integrity, option A (ignoring arguments and attacking character is directly related to a specific logical fallacy, while options B, C, and D involve different forms of unethical or ineffective communication strategies."
