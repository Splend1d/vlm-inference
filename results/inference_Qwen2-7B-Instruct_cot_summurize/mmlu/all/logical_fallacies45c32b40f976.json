This fallacy occurs when someone claims that something is true simply because it is self-evident, without providing any actual evidence or proof for the claim. The idea is that the truth of the statement is so clear and obvious that no further explanation or evidence is needed. However, this approach often fails to meet the standard of proof required for establishing the validity of a claim."
