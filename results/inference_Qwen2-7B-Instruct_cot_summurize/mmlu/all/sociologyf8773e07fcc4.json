They would come to recognize themselves as a group with common interests and grievances, which would drive them to organize and fight for better conditions.\n\nIt's important to note that Marx did not see this development leading to the working class becoming a \"ruling class\" ( (option D), as he believed capitalism would inevitably be replaced by socialism or communism, where the means of production are owned collectively rather than privately.\n\nOptions B and C ( \"a class by itself\" and \"a class for itself\" are less commonly used formulations but essentially convey the same idea of the working class forming an autonomous entity with its own interests and identity."
