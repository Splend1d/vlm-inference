National program of child immunization\n\nThis choice is correct because a national program of child immunization can lead to a healthier population, reducing mortality rates and increasing the number of people who can contribute to the workforce. This contributes to a permanent increase in a nation's productive capacity.\n\nLet's briefly look at the other options:\n\nA. A decline in the birth rate could potentially decrease the size of the labor force, which might reduce productive capacity if not offset by immigration or improvements in productivity.\n\nB. Declining adult literacy rates limit the skills and knowledge available to the workforce, decreasing productive capacity.\n\nC. Widespread relocation of manufacturing firms to low-wage nations might initially increase exports, but it does not necessarily lead to a permanent increase in a nation's productive capacity within its own borders. Instead, it may lead to a temporary boost in GDP due to foreign investment, but the nation might lose its own industrial base and the associated skills and infrastructure over time."
