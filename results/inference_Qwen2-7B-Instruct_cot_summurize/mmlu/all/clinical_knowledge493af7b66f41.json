                    "text": "The correct answer is A. 2 from glucose and 3 from glycogen.\n\nIn glycolysis, the process of breaking down glucose into pyruvate, two molecules of ATP are produced through substrate-level phosphorylation for each molecule of glucose. Therefore, if you start with one glucose molecule, you'll end up with 2 ATP molecules. \n\nFor glycogen, which is a complex carbohydrate made up of many glucose units, the process is a bit different. Glycogen breakdown starts at the branch points of the glycogen molecule, so it's not as straightforward to calculate the exact number of ATP molecules produced per glucose unit. However, it's generally understood that glycogen breakdown yields more ATP than glucose breakdown because of the energy stored in the branching structure of glycogen. Still, the exact numbers can vary depending on how much energy is used for the breakdown itself and how much is conserved in the final products. Typically, it's estimated that about 4 ATP are produced from the initial stages of glycogen breakdown, but this can be a simplification.\n\nSo, while the precise ATP yield from glycogen is a bit more complex and variable, the statement \"2 from glucose and 3 from glycogen\" is often used as an approximation in educational contexts."
