Some countries have had relatively significant growth rates, but the Democratic Republic of Congo ((DRC) has become poorer than it initially was in 1980.\n\nThe continent of Sub-Saharan Africa has seen a mix of economic performance. While there have been countries that have experienced notable growth, often driven by sectors such as mining, agriculture, and services, the DRC is an example of a country that has faced significant economic challenges. The DRC, despite its vast natural resources, has struggled with political instability, conflict, and poor governance, which have hindered its economic development and contributed to its decline since the 1980s. \n\nIt's important to note that economic conditions can change over time due to various factors including policy reforms, international investment, global market conditions, and natural disasters. Therefore, while this statement was accurate as of 2020, it might not reflect current or future economic situations without further updates."
