                    "text": "Wellman's argument primarily revolves around the implications of holding to unlimited property rights in the context of society and governance. When one insists on unlimited property rights, it means that individuals have complete freedom over their possessions without any constraints from the state or other entities. Wellman suggests that this stance leads to several critical issues for society:\n\n1. **Resource Allocation and Access**: Unlimited property rights can lead to significant disparities in wealth distribution, where a small portion of the population accumulates vast amounts of resources while others lack even basic necessities. This can result in a situation where resources are not efficiently allocated, potentially leading to social unrest and inequality.\n\n2. **Social Contract and Governance**: Wellman argues that if property rights are not subject to any limitations, it undermines the social contract that underpins democratic societies. The social contract typically involves a mutual agreement between individuals and the state, where individuals surrender some freedoms in exchange for protection and order. Unlimited property rights challenge this balance, potentially leading to a breakdown in societal norms and the rule of law.\n\n3. **Anarchy**: Wellman suggests that insisting on unlimited property rights commits one to anarchy, which is the absence of a central governing authority. In such a scenario, individuals would operate solely based on self-interest without any formal legal framework to resolve disputes or ensure cooperation. This can lead to a chaotic environment where violence might be the only means to enforce rights or resolve conflicts.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer to the question is **D. anarchy**. Wellman's argument posits that the pursuit of unlimited property rights without any constraints could logically lead to an anarchic society where traditional forms of governance and order do not exist."
