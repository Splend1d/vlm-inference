Substituting \\(x = 0\\) into the original equation:\n\\[y = 0 + e^0 = 0 + 1 = 1\\]\n\nSo, the point on the curve at \\(x = 0\\) is \\((0, 1)\\).\n\nThe equation of the tangent line can be found using the point-slope form:\n\\[y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)\\]\n\nWhere \\((x_1, y_1) = ( (0, 1)\\) and \\(m = 2\\). Plugging these values in gives:\n\\[y - 1 = 2(x - 0)\\]\n\\[y = 2x + 1\\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **A. y = 2x + 1**."
