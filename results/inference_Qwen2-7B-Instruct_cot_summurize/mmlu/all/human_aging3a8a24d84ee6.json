Among the options provided, the one most directly linked to cognitive decline is:\n\nA. Cardiovascular problems\n\nCardiovascular health is closely linked to brain health due to the importance of a healthy circulatory system in delivering oxygen and nutrients to the brain. Conditions such as hypertension, high cholesterol, and atherosclerosis can lead to reduced blood flow and oxygen supply to the brain, potentially contributing to cognitive decline.\n\nWhile other factors like loss of muscle strength (B, immune system decline C, and graying of hair D can have indirect effects on overall health and well-being, they do not have the same direct impact on cognitive function as cardiovascular issues. It's important to note that multiple factors contribute to cognitive decline, and maintaining overall health is crucial for supporting cognitive function."
