An enduring change in an organism's behavior based on experience\n\nLearning, in its broadest sense, refers to a process by which an organism modifies its behavior through experience. This change can be enduring, meaning it lasts over time, or it could be temporary depending on the context. It involves not just classical and operant conditioning (which are are specific types of learning) but also other forms such as observational learning, habituation, sensitization, etc. Therefore, option B provides the most comprehensive and accurate definition of learning as it encompasses the idea of a lasting behavioral change following experience."
