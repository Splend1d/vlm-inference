About 500 miles per hour.\n\nTo understand this, let's break down the calculation:\n\nThe Earth completes one full rotation around its axis in approximately 24 hours ( - this is known as a sidereal day. To find out how fast the Earth's surface moves at the equator, we can use the formula for linear speed:\n\n\\[ \\text{Linear Speed} = \\frac{\\text{Circumference}}{\\text{Time}} \\]\n\nGiven that the circumference of the Earth at the equator is about \\( 40,075 \\) kilometers ( or \\( 24,901 \\) miles ( (which you get by multiplying the Earth's diameter by \\( \\pi \\)), and it takes \\( 24 \\) hours to complete one rotation, we can calculate the linear speed as follows:\n\n\\[ \\text{Linear Speed} = \\frac{24,901 \\text{ miles}}{24 \\text{ hours}} \\approx 1,037.54 \\text{ miles per hour} \\]\n\nThis means that an object at the equator is moving at a speed of roughly 1,037.54 miles per hour due to the Earth's rotation. However, among the provided options, the closest value is 500 miles per hour, which seems to be a simplification or approximation used in the question. The precise calculation indicates that the actual speed is higher than any of the choices given, but based on the options, B (about 500 miles per hour is the most accurate choice."
