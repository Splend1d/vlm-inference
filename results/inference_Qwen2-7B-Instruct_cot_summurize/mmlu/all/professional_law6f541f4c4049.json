The driver of the other car sued the company. The company, in its defense, claimed that the employee's use of the vehicle was unauthorized. At trial, the company calls the employee's boss. The boss offers to testify that the employee called him five minutes after the accident and stated, \"I hope you won't be sore, because I took the company car without permission. \"The court should rule that this evidence is\n\nA. admissible as a declaration against interest.\nB. admissible as an admission.\nC. inadmissible, because the employee was not unavailable.\nD. inadmissible, because it violates the employee's Fifth Amendment rights.\n"

This can include statements made by a party to the lawsuit, or in this case, by someone associated with the party (the employee's boss acting as a witness for the company. The statement provided by the employee's boss is an admission because it directly acknowledges that the employee used the company vehicle without authorization, which is a key point being contested in the lawsuit. \n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nA. A declaration against interest would typically be a statement made by the declarant that they believe to be false or that exposes them to legal liability. While the statement may be against the employee's interest, it is not necessarily against their own interest but rather against the company's position.\n\nC. The employee's unavailability is not the issue here. The statement is being coming from a third party (the boss) who is available to testify and is offering testimony about what the employee said.\n\nD. The Fifth Amendment protects individuals from self-incrimination, meaning they cannot be forced to testify against themselves in a criminal case. However, this scenario does not involve a criminal case, so the Fifth Amendment rights do not come into play. The statement made by the employee is not self-incriminating since it is being offered by the boss, not by the employee under compulsion."
