Since they didn't have a car, the men asked the defendant to drive them to the home. The two men did not tell the defendant what they intended to do there. The defendant drove them to the house. While the defendant waited in the car, the two men entered the home by using a master key to unlock the front door. They then stole several items of expensive jewelry from the bedroom. Concealing the jewelry in their pockets, they left the house and got back into the defendant's car. Unaware of the theft, the defendant drove the two men back to their apartments. The next day, the two men pawned the jewelry for $5,000. Two weeks later, the two men gave the defendant $500 and told him for the first time about the burglary. The defendant kept the money and did not report the theft to the police. If the defendant is subsequently prosecuted, he should be found\n\nA. guilty of receiving stolen property but not guilty of burglary.\nB. guilty of burglary but not guilty of receiving stolen property.\nC. guilty of burglary and of receiving stolen property.\nD. not guilty of either burglary or receiving stolen property.\n"

Initially, he was unaware of the intent of the two men to commit burglary when he drove them to the home. Therefore, he cannot be held liable for burglary since he did not have the requisite intent (mens rea) at the time the crime was committed.\n\nHowever, after learning about the burglary, the defendant accepted $500 and did not report the theft to the police. By accepting the money, which was a portion of the proceeds from the sale of the stolen jewelry, the defendant becomes complicit in the crime of receiving stolen property. His failure to report the crime and his acceptance of the money indicate that he is aiding in the concealment and disposal of the stolen goods.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\nA. guilty of receiving stolen property but not guilty of burglary."
