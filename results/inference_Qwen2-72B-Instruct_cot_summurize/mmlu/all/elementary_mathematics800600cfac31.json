In this case, Mr. Jones is rolling a six-sided die, and there is only one side that has the number three on it.\n\nSo, the number of favorable outcomes is 1 (rolling a three), and the total number of possible outcomes is 6 (since it's a six-sided die).\n\nThus, the probability of rolling a three is:\n\n\\[ P(\\text{rolling a three}) = \\frac{\\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\\text{Total number of possible outcomes}} = \\frac{1}{6} \\]\n\nIn terms of the options provided, the correct answer would be represented as \"1 in 6\" or simplified to lowest terms, which is not explicitly given among your options. However, interpreting the options as fractions, the closest match to \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\) is:\n\nC. 3-Jan\n\nThis is because \"Jan\" could be a typo for \"Jun\", and \"3-Jun\" might be intended to represent \"3 in 6\", which simplifies to \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\), but if we interpret \"Jan\" as a placeholder for any number, then \"3-Jan\" could be seen as \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\) if \"Jan\" represents 6. \n\nHowever, it's important to note that the literal interpretation of the options does not perfectly match mathematical notation. The best answer based on the given options and assuming a typographical error, is:\n\nC. 3-Jan\n\nBut, for clarity, the correct answer should be stated as \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\)."
