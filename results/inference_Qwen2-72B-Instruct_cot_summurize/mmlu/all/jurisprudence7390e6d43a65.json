In other words, the meaning of these principles and concepts is not fixed or determinate, but rather depends on the context in which they are used and the values and purposes they are intended to serve. This means that judges cannot simply apply a rule of recognition to determine whether a given principle or concept is part of the law; instead, they must engage in a process of interpretation that takes into account the broader moral and political context in which the law operates. Therefore, option D is the correct answer."
