This includes being diagnosed with both conditions (A and B), being diagnosed with only Condition A, or being diagnosed with only Condition B:\n\nP(at least one) = P(A and B) + P(A and not B) + P(B and not A)\n\nWe already have P(A and B) and P(B and not A). We still need to calculate P(A and not B):\n\nP(A and not B) = P(A) * P(not B|A) = P(A) * (1 - P(B|A)) = 0.15 * (1 - 0.70) = 0.15 * 0.30 = 0.045\n\nSo, we add all these probabilities together:\n\nP(at least one) = P(A and B) + P(A and not B) + P(B and not A)\n                = 0.105 + 0.045 + 0.085\n                = 0.235\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. 0.235"
