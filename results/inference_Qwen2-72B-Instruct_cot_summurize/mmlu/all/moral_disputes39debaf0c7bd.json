He argues that the harm caused by drug use to individual drug users does not justify state prohibition of drugs. According to Huemer, individuals have the right to make their own choices regarding their bodies and lives, even if those choices may be harmful to themselves. As long as they do not harm others, the state should not interfere with personal autonomy."
