Because the professor was such a popular and well-respected individual in the bar review industry, there was much speculation and interest concerning his termination. A reporter for the local law journal telephoned the bar review course's administrative director and inquired why the professor had been fired. The director told the reporter that the professor was fired because the president of the bar review course believed that the professor had embezzled money. The next day, the reporter wrote an article that was published by the law journal, which quoted the director and stated that the professor \"was fired because he had embezzled money. \" It was later learned that the professor was not responsible for any unlawful conduct and had not embezzled funds. If the professor asserts a defamation action against the law journal, he will most likely\n\nA. prevail, if the professor proves malice.\nB. prevail, if the newspaper was negligent in notascertaining whether the professor had actually embezzled any funds.\nC. not prevail, because the director was merely providing an opinion about the reason for the professor's termination.\nD. not prevail, because the law journal was merely repeating what it had been told by a source.\n"

Additionally, the standard of proof varies depending on whether the plaintiff is a public figure or a private individual. In this case, the professor may be considered a limited-purpose public figure due to his role in the bar review industry, which would require him to prove actual malice (knowledge of falsity or reckless disregard for the truth) if he were to sue the director or the bar review course.\n\nHowever, when suing the law journal, the professor would need to show that the publication acted negligently in failing to verify the information provided by the director before publishing it. Since the statement that the professor embezzled money is a factual assertion that turned out to be false, and if the law journal did not exercise reasonable care in checking the veracity of the claim before publishing it, the professor could potentially prevail in a defamation lawsuit against the law journal based on negligence."
