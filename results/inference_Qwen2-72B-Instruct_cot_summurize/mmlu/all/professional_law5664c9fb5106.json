The three-story building had a store on the ground floor and apartments on the other two floors. The writer entered into a leasehold agreement with a shopkeeper, who would lease the first floor, where she planned to open a sporting goods store. After identifying the parties, the operative words of the lease were as follows: \"Landlord hereby agrees to lease for the three years the first floor of his building in the city to tenant, reserving unto said landlord annual rental in the sum of $12,000 payable in advance in monthly installments of $1,000. \"At the moment of signing, the leasehold agreement entered into between the writer and the shopkeeper\n\nA. created a periodic tenancy.\nB. could be terminated at will by either party.\nC. did not convey to the shopkeeper a term of years at law.\nD. was void, invalid, and had no legal effect.\n"

Therefore, option C is incorrect.\n\nThe operative words of the lease specify that the lease is for three years, which indicates a fixed term rather than a periodic tenancy. A periodic tenancy would not have a specified end date and would continue indefinitely until either party terminates it. Therefore, option A is incorrect.\n\nThe lease also specifies that the annual rental of $12,000 is payable in advance in monthly installments of $1,000. This means that the lease cannot be terminated at will by either party, as there is a contractual obligation to fulfill the terms of the lease. Therefore, option B is incorrect.\n\nAssuming that the lease satisfies all legal requirements and formalities, it should be valid and enforceable. Therefore, option D is also incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is none of the above options. The leasehold agreement entered into between the writer and the shopkeeper created a fixed-term tenancy for three years at an annual rental of $12,000, payable in advance in monthly installments of $1,000."
