                    "text": "When a beam of monochromatic light enters a glass window pane from the air, it experiences a change in both speed and wavelength. The frequency of the light remains constant, as frequency is determined by the source of the light and does not change with medium. However, the speed of light decreases when it moves from air into glass because glass has a higher refractive index than air. As the speed changes, the wavelength of the light also changes to maintain the same frequency. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. speed and wavelength"
