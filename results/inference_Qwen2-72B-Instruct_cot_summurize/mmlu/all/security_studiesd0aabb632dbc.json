Biology determines the female body as weak, ensuring that men continue to dominate state security apparatus in order to protect them. Women are aware of practical biological differences, and by accepting them they allow men to act as their protectors and care-givers. In return, women must act as protectors and care-givers to those less capable than themselves, their children, infants, the elderly, and the infirm.\nB. The most intimate of human activities for women are more important than the demands of the political and religious male dominated elite. Biology determines, and woman's intimate choice exerts, that the considerable responsibility of reproducing a state's population becomes the duty of women alone.\nC. Indiscriminate warfare is gender neutral and in contemporary conflicts there is no gender difference in levels of risk or duty. Men are just as likely to become victims of mass rape (as in the Democratic Republic of Congo or Balkans conflict) as women, and women are equally likely to be conscripted or coerced into military service.\nD. Gender roles are a social construct; the values that we attribute to masculinity or femininity, such as strength or care-giving, are the product of shared social ideals rather than innate biological properties. Men and women are equally able to care effectively for children or to conduct violent and aggressive behaviour. However, social constructs of gender roles are pervasive, and women are likely to be victims of gender-based violence in conflict whilst men are more likely to be involved as perpetrators of violence.\n"

                    "text": "The answer is D. Gender roles are indeed a social construct, and while there may be some biological differences between men and women, these differences do not necessarily determine the roles that men and women must perform for the state. Social constructs of gender roles have led to the expectation that women will take on care-giving roles and that men will take on roles related to physical strength and aggression. However, these expectations are not based on innate biological properties but rather on cultural norms and values.\n\nIn contemporary conflicts, there is no gender difference in levels of risk or duty, and both men and women can be victims of violence. While it is true that women are often disproportionately affected by gender-based violence in conflict, men can also be victims of violence and abuse. Similarly, while women may be more likely to be responsible for care-giving, men can also be effective caregivers, and women can also engage in violent and aggressive behavior if necessary.\n\nOverall, while biological differences may exist between men and women, these differences do not determine the roles that men and women must perform for the state. Rather, social constructs of gender roles play a significant role in shaping expectations around gendered behavior and responsibilities."
