It has become more influenced by evangelical Christians.\n\nSince the 1980s, the Republican Party in the United States has seen a significant increase in influence from evangelical Christian groups and leaders. This shift has been characterized by a stronger emphasis on social issues such as abortion, same-sex marriage, and religious freedom, which align with conservative Christian values. The party platform has increasingly reflected these priorities, and many Republican candidates have sought endorsements and support from prominent evangelical figures."
