Carruthers argues that only beings capable of entering into social contracts have moral standing, which aligns with the principles of contractualism. Contractualism is a moral theory that suggests that moral principles arise from agreements or contracts that rational individuals would accept as the basis for their actions and interactions. In this context, Carruthers contends that since nonhuman animals cannot enter into such contracts, they do not possess full moral standing."
