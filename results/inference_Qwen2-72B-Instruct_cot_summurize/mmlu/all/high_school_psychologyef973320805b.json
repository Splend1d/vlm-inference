The receptor sends signals to the spinal cord via an afferent neuron (also known as a sensory neuron). In the spinal cord, the signal may be processed by one or more interneurons. The interneuron(s) then communicate with an efferent neuron (also known as a motor neuron), which sends a signal back out to an effector (such as a muscle or gland) to produce a response to the stimulus. This path ensures a rapid response to potentially harmful stimuli without the need for the signal to travel all the way to the brain and back."
