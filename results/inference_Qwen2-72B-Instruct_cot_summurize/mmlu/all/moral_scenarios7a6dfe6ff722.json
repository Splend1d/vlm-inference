This is generally seen as morally wrong.\n\nIn scenario 2, while the action might have been careless or accidental, there isn't a clear intention to harm or cause distress. It could be seen as a mistake rather than a morally wrong action. However, if the main character knew the consequences and did it out of spite, then it would be considered morally wrong. Assuming it was an accident, it's not considered morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards."
