Implied powers of an international organization are those that are not explicitly stated in its founding charter but are deemed necessary for the organization to effectively achieve its objectives. These powers can be derived through an expansive interpretation of the organization's charter, allowing it to undertake activities that, while not specifically mentioned, are considered essential for fulfilling its mission. Option B is incorrect because implied powers are not assumed unilaterally; they are recognized as inherent to achieving the organization's goals. Option C is also incorrect because implied powers are not directly conferred by the international community; they are inferred from the organization's charter and purpose."
