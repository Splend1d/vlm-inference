The conference was attended by the leaders of the three major Allied powers: Soviet Premier Joseph Stalin, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill (replaced midway by new Prime Minister Clement Attlee), and U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Italy had surrendered to the Allies in 1943 and was no longer part of the Axis powers by the time of the Yalta Conference in February 1945. Additionally, Mussolini was executed in April 1945, after being captured while attempting to flee to Switzerland."
