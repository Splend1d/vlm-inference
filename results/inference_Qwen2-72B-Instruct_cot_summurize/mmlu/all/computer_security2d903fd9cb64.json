A direct leak creates a denial of service by failing to free memory, while a channel frees memory as a side effect\nB. A direct leak is one that is intentional, rather than by unintentional\nC. A direct leak comes via the software system's intended interaction mechanism, where as a side channel leak comes from measurements of other system features, like timing, power usage, or space usage\nD.

A direct leak comes via the software system's intended interaction mechanism, whereas a side channel leak comes from measurements of other system features, like timing, power usage, or space usage.\n\nDirect leaks occur when sensitive information is directly exposed through the normal operation of a system, such as when an error message reveals more information than it should, or when data is improperly stored or transmitted in plaintext.\n\nSide channels, on the other hand, are indirect ways to infer sensitive information by observing the behavior or physical characteristics of a system under certain conditions. For example, analyzing the time it takes for a cryptographic operation to complete can give clues about the underlying data being processed, even if the data itself is encrypted. Similarly, monitoring power consumption patterns or electromagnetic emissions can also reveal information about the operations being performed by the system."
