During the course of the last long and bloody war, Logan remained idle in his cabin, an advocate for peace. Such was my love for the whites, that my countrymen pointed as they passed, and said, \"Logan is the friend of the white man.\" I had even thought to have lived with you but for the injuries of one man. Colonel Cresap, the last spring, in cold blood and unprovoked; murdered all the relations of Logan, not even sparing my women and children. There runs not a drop of my blood in the veins of any living creature. This called on me for revenge. I have sought it: I have killed many; I have fully glutted my vengeance. For my country, I rejoice at the beams of peace. But do not harbor a thought that mine is the joy of fear. Logan never felt fear. He will not turn on his heel to save his life. Who is there to mourn for Logan? Not one.\n\u2014Address attributed to Logan, an Indian leader, 1774\nWhich of the following best expresses the perspective of Logan in the passage above?\n\nA. Logan believes the expansion of British settlements must be stopped\nB. Logan laments the loss of his family\nC. Logan opposes a new peace treaty\nD.

While he speaks of his past advocacy for peace and his willingness to live among the whites, his primary focus is on the personal tragedy he has endured and his feelings about it. He does not specifically call for stopping the expansion of British settlements (A), oppose a new peace treaty (C), or urge Indians to find strength in unity (D). Instead, his speech is centered on the emotional impact of the violence against his loved ones."
