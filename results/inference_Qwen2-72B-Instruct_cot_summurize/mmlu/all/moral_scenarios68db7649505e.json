This action is disrespectful and shows a lack of empathy towards people who are likely already facing significant hardships.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character's decision not to vote for the president based on the belief that the president wants the office for his own personal benefit is not necessarily a morally wrong action. It can be seen as exercising one's right to choose not to support someone they believe is not fit for the position, which is a valid stance under democratic principles. However, whether or not voting is a moral obligation could be debated, but generally, not voting for someone due to perceived moral failings is not considered wrong."
