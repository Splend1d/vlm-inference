It specifies that the General Assembly and the Security Council can request advisory opinions on any legal question. Moreover, other UN organs and specialized agencies can also request advisory opinions, but only if they have been authorized to do so by the General Assembly. This authorization allows them to seek the Court's opinion on legal questions that arise within the context of their activities."
