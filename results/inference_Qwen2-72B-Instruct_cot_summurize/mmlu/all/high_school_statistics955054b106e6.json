Monitoring wildlife populations is important so that appropriate management efforts can be implemented, but such monitoring is often difficult. One study found a cheap and easy way to estimate the number of nesting sites of terns (a type of seabird) by monitoring the number of calls heard per minute. More calls happen when there are more birds, as one would expect. In fact, it turned out that the number of calls explained 71% of the variation in the abundance of nests between breeding sites. Which of the following statements is correct about the correlation between the number of calls and the abundance of nests?\n\nA. The correlation coefficient is -0.71.\nB. The correlation coefficient is 0.71.\nC. The correlation coefficient is -0.84.\nD. The correlation coefficient is 0.84.\n"

                    "text": "The correlation coefficient, denoted by r, measures the strength and direction of the relationship between two variables. A value of r close to +1 or -1 indicates a strong linear relationship, while values close to 0 indicate little to no linear relationship. The sign of the correlation coefficient (+ or -) indicates the direction of the relationship: positive if both variables increase together, and negative if one variable increases as the other decreases.\n\nIn this case, the statement says that the number of calls explains 71% of the variation in the abundance of nests. This percentage is actually the coefficient of determination (R^2), which is the square of the correlation coefficient (r). To find the correlation coefficient from the coefficient of determination, we take the square root of R^2:\n\n\\[ r = \\sqrt{R^2} = \\sqrt{0.71} \\approx 0.84. \\]\n\nSince the relationship described is positive (more calls correspond to more nests), the correlation coefficient is also positive. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. The correlation coefficient is 0.84."
