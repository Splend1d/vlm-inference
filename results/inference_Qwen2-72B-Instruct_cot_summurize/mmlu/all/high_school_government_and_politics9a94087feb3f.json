The \"winner-take-all\" nature of American elections, where the candidate with the most votes wins without needing to secure a majority, can make it difficult for smaller, issue-specific parties to gain traction and electoral success. This system tends to favor larger parties with broader appeal, which can encompass a wider range of issues and voter bases."
