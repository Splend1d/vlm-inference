All of the options given are correct.\n\nType 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is characterized by a combination of impaired insulin secretion and insulin resistance, which leads to hyperglycemia. The pathogenesis of T2DM involves multiple mechanisms, including:\n\n1. **Increased Glucose Production by the Liver**: In T2DM, the liver fails to properly respond to insulin, leading to excessive production of glucose, particularly during fasting conditions. This is due to a defect in the suppression of gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis by insulin.\n\n2. **Impaired Insulin Secretion**: Beta cells of the pancreas, responsible for producing insulin, function suboptimally in T2DM. There is both an initial defect in insulin secretion in response to glucose and a progressive decline in beta cell function over time.\n\n3. **Decreased Glucose Uptake from Skeletal Muscle**: Insulin resistance in skeletal muscle reduces the ability of muscle cells to take up glucose, contributing to hyperglycemia. Normally, insulin facilitates glucose uptake by promoting the translocation of glucose transporter proteins (GLUT4) to the cell membrane in muscle cells.\n\nAll these factors contribute to the development and progression of hyperglycemia in T2DM, so none of the options A, B, or C can be excluded as they are all involved in the pathogenesis of hyperglycemia in this condition."
