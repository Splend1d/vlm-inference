This can cause data to spill over into adjacent areas of memory, potentially overwriting other important data or code. Boundary checks are designed to prevent this by ensuring that the program does not write beyond the bounds of the buffer. If these checks are not done fully or correctly, buffer overflows can remain as bugs in applications."
