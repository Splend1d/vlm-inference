Liberal theory in academia often emphasizes individual autonomy and choice, which can lead to an under-acknowledgement of the potential harms of consensual sex if those harms are seen as resulting from individual choices rather than systemic issues. This focus on individualism can sometimes overlook the ways in which power dynamics and societal structures can influence individuals' choices and experiences."
