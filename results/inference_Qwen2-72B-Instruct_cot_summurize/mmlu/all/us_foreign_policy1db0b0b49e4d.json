The belief that the United States is different from other major powers because it is concerned not only with Power, but also with Principles.\n\nAmerican exceptionalism is the idea that the United States is unique among nations due to its founding principles, history, and mission. It suggests that the U.S. has a special role in the world, driven not just by self-interest or power politics, but also by a commitment to ideals such as democracy, freedom, and human rights. This concept has been used to justify various aspects of U.S. foreign policy and national identity."
