Among the options provided:\n\nA. Clostridium perfringens - This is not a common cause of meningitis. It's typically associated with gas gangrene and food poisoning.\n\nB. Haemophilus influenzae - This can cause meningitis, but it is more common in children under the age of 5, especially those who have not been vaccinated against H. influenzae type b (Hib).\n\nC. Rhinovirus - This virus is a common cause of the common cold and is not known to cause meningitis.\n\nD. Streptococcus pneumoniae - This is one of the most common causes of bacterial meningitis in adults, particularly in the elderly. Given the patient's age and the described symptoms, S. pneumoniae is the most likely etiologic organism.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Streptococcus pneumoniae."
