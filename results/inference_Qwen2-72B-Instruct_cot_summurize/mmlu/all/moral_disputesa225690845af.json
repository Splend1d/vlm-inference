Care ethics is an important development of virtue ethics, as it emphasizes the importance of relationships, empathy, and compassion in moral decision-making, which can be seen as an extension of Aristotelian virtues.\n\nB. Traditional moral theories, such as deontology and consequentialism, have difficulty explaining the rightness or wrongness of attitudes because they often focus on abstract principles or outcomes rather than the context and relational aspects of moral situations.\n\nC. While care ethicists do emphasize the importance of care and compassion, they do not necessarily claim that these are the only important moral concepts. However, they do argue that these concepts have been undervalued in traditional moral theories.\n\nD. Care ethicists do suggest that we should think about welfare and happiness in terms of sympathy and relational connections, as opposed to solely individualistic or impersonal considerations. This emphasis on relational aspects is a key feature of care ethics. However, this does not mean that they reject all other ways of thinking about welfare and happiness."
