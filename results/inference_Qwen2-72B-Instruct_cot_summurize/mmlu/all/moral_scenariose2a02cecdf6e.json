If the task was designed for human completion and you automated it, this could be seen as dishonest, but without clear guidelines or rules being broken, it may not be universally considered as morally wrong as cheating on homework would be. However, if the platform's terms of service or the specific HIT instructions prohibit automation, then it would be considered wrong."
