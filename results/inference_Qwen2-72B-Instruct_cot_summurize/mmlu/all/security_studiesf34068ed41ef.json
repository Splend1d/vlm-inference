A failure to address the importance of a wide range of actors in the decision-making processes of the international system.\n\nLiberalism actually emphasizes the role of multiple actors in the international system, including states, international organizations, non-governmental organizations, and individuals. This is in contrast to realism, which focuses primarily on state actors. Therefore, option C is not a limitation of liberalism but rather a strength that distinguishes it from other international relations theories."
