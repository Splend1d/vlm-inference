                    "text": "To find the stone's total speed when it enters the water, we need to consider both its horizontal and vertical components of velocity. Since the stone is thrown horizontally, its initial horizontal velocity (vx) is 30 m/s. There is no acceleration in the horizontal direction if air resistance is neglected, so vx remains constant at 30 m/s throughout the fall.\n\nThe vertical component of velocity (vy) starts at zero but increases due to gravity. The acceleration due to gravity (g) is approximately 9.81 m/s\u00b2. We can use the formula for the final velocity in free fall:\n\n\\[ v_y = g \\cdot t \\]\n\nwhere \\(v_y\\) is the final vertical velocity, \\(g\\) is the acceleration due to gravity, and \\(t\\) is time.\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\n\\[ v_y = 9.81 \\, \\text{m/s}^2 \\cdot 4 \\, \\text{s} = 39.24 \\, \\text{m/s} \\]\n\nNow we have two components of velocity: \\(v_x = 30 \\, \\text{m/s}\\) and \\(v_y = 39.24 \\, \\text{m/s}\\). The total speed (v) when the stone enters the water can be found using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\n\\[ v = \\sqrt{v_x^2 + v_y^2} \\]\n\n\\[ v = \\sqrt{(30 \\, \\text{m/s})^2 + (39.24 \\, \\text{m/s})^2} \\]\n\n\\[ v = \\sqrt{900 + 1539.7776} \\]\n\n\\[ v = \\sqrt{2439.7776} \\]\n\n\\[ v \u2248 49.4 \\, \\text{m/s} \\]\n\nThis value is closest to option C, which is 50 m/s. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. 50 m/s"
