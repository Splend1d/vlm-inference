In 1990, Albert drafted a document for a client's estate plan that unfortunately violated the rule against perpetuities. Upon the testator's death in 2004, the mistake was discovered. Because of the error, the estate plan was not admitted to probate so the assets were distributed under the state intestacy statute. Gordon Greedy was named as a substantial taker under the estate plan, but did not take under the intestate statute since he was not a relative. The state statute of limitations for professional malpractice is three years. If Gordon sues Albert for professional malpractice in 2005, the best defense Albert can assert is\n\nA. The statute of limitations has run, so Gordon's lawsuit is not timely.\nB. The legal fee for the original estate plan was never paid.\nC. The rule against perpetuities is too complicated for the average lawyer in the locality of Littletown to understand.\nD. Gordon was not an eligible taker under the estate plan.\n"

The statute of limitations has run, so Gordon's lawsuit is not timely.\n\nExplanation: The statute of limitations for professional malpractice is three years. Since the mistake was discovered in 2004 upon the testator's death and Gordon is suing in 2005, it might appear at first glance that the lawsuit is timely. However, the statute of limitations typically starts from the time the cause of action accrues, which could either be when the mistake was made (in 1990) or when it should have been discovered (potentially earlier than 2004). Assuming the latter, if the mistake could have been reasonably discovered more than three years before Gordon filed his suit in 2005, then the statute of limitations defense would apply. This defense assumes that Gordon had the opportunity to discover the error within the three-year period after it occurred or should have reasonably known about it."
