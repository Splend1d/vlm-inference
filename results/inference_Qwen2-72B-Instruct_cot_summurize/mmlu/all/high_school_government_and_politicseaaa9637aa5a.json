Congressional oversight activities most often take place at the committee and subcommittee levels.\n\nCongressional oversight is a critical function of the legislative branch, allowing it to monitor and review the actions and policies of the executive branch. This oversight is typically carried out by committees and subcommittees that have specific areas of focus, such as defense, health, or finance. These groups hold hearings, request reports, and conduct investigations to ensure that federal agencies and programs are operating effectively and in accordance with the law."
