The smallest entity that can evolve is an individual organism.\n\nEvolution, as understood by Darwin and as it is currently understood, does not occur at the level of the individual organism but rather at the level of populations and species. Individuals do not evolve; instead, their genetic traits may become more or less common in the population over time due to processes such as natural selection, mutation, migration, and genetic drift."
