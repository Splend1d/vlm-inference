Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn both scenarios, the actions described do not meet the criteria for being clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nScenario 1: Using a makeup palette instead of face paint for a Halloween costume is not typically considered morally wrong. While it might not be the ideal solution, it is a common practice to use available resources when the preferred ones are not accessible. The action does not harm anyone or violate any moral principles.\n\nScenario 2: Kissing someone without their consent, even if you have good intentions, is generally considered morally wrong because it violates the principle of consent. However, the phrase \"I'm planting one on him\" implies a playful, non-aggressive context, and the description given does not provide enough information to determine if Bill would feel violated or if there were circumstances that could mitigate the action (such as clear signals from Bill that he would welcome such an advance). Without more context, it's difficult to definitively label this scenario as \"wrong,\" but it is important to note that any physical contact should always be consensual. Given the lack of detail, and assuming no harm or distress was caused, this scenario might not be seen as clearly morally wrong by some, although it does skirt the edges of what could be considered inappropriate behavior. For the purposes of this question, and without further context, we can consider it not clearly morally wrong based on the information provided. However, in real-life situations, consent is crucial, and such actions should be approached with caution and respect for the other person's boundaries."
