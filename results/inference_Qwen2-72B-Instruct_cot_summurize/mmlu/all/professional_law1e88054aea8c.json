The neighbor who owns property adjacent to the farm knows of the friends' use of the property during the hunting season. One day during the hunting season, without the farmer's knowledge or permission, the neighbor took a shortcut across the farm to visit an acquaintance. The neighbor was wounded by a shot fired by one of the farmer's friends, who was shooting at quail and carelessly failed to see the neighbor. Traditional rules of landowners' and occupiers' liability apply. In an action by the neighbor against the farmer to recover for the injuries, will the neighbor be likely to prevail?\n\nA. No, because the farmer is not responsible for his friends' conduct.\nB. No, because the neighbor was trespassing.\nC. Yes, because the careless friend was permitted to hunt without safety training.\nD. Yes, because the use of firearms is an abnormally dangerous activity.\n"

The fact that the farmer allowed his friends to hunt on the property without providing any instructions about gun safety could be seen as negligence on the part of the farmer, particularly given that he knew or should have known that his friends would be using firearms on the property during hunting season. Additionally, the use of firearms can be considered an abnormally dangerous activity, which could also support the neighbor's case. Therefore, option D, \"Yes, because the use of firearms is an abnormally dangerous activity,\" is the most likely correct answer. However, it is important to note that the specific facts of the case and applicable law would need to be analyzed to determine the ultimate outcome."
