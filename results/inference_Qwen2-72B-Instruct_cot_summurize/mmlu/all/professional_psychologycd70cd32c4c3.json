This LAD is a hypothetical mechanism in the brain that allows children to learn any human language they are exposed to during a critical period of development. According to this theory, the principles and parameters of grammar are universal and pre-programmed into the human mind, which explains why children can learn language so quickly and with such little explicit instruction. This perspective contrasts with behaviorist theories, like those proposed by B.F. Skinner, which emphasize the role of environmental factors such as reinforcement and imitation in language learning (options B and C). Cognitive development (option D) is also important for language learning, but Chomsky argues that it is not sufficient to explain the complexity and rapid acquisition of language without invoking innate mechanisms."
