Information in this node includes (1) the owner of the file, (2) a count of the number of links to the tile, and (3) the disk block numbers of the file. What is a primary drawback to this approach to sharing?\n\nA. If the owner modifies the file, another user who does not share will see the changes.\nB. If the owner renames the file, other users will not be able to access it.\nC. If the owner is allowed to delete a file, dangling links may result.\nD. If any user who shares the file appends to it, others who share it will not be able to access the new disk blocks.\n"

If the owner deletes the file, but there are still links pointing to it from other directories, those links become \"dangling\" and point to a non-existent file. This can cause problems for users who try to access the file through one of these links, as they will not be able to do so."
