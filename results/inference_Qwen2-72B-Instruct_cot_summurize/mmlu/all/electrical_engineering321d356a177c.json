                    "text": "In the two-wattmeter method, which is used for measuring power in three-phase systems, if the total power is measured by one wattmeter only, it implies that the other wattmeter reads zero. This condition occurs when the phase angle between the voltage and current in all phases is such that one of the wattmeters reads a positive value (total power) and the other reads a negative value equal in magnitude to the first, thus canceling out. However, for this scenario to reduce to the total power being read by just one wattmeter, with the other reading zero, it means that the phase angles are set up in such a way that there's no reactive component present in the circuit.\n\nWhen the power factor is unity (1), the phase angle between voltage and current is zero, and therefore, there's no reactive power. In this case, both wattmeters would read the same positive value, contributing equally to the total power. However, the question implies a scenario where one wattmeter reads the total power, and the other reads zero, which is consistent with a balanced three-phase system operating at unity power factor, but under specific conditions where the load is purely resistive.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. 1."
