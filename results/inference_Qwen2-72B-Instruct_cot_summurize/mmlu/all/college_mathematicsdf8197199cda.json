Therefore, it is not always true that |x + y| = |x| + |y|.\n\nThe other statements are true:\nA. |x| \u2265 0 - This is true because the norm (or magnitude) of any vector is always non-negative.\nB. |x \u00b7 y| \u2264 |x||y| - This is the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, which is true for any vectors x and y in R^k.\nC. |x| = 0 if and only if x = 0 - This is true because the norm of a vector is zero if and only if the vector itself is the zero vector."
