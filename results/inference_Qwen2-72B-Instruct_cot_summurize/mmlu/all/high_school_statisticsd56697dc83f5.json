The survey is meaningless because of voluntary response bias.\n\nThis type of survey suffers from voluntary response bias because the people who choose to respond may not be representative of the entire listening audience or the general population. Those who feel strongly about the issue, particularly those in favor of the death penalty, are more likely to take the time to send an email, skewing the results. Without a method to ensure that the respondents are a random and representative sample of the population, the results cannot be generalized to the broader audience or public opinion."
