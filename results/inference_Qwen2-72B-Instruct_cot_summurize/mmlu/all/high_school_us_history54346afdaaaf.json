Freedom and equality for each individual, government of, by, and for the people\u2014these American values we found good, principles by which we could live as men. Many of us began maturing in complacency.\n\"As we grew, however, our comfort was penetrated by events too troubling to dismiss. First, the permeating and victimizing fact of human degradation, symbolized by the Southern struggle against racial bigotry, compelled most of us from silence to activism. Second, the enclosing fact of the Cold War, symbolized by the presence of the Bomb, brought awareness that we ourselves, and our friends, and millions of abstract 'others' we knew more directly because of our common peril, might die at any time. . . .\"\n\u2014Port Huron Statement, 1962\nThrough the remainder of the 1960s, the growth of the organization that published the Port Huron Statement can best be understood in the context of\n\nA. rapid industrialization, urban growth and congestion, and corporate consolidation.\nB. the baby boom, economic growth, and a rapid expansion of higher education.\nC. economic polarization, supply-side economic policies, and the disappearance of the middle class.\nD. the proliferation of personal computer technologies, the rise of Christian fundamentalism, and an increase in student apathy.\n"

This period saw a large number of young people entering colleges and universities, which became centers for political and social activism. The combination of a large youth population, economic prosperity, and access to higher education contributed to the emergence of a counterculture that challenged traditional values and norms, leading to increased activism on issues such as civil rights, anti-war protests, and other social justice causes."
