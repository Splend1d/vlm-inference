Free riders: Public goods are often subject to the free-rider problem, where individuals have no incentive to pay for the good because they can benefit from it without contributing to its cost.\n\nII. Adding demand curves vertically: To determine the aggregate demand for a public good, individual demand curves are summed vertically, reflecting the fact that the total willingness to pay is the sum of all individual willingnesses to pay at each quantity level.\n\nIII. Nonrivalry in consumption: A characteristic of public goods, meaning that one person's consumption does not diminish another's ability to consume the same good.\n\nIV. Nonexcludability: Another characteristic of public goods, meaning that it is difficult or impossible to prevent non-payers from using the good."
