                    "text": "A likely cause of falling Treasury bond prices is B. contractionary monetary policy. Contractionary monetary policy typically involves actions by a central bank, such as the Federal Reserve in the United States, to reduce the money supply and raise interest rates. When interest rates rise, the price of existing bonds falls because new bonds are issued with higher yields, making the older bonds less attractive to investors.\n\nHere's why the other options may not directly lead to falling Treasury bond prices:\n\nA. Expansionary monetary policy usually involves lowering interest rates and increasing the money supply, which can lead to higher bond prices as demand for them increases due to their relatively higher yields compared to the new lower-rate environment.\n\nC. A depreciating dollar does not necessarily lead directly to falling Treasury bond prices. In fact, during times of uncertainty when the dollar weakens, investors might flock to safe-haven assets like U.S. Treasury bonds, potentially increasing their prices.\n\nD. Fiscal policy designed to reduce the budget deficit could potentially lead to an increase in bond prices if it reduces government borrowing and thus decreases the supply of new bonds on the market. However, this effect would depend on how the deficit reduction is achieved (e.g., through spending cuts or tax increases) and how the markets perceive the overall impact on economic growth."
