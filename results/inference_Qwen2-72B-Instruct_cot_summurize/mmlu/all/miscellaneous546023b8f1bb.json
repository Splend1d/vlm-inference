Pidgins are simplified languages that develop as a means of communication between groups of people who do not share a common language. They typically have reduced grammatical structures and a limited vocabulary, and they often arise in trade situations or other contexts where people need to interact but cannot use their native languages to do so. Over time, pidgins can sometimes develop into more complex languages known as creoles when they become the primary language of a community and are acquired as a first language by children. However, based on the description provided, the language used by the fishermen at the border is best described as a pidgin."
