Moore was a prominent philosopher who criticized the tendency of previous philosophers to define \"good\" in terms of natural properties, such as pleasure or desire satisfaction. He argued that this approach commits the \"naturalistic fallacy,\" which involves attempting to define an ethical term (in this case, \"good\") solely in terms of descriptive, natural properties. According to Moore, \"good\" is a simple, indefinable quality that cannot be reduced to anything else."
