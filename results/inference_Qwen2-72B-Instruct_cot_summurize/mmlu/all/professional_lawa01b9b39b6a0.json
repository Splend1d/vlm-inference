The putrid smell from the slaughterhouse travels over the woman's property. The woman and her family members find the odor to be foul and nauseating. As a result of the man's slaughterhouse, the value of the woman's property was diminished by 20 percent, and the woman incurred expenses for prescription drugs to treat her family's nausea. There is no applicable zoning ordinance preventing the man's slaughterhouse operation. The woman has asserted a nuisance action against the man. The complaint seeks recovery for damages and injunctive relief enjoining operation of the slaughterhouse. The court should\n\nA. award damages, but not grant injunctive relief.\nB. grant injunctive relief, but not award damages.\nC. grant injunctive relief and award damages.\nD. neither award damages nor grant injunctive relief, because there was no violation of any ordinance.\n"

The fact that there is no applicable zoning ordinance preventing the slaughterhouse operation does not necessarily mean that the operation is not a nuisance under common law. The court will consider whether the slaughterhouse operation unreasonably interferes with the woman's use and enjoyment of her property. Given the significant decrease in property value and health issues experienced by the woman and her family, it is likely that the court will find the slaughterhouse to be a private nuisance and grant both injunctive relief and damages."
