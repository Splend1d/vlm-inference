The plaintiff's complaint alleged that the walk was covered by a thick sheet of ice, which had been negligently left there for several days by the defendant. In his answer, the defendant set forth that the ice formed overnight and that the plaintiff fell before the defendant had a chance to remove it. During the trial, a physician, whose office was next door to the defendant's home, testified that he saw the plaintiff fall and that the ice, which had been there for several days was at least two inches thick. On cross-examination, counsel for the defendant asked the physician the following question: \"During your treatment of the plaintiff on the day in question, is it not true that he told you his fall resulted from a loss of equilibrium after he suffered from dizziness?\"Upon objection by the plaintiff's attorney, the physician's testimony will be ruled\n\nA. admissible, because it is reasonably pertinent to diagnosis or treatment.\nB. admissible, because the physician had personal knowledge of the plaintiff's injuries.\nC. inadmissible, because the defendant's counsel failed to lay a proper foundation.\nD. inadmissible, because the physician's testimony is not relevant to prove that the plaintiff's alleged injuries are false or exaggerated.\n"

                    "text": "The physician's testimony about what the plaintiff told him regarding the cause of his fall would generally be considered hearsay and thus inadmissible unless an exception applies. However, under Federal Rule of Evidence 803(4), statements made by a patient to a physician for the purpose of medical diagnosis or treatment are admissible as an exception to the hearsay rule.\n\nIn this context, the question posed by the defense attorney is asking the physician if the plaintiff told him that his fall was due to dizziness rather than slipping on ice. This statement could potentially be relevant to the physician's diagnosis and treatment of the plaintiff's condition. Therefore, under the criteria of Rule 803(4), such a statement might be admissible to show the basis for the physician's treatment decisions.\n\nHowever, the question also seems to imply that the statement is being used to challenge the credibility of the plaintiff's claim that the fall was caused by the ice on the defendant's property, which would be outside the scope of the hearsay exception under Rule 803(4). If the statement is being offered solely to contradict the plaintiff's version of events (i.e., that the fall was due to the icy conditions) and not for the purpose of showing how it influenced the physician's medical judgment, then it may not meet the criteria for admissibility under Rule 803(4).\n\nGiven these considerations, the most likely answer to the question of whether the physician's testimony will be ruled admissible or inadmissible depends on the specific rules of evidence applied by the court and the precise purpose for which the testimony is being offered. However, based on the information provided, the most fitting answer is:\n\nD. inadmissible, because the physician's testimony is not relevant to prove that the plaintiff's alleged injuries are false or exaggerated.\n\nThis answer assumes that the primary purpose of the testimony is to challenge the plaintiff's account of how the injury occurred, rather than to provide insight into the physician's medical decision-making process. If the latter were the case, the testimony could potentially be ruled admissible under Rule 803(4)."
