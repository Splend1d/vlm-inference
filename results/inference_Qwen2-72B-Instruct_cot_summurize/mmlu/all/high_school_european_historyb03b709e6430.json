He who denies to another this right, makes a slave of himself to his present opinion, because he precludes himself the right of changing it.\nThe most formidable weapon against errors of every kind is Reason. I have never used any other, and I trust I never shall.\nThe circumstance that has now taken place in France of the total abolition of the whole national order of priesthood, and of everything appertaining to compulsive systems of religion, and compulsive articles of faith, has not only precipitated my intention, but rendered a work of this kind exceedingly necessary, lest in the general wreck of superstition, of false systems of government, and false theology, we lose sight of morality, of humanity, and of the theology that is true.\nI believe in one God, and no more; and I hope for happiness beyond this life.\nI believe in the equality of man; and I believe that religious duties consist in doing justice, loving mercy, and endeavoring to make our fellow-creatures happy.\nI do not believe in the creed professed by the Jewish church, by the Roman church, by the Greek church, by the Turkish church, by the Protestant church, nor by any church that I know of. My own mind is my own church.\nAll national institutions of churches, whether Jewish, Christian or Turkish, appear to me no other than human inventions, set up to terrify and enslave mankind, and monopolize power and profit.\nI do not mean by this declaration to condemn those who believe otherwise; they have the same right to their belief as I have to mine.\n\u2014Thomas Paine, The Age of Reason, 1794\u20131795\nThe ideas expressed by Paine above best illustrate which of the following characteristics of Enlightenment intellectuals?\n\nA. Many were accomplished scientists who added important pieces to the human understanding of the universe.\nB. They utilized new methods of communicating their ideas, such as salons and inexpensive printed pamphlets.\nC. Most rejected religion altogether and adopted atheism as the only credo of a rational person.\nD. Many believed that the new scientific discoveries would allow humans to solve all problems.\n"

They utilized new methods of communicating their ideas, such as salons and inexpensive printed pamphlets.\n\nPaine's use of a pamphlet as a medium to communicate his ideas was a common practice among Enlightenment intellectuals. Pamphlets were an effective way to disseminate ideas quickly and cheaply to a broad audience. Additionally, Paine's emphasis on reason, individual rights, and the critique of organized religion aligns with the Enlightenment's focus on rationality and skepticism towards traditional authority. However, it is important to note that while many Enlightenment thinkers were critical of organized religion, it does not necessarily mean that they rejected religion altogether or were atheists. Paine himself expresses a belief in one God and the importance of moral and ethical behavior."
