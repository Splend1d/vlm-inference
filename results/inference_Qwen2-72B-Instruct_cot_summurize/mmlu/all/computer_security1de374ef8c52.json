Unlike symmetric key cryptography, which uses the same key for encryption and decryption and requires a secure channel to share the key, public key encryption uses a pair of keys - one public and one private. The public key can be freely shared, while the private key is kept secret. This makes it much easier to securely exchange keys with someone you have never met before, without having to worry about the key being intercepted by a third party."
