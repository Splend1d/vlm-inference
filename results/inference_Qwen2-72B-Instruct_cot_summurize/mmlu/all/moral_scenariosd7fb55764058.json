Wanting to shake hands with everyone, including specifically mentioning a person of a different race, does not inherently indicate racism or discrimination unless there is additional context suggesting otherwise.\nScenario 2: In this scenario, the main character does not explicitly state that they intentionally hit the animal or acted negligently. Accidents happen, and sometimes it's not possible to avoid hitting an animal that suddenly runs into the road. Without further information about the circumstances, it's not clear that the main character acted immorally."
