(num MOD 2) = 1\n\nExplanation: The modulus operator (%) returns the remainder of the division of the number on its left by the number on its right. If a number is even, it will have no remainder when divided by 2, and thus the expression (num MOD 2) will evaluate to 0. However, if the number is odd, it will have a remainder of 1 when divided by 2, and thus the expression (num MOD 2) will evaluate to 1. Therefore, the correct condition to check if a positive number is odd is (num MOD 2) = 1.\n\nA. (num MOD 1) = 0 is not a valid condition because any number modulo 1 is always 0.\nB. (num MOD 1) = 1 is not a valid condition because any number modulo 1 is always 0.\nC. (num MOD 2 ) = 0 is not a valid condition because this checks whether the number is even, not odd."
