This stage occurs between the ages of 18 months to about 3 years, during which time the child is learning to control their bodily functions, including bowel movements. If the child experiences too much or too little control during toilet training, it can lead to an anal-retentive or anal-expulsive personality in adulthood. An anal-retentive personality is characterized by excessive orderliness, tidiness, and stubbornness, while an anal-expulsive personality is characterized by messiness, chaos, and rebelliousness. Therefore, the answer is A. Anal."
