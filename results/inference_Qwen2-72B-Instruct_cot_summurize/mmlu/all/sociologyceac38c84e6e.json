Becker, a prominent sociologist, argued in his work \"Becoming a Marihuana User\" (1953) that the use of cannabis or marijuana is not an innate behavior but rather a learned one that occurs through a process he called a \"deviant career.\" According to Becker, individuals do not automatically know how to use cannabis or how to interpret the effects; instead, they learn these things from others who have already established themselves as users. This learning process includes understanding the drug's effects, learning the proper way to smoke it, and internalizing the meanings and experiences associated with its use. Therefore, cannabis use is not simply a matter of personal choice but is influenced by social interactions and the cultural context in which it is used. \n\nWhile Becker did acknowledge that cannabis use was increasing among youth in the 1970s, this was not the primary focus of his work. He also did not take a moral stance on whether cannabis use was dangerous or enjoyable, but rather focused on the social processes involved in becoming a user."
