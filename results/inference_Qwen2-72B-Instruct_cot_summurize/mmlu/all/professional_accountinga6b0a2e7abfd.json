Theory of constraints.\n\nThe Theory of Constraints (TOC) is a management philosophy that focuses on identifying and improving the weakest link in a process or system, which is often referred to as the bottleneck. In this scenario, the manager is dealing with a critical machine that has limited capacity, which could be considered the bottleneck in the production process. TOC would help the manager analyze the situation, identify the constraints, and implement strategies to optimize the use of the critical machine, thereby increasing profitability within the existing capacity constraints."
