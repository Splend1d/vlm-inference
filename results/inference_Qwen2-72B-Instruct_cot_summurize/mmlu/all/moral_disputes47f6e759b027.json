Even though you ought to let the violinist use your kidneys for that hour, we should not conclude that he or she has a right to use your kidneys for that hour. In other words, while it may be morally commendable to allow the violinist to use your kidneys, it does not necessarily follow that they have a right to do so. This distinction is important because it highlights the difference between moral obligations and legal or entitlement-based rights."
