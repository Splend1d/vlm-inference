This typically leads to an upward pressure on prices as sellers can charge more for their goods due to high demand. As prices rise, some consumers may be priced out of the market, reducing demand, while higher prices may encourage suppliers to produce more, increasing supply. This process helps to move the market towards equilibrium where quantity demanded equals quantity supplied."
