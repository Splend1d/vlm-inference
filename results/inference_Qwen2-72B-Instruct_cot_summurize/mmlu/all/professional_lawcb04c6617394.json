A defendant shot a victim in the head. The victim was then taken to a hospital for treatment of the wound. An earthquake later struck the city, causing the hospital to collapse. The victim was crushed to death in the rubble.\nB. A defendant and a victim lived in the same apartment building. The defendant knew that the victim was having a love affair with a married woman. One day, the defendant learned that the victim was to be murdered by the married woman's husband. Although the defendant had ample time to warn the victim, he failed to do so. That night, the victim was stabbed to death by the husband.\nC. A victim, who was a gambler, was heavily in debt to the mob. The defendant, who was a mob enforcer, threatened to kill the victim if he didn't pay up. Frightened, the victim boarded the next airplane flight out of town. The airplane crashed, and the victim was killed.\nD. A defendant and a victim were driving to work together when the defendant, without provocation, stabbed the victim in the arm. The defendant then pushed him out of the car. The victim fell along the side of the street and fractured his ankle. Unable to move from the roadway, the victim was fatally crushed a half-hour later by a car driven by a drunk driver.\n"

In this scenario, the defendant's actions (stabbing the victim and pushing him out of the car) directly led to the victim being unable to move from the roadway, which ultimately resulted in his death when he was hit by another car. This chain of events establishes a clear causal link between the defendant's actions and the victim's death.\n\nIn contrast:\n\nA. The earthquake breaking the chain of causation makes it less likely that the defendant would be held responsible for the victim's death after being shot.\n\nB. The defendant's failure to warn the victim does not necessarily make him criminally responsible for the murder committed by the husband.\n\nC. The airplane crash, an independent intervening event, breaks the chain of causation between the defendant's threat and the victim's death.\n\nTherefore, situation D presents the strongest case for criminal responsibility on the part of the defendant for the victim's death."
