                    "text": "The passage provided is from the landmark Supreme Court case Brown v. Board of Education (1954), which overturned the \"separate but equal\" doctrine established by Plessy v. Ferguson (1896) and declared that segregated schools were unconstitutional. This decision was a pivotal moment in the Civil Rights Movement and contributed to the desegregation of schools across the United States.\n\nThe question asks about unfulfilled promises leading to desegregation, specifically in relation to the options given:\n\nA. The Great Society - This was a set of domestic programs launched by President Lyndon B. Johnson in the mid-1960s, after the Brown v. Board of Education decision. It aimed to eliminate poverty and racial injustice, including the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. However, these initiatives came after the Brown decision, so they cannot be said to have led directly to desegregation efforts.\n\nB. The Square Deal - This was a domestic agenda introduced by President Theodore Roosevelt at the turn of the 20th century. It focused on consumer protection, control of large corporations, and conservation of natural resources. It did not address issues of racial equality or education.\n\nC. The New Deal - This was a series of programs and policies implemented by President Franklin D. Roosevelt during the 1930s to combat the effects of the Great Depression. While some New Deal programs inadvertently helped African Americans, such as providing jobs through the Works Progress Administration, the New Deal did not specifically target racial inequalities in education or explicitly promise desegregation.\n\nD. Reconstruction - This period followed the American Civil War and lasted from 1865 to 1877. Reconstruction aimed to rebuild the Southern states and integrate freed slaves into society as equal citizens. Promises made during Reconstruction included citizenship rights for African Americans and efforts to establish public schools, including schools for African Americans. However, these promises were often unfulfilled due to resistance from white supremacists and the eventual end of Reconstruction, which allowed for the rise of Jim Crow laws and the re-establishment of segregation.\n\nGiven the context and historical timeline, the most accurate answer to the question is:\n\nD. Reconstruction\n\nReconstruction-era policies and promises regarding racial equality and education were undermined and reversed over time, leading to the institutionalization of segregation and the need for legal challenges like Brown v. Board of Education to rectify the situation."
