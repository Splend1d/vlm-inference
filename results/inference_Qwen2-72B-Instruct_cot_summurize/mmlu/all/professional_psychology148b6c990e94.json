According to Bandura's social learning theory, this internal mechanism allows people to maintain learned behaviors over time even when external rewards or punishments are not present. This concept is critical in explaining how individuals can regulate their own behavior and continue to engage in actions that they perceive as beneficial or desirable without needing continuous external reinforcement."
