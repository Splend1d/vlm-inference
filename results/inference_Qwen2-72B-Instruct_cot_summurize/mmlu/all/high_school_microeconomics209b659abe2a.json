Price falls as firms enter the industry.\n\nWhen the price in a perfectly competitive market is above the minimum average total cost (ATC), it means that existing firms are making economic profits. This signals to potential new entrants that there are profits to be made in the industry, and so they will be incentivized to enter the market. As more firms enter, the supply in the market increases, putting downward pressure on the price. This continues until the price falls to the level of the minimum ATC, at which point firms are earning normal profits and there is no incentive for new firms to enter or existing firms to exit. This is how the market reaches long-run equilibrium in perfect competition."
