The procedure is to obtain a random sample of principals from each of the districts rather than grouping all the lists together and obtaining a sample from the entire group. Which of the following is a correct conclusion?\n\nA. This is a simple random sample obtained in an easier and less costly manner than procedures involving sampling from the entire population of principals.\nB. This is a cluster sample in which the population was divided into heterogeneous groups called clusters.\nC. This is an example of systematic sampling, which gives a reasonable sample as long as the original order of the list is not related to the variables under consideration.\nD. This is a stratified sample, which may give comparative information that a simple random sample wouldn't give.\n"

This is a stratified sample, which may give comparative information that a simple random sample wouldn't give.\n\nExplanation: By dividing the population into smaller groups (strata) based on school districts and then taking a random sample from each stratum, the researcher is employing a stratified sampling technique. This method ensures representation from all strata, which can provide more precise estimates than a simple random sample if the strata are chosen appropriately. It also allows for comparisons between different districts, which would not be possible with a simple random sample taken from the entire population of principals."
