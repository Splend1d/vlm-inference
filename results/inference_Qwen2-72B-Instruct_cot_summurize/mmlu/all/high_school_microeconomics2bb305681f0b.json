                    "text": "To determine what the firm should do, we need to compare the marginal revenue product (MRP) of labor and capital to their respective prices. The MRP is the additional revenue generated by one additional unit of the input.\n\nGiven:\n- Price of labor (PL) = $2\n- Price of capital (PK) = $1\n- Marginal product of labor (MPL) = 200\n- Marginal product of capital (MPK) = 50\n\nAssuming a competitive market where the firm is a price taker, the MRP equals the marginal product times the price of the output. Let's denote the price of the output as P. Without knowing P, we can still compare the MRP/price ratios for labor and capital:\n\n\\[ \\text{MRP of Labor} / \\text{Price of Labor} = (\\text{MPL} \\times P) / PL = (200P) / 2 = 100P \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{MRP of Capital} / \\text{Price of Capital} = (\\text{MPK} \\times P) / PK = (50P) / 1 = 50P \\]\n\nWe want the MRP/price ratio to be equal for both inputs because this is the condition for cost minimization given a fixed level of output. If one ratio is higher than the other, it means the firm can reduce costs by substituting away from the input with the lower ratio towards the input with the higher ratio.\n\nIn this case, the MRP/price ratio for labor is twice that of capital (100P vs 50P). This indicates that the firm should substitute away from capital towards labor, which means decreasing capital and increasing labor. The goal is to decrease the MRP of labor relative to its price and increase the MRP of capital relative to its price until the ratios are equal.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Decrease capital and increase labor so that the marginal product of capital rises and the marginal product of labor falls."
