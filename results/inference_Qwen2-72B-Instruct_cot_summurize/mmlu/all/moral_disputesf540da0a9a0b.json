There is no inherent moral difference between killing and letting die; therefore, there is no inherent moral difference between active and passive euthanasia.\n\nRachels argues that the traditional distinction between active and passive euthanasia is not morally significant. He contends that the intentions behind the actions are what matter, not whether one actively administers a lethal dose or passively allows someone to die by withholding treatment. According to Rachels, if the intention is to relieve suffering and the outcome is the same (the patient's death), then there should be no moral difference between the two acts."
