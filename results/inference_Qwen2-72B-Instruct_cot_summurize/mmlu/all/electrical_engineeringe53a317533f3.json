This is because in the frequency domain representation (usually obtained via Laplace transform), the poles of an LC network correspond to the resonant frequencies where the impedance is purely resistive, and the zeros correspond to the anti-resonant frequencies where the impedance is either purely capacitive or purely inductive.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\nA.
