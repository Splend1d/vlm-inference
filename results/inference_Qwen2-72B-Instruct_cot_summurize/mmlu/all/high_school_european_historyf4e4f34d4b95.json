If she went to the Ancient Concert on Wednesday, having besides a concert of her own here on Monday, it would be four nights of fatigue, really exhausted as the Queen is.\nBut if Lord Melbourne thinks that as there are only to be English singers at the Ancient Concert, she ought to go, she could go there for one act; but she would much rather, if possible, get out of it, for it is a fatiguing time&\u2026.\nAs the negotiations with the Tories are quite at an end, and Lord Melbourne has been here, the Queen hopes Lord Melbourne will not object to dining with her on Sunday?\"\nThe Letters of Queen Victoria, Volume 1 (of 3), 1837-1843: A Selection from Her Majesty's Correspondence Between the Years 1837 and 1861\nThe phrase \"negotiations with the Tories\" suggests that what historical transition had been made complete?\n\nA.

                    "text": "The phrase \"negotiations with the Tories\" in the context of this letter from Queen Victoria to Lord Melbourne suggests that the historical transition which had been made complete is related to political power dynamics within the British government. Specifically, it indicates that discussions or power struggles between the Tory party (a precursor to today's Conservative Party) and the Whigs (a precursor to today's Liberal Democrats and Labour parties) had come to an end.\n\nGiven the options provided:\n\nA. The switch from a liberal-dominated to a conservative-dominated Parliament\n\nThis option aligns most closely with the context provided by the letter. The Tories were traditionally more conservative than the Whigs, and if negotiations with them were concluded, it might suggest that a period of Tory dominance was established or that some agreement was reached that solidified their role in government.\n\nB. The conversion from male-dominated politics to female-dominated politics\n\nThis option does not fit the context of the letter or the historical period. While Queen Victoria was a significant female figure in politics, the 19th century was still predominantly male-dominated, and there was no transition to female-dominated politics during her reign.\n\nC. The change from a divinely-ordained monarch to a constitutionally-approved monarch\n\nWhile the concept of divine right of kings was waning by the time of Queen Victoria's reign, she was still a constitutional monarch. However, the phrase \"negotiations with the Tories\" does not directly relate to the legitimacy of her rule or the nature of her monarchy.\n\nD. An end to war and the creation of a lasting peace\n\nThis option does not relate to the specific content of the letter, which deals with internal political matters and the Queen's social engagements.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. The switch from a liberal-dominated to a conservative-dominated Parliament"
