                    "text": "During the final days of his presidency, many of the President's Cabinet members began leaking rather embarrassing stories about the President to the press. In one such story, which appeared in a newspaper, an unidentified Cabinet member was quoted as saying that the President pardoned the owner of a professional baseball team, for a previous felony conviction because the owner promised to give the President a lifetime pass to all future games. Upset by these news \"leaks,\" the President, in his last official act, issued an executive order banning all executive employees from having conversations with members of the press unless prior permission had been obtained from an administrative supervisor. The executive order called for the dismissal of any employee willfully in violation of that order. After the President left office, the press made repeated references to the executive order and derisively referred to it as the President's legacy. Nonetheless, after the new President took office he promised to abide by the order. Thereafter one of the Vice President's senior advisers, leaked a story to a magazine stating that the Vice President told staff members that the only reason he visited a city following an earthquake was because he wanted to play golf at a nearby golf course. The magazine printed the story and named the senior adviser as the source. In compliance with civil service regulations, a hearing was conducted and the senior adviser was found to have violated the executive order barring unauthorized conununications with print media. Subsequently, the senior adviser was summarily dismissed from his executive staff position. The senior adviser brings an appropriate action seeking reinstatement and challenges the constitutionality of the executive order. If this case reaches the U. S. Supreme Court, the justices should rule the executive order is\n\nA. constitutional, because governmental employment is a privilege and not a right.\nB. constitutional, because the President has plenary power to set forth employment regulations for executive department employees.\nC. unconstitutional, because Congress, not the President, has authority to regulate the terms and conditions of federal employment.\nD. unconstitutional, because the President cannot broadly limit all executive employees' freedom of speech and association.\n"

Unconstitutional, because the President cannot broadly limit all executive employees' freedom of speech and association.\n\nWhile the President does have significant authority over executive branch employees, including setting guidelines for their conduct, those guidelines must still comply with the Constitution. In this case, the executive order appears to infringe on the First Amendment rights of executive branch employees by broadly limiting their ability to speak to the press without prior permission. This could be seen as an unconstitutional restriction on free speech, especially if the limitations are overly broad and do not serve a compelling government interest or are not narrowly tailored to meet that interest. The Supreme Court has historically protected the rights of public employees to speak out on matters of public concern, although there are limits to this protection when the speech interferes with the effective functioning of the government or violates confidentiality requirements. However, a blanket ban on all conversations with the press without permission would likely be viewed as too restrictive and not narrowly tailored enough to survive constitutional scrutiny."
