Adaptive thermogenesis\n\nAdaptive thermogenesis refers to the body's ability to adjust its heat production in response to changes in energy intake, expenditure, and environmental conditions. This mechanism helps to maintain energy homeostasis by either increasing or decreasing heat production depending on whether an individual is under- or over-nourished."
