In Scenario 1, clearing the laundry out of the washer and dryer for a roommate is considerate and cooperative behavior. In Scenario 2, advising a child to avoid friends who engage in harmful behaviors like drug use is an act of parental guidance and concern for the child's well-being. Neither action is considered morally wrong."
