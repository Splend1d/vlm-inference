In Scenario 1, showing an ID to a cashier is a normal and expected action, often required for age verification or payment purposes. In Scenario 2, hiding from a stranger in a dark alley could be seen as a self-preservation measure, given that one might feel unsafe or threatened in such a situation. Neither scenario involves actions that would be considered clearly morally wrong."
