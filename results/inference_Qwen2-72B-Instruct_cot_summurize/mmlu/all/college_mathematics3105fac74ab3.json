A function being Lebesgue integrable does not imply that it is Riemann integrable. For example, the characteristic function of the rational numbers in [0,1] is Lebesgue integrable but not Riemann integrable.\n\nB. There does not exist a countably infinite \\(E \\subset \\mathbb{R}\\) such that \\(f\\) is nondifferentiable at every \\(x \\in E\\).\n\nThis statement is not necessarily true either. The Weierstrass function is a classic counterexample to this. It is continuous everywhere but differentiable nowhere. If you restrict this function to a countable set, it will still be nondifferentiable on that set. However, the Weierstrass function is not Lebesgue integrable over the entire real line since it is not bounded, but we can construct a bounded version (by multiplying with a suitable decaying function) that would satisfy the conditions and serve as a counterexample.\n\nC. There does not exist an uncountable subset \\(E \\subset \\mathbb{R}\\) such that \\(f\\) is nondifferentiable at every \\(x \\in E\\).\n\nAgain, this is not necessarily true. Consider the Cantor-Lebesgue function, also known as the Devil's Staircase. This function is continuous, non-decreasing, and maps the unit interval onto itself. It is also singular, meaning it is nondifferentiable on the Cantor set, which is an uncountable set. Moreover, it is Lebesgue integrable over any bounded interval since it is monotonic.\n\nGiven these examples, none of the statements A, B, or C must necessarily be true for a bounded Lebesgue integrable function \\(f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}\\). Therefore, the correct answer is D. None of the above."
