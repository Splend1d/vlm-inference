The concept of an injured State is central to the law of international responsibility, which deals with the legal consequences of breaches of international obligations.\n\nThe correct answer is D. A State is considered 'injured' if the obligation breached was owed to it individually or if it was owed to a group of States, including that State, and it was specially affected. This means that the injured State has a legal interest in the breach and can claim reparation for the harm suffered. The injury may be material (e.g., loss of territory, damage to property) or moral (e.g., violation of sovereignty).\n\nOptions A and C are partially correct but do not fully capture the definition of an injured State in international law. Option B is incorrect because while a violation of a peremptory norm (jus cogens) can lead to the responsibility of the offending State towards all other States, not every State automatically becomes an 'injured State'; rather, they may have a right to demand cessation and non-repetition of the wrongful act."
