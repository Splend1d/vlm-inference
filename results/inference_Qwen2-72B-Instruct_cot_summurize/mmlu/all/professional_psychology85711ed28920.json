A dual relationship occurs when a therapist has multiple roles with a client or engages in other relationships with them outside of the therapeutic context. In this case, treating his son's teacher could potentially impact his ability to provide unbiased and effective treatment, as well as create complications regarding confidentiality and boundaries."
