                    "text": "The question seems to be about the effects of alcohol on sexual function and behavior. When Stan consumes less alcohol (in this case, only 1 beer), his level of intoxication will be lower than if he consumed more. Alcohol is a central nervous system depressant, and its effects can vary depending on the amount consumed.\n\nAmong the options provided:\n\nA. Arousal - Alcohol can initially increase feelings of relaxation and reduce anxiety, which might lead to increased arousal at low to moderate doses. However, excessive alcohol consumption can impair sexual function. With only 1 beer, it's possible that arousal might not be significantly affected or could potentially be slightly enhanced due to reduced inhibitions without the negative effects of higher doses.\n\nB. Erection - Excessive alcohol consumption can lead to erectile dysfunction by affecting the body's ability to produce nitric oxide, which is necessary for an erection. With only 1 beer, the likelihood of erectile dysfunction decreases compared to consuming more alcohol.\n\nC. Inhibition - Alcohol is known to decrease inhibitions as it acts as a depressant on the central nervous system. With only 1 beer, Stan's inhibition would likely be decreased less than if he consumed more alcohol. This means that his inhibition levels would be relatively higher than if he drank more, making this the correct answer in terms of what is DECREASED by consuming less alcohol.\n\nD. Orgasm - Alcohol can affect orgasmic function by reducing sensitivity and delaying orgasm at higher doses. With only 1 beer, the likelihood of these effects is reduced compared to consuming more alcohol.\n\nTherefore, the answer to which will be DECREASED if Stan only consumes 1 beer is:\n\nC. inhibition"
