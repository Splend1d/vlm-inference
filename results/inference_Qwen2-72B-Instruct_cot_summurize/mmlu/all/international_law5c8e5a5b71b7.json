The UDHR is a UN General Assembly resolution.\n\nThe Universal Declaration of Human Rights was adopted and proclaimed by the United Nations General Assembly on December 10, 1948. It is not a treaty but rather a declaration that sets out fundamental human rights to be universally protected. While it is not legally binding in the same way that treaties are, the UDHR has been influential in the development of international human rights law and is considered a foundational document in this area."
