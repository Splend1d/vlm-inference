The international recognition of human rights after World War II\n\nThe revival of natural law in the 20th century was significantly influenced by the international recognition of human rights following World War II. The atrocities committed during the war highlighted the need for a universal moral framework that could protect individuals from such abuses. This led to the development of international human rights instruments, such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), which were grounded in natural law principles.\n\nWhile the other events listed may have had some impact on legal and political thought, it is the focus on human rights post-World War II that most directly relates to the revival of natural law theory. Natural law posits that certain rights are inherent and universal, stemming from human nature itself, and this aligns closely with the concept of universal human rights."
