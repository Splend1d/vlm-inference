Our strength, because it gives to us rights of the public interest over private interests; our weakness, because it rallies all vicious men against us. We must smother the internal and external enemies of the Republic or perish with it; now in this situation, the first maxim of your policy ought to be to lead the people by reason and the people's enemies by terror. Terror is nothing other than justice, prompt, severe, inflexible; it is therefore an emanation of virtue; it is not so much a special principle as it is a consequence of the general principle of democracy applied to our country's most urgent needs.\nFrench revolutionary leader Maximilien Robespierre, 1794\nThe passage above appears to articulate which of the following political principles?\n\nA. From each according to his abilities, to each according to his needs\nB. Might makes right\nC. The end justifies the means\nD. The government is best that governs least\n"

He presents terror as a necessary response to the urgency of the situation, as a way to deal with the internal and external enemies who threaten the revolution. This justification of extreme measures for the greater good reflects the idea that the ends justify the means."
