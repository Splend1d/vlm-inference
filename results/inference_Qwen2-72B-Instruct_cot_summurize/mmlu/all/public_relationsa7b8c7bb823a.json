It's important to gather scientific evidence and collaborate with health authorities to ensure an accurate diagnosis.\n\n2. **Stop all sales of the product throughout the nation and issue a recall for that product** (Option B): Given that the product is sold nationwide and the contamination has already affected consumers, a nationwide recall is necessary to prevent further harm. This action demonstrates responsibility and concern for consumer safety, which can help mitigate damage to the brand's reputation.\n\nAdditionally, I would recommend:\n\n3. **Communicate transparently and proactively with the public and media**: Issue a press release acknowledging the problem, detailing the steps being taken (investigation, recall), and expressing sincere apologies and commitment to resolving the issue. Keep the communication lines open by providing regular updates as more information becomes available.\n\n4. **Set up a dedicated hotline and website section for consumer inquiries**: This will allow concerned customers to get information about the recall and how to return the product for a refund or replacement.\n\n5. **Work closely with retailers to remove the product from shelves**: Ensure that all retailers are notified immediately and provided with clear instructions on how to handle returned products.\n\n6. **Plan a corrective action strategy**: Once the investigation is complete, implement measures to prevent future occurrences, such as improving quality control processes, enhancing supplier standards, and increasing product testing.\n\n7. **Consider compensation for affected consumers**: Offer compensation or goodwill gestures to those who have been affected, which could include refunds, free product replacements, or discounts on future purchases.\n\nBy taking these steps, the corporation can demonstrate its commitment to consumer safety and work towards restoring trust and confidence in the brand."
