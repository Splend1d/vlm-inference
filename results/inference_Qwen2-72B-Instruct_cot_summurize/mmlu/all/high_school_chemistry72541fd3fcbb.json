The entropy of the system increases due to the separation of the electron from its atom.\nC.

                    "text": "The correct answer is C. Energy contained in the light can be used to overcome the Coulombic attraction between electrons and the nucleus.\n\nDuring photoelectron spectroscopy, high-energy photons (light) are absorbed by the atoms or molecules being studied. This absorbed energy can be sufficient to overcome the electrostatic force that holds the electrons in their orbitals around the nucleus. When this occurs, one or more electrons may be ejected from the atom or molecule, resulting in the formation of positive ions (cations). Since the process of ionization typically requires an input of energy (endothermic), it is not thermodynamically favored under normal conditions. However, in the context of photoelectron spectroscopy, the external energy provided by the light allows for the ionization to occur despite this thermodynamic barrier."
