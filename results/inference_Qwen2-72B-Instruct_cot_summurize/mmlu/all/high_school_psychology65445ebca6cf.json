Beck's negative triad is a concept in cognitive theory that describes how individuals with depression may have negative thoughts or beliefs about themselves, the world, and the future. This triad of negative thoughts contributes to the maintenance of depressive symptoms. The therapy that this concept is most closely associated with is Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), which is a form of cognitive therapy. CBT aims to help individuals identify and challenge these negative thought patterns to alleviate depression and other mental health issues."
