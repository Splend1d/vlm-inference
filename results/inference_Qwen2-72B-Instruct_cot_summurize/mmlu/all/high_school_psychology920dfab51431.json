The anxiety reaction of a woman who is driving on the highway for the first time after being involved in a major accident on that highway\n\nThis response is most likely acquired through classical conditioning because it involves an association between two stimuli (driving on the highway and the memory/emotional response to the previous accident) leading to a conditioned emotional response (anxiety). The other responses are more likely due to innate reactions or reflexes rather than learned associations."
