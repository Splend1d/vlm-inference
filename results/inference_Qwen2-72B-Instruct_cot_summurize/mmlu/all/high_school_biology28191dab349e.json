However, since natural selection cannot act on something that isn't passed to the next generation, the smallest unit that can be changed by natural selection is an individual's genotype (option D). But it's important to note that this change is observed at the level of a population's gene frequency (option B) over time, as successful genotypes become more common in the population due to their greater reproductive success. So while the answer to your question would technically be D, it's crucial to understand that the effect of natural selection is seen at the population level."
