Stiff neck (nuchal rigidity) can be caused by various conditions including meningitis, but it can also be due to muscle strain, torticollis, or other non-life-threatening causes.\n\nB. Severe pain does not necessarily indicate a life-threatening cause. While severe headache can be a symptom of serious conditions like aneurysm, stroke, or brain tumor, it can also result from less serious conditions such as migraine or tension headache.\n\nC. Temporal arteritis (giant cell arteritis) is not strongly associated with rheumatoid arthritis. Temporal arteritis is a type of vasculitis that affects the lining of the arteries, particularly those in the head, while rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease that primarily affects joints.\n\nD. Tension headaches are indeed a common cause of headache, characterized by mild to moderate pain that feels like a tight band around the head. They are often related to stress, depression, anxiety, or muscle strain."
