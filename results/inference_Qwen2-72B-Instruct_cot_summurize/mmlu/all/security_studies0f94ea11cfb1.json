Security systems are detrimental to usability and can make IT systems less functional, and therefore less attractive to the consumer.\nC. There is pressure to reduce the time it takes to get a new IT product or system onto the market, so security systems are sacrificed in order to reduce the time-to-market.\nD. All of these options.\n"

All of these options.\n\nEach of the mentioned obstacles contributes significantly to the challenge of developing robust IT security in the context of commerce and marketing:\n\nA. Lack of direct return on investment: Companies may prioritize investments that offer immediate financial returns over those that provide long-term benefits like enhanced security. Security measures often require significant upfront costs without a clear, immediate financial benefit, making them less appealing in budgeting decisions.\n\nB. Security vs. Usability: Strong security measures can sometimes lead to reduced usability for end-users, which can negatively impact customer satisfaction and sales. This trade-off between security and convenience can make companies hesitant to implement stringent security protocols that might deter potential customers.\n\nC. Time-to-market pressures: In highly competitive markets, there's a constant push to release products quickly to gain an edge over competitors. This can lead to cutting corners on security testing and implementation to expedite the launch process. The rush to market may result in vulnerabilities being overlooked, which could later be exploited by cybercriminals.\n\nAll three factors play a role in hindering the development and implementation of comprehensive IT security strategies within commercial and marketing environments."
