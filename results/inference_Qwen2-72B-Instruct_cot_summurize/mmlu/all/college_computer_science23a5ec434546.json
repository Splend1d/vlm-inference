                    "text": "The six-bit numbers in question are 011000 and 011000. Let's examine each representation to determine if an overflow occurs when adding these numbers.\n\n### Two's Complement\n\nIn two's complement, the most significant bit (MSB) represents the sign. For positive numbers, the MSB is 0. The binary number 011000 is positive and its decimal equivalent is +24 (2^5 = 32; 2^4 = 16; total = 24).\n\nWhen we add 011000 + 011000, we get:\n\n```\n  011000\n+ 011000\n------\n 1001000\n```\n\nSince we're dealing with six bits, the result should be truncated to fit into six bits, so the actual result would be 001000, which is +8. However, because the addition resulted in a carry out of the most significant bit, this indicates an overflow has occurred since both operands were positive and the result was supposed to remain within the positive range of representable numbers.\n\n### One's Complement\n\nOne's complement also uses the MSB as the sign bit, but it represents negative numbers by inverting all the bits of the positive counterpart. Adding two positive numbers should not change the sign bit. However, in one's complement, there's an additional rule: if there's a carry out of the most significant bit, you need to perform an end-around carry, which means you add the carry back into the least significant bit (LSB).\n\nFor our case, adding 011000 + 011000 results in a carry out of the most significant bit, similar to two's complement. Since we're working with six bits, the result would be 100100, but due to the end-around carry rule, we would add the extra 1 to the LSB, resulting in 100101. This still indicates an overflow because the original numbers were positive, and the operation should have remained within the positive range.\n\n### Sign and Magnitude\n\nSign and magnitude simply uses the MSB as a sign bit and the rest for the magnitude. So, adding 011000 + 011000 would yield 100100, which would represent -28 in sign and magnitude, indicating an overflow since the original numbers were positive.\n\nThus, in all three representations, there is an overflow when adding the numbers 011000 and 011000.\n\n**Answer: D.
