Negligence.\n\nWhen a CPA fails to meet the standards of due care in conducting an audit, and this failure results in harm to third parties who rely on the financial statements, the CPA can be held liable for negligence. Under negligence law, a professional like a CPA owes a duty of care to those who might reasonably be expected to rely on their work. If the CPA breaches that duty by not following proper auditing standards and a third party suffers damages as a result, the CPA may be held liable for those damages.\n\nStrict liability (A) does not apply because it does not require proof of fault or breach of duty. Breach of contract (B) is not applicable because there is no direct contractual relationship between the CPA and the third parties. Gross negligence (D) could potentially apply if the CPA's actions were significantly more reckless than ordinary negligence would imply, but the question specifically asks about a \"reckless departure,\" which is generally covered under negligence law."
