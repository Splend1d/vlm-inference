The individual experiences real and significant distress about these symptoms, which often lead to frequent doctor visits and extensive medical testing. Despite the lack of a medical diagnosis to explain their symptoms, individuals with somatoform disorders genuinely believe they have a physical ailment. Examples of somatoform disorders include somatization disorder, conversion disorder, and body dysmorphic disorder."
