A PET scan can show areas of high and low metabolic activity in the brain, which can help identify which hemisphere is more active during language tasks. This type of scan is often used in research to study brain function and can provide valuable information about brain activity patterns.\n\nA. CAT (Computed Tomography) scans provide detailed images of the structures inside the body but do not show brain function.\nB. MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) provides detailed images of the brain's structure but does not directly measure brain function either.\nD. MMPI (Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory) is a standardized psychometric test used to assess personality traits and psychopathology, not brain function or lateralization."
