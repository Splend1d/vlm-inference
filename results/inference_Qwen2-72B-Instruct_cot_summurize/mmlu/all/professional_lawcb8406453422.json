Near the edge of the field, a woman was sitting in a beach chair and reading a book. The girl threw the ball too far, and it went over her friends' heads and flew toward the woman. Although the woman did not see the ball coming, it hit the straw hat that the woman was wearing, knocking it from her head. Although the woman was not touched by the ball, she was startled by the ball hitting her hat, and she fell from her chair and broke her arm. If the woman initiates a suit against the girl to recover damages for her broken arm, the woman will\n\nA. recover for assault only.\nB. recover for battery only.\nC. recover for assault and battery.\nD. not recover.\n"

Assault is an intentional act that causes a reasonable apprehension of imminent harmful or offensive contact, and battery is the actual harmful or offensive contact resulting from an intentional act. Here, the girl did not intend to throw the ball at the woman, nor was there any intent to cause harm or offensive contact. Additionally, since the ball did not touch the woman, there was no battery.\n\nHowever, the woman might have grounds for a negligence claim if she can prove that the girl's actions were careless and that the carelessness led directly to her injury. But based on the options given, the correct answer under the context of assault and battery is D. not recover."
