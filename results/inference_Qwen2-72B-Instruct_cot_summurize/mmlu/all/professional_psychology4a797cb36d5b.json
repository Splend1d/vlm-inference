This discomfort motivates them to reduce the dissonance by changing their attitudes, beliefs, or behaviors. In the context of forced compliance, where an individual is made to act in a way that is inconsistent with their beliefs, the theory predicts that individuals will experience cognitive dissonance and may change their beliefs to align with their actions, especially when the compliance is accompanied by a small reward.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nC. when compliance is accompanied by a small reward\n\nThis is because a small reward does not provide sufficient justification for the inconsistency between the person's actions and beliefs, leading to greater dissonance and a stronger motivation to reduce it through belief change. A large reward, on the other hand, can serve as external justification for the behavior, reducing the need to change one's beliefs to align with the action."
