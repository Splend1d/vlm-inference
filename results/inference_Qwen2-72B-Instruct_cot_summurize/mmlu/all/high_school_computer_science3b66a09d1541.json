The program can also be expressed as binary code, but will be more easily understood by humans when expressed in a higher-level programming language.\n\nThis statement is true because a program written in a high-level programming language can indeed be compiled or interpreted into binary code (machine code) that a computer can execute directly. However, binary code is not easily readable or understandable by humans, making it difficult to write, debug, and maintain programs in that form. High-level languages provide abstractions that make programming easier for humans while still allowing the code to be translated into machine-executable form."
