The other options can indeed complicate pipelining:\n\nA. Condition codes set by every instruction can lead to data dependencies that stall the pipeline.\nB. Variable-length encoding of instructions can make it difficult to fetch and decode instructions efficiently in a pipelined processor.\nC. Instructions requiring widely varying numbers of cycles to execute can cause pipeline bubbles or stalls when shorter instructions follow longer ones."
