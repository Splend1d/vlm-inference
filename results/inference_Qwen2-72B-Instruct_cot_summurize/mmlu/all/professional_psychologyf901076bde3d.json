Humanistic psychologists such as Carl Rogers and Abraham Maslow emphasize that individuals have an inherent drive toward self-actualization and personal growth. When this potential is blocked by various factors such as negative experiences, societal pressures, or internal conflicts, it can lead to psychological distress and dysfunction.\n\nAdditionally, the concept of \"dis-integration\" refers to a state where an individual's sense of self is fragmented or disrupted, which can also contribute to psychological issues. Humanistic therapists aim to help clients overcome these blocks and reintegrate their sense of self in order to facilitate personal growth and well-being.\n\nOptions C and D (unresolved conflicts and severe trauma) are also significant factors in psychopathology from other psychological perspectives, such as psychodynamic theory and trauma-informed approaches. However, they are not the primary focus of humanistic psychotherapy."
