The patient and his family immigrated to the United States 2 months ago and he has not been evaluated by a physician in 4 years. He has been generally healthy. Medical history is significant for pneumonia at age 3 years. He takes no medications. He is at the 25th percentile for height, weight, and BMI. Vital signs are temperature 37.0\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), pulse 82/min, respirations 20/min, and blood pressure 112/74 mm Hg. Cardiac examination discloses a grade 3/6 systolic murmur audible along the left sternal border at the third and fourth intercostal spaces. Femoral pulses are weak and brachial pulses are strong; there is a radiofemoral delay. Chest xray discloses mild cardiomegaly with left ventricular prominence. ECG shows left ventricular hypertrophy. This patient is at greatest risk for which of the following complications?\n\nA. Atrial fibrillation\nB. Cor pulmonale\nC. Systemic hypertension\nD. Tricuspid valve regurgitation\n"

                    "text": "The patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest that he may have a congenital heart defect, specifically aortic coarctation. This condition can lead to several complications, but the most likely complication in this case is systemic hypertension (option C). Aortic coarctation causes narrowing of the aorta, leading to increased resistance to blood flow and subsequently increased blood pressure in the upper body. This can cause a radiofemoral delay, as observed in the physical examination, due to the difference in blood pressure between the arms and legs. Additionally, the left ventricular hypertrophy seen on the ECG is consistent with chronic hypertension. The other options listed (atrial fibrillation, cor pulmonale, and tricuspid valve regurgitation) are less likely in this case given the patient's age and the specific findings on examination."
