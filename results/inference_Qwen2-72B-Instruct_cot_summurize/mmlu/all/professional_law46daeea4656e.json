He and his associate occupy the first floor for their architectural business. In June 2005, the architect entered into a valid and binding written lease with a tenant to rent the second floor office space for four years at a monthly rental of $5,000. The lease contained a provision wherein the architect was required to repaint the second floor premises after two years of occupancy. On June 1, 2007, the tenant sent the architect a written letter requesting the repainting of the second-floor office space. The architect made no reply and failed to perform the repainting as the lease required. The cost of repainting the tenant's office was estimated at $1,750. On July 1, 2008, the architect had still not repainted the premises. The following day, the tenant moved out, mailed the keys to the architect, and refused to pay any more rent. The lease was silent as to the rights and remedies of the tenant due to the architect's failure to perform the repainting. There is no applicable statute in the jurisdiction. In an appropriate action by the architect against the tenant for the rent due, the architect will\n\nA. win, because there was no constructive eviction.\nB. n, because the tenant had the remedy of self-help.\nC. lose, because he cannot maintain an action for rent while in breach of an express covenant.\nD. lose, because the obligation to pay rent is dependent on the architect's performance of his express covenant.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer would be D. lose, because the obligation to pay rent is dependent on the architect's performance of his express covenant.\n\nIn this situation, the architect has breached an express covenant of the lease agreement by failing to repaint the second floor premises as stipulated. This breach could potentially relieve the tenant from the obligation to pay rent if it can be demonstrated that the breach substantially interfered with the tenant's use and enjoyment of the premises. However, the specific legal doctrine that would apply here is that the obligation to pay rent is often considered conditional upon the landlord's compliance with the terms of the lease. Since the architect failed to fulfill his contractual duty, the tenant may have a defense against the payment of rent under the principle that the tenant's duty to pay rent is dependent on the landlord's fulfillment of his obligations under the lease. \n\nIt's important to note that the specific outcome would depend on the interpretation of the lease terms and the laws of the jurisdiction where the property is located. Without applicable statutes or further clarification in the lease regarding remedies for breach, the court might view the architect's failure to repaint as a material breach that excuses the tenant from further rent payments."
