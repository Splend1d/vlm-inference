Although the verb \"gived\" is not correct, the sentence demonstrates an attempt at using grammatical rules to construct a sentence. Young children often make errors like this as they learn the complex rules of their native language. They understand that verbs need to be in the past tense when describing something that has already happened (as in \"Mommy gave me a cookie\"), but they have not yet mastered all the irregular forms and exceptions in the language's grammar.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that this sentence also involves C. holophrases, which are single words used to convey a complete thought or idea. In this case, \"Mommy\" and \"cookie\" could each be considered holophrases if used by a very young child who has not yet developed the ability to combine words into sentences. But since the question focuses on what the given sentence best illustrates, the answer is D. grammar."
