However, it's important to test any stain removal method on a small, inconspicuous area first to ensure it doesn't damage or discolor the fabric.\n\nA. Baking soda can be used for cleaning and deodorizing but is not particularly effective against ink stains.\nB. Nail polish is not suitable for removing ink stains; in fact, it might make the situation worse by adding another layer of stain.\nD. Butter is typically used for greasy stains and would not be effective against ink."
