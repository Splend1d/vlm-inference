Your friends make a music CD that doesn't sell any copies.\n\nGDP (Gross Domestic Product) measures the total value of all goods and services produced within a country in a given time period. When goods are produced but not sold, they do not contribute to GDP until they are sold or counted as inventory investment. Since the music CDs were made but did not sell any copies, there is no transaction involving these goods that would be included in GDP calculations for that period. However, if resources were used to produce the CDs (like labor, materials, etc.), those costs would have been included in GDP when the production took place as part of the investment component of GDP. But since the question seems to focus on the final product's sale, option C is correct under the assumption that unsold goods do not directly contribute to GDP through sales."
