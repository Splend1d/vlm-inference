The pedestrian must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the painting company was negligent.\nC.

The pedestrian must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the painting company was negligent.\n\nIn civil cases like this one, the standard of proof required is usually \"preponderance of the evidence,\" which means more likely than not (over 50% likelihood). This is in contrast to criminal cases where the standard is \"beyond a reasonable doubt.\" The burden is on the plaintiff (the pedestrian) to prove that the defendant (the painting company) was negligent, which typically involves demonstrating that the company had a duty of care, breached that duty, and caused harm as a result. \n\nRegarding option D, while res ipsa loquitur (\"the thing speaks for itself\") can sometimes shift the burden of proof in certain circumstances where the cause of an accident is within the exclusive control of the defendant and the accident is of a type that does not occur without negligence, it does not create a \"rebuttable presumption\" of negligence. Instead, it allows the plaintiff to infer negligence from the very occurrence of the accident under certain conditions, but the ultimate burden of proving negligence remains with the plaintiff."
