Federal budget entitlements\n\nEntitlement programs, such as Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, do not require annual appropriations because they are mandatory spending programs established by law. Eligibility for these programs is determined by specific criteria, and benefits must be paid to anyone who meets those criteria. Therefore, Congress does not need to pass an appropriations bill for entitlements; the spending occurs automatically based on the number of eligible beneficiaries."
