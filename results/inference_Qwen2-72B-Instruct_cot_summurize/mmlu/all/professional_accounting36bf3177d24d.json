However, the land was subject to a $24,000 mortgage that was assumed by Ace. This mortgage relief is treated as boot received by Strom, which could potentially create taxable gain if it exceeds his basis in the property contributed.\n\nThe calculation for Strom's basis in the partnership interest would be:\n\n- Basis of property contributed: $16,000\n- Fair market value of property contributed: $50,000 (not used in this calculation)\n- Liabilities assumed by the partnership: $24,000\n\nFirst, we calculate Strom's gain on the transaction:\n- Gain = Fair Market Value - Adjusted Basis = $50,000 - $16,000 = $34,000\n\nHowever, because the partnership assumed the $24,000 mortgage, Strom realizes $24,000 of this gain tax-free (as debt relief). The remaining $10,000 ($34,000 - $24,000) of gain is realized but may or may not be recognized depending on other factors not mentioned here.\n\nFor the purpose of determining Strom's basis in the partnership, we only consider the basis of the property contributed and the liabilities assumed by the partnership.\n\nStrom's basis in the partnership would then be the lesser of his adjusted basis in the property contributed ($16,000) plus any gain recognized on the transaction (which in this case is zero since the full gain was offset by the mortgage relief), or the fair market value of the property contributed less liabilities assumed by the partnership ($50,000 - $24,000 = $26,000).\n\nTherefore, Strom's basis in Ace would be the lesser of $16,000 + $0 (gain recognized) or $26,000, which is $16,000.\n\nHowever, under IRS regulations, when a partner contributes property to a partnership and the partnership assumes a liability that exceeds the partner's adjusted basis in the contributed property, the partner's basis in the partnership interest is zero. This rule prevents the partner from getting a tax benefit from contributing overleveraged property.\n\nSo, given the rules and the information provided, Strom's basis in Ace would actually be:\n\nA. $0\n\nThis is because the liability assumed by the partnership ($24,000) exceeds Strom's adjusted basis in the property ($16,000)."
