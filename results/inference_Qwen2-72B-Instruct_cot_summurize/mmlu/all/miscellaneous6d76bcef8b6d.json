The molar mass of \\(O_2\\) is approximately \\(2 \\times 16.00 = 32.00\\) g/mol.\n\nLet \\(x\\) be the number of grams of \\(O_2\\) that contains the same number of molecules as 36.0 grams of water:\n\n\\[2.0\\ moles\\ of\\ H_2O = \\frac{x\\ g\\ of\\ O_2}{32.00\\ g/mol}\\]\n\n\\[2.0 = \\frac{x}{32.00}\\]\n\nSolving for \\(x\\):\n\n\\[x = 2.0 \\times 32.00 = 64.0\\ grams\\]\n\nThus, the correct answer is **A. 64.0 grams**."
