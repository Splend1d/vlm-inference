Gather data from all relevant sources.\n3. Analyze the data and compare it against benchmarks or previous performance.\n4. Report findings and make recommendations for improvement.\n5. Implement changes and repeat the process.\n\nPre-testing of strategy and tactics should ideally be carried out before full-scale implementation, which aligns with step 2 where data gathering occurs. However, the direct application of pre-testing within this model is not explicitly mentioned in these steps. Pre-testing can be seen as a part of the planning phase, which could fit into step 1 where objectives are set, or as part of the data gathering phase, which would place it under step 2. \n\nGiven that pre-testing is a form of data gathering to assess the potential effectiveness of strategies and tactics before full-scale deployment, it makes more sense to consider it as part of step 2, where data is gathered from all relevant sources.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. 2\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the model does not explicitly mention pre-testing, so this placement is an interpretation based on the nature of the activities typically associated with each step."
