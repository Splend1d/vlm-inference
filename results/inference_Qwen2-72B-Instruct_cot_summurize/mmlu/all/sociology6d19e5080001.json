The introduction of compulsory education in the 19th century was a significant factor in defining childhood as a distinct life stage that required specific types of care and attention. This period also saw an increase in emotional ties between parents and children, with children being seen as more than just economic assets or future workers. Additionally, the emergence of new consumer goods for children, such as clothes, toys, and books, contributed to the creation of a separate culture for children, further reinforcing the idea of childhood as a distinct phase of life. Therefore, all of these factors have played a role in the social construction of childhood."
