Both men and women experience hair loss, though the patterns and prevalence may differ.\n\nB. The term \"more systematic\" is not clear in this context. However, it's true that male pattern baldness follows a more predictable pattern compared to female hair loss, which can be more diffuse.\n\nC. This statement is also incorrect. While the rate of hair loss might vary from person to person, it is not necessarily true that women lose hair more rapidly than men. In fact, male pattern baldness often progresses more quickly than female pattern hair loss.\n\nD. Environmental factors can contribute to hair loss, but they are not the only cause. Genetic predisposition, hormonal changes, medical conditions, medications, and lifestyle factors can all play a role.\n\nIn summary, hair loss affects both men and women, and while genetic factors are often significant, environmental and other factors can also contribute."
