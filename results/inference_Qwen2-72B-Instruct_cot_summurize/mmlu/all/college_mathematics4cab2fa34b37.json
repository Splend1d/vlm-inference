They can choose any 2 out of the 20 courses, which gives us \\(\\binom{20}{2}\\) ways to assign those two courses to the first professor. After assigning 2 courses to the first professor, we have 18 courses left.\n\nThe second professor can then choose any 2 out of the remaining 18 courses, which gives us \\(\\binom{18}{2}\\) ways to assign those two courses to the second professor. After assigning 2 courses to the second professor, we have 16 courses left.\n\nWe continue this process until we have assigned all 10 professors their 2 courses each. So, the number of ways to assign the courses is:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{20}{2} \\times \\binom{18}{2} \\times \\cdots \\times \\binom{2}{2}\n\\]\n\nThis can be simplified using the definition of combinations and factorials:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{20!}{2!18!} \\times \\frac{18!}{2!16!} \\times \\cdots \\times \\frac{2!}{2!0!}\n\\]\n\nNotice that in the product, most of the factorials cancel out, leaving us with:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{20!}{2^{10}}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. \\(20!/2^{10}\\)"
