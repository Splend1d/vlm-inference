She argues that moral actions cannot be adequately judged solely by their outcomes but must also take into account the agent's intentions and the means used to achieve those outcomes. This distinction is crucial in her view for understanding the morality of actions. The other options (B and C) do not accurately represent Anscombe's criticisms of Sidgwick."
