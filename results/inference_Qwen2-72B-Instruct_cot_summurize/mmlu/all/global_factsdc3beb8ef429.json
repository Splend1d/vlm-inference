For example, the 1970 Bhola cyclone and flood in East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) is estimated to have killed between 300,000 and 500,000 people, making it one of the deadliest natural disasters of the 20th century. However, it's worth noting that the exact number of deaths caused by each type of disaster can be difficult to determine and may vary depending on the source."
