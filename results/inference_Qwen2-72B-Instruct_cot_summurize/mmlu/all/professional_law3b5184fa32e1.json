The friend, the son, the daughter, and any additional children of the sister born within 21 years after the death of the deceased son.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe original conveyance created a fee simple determinable estate in the friend, with a subsequent limitation in favor of the children of the sister who reach the age of 25 if the property is ever used for church purposes. This type of conveyance is known as a fee simple subject to a condition subsequent. However, because of the rule against perpetuities, any interest that vests must do so within 21 years after some life in being at the creation of the interest. In this case, the life in being is the sister, and the interest in her children must vest, if at all, no later than 21 years after her death.\n\nBecause the sister had two sons after the conveyance, those sons became vested remaindermen in the property when they reached the age of 25. When one of the sons died, his interest passed to his heirs. The sister subsequently had a daughter, who would also become a vested remainderman when she reaches the age of 25. Any additional children of the sister born within 21 years after the death of the deceased son could also become vested remaindermen upon reaching the age of 25.\n\nTherefore, the current owners of the property are the friend, who holds the fee simple determinable estate, and the surviving son, the daughter, and any additional children of the sister born within 21 years after the death of the deceased son, who hold vested remainders subject to the condition that the property not be used for church purposes. If the property is used for church purposes, the estate will automatically revert to the grantor or the grantor's heirs."
