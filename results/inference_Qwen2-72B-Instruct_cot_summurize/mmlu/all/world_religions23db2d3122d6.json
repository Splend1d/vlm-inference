Palestine and Babylonia\n\nAfter the Bar Kochba revolt in the 2nd century CE, which resulted in the Romans suppressing the revolt and exiling many Jews from Judea, the two main centers for Jewish development became Palestine (specifically the region of Galilee) and Babylonia (modern-day Iraq). These regions became significant for the development of Jewish religious thought, scholarship, and the creation of key Jewish texts such as the Talmud."
