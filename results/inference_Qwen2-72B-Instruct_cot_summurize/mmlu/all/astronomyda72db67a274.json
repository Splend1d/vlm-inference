When sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere, it collides with molecules and small particles in the air. Sunlight is made up of different colors, each of which has a different wavelength. Blue light waves are shorter and encounter more resistance from the gases and particles in the atmosphere, causing them to scatter in all directions. This scattering of blue light is what gives the sky its blue color during the day."
