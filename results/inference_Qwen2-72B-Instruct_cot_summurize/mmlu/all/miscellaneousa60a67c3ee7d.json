The SEC is a U.S. government agency that regulates the securities industry and protects investors by enforcing federal securities laws. It oversees the nation's stock and options exchanges, as well as other electronic financial networks, and works to ensure that companies provide accurate information to investors. The SEC also investigates and prosecutes violations of securities laws, such as insider trading and accounting fraud.\n\nAAA (American Automobile Association) is a federation of motor clubs in North America, NBA (National Basketball Association) is a professional basketball league in North America, and MADD (Mothers Against Drunk Driving) is a non-profit organization that aims to stop drunk driving and support victims of this crime. None of these organizations are responsible for protecting investors."
