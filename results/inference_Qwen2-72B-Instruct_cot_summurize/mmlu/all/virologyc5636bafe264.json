It ensures that participants are fully aware of the nature of the research, its potential risks and benefits, and their rights as participants, including the right to withdraw at any time without penalty. This principle respects the autonomy of individuals and is a cornerstone of ethical research practices. While all the other options listed (beneficence, justice, and a methodologically sound study design) are also crucial components of ethical research, informed consent is fundamental to ensuring that the rights and welfare of human subjects are protected."
