Consequentialist theory.\n\nConsequentialist theories evaluate the morality of an action based on its consequences, and in particular, whether those consequences increase or decrease the amount of overall intrinsic value in the world. Therefore, a consequentialist approach to the morality of abortion would consider how much overall intrinsic value is likely to be brought about by allowing or prohibiting abortions. \n\nVirtue ethics focuses on the character of the person performing the action, Kantian ethics emphasizes the importance of following moral rules and duties, and natural law theory looks to nature as a guide for determining what is morally right or wrong. None of these approaches would necessarily focus on the overall intrinsic value brought about by abortion."
