The distinction between limited force and full-scale force is the second process of coercive diplomacy. Coercive diplomacy only fails if the coercer fails to achieve its defined goals and fails to defeat its adversary in the second stage.\nB. Generally the distinction between brute and limited force is negligible. Resort to air or sea power constitutes an equal coercive capacity to a conventional ground offensive. Military action always results from a failure of negotiations and from a shift from the diplomatic to the military sphere.\nC. The distinction between limited force and brute force is important because the amount of force that is used to attain the coercer's interests defines the type of outcome that is achieved. If a positive policy outcome is achieved, then we can say that limited force has been employed.\nD. The distinction between limited force and full-scale war is crucial because resort to brute force means that diplomacy has failed. The distinction is not based on the amount of force or the type, but on the purpose that the use of force seeks to accomplish and the element of choice left to the adversary. In essence, limited force is a bargaining tool.\n"

In essence, limited force is a bargaining tool.\n\nLimited force is typically used as a way to signal intent or to demonstrate resolve without escalating to full-scale war. It can involve targeted strikes, limited ground operations, or other forms of military action that are designed to achieve specific objectives while leaving room for further negotiation or diplomacy. Full-scale force, on the other hand, involves the use of all available military resources in an effort to defeat the enemy completely and achieve a decisive victory. This level of force is typically reserved for situations where all other options have been exhausted and there is no other way to achieve the desired outcome."
