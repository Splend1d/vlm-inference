Adhesion plaques, also known as focal adhesions, are structures that anchor cells to the extracellular matrix and play a role in cell migration and mechanotransduction. They are not directly involved in receptor-mediated endocytosis or cholesterol uptake.\n\nCellular uptake of cholesterol occurs through receptor-mediated endocytosis, which involves the following steps:\n\n1. LDL (low-density lipoprotein) binds to specific cell-surface receptors (option A).\n2. The receptor-ligand complex is internalized into the cell via clathrin-coated pits, leading to endosome formation (options C and D).\n3. The endosome matures and fuses with lysosomes, where the cholesterol is released and transported to other parts of the cell for use or storage.\n\nThus, options A, C, and D are all directly involved in the process of cholesterol uptake, while option B (adhesion plaques) is not."
