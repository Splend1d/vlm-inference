There is an average of $15,000 in wealth to every family in America. That is right here today.\nWe do not propose to divide it up equally. We do not propose a division of wealth, but we do propose to limit poverty that we will allow to be inflicted on any man's family. We will not say we are going to try to guarantee any equality \u2026 but we do say that one third of the average is low enough for any one family to hold, that there should be a guarantee of a family wealth of around $5,000; enough for a home, an automobile, a radio, and the ordinary conveniences, and the opportunity to educate their children.\u2026\nWe will have to limit fortunes. Our present plan is that we will allow no man to own more than $50,000,000. We think that with that limit we will be able to carry out the balance of the program.\n\u2014Senator Huey P. Long of Louisiana, Radio Address, February 23, 1934\nSenator Huey P. Long's \"Share the Wealth Society\" was a political program intended to\n\nA. demonstrate Senator Long's commitment to fighting communism.\nB. return the United States to the economic ideas of the late nineteenth century.\nC. persuade voters that Senator Long had a plan to combat the Great Depression.\nD. showcase Senator Long's understanding of the constitutional ideas of the Founding Fathers.\n"

Long was a populist political program designed to address the extreme economic inequality and poverty experienced during the Great Depression. By advocating for limits on individual wealth and proposing a minimum standard of living for all families, Long sought to appeal to the large number of Americans who were suffering economically and looking for solutions to the nation's economic crisis."
