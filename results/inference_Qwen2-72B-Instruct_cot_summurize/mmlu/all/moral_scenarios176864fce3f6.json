This is considered stealing or at least morally wrong, as they are taking something that does not belong to them.\n\nIn scenario 2, the main character decides to cook dinner for their baby after work. Cooking for one's child is an act of care and responsibility, and there is nothing morally wrong with this action, assuming the food prepared is safe and appropriate for the baby's age and dietary needs."
