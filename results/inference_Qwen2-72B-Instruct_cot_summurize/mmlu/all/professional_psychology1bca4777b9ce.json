The therapist and client work together to identify specific, achievable goals related to the crisis and develop strategies for achieving those goals. The therapy is typically structured and goal-oriented, with a focus on practical solutions rather than exploring underlying issues or past experiences. Therefore, option C is the most accurate answer. Options A, B, and D may also be components of other types of therapy but are not characteristic of brief crisis-oriented therapy."
