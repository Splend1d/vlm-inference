As they reached the car, a defendant, who was visibly intoxicated, emerged from behind a trash can and approached them. The defendant knocked the brother to the ground and hit him over the head with a trash can, causing the brother to lose consciousness. The defendant then forced the sister into the car and raped her. The defendant is charged with assault with intent to commit rape, based on his attack on the brother. The defendant's best defense would be which of the following statements?\n\nA. Although the sister was only 15 years old, she appeared to be 16 years old to a reasonable man.\nB. The defendant did not intend to rape the sister.\nC. The defendant's intoxication at the time negated the required general intent.\nD. It is impossible to prove that the defendant was the perpetrator because the parking lot was dimly lit.\n"

                    "text": "The defendant's best defense would likely be:\n\nB. The defendant did not intend to rape the sister.\n\nThis is because the charge of assault with intent to commit rape requires proof that the defendant had the specific intent to commit rape when he assaulted the brother. If the defendant can argue that he did not have this specific intent, it could potentially weaken the prosecution's case for this particular charge.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the other defenses listed are unlikely to be successful under these circumstances:\n\nA. The age of the sister and her appearance are irrelevant to the charge of assault with intent to commit rape against the brother.\n\nC. Intoxication is generally not a defense to specific intent crimes like assault with intent to commit rape, especially if the intoxication was voluntary. In some jurisdictions, voluntary intoxication may negate specific intent, but it does not negate general intent, and it certainly does not excuse the commission of violent crimes.\n\nD. The lighting conditions might affect the reliability of eyewitness identification, but it does not necessarily make it impossible to prove the defendant's identity as the perpetrator. Other evidence, such as DNA or physical evidence, could still link the defendant to the crime."
