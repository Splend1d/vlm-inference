This concept is encapsulated in Maxwell's equations, specifically in the Amp\u00e8re-Maxwell law which states that the line integral of the magnetic field around a closed loop is equal to the sum of the electric current passing through the surface bounded by the loop and the rate of change of the electric flux through that surface. This latter term is known as the displacement current."
