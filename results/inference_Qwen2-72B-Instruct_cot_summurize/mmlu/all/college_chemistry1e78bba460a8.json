This technique reduces random errors by canceling out variations that occur randomly from one measurement to another.\n\nAveraging the results from multiple samples (III) is similar to signal averaging but applies to different samples instead of repeated measurements of the same sample. By taking multiple samples and averaging their results, you can mitigate the effects of random errors that might be present in any single sample.\n\nThe use of internal standards (II) helps to correct for systematic errors rather than random errors. Internal standards provide a reference point within the analytical procedure to account for variations in instrument performance, sample preparation, or other factors that could introduce consistent biases across multiple measurements. While useful for controlling systematic errors, it does not directly address random errors."
