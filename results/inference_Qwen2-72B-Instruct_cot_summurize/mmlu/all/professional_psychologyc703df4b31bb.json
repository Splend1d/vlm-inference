This consistency and confidence can lead to the reevaluation of the majority's position and potentially result in attitude change.\n\nMoscovici argued that for a minority to be influential, its members must:\n\n1. Be consistent in their views over time.\n2. Express their views confidently.\n3. Not be too extreme or dogmatic in their stance.\n4. Maintain warmth and friendliness toward the majority.\n\nThese factors contribute to the minority's ability to create doubt in the minds of the majority about their own beliefs and can lead to a reconsideration of the majority's position. Consistency and confidence without dogmatism allow the minority to present an alternative perspective in a compelling but not threatening way, which can facilitate persuasion."
