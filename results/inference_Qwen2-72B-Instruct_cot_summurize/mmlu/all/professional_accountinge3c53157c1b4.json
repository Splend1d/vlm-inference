We can do this by using the cost of goods sold (COGS) and adjusting for changes in inventory.\n\nThe formula to find the cost of purchases is:\nCost of Purchases = COGS + Ending Inventory - Beginning Inventory\n\nPlugging in the numbers given:\nCost of Purchases = $300,000 (COGS) + $180,000 (Ending Inventory) - $150,000 (Beginning Inventory)\nCost of Purchases = $300,000 + $180,000 - $150,000\nCost of Purchases = $330,000\n\nHowever, this figure represents the total cost of purchases made, but it doesn't necessarily reflect the actual cash disbursements made in June. To find out the cash disbursements, we need to adjust for accounts payable (AP), which represents money owed for merchandise that has been received but not yet paid for.\n\nThe change in AP reflects whether more or less cash was paid out than was owed during the period. If AP goes down, it means more cash was paid out than what was owed at the beginning of the period. If AP goes up, it means less cash was paid out compared to what was owed at the beginning.\n\nChange in AP = AP June 30 - AP June 1\nChange in AP = $75,000 - $85,000\nChange in AP = -$10,000\n\nThis means there was a net payment of $10,000 on outstanding purchase obligations during June.\n\nThus, to find the cash disbursements for June purchases, we subtract the decrease in AP from the cost of purchases:\nCash Disbursements = Cost of Purchases - Change in AP\nCash Disbursements = $330,000 - (-$10,000)\nCash Disbursements = $330,000 + $10,000\nCash Disbursements = $340,000\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. $340,000."
