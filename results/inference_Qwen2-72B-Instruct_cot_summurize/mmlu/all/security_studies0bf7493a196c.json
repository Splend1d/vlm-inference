Market place scholars argue that transnational crime operates like a capitalist marketplace in its scope and extensity of operations. Criminal organizations are thus very resilient to law enforcement efforts by virtue of their sheer size. Of comparative difference is the development of highly sophisticated networks of collaboration between criminal groups that has enabled them to survive under the conditions of the competitive logic of the marketplace.\nB. Market analysts argue that the criminal alliances create organizations with a high level of wealth and power that far underestimates what government and official estimates attribute to them. Within this perspective the threat to the licit economy is vastly increased.\nC. Market analysts believe that white-collar and corporate crimes contribute significantly to undermining the licit market. Those organized crime groups are more prone to use violence and corruption than ordinary criminal groups as a result of the extent of profits invested in their activities.\nD. Market analysts claim that organized crime is highly disorganized, and resembles more a market for illicit goods and services than an organization. Proponents of this view minimize the threat posed by organized criminals to states and societies.\n"

This perspective emphasizes the capitalist nature of transnational crime, highlighting the resilience of criminal organizations due to their size and the sophisticated networks they develop to collaborate and compete in the marketplace. This viewpoint acknowledges the adaptability and resourcefulness of these groups, which allows them to withstand law enforcement efforts.\n\nB. Market analysts from this angle focus on the significant wealth and power accumulated by criminal alliances, suggesting that official estimates often underestimate their true influence. They argue that the threat to the legitimate economy is substantial due to the scale of these operations and the potential for disruption.\n\nC. This perspective draws attention to the impact of white-collar and corporate crimes on the licit market, suggesting that organized crime groups are particularly adept at using violence and corruption to further their interests. The large profits involved in their activities lead to a higher propensity for such tactics, which can undermine the stability of legal economic systems.\n\nD. Some market analysts view organized crime as less structured and more akin to a chaotic market for illicit goods and services. They argue that while these groups pose threats, their disorganization minimizes the danger to states and societies compared to more centralized and hierarchical organizations. However, this view might underestimate the strategic capabilities of some criminal networks.\n\nIn reality, transnational organized crime encompasses elements from all these viewpoints, adapting to the dynamics of the global market while also exploiting vulnerabilities in legal frameworks and economies. Their operations can range from highly organized and sophisticated to more fragmented and opportunistic, depending on the specific group and context."
