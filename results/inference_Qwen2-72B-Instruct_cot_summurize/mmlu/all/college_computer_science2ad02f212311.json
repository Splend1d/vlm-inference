II only\n\nIn a purely segmented memory system, memory is divided into segments of variable sizes based on the user's program needs rather than fixed-size units (which would be true for paging). This allows for better memory utilization and the implementation of virtual memory, where each process can have its own virtual address space independent of physical memory. However, this system does not suffer from internal fragmentation in the same way that a paged system might; instead, it can suffer from external fragmentation, where free memory is split into small, non-contiguous blocks that cannot be used effectively."
