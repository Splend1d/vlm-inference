It suggests that law is not something imposed from above but rather emerges from the collective consciousness of a community or nation. Given this, option C (\"Law is the deliberate expression of a sovereign's will.\") is the least likely to follow logically from Savigny's notion of a Volksgeist because it implies that law is created by the will of a sovereign rather than arising naturally from the people. This perspective aligns more closely with theories of legal positivism, which view law as the product of conscious decisions made by authorities, rather than Savigny's organicist theory of law."
