This is because each additional unit of one good will always cost the same amount of the other good, regardless of how much is being produced. Therefore, there is no curvature in the PPF due to increasing opportunity costs as you move along it.\n\nSo the correct answer is:\n\nD. a straight diagonal line sloping downward from left to right."
