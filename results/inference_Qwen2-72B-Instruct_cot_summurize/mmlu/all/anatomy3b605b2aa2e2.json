Contraction of contralateral limb musculature.\n\nThis is because the primary motor cortex has a contralateral organization, meaning that it primarily controls muscles on the opposite side of the body. For example, the left primary motor cortex mainly controls muscles in the right arm and leg. There are some exceptions for certain muscles, such as those involved in facial expressions, which can receive input from both hemispheres."
