                    "text": "The electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrum of a radical can provide information about the local environment around the unpaired electron. The intensity ratios of the lines in an EPR spectrum depend on the number of equivalent nuclear spins that interact with the unpaired electron and the spin quantum number (I) of these nuclei.\n\nIn the case of the t-butyl radical, the structure is:\n\n```\n       H\n       |\n   H---C---H\n       |\n   H---C\n       |\n   H---C---\u2022\n       |\n       H\n```\n\nThe central carbon atom to which the unpaired electron is attached has three equivalent methyl groups (-CH3) attached to it. Each methyl group contains three equivalent protons (nuclear spin I = 1/2). Therefore, the total number of equivalent protons interacting with the unpaired electron is 3 * 3 = 9.\n\nThe multiplicity of the EPR signal (number of lines) for a system with n equivalent nuclei each having spin I is given by 2nI + 1. In this case, n = 9 and I = 1/2, so the multiplicity is 2*9*(1/2) + 1 = 10 lines.\n\nThe intensity ratios of these lines follow the binomial distribution, which is given by the coefficients of the expansion of (x + y)^n where n is the number of equivalent nuclei. For 9 equivalent nuclei, we have:\n\n(x + y)^9 = x^9 + 9x^8y + 36x^7y^2 + 84x^6y^3 + 126x^5y^4 + 126x^4y^5 + 84x^3y^6 + 36x^2y^7 + 9xy^8 + y^9\n\nThe coefficients give us the intensity ratios of the lines in the EPR spectrum:\n\n1:9:36:84:126:126:84:36:9:1\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. 1:9:36:84:126:126:84:36:9:1"
