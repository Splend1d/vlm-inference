However, as a general guideline, maximal dynamic exercise tends to shift towards becoming predominantly aerobic after about 2-3 minutes of continuous activity.\n\nGiven the options provided:\n\nA. 10 seconds - This is too short for aerobic metabolism to become predominant.\nB. 30 seconds - This is also too short for aerobic metabolism to become predominant.\nC. 1 minute - While aerobic metabolism starts contributing significantly around this time, it might not yet be the predominant source of energy.\nD. 4 minutes - This is closer to the time when aerobic metabolism becomes the predominant source of energy during maximal dynamic exercise.\n\nTherefore, the closest answer would be D. 4 minutes. However, it's important to note that the exact time can vary based on individual factors and the specifics of the exercise being performed."
