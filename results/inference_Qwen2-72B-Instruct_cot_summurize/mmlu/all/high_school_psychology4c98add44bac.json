Hyperpolarization results.\n\nWhen a neuron fires, it undergoes an action potential, which is a rapid change in its membrane potential. After the action potential, the neuron enters a refractory period during which it cannot fire again immediately. This refractory period includes a phase of hyperpolarization where the inside of the neuron becomes even more negative than its resting potential. This hyperpolarization helps to prevent the neuron from firing again too soon and ensures that signals are transmitted in one direction down the axon.\n\nThe other options you mentioned occur at different stages:\n- A. The resting potential returns after the hyperpolarization phase.\n- B. Graded potentials are not directly related to the post-firing state; they are changes in membrane potential that can lead to an action potential if they reach a certain threshold.\n- C. An action potential occurs when the neuron fires, not after it has already fired."
