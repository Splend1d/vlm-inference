The litigant's original attorney neglected to file notice on time, and now the litigant has retained a new attorney to file the appeal and has also sued the former attorney for malpractice.\n\nThis scenario could potentially constitute sufficient good cause or excusable neglect because it involves attorney misconduct or neglect. If the original attorney failed to file the notice of appeal due to negligence or error, this can often be grounds for an extension of the deadline to file an appeal. The litigant taking steps to rectify the situation by retaining new counsel and pursuing legal action against the former attorney further supports their case for excusable neglect."
