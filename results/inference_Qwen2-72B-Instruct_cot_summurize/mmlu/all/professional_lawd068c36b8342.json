To finance the improvements, the investor borrowed $125,000 from his friend. As consideration for the loan, the investor executed a promissory note for $125,000 payable to the friend in one year and secured by a mortgage on the building. The mortgage was dated January 1, and was recorded January 2. Thereafter, on February 1, the investor executed a deed absolute on the building and named the friend as grantee. This deed, although absolute in form, was intended only as additional security for the payment of the debt. In order to make judicial foreclosure unnecessary and to eliminate the right to redeem, the investor then delivered the deed to his nephew in escrow with instructions to deliver the deed to the friend if the investor failed to pay his promissory note at maturity. On January 1 of the following year, the investor failed to pay the note when it came due. Thereupon, the nephew, in accordance with the escrow instructions, delivered the investor's deed on the office building to the friend, which the friend promptly and properly recorded. Two weeks later, the investor tendered the $125,000 indebtedness to the friend. When the friend refused to accept it, the investor brought an appropriate action to set aside and cancel the deed absolute and to permit the redemption of the building from the friend. Conversely, the friend counterclaimed to quiet title and argued that the deed absolute was intended as an outright conveyance upon default. The court should enter a judgment that will grant the relief sought by\n\nA. the investor, but only if the investor can establish that the mortgage takes precedence over the deed absolute because it was executed earlier in time.\nB. the investor, because the deed absolute did not extinguish his right of redemption.\nC. the friend, because the deed absolute effectuated an outright conveyance that extinguished the redemption interest sought to be retained by the investor.\nD. the friend, because the investor is estopped to deny the effect of the deed absolute in conjunction with the escrow arrangement.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is B. the investor, because the deed absolute did not extinguish his right of redemption.\n\nIn this scenario, the deed absolute was given as additional security for the loan, with the intention of avoiding the need for judicial foreclosure and eliminating the right to redeem if the loan was not repaid. However, the fact that the deed was placed in escrow with instructions to deliver it to the friend only upon the investor's failure to repay the loan indicates that the deed was not intended as an outright conveyance. Instead, it functioned more like a collateral or security device. Therefore, the investor retains the right of redemption, which allows him to pay off the debt and reclaim his property.\n\nThe court would likely view the transaction as a mortgage-like arrangement, where the deed absolute served as security for the debt rather than an actual sale of the property. The friend cannot retain the property simply by receiving the deed through the escrow arrangement after the loan's maturity without allowing the investor the opportunity to redeem the property by paying off the debt. Thus, the court should grant the relief sought by the investor, allowing him to redeem the building by paying the $125,000 indebtedness."
