Inexplicably, he gave a campaign speech at a school assembly that was filled with graphic stories and anecdotes about the imagined sexual adventures and prowess of certain teachers and students. Several teachers and students complained. The principal suspended him for five days and retracted the valedictorian honors. The student, with his parents, sued in federal court, seeking an injunction and damages based on denial of First Amendment free speech rights. The federal courts ruled for the student but the case came before the U.S. Supreme Court for final decision. Did the Supreme Court uphold the relief granted to the student?\n\nA. No, the school exercised its appropriate function of trying to restrict the use of vulgarity and offensive discourse in a high school setting where free speech may be limited.\nB. Yes, despite some inconvenience to teachers and students, the immature presentation must be tolerated in deference to the need to provide platforms for free speech to students.\nC. No, the student had no rights to free speech, especially considering the violent disruptions in the schools in recent years.\nD. Yes, in today's society sexual images and sexual humor is so intertwined into the fabric of society that it is something that has to be tolerated in the interest of free speech.\n"

No, the school exercised its appropriate function of trying to restrict the use of vulgarity and offensive discourse in a high school setting where free speech may be limited.\n\nThe Supreme Court would likely rule that the school had the authority to discipline the student for his inappropriate and offensive speech. While the First Amendment protects free speech, it does not protect all types of speech in all contexts, particularly in public schools where the government has a special interest in maintaining order and protecting the educational environment. The Court has previously held that schools can regulate speech that is lewd, vulgar, or indecent, as well as speech that disrupts the educational process. In this case, the student's speech could be considered both lewd and disruptive, justifying the school's disciplinary actions."
