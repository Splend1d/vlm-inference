Free radicals and sunlight.\n\nExplanation: The DNA damage/repair theory of aging suggests that senescence (aging) occurs due to the accumulation of DNA damage over time, which leads to errors in cellular function. DNA can be damaged by various sources including free radicals produced during normal metabolic processes, as well as environmental factors such as ultraviolet (UV) radiation from sunlight. This damage can lead to mutations or alterations in gene expression, which can ultimately result in cellular dysfunction and aging.\n\nRadiation from antioxidants (option A) is not a source of DNA damage since antioxidants actually protect against oxidative stress and DNA damage. Telomerase (option D), on the other hand, is an enzyme that adds repetitive nucleotide sequences to the ends of chromosomes, thereby maintaining telomere length. While telomere shortening is another mechanism associated with aging, telomerase itself does not cause DNA damage."
