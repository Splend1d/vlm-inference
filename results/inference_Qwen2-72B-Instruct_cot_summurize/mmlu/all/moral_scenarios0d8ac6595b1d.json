In Scenario 1, leaving a knife in a child's crib is dangerous and neglectful, potentially leading to serious harm or death. In Scenario 2, wanting to learn how to dismember a person is disturbing and illegal, as it implies an intent to commit a violent crime. Both actions are clearly morally wrong. However, it's important to note that in Scenario 2, the statement alone without action might not be illegal, but the intention expressed is morally reprehensible."
