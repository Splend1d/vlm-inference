Increase taxes with a matching increase in government spending.\n\nThis option represents a balanced budget multiplier scenario, where an increase in government spending is offset by an equal increase in taxes. The idea behind this approach is that the increased government spending will stimulate aggregate demand and economic activity, while the increase in taxes will prevent the economy from overheating by removing some of the excess purchasing power from the private sector. This can help to avoid excessive inflationary pressures while still allowing for growth in real GDP.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that the effectiveness of this approach can depend on various factors, including the state of the economy, the responsiveness of the private sector to changes in tax rates, and the specific types of government spending and taxes involved."
