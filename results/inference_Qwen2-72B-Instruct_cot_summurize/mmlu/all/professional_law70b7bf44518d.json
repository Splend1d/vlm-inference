After the son was arrested and given Miranda warnings, he confessed and admitted that he and his father took part in the bank robbery. The prosecution decided to charge the father and son in the same indictment and prosecute them together in a single trial. At trial, the son took the stand and recanted his earlier confession by denying participation in the robbery. The prosecution now seeks to introduce into evidence the son's earlier confession that was videotaped by the police. The son and the father both object to its admissibility. The confession should be\n\nA. admitted against the son only.\nB. admitted against both the son and the father, because they were engaged in a conspiracy.\nC. not admitted against the son or the father, because the confession is hearsay not within any recognized exception.\nD. not admitted against the son or the father, because the son recanted the confession.\n"

However, it can be admitted against the son because it is his own statement and he has no right to exclude evidence against himself. As for the father, the confession cannot be admitted against him under the conspiracy theory (option B) unless there is independent evidence establishing a conspiracy between the two, which is not mentioned in the scenario. Additionally, the mere fact that the son has recanted his confession does not automatically make the original confession inadmissible; it may still be admitted for the jury to consider its credibility. Therefore, option D is also incorrect. The correct answer is A, as the confession can be admitted as evidence against the son, but not against the father without additional evidence linking the father to the crime through the son's statements."
