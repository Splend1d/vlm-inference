However, it's important to note that all of these conditions are necessary for a subset H of a group (G,*) to be a subgroup, not just one of them. But, condition C alone implies the rest under certain circumstances.\n\nFor a subset H of a group (G,*) to be a subgroup, it must satisfy four conditions:\n\n1. Closure: For every a and b in H, the product a * b is also in H.\n2. Associativity: The operation * is associative in H, which is inherited from G since G is a group.\n3. Identity: The identity element of G is in H.\n4. Inverses: For every element a in H, its inverse a^-1 is also in H.\n\nCondition A corresponds to closure, condition B corresponds to inverses, and condition D corresponds to the identity element.\n\nCondition C (a, b in H => a * b^-1 in H) actually implies closure, existence of inverses, and the presence of the identity element if you assume that H is non-empty. Here's why:\n\n- If a and b are in H, then a * b^-1 is in H by condition C. Taking b = a, we have a * a^-1 = e in H, where e is the identity element of G. This shows that the identity element is in H.\n- Now, taking a = e, we have e * b^-1 = b^-1 in H, showing that for any b in H, its inverse b^-1 is also in H.\n- Finally, since we have shown that for any b in H, its inverse b^-1 is in H, and using the fact that a * b^-1 is in H for any a and b in H, we can conclude that H is closed under the operation *.\n\nTherefore, while technically all four conditions are necessary for H to be a subgroup of G, condition C alone is sufficient to imply the other three if H is assumed to be non-empty."
