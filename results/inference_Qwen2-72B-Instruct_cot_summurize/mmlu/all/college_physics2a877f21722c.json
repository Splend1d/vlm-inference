                    "text": "The correct answer is:\n\nD. an average of 10 times, with an rms deviation of about 3\n\nExplanation:\nQuantum efficiency (QE) is defined as the probability that a photon will be detected when it strikes the detector. In this case, the QE is 0.1, meaning that on average, the detector will detect 10% of the photons that strike it.\n\nIf 100 photons are sent into the detector, one after the other, then the expected number of detections is 100 * 0.1 = 10. However, due to statistical fluctuations, the actual number of detections will vary around this average value.\n\nThe number of detections follows a binomial distribution, which has a mean of np and a variance of np(1-p), where n is the number of trials (in this case, 100) and p is the probability of success (in this case, 0.1). The standard deviation (rms deviation) is the square root of the variance, so we have:\n\nmean = np = 10\nvariance = np(1-p) = 10 * 0.9 = 9\nstandard deviation = sqrt(variance) = sqrt(9) = 3\n\nTherefore, the expected number of detections is 10, with a standard deviation of 3. This means that most of the time, the number of detections will be within 3 standard deviations of the mean, i.e., between 1 and 19. However, there is still a small chance that the number of detections could be much higher or lower than this range due to statistical fluctuations."
