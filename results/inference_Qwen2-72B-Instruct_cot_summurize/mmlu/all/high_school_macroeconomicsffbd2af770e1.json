It reflects the purchasing power of the income.\n\nGiven that Robin's income increased from $30,000 to $60,000, his nominal income has clearly increased. However, we must also consider the impact of the tripling of the average price level on his real income.\n\nIf the price level triples, it means that prices have increased by 200% (or multiplied by 3). This means that items which originally cost $1 would now cost $3. If Robin's income had only kept pace with inflation, his income would have to triple as well to maintain the same purchasing power (real income).\n\nInitially, with $30,000, Robin could buy \\(\\frac{30,000}{1} = 30,000\\) units of goods or services.\n\nAfter the price level triples, the same amount of goods or services would cost him \\(3 \\times 30,000 = 90,000\\).\n\nRobin's new income is $60,000. With the price level at three times the original, he can now afford \\(\\frac{60,000}{3} = 20,000\\) units of goods or services.\n\nThis shows that despite his nominal income doubling, Robin's real income (purchasing power) has decreased because he can now only afford two-thirds of what he could before (\\(20,000\\) out of \\(30,000\\) units).\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Increased Decreased\n\nRobin's nominal income increased, but his real income decreased due to the higher rate of inflation."
