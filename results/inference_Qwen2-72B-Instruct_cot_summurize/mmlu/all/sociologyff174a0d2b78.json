Drug use has spread across different age groups and social classes.\n\nB is incorrect because cannabis is actually the most commonly used recreational drug in Britain, not Ecstasy (MDMA).\n\nC is also incorrect as research suggests that teenage boys are more likely to experiment with drugs than teenage girls, although this gap has narrowed in recent years.\n\nD is incorrect because while there have been moral panics about drug use in Britain, the use of illegal drugs, though not \"very rare,\" is less prevalent than the use of legal substances such as alcohol and tobacco. However, the statement downplays the actual prevalence of illegal drug use in the UK."
