Because he believes portions of March's deposition are highly favorable to his case, Cooper's attorney intends to read parts of the deposition at trial instead of calling March to the stand. March objects to Cooper's use of the deposition at trial. What is the court's likely ruling?\n\nA. Cooper may use the deposition at trial, but, if requested, he must read all parts that in fairness ought to be considered with the part introduced.\nB. Cooper may use the deposition at trial, but only to contradict or impeach March's prior inconsistent statements or pleadings.\nC. Cooper may not use the deposition at trial, as March is able to testify and no exceptional circumstances exist.\nD. Cooper may not use the deposition at trial, as this would make March his witness and immune to impeachment.\n"

Cooper may use the deposition at trial, but, if requested, he must read all parts that in fairness ought to be considered with the part introduced.\n\nThis answer is based on Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 32(a)(6), which states that a party may use a deposition at trial \"for any purpose\" if it is given by the party's own witness, and \"to contradict or impeach\" the witness if it is given by an adverse party. However, if parts of the deposition are used, the opposing party can require the reading of additional parts that are necessary for a fair understanding of the context. In this case, since Cooper wants to use March's deposition against him, March (or his attorney) can request that other relevant parts of the deposition be read to provide a fair representation of the testimony."
