False, True\n\nStatement 1 is false because Highway Networks were actually introduced before ResNets (Highway Networks in 2015, ResNets in 2016), and they do not necessarily eschew max pooling in favor of convolutions; it's a design choice that can be made but isn't inherent to the architecture.\n\nStatement 2 is true because DenseNets have a feature concatenation mechanism which can lead to higher memory usage compared to ResNets due to the accumulation of feature maps at each layer."
