So the correct answer is:\n\nB. in parallel.\n\nThe snubber circuit, which usually consists of a resistor and a capacitor in series, is placed across the SCR to protect it from voltage spikes that can occur during turn-off. This helps to prevent the SCR from turning on unintentionally due to transient overvoltages."
