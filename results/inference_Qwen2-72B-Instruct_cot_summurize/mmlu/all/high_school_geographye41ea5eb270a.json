This method involves cutting down and burning the vegetation in an area to clear it for farming. After a few years, when the soil's nutrients are depleted, the farmers move on to a new plot of land and the process begins again. This practice is common in many parts of the world where dense tropical forests exist, including parts of South America, Africa, and Southeast Asia."
