It's generally known as an oncogene, meaning it has the potential to cause cancer when mutated or expressed at high levels. In contrast, tumor suppressor genes normally prevent the development of tumors by controlling cell growth and division. When these genes are mutated or lost, they can no longer perform their function, which may lead to uncontrolled cell growth and cancer.\n\nAPC (Adenomatous Polyposis Coli), NF1 (Neurofibromin 1), and RB1 (Retinoblastoma) are all examples of tumor suppressor genes. Mutations in these genes are associated with various types of cancer."
