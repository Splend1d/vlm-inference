In order to rebut the presumption that the services rendered were gratuitous, since the nephew was a relative of his uncle, the nephew called his sister-in-law as a witness. Assume that this jurisdiction has a relevant Dead Man's Statute in effect. The sister-in-law testified that she had lived in the nephew's house, knew his uncle, and that she was familiar with the uncle's handwriting. The nephew's attorney asked her to look at a letter and to tell the court whether it was written by the uncle. Upon objection by the attorney for the administrator of the estate, the trial judge would most likely\n\nA. sustain the objection, because the sister-in-law is not a handwriting expert.\nB. sustain the objection, because of the Dead Man's Statute.\nC. overrule the objection, because the letter qualifies as a past recollection recorded, an exception to the hearsay rule.\nD. overrule the objection, because an authenticating witness need not be an expert if familiar with the handwriting of the person in question.\n"

This is allowed under the Federal Rules of Evidence and similar state rules, which do not require an expert witness for authentication of handwriting if the witness is sufficiently familiar with the person's writing. However, it's important to note that the Dead Man's Statute might still limit her testimony in some jurisdictions, but the specific question here pertains to the admissibility of her testimony regarding the handwriting, which is governed by different rules."
