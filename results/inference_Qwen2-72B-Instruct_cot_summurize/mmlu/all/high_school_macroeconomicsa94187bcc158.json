They help to automatically reduce the severity of recessions by providing support to individuals and businesses during economic downturns, often through mechanisms such as unemployment insurance benefits, welfare payments, and progressive taxation systems. These stabilizers can also help to moderate the expansion phase of the business cycle by increasing tax revenues and reducing spending when the economy is growing, thereby cooling down potentially overheating conditions."
