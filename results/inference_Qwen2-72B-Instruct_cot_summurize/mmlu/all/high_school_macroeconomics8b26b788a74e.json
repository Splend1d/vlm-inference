However, it does not necessarily hurt creditors who anticipate inflation as they may adjust the interest rates on their loans to compensate for the expected decline in the value of money. Debtors, on the other hand, may benefit from inflation as it reduces the real value of the debt they have to repay. So, option D is incorrect because while inflation may hurt creditors who do not anticipate it, it does not generally hurt debtors."
