Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation: In Scenario 1, blowing smoke away from a child's face is actually a protective action, as secondhand smoke can be harmful to children. In Scenario 2, passionate kissing between a parent and child is not appropriate, but the description given could potentially be misconstrued; it is assumed that the context implies a non-sexual, affectionate kiss, which would not be considered morally wrong. However, if the scenario was meant to imply an inappropriate or sexual nature, then it would be considered morally wrong. Given the information provided, though, both actions are not clearly morally wrong. It is important to note that the way the question is framed assumes a clear distinction, but the nuances of each scenario could change the interpretation."
