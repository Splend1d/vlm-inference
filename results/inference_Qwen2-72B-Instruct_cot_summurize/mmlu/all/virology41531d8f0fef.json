Initiate a fusion 'from without' using virus F protein\n\nParamyxoviruses, such as measles and mumps viruses, enter host cells through a process called fusion-from-without. This is facilitated by the viral F (fusion) protein, which is activated by cleavage into two subunits (F1 and F2) by host cell proteases. The F protein then undergoes conformational changes that allow it to interact with the host cell membrane, bringing the viral envelope and the host cell membrane into close proximity for fusion to occur. This results in the release of the viral RNA into the cytoplasm of the host cell."
