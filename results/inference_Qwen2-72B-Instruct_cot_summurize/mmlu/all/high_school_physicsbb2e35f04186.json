Is this enough information to determine the direction of the net force acting on the cart between t1 and t2?\n\nA. Yes, since we know the cart is slowing down, its momentum change is opposite the direction of movement, and the net force is in the direction of momentum change.\nB. No, because we don\u2019t know whether forces such as friction or air resistance might be acting on the cart.\nC. No, because we don\u2019t know the mass of the cart.\nD. Yes, since we know the cart keeps moving to the east, the net force must be in the direction of motion.\n"

Yes, since we know the cart is slowing down, its momentum change is opposite the direction of movement, and the net force is in the direction of momentum change.\n\nThe reason for this is based on Newton's second law, which states that the net force acting on an object is equal to the rate of change of its momentum. Since the cart is decelerating (slowing down) while moving east, its momentum is decreasing in the eastward direction. This means the change in momentum is westward. According to Newton's second law, the net force must also be in the direction of this change in momentum, which is westward in this case. Therefore, you can determine the direction of the net force acting on the cart between \\(t_1\\) and \\(t_2\\)."
