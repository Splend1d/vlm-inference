Her data showed that over half of the squirrels born did not survive to reproduce, because of competition for food and predation. In a single generation, 90% of the squirrels that were born lived to reproduce, and the population increased to 80. Which inference(s) about this population might be true?\n\nA. The amount of available food may have increased.\nB. The number of predators may have decreased.\nC.

                    "text": "The correct answer is D. A, B, and C.\n\nExplanation:\nA. The amount of available food may have increased: This is a plausible inference since an increase in the squirrel population could be due to an increase in food resources, which would support a larger population size.\n\nB. The number of predators may have decreased: A decrease in predator numbers could also lead to an increase in the squirrel population as fewer squirrels would be predated upon, allowing more to survive and reproduce.\n\nC. The squirrels of subsequent generations should show greater levels of genetic variation than previous generations, because squirrels that would not have survived in the past will now survive: This statement is also possible. If environmental pressures (such as food availability and predation) that previously selected against certain individuals have lessened, then those individuals that would not have survived under harsher conditions might now survive and contribute their genes to the next generation, potentially increasing genetic variation.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that while these are all plausible inferences, without additional information, we cannot definitively conclude any of them as the sole cause of the population increase. It could be one or a combination of these factors, or other factors not mentioned in the question."
