The procedures to be applied on a particular engagement are a matter of the auditor\u2019s professional judgment.\n\nWhen planning the nature of tests to use in a financial statement audit, the auditor must exercise professional judgment. This includes considering factors such as the risks of material misstatement, the effectiveness of internal controls, and the auditor's desired level of assurance. Options A, B, and D contain statements that are not accurate or are misleading. For instance, tests of details can provide a high level of assurance, analytical procedures can be very efficient for obtaining assurance, and the use of tests of controls should indeed consider the level of assurance required."
