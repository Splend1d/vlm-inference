Its span is limited by the number and form of the items presented.\n\nShort-term memory has a limited capacity, typically around 7\u00b12 items (Miller's Law), although this can vary depending on the nature of the information and individual differences. STM is also susceptible to decay over time if the information is not rehearsed or transferred to long-term memory. Additionally, STM can be disrupted by interference from other stimuli or tasks."
