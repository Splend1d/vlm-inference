They argue that wages and prices are flexible and will adjust downward until they reach a point where the quantity of labor demanded equals the quantity supplied, thus achieving full employment. This process is known as the \"invisible hand\" working to correct market imbalances.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that this view has been criticized by Keynesian economists who argue that wages and prices may not be perfectly flexible, particularly in the short run. Keynesians suggest that during recessions, wages and prices may be sticky or rigid, preventing the economy from adjusting quickly back to full employment. In such cases, they advocate for C. expansionary monetary policy or D. increased government spending to stimulate demand and help reduce unemployment."
