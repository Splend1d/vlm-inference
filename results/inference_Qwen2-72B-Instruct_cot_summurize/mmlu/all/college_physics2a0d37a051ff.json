Lines in the infrared, visible, and ultraviolet regions of the spectrum reveal primarily the nuclear structure of the sample.\n\nThis statement is incorrect because lines in these regions of the electromagnetic spectrum actually reveal information about the electronic structure of atoms and molecules, not primarily their nuclear structure. The energy levels associated with electronic transitions are much lower than those required to probe nuclear structure, which would typically involve gamma rays or other very high-energy radiation."
