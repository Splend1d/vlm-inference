It could be seen as a kind act, provided you have the authority to do so and the person has no adverse reaction or contraindications to the medication.\nScenario 2: Urinating into a cup as part of an employment process, such as for a drug test, is not morally wrong. It is a standard procedure required by many employers to ensure a safe and drug-free workplace."
