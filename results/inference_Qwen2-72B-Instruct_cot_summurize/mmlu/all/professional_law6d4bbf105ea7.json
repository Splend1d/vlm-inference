The contractor who installed the shutters did so by drilling screws and brackets into the exterior window frames and the shutters. The man later agreed to sell the home to a buyer. The sales agreement did not mention the shutters, the buyer did not inquire about them, and the buyer did not conduct a walkthrough inspection of the home before the closing. The man conveyed the home to the buyer by warranty deed. After the sale closed, the buyer noticed that the shutters and brackets had been removed from the home and that the window frames had been repaired and repainted. The buyer demanded that the man return the shutters and pay the cost of reinstallation, claiming that the shutters had been conveyed to him with the sale of the home. When the man refused, the buyer sued. Is the buyer likely to prevail?\n\nA. No, because the sales agreement did not mention the shutters.\nB. No, because the window frames had been repaired and repainted after removal of the shutters.\nC. Yes, because the shutters had become fixtures.\nD. Yes, because the man gave the buyer a warranty deed and the absence of the shutters violated a covenant of the deed.\n"

Yes, because the shutters had become fixtures.\n\nIn real estate law, items that are permanently attached to the property, such as built-in appliances, lighting fixtures, and in this case, custom-made wooden shutters that were screwed and bracketed onto the exterior window frames, are generally considered fixtures and therefore part of the real property. Unless specifically excluded in the sales agreement, fixtures are presumed to be included in the sale of the property. Since the sales agreement did not exclude the shutters, and they were considered fixtures, the buyer has a reasonable expectation that they would remain with the property. The fact that the window frames were repaired and repainted does not change the status of the shutters as fixtures. Therefore, the buyer is likely to prevail based on the principle that fixtures are conveyed with the property unless explicitly excluded from the sale."
