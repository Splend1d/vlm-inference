Be absent from work: This may not be true as many older workers have fewer sick days than younger employees due to a stronger work ethic and more experience managing health issues.\n\nB. Be dissatisfied with their jobs: Job satisfaction is not necessarily related to age. It can depend on various factors such as job role, company culture, personal goals, etc.\n\nC. Be less productive: This is a common stereotype but it is not supported by evidence. In fact, research shows that productivity often peaks in middle age and continues into later years.\n\nD. Be laid off: Older workers might face age discrimination when it comes to layoffs, but this is illegal and should not be considered a norm. \n\nSo, none of these options are accurate or fair representations of all older workers. Age does not determine an individual's work ethic, productivity, job satisfaction, or likelihood of being laid off."
