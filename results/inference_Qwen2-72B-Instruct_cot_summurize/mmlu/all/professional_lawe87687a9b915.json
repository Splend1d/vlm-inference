The other options (death or insanity of a party, destruction of the subject matter of the contract, and supervening illegality) can lead to the termination of a contract because they involve circumstances that make it impossible to fulfill the contract's terms or render the contract void. However, partial performance merely means that some, but not all, of the obligations under the contract have been fulfilled, which does not automatically terminate the contract."
