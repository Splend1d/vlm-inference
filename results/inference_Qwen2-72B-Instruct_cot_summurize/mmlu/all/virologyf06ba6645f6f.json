                    "text": "The correct answer is A. Even in combination, current drugs do not completely block viral replication.\n\nExplanation: Antiretroviral therapy (ART) can suppress HIV to undetectable levels in the blood, but it does not eliminate the virus from the body. HIV can hide in latent reservoirs, such as infected immune cells, where it can evade the effects of ART. This means that even when someone is on effective ART and has an undetectable viral load, they may still have HIV-infected cells in their body that can reactivate and start producing new virus if treatment is stopped. Additionally, some drugs may not be able to fully penetrate certain tissues or organs, such as the central nervous system, which can also contribute to persistent viral reservoirs. However, option D is not entirely accurate since newer antiretroviral drugs can penetrate the CNS to some extent. Option B is incorrect because antiretroviral drugs do penetrate cells, and option C is not entirely accurate because although current drugs cannot reverse the integration of viral DNA into the host genome, they can prevent the transcription of viral DNA into RNA and the subsequent production of new viruses."
