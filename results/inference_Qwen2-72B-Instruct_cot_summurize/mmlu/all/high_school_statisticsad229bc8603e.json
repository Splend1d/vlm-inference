Based on the properties of conditional probability the next toss is more likely to be an even number given that three in a row have been even.\nC.

The probability that the next toss will again be even is 0.5.\n\nA fair die has no memory, so the outcome of one roll does not affect the outcomes of future rolls. This means that no matter what has happened in the past, the probability of getting an even number (2, 4, or 6) on the next roll remains at 3 out of 6 possible outcomes, or 0.5.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the law of large numbers does not apply to individual trials. It only applies to the average outcome over many trials. It does not imply that after a series of one type of outcome, the next outcome is more likely to be different.\n\nChoice B is also incorrect because while conditional probability can be used to calculate probabilities based on prior events, it doesn't change the fact that the probability of any single roll being even or odd remains constant at 0.5 for a fair die.\n\nChoice C is incorrect because dice do not have memories; each roll is independent of the previous ones."
