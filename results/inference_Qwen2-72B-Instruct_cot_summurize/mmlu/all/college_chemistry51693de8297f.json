I and III only\n\nExplanation:\nRaoult's law states that the partial vapor pressure of each component of an ideal solution (binary or otherwise) is equal to the vapor pressure of the pure component multiplied by its mole fraction in the solution. This corresponds to statement I.\n\nStatement III is also correct because Raoult's law assumes that the intermolecular forces between unlike molecules are the same as those between like molecules. In other words, the interactions between molecules of different components in the mixture are the same as those in the pure components.\n\nStatement II is not necessarily true for a mixture that obeys Raoult's law. While it might hold for ideal mixtures, it does not have to be true for real solutions. Volume additivity can be affected by the nature of the intermolecular forces and molecular geometry, which may cause expansion or contraction upon mixing. Therefore, this statement is not a requirement for a system obeying Raoult's law."
