Those with savings earning fixed interest rates (III) are also hurt because the real value of their savings declines as inflation erodes the purchasing power of the currency. Borrowers at fixed interest rates (I) actually benefit from inflation since they pay back loans with money that is worth less in real terms. Restaurant owners (IV) may or may not be hurt by inflation depending on their ability to adjust prices and manage costs."
