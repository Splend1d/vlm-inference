Michael Sandel, a prominent political philosopher, argues that there are inherent limits to what we should do with our genetic makeup and that we should not use technology to enhance or alter human traits beyond what is necessary for health or normal functioning. He contends that such interventions could undermine the intrinsic value of human life and our sense of what it means to be human. This perspective resonates with natural law theory, which holds that there are certain universal moral principles that govern human behavior and that are derived from the nature of human beings and the world around us."
