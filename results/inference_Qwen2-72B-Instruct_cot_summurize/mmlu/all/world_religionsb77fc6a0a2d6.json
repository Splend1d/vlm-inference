The most prominent gods whose cults were suppressed during his reign were:\n\nC. Amun and Mut\n\nAmun was one of the most important deities in the Egyptian pantheon, and his main consort was the goddess Mut. Akhenaten's religious reforms were aimed at establishing the Aten as the sole god of Egypt, effectively making the worship of other gods, including Amun and Mut, illegal or heretical. This led to the closure of their temples and the defacement of their images and inscriptions."
