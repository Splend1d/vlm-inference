However, the argument also assumes that the person in question is entirely and permanently incapable of doing good, which could be seen as an overgeneralization or a hasty generalization, but these are not among the provided options either.\n\nAmong the options you've given, none directly matches the description of the fallacy being committed. However, if I must choose one from the list, it would be:\n\nC. Accident\n\nThis is because the fallacy of accident involves applying a general rule to a specific case where it does not fit. In this scenario, assuming someone is incapable of doing good in all situations based on a general belief about their character is applying a general rule too broadly, which can be akin to the fallacy of accident. However, this is not a perfect match, and \"ad hominem\" would be more accurate if it were an option."
