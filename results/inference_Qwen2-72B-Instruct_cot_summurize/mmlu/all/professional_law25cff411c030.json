The state's highest court has construed the code as imposing strict and vicarious liability to the extent allowed by the federal Constitution. The evidence at trial established that the owner's company had sold contaminated meat that had sickened hundreds of consumers. It further showed, however, that the owner had been out of the country when the meat was sold and had had no reason to know that any of the meat was contaminated. The jury convicted the owner, and the court sentenced him to a large fine and probation. On appeal, the owner has challenged the sufficiency of the trial evidence. Should the appellate court uphold the conviction?\n\nA. No, because there was insufficient proof of the owner's actus reus.\nB. No, because there was insufficient proof of the owner's mens rea.\nC. Yes, because an appellate court cannot second-guess a jury's verdict.\nD. Yes, because the evidence was sufficient to support the jury's verdict.\n"

Yes, because the evidence was sufficient to support the jury's verdict.\n\nIn this case, the state criminal code imposes strict and vicarious liability, which means that the prosecution does not need to prove the owner's mens rea (criminal intent) for the conviction to stand. Since the owner's company sold contaminated meat that caused harm to consumers, the actus reus (the physical act of the crime) is established. The fact that the owner was out of the country and had no reason to know about the contamination is irrelevant under strict liability laws. As long as the company sold the contaminated meat, the owner can be held liable under the state's law, and the appellate court should uphold the conviction if it deems the evidence sufficient to support the jury's verdict."
