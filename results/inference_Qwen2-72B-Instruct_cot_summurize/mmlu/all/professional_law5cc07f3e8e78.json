The current lessee of the premises, who had made substantial improvements to the property, wanted to buy at the full list price but needed extra time. He paid $10,000 for an option to be added to the lease, giving him an option to buy on or before Sept. 1. The option stated that all notices required under it \"shall be deemed given if given in writing and delivered personally, delivered by commercial delivery service, or by certified mail return receipt requested, to the party to receive the Notice\" That notice was required by Sept. 1. Buyer called Seller on Aug. 25 and told her that he was exercising the option, but Seller did not remember the words used. The Buyer sent written intent to exercise it by first class mail on Aug. 29 but the Seller later testified that she did not receive it until September 3. On September 10 she notified Buyer that the option expired and the deal was off. Buyer filed a specific performance action to compel the transaction. Is it likely that the Equity Court will grant the request for specific performance?\n\nA. Yes, the exercise of an option is not considered to be a situation where \"time is of the essence\" of the agreement, and options are liberally enforced so that the benefit of the bargain is not unreasonably lost.\nB. Yes, the delay was minimal, the lessee would suffer hardship, and the wording of the notice requirement did not absolutely require one of the stated forms of notice.\nC. No, because the Seller would be prejudiced by having to sell after the option date.\nD. No, because option contracts are strictly enforced and even a one-day delay cannot be allowed due to the need to have commercial predictability in such transactions.\n"

Yes, the delay was minimal, the lessee would suffer hardship, and the wording of the notice requirement did not absolutely require one of the stated forms of notice.\n\nIn this scenario, the delay in receiving the written notice was minimal (received on September 3rd despite being mailed on August 29th). Additionally, the lessee has already made substantial improvements to the property, suggesting potential hardship if the sale does not go through. The notice provision in the option contract does not explicitly state that only one of the specified methods must be used for the notice to be valid; it merely provides examples of acceptable methods. Since first-class mail is a common method of sending notices and could reasonably be interpreted as falling within the scope of the provision, the court may view the buyer's attempt to send the notice as compliant with the contract terms.\n\nFurthermore, the court may consider the principle of equity, aiming to prevent unjust enrichment or hardship and to enforce fair dealings. Given these circumstances, it is likely that the Equity Court would grant the request for specific performance. However, the exact decision would depend on the interpretation of the contract by the judge and the jurisdiction's legal precedents regarding option contracts and notice provisions."
