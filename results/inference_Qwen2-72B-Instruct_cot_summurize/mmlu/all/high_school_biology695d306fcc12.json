This is different from diffusion (A), which is the movement of molecules from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration, active transport (B), which requires energy to move substances across a cell membrane against their concentration gradient, and facilitated diffusion (C), which involves the movement of molecules across the cell membrane with the help of carrier proteins without the use of energy."
