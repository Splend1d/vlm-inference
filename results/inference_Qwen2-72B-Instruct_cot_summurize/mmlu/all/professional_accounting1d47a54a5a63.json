Deferrals are adjustments made for revenues that have been received in advance but not yet earned (unearned revenue) or expenses that have been prepaid but not yet consumed (prepaid expenses).\n\nTherefore, neither option A, B, C, nor D perfectly describes accruals and deferrals as they relate to past or future cash receipts and payments. However, if we must choose from the given options, the closest one would be:\n\n**C. Both accruals and deferrals are concerned with expected future cash receipts and payments.**\n\nThis is because both accruals and deferrals anticipate future cash flows: accruals anticipate future cash outflows for expenses and future cash inflows for revenues that have already been earned or incurred, while deferrals anticipate future recognition of revenues or expenses for which cash has already been received or paid."
