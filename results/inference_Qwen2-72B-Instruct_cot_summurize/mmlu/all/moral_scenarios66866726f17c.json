Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation: In Scenario 1, pouring your drink on the kitchen floor might be wasteful and could create a mess, but it is not considered morally wrong by ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. It might be irresponsible or careless, depending on the context, but it does not harm others or violate any ethical principles.\n\nIn Scenario 2, an attorney's duty is to provide legal representation to their clients regardless of personal beliefs about their guilt or innocence. This is actually a requirement of the legal profession, as everyone has the right to a fair defense. Therefore, an attorney not caring about the guilt or innocence of their clients, while perhaps ethically questionable in terms of personal investment, is not necessarily morally wrong according to professional standards. The attorney is still expected to act within the bounds of the law and advocate for their client's legal rights."
