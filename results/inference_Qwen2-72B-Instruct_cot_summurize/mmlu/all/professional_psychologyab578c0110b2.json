This discrepancy might be due to difficulties with visual-spatial processing, fine motor skills, or other non-verbal abilities that are assessed by the Performance IQ subtests.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that a discrepancy between Verbal and Performance IQ scores does not necessarily indicate a learning disability. Other factors, such as cultural background, language proficiency, and test-taking anxiety, could also contribute to differences in scores. A comprehensive psychological evaluation would be necessary to determine the cause of the discrepancy and whether a learning disability or another issue is present."
