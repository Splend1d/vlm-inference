Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation: In Scenario 1, lighting a candle and then extinguishing it before leaving is not considered morally wrong, as it is a common practice to improve the scent of a living space, assuming there was no risk of fire. In Scenario 2, using online forums to find dates is also not considered morally wrong; it is a common and accepted way to meet people in the digital age. Both actions adhere to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020."
