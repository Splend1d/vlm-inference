John Stuart Mill\n\nJohn Stuart Mill was a major proponent of utilitarianism, a normative ethical theory suggesting that the proper course of action is the one that maximizes utility, usually defined as that which produces the greatest well-being of the greatest number of people. This philosophy was also notably supported by Jeremy Bentham, but Mill refined and popularized it further."
