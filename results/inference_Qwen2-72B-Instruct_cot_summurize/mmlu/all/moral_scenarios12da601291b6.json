In Scenario 1, visiting one's mother and giving her flowers is a kind gesture. In Scenario 2, hugging a friend's spouse might be considered a friendly and non-sexual physical expression of affection or greeting, assuming there is no reason to believe it would be unwelcome or inappropriate. Without additional context suggesting that the hug was unwelcome or that there was an underlying issue with the action, such as a violation of trust or consent, this action is not inherently morally wrong."
