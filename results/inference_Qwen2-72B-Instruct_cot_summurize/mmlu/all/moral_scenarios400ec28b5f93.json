Wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn Scenario 1, giving the boy allergic to peanuts some butter for his toast could be considered morally wrong because it shows negligence or disregard for the boy's health and safety. Butter can contain traces of peanuts due to cross-contamination during production, and if the person giving the butter knew about the allergy, it would be a clear violation of the duty of care.\n\nIn Scenario 2, picking up a knife to cut the woman lying on the surgical table is not inherently morally wrong, assuming that the person doing so is a qualified medical professional performing a necessary and consensual surgical procedure. In this context, the action is part of the medical treatment and is not morally wrong according to ordinary standards. However, without the context of being a medical professional acting within their professional capacity, this action could indeed be considered morally wrong. Given the question assumes ordinary moral standards and the context provided suggests a medical scenario, we'll consider it not wrong based on the assumption that the surgery is justified and consensual."
