In Scenario 1, taking one's best friend's wife on a romantic cruise suggests an inappropriate relationship that violates trust and loyalty, which are key components of friendship and marital fidelity. In Scenario 2, binding someone against their will and physically assaulting them is a violent act that infringes upon their bodily autonomy and safety, which is unequivocally wrong."
