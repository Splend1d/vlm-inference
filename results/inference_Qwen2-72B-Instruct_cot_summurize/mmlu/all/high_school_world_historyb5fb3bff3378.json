The same is true in all the other mines: the silver mines of Potosi [and others]\u2026.The owners and stewards of the mines, whether Spaniards, mestizos, or Indians, are such tyrants, with no fear of God or Justice, because they are not audited and are not inspected twice a year\u2026.\nAnd they are not paid for the labor of traveling to and from the mines or for the time they spend at the mines. The Indians, under the pretext of mining chores, are made to spend their workdays herding cattle and conveying goods; they are sent off to the plains, and the Indians die. These Indians are not paid for their labor, and their work is kept hidden.\nAnd [the mine owners] keep Indian cooking women in their residences; they use cooking as a pretext for taking concubines\u2026.And they oblige the Indians to accept corn or meat or chicha [corn beer]\u2026at their own expense, and they deduct the price from their labor and their workdays. In this way, the Indians end up very poor and deep in debt, and they have no way to pay their tribute.\nThere is no remedy for all this, because any [colonial official] who enters comes to an agreement with the mine owners, and all the owners join forces in bribing him\u2026.Even the protector of the Indians is useless;\u2026he [does not] warn Your Majesty or your royal Audiencia [court] about the harms done to the poor Indians.\"\nExcerpt from The First New Chronicle and Good Government [abridged], by Felipe Guaman Poma de Alaya.

                    "text": "The passage describes the harsh treatment and exploitation of Native Americans in the mines of the Spanish colonies, particularly in Huancavelica and Potosi. The practices mentioned include forced labor, lack of payment, hidden work, debt bondage, and sexual exploitation. Given the context of the passage and the time period (ca. 1610), the most plausible change that occurred as a direct response to these practices was:\n\nC. The promulgation of royal decrees insisting on more humane treatment of the natives.\n\nThroughout the colonial period, the Spanish crown issued various laws and decrees aimed at protecting the indigenous peoples from the worst abuses of the colonists and mine owners. One notable example is the New Laws of 1542, which were designed to improve the conditions of the natives and limit the power of the encomenderos (Spanish landholders). Although these laws were often poorly enforced and met resistance from the colonists, they represented an attempt by the Spanish crown to address the mistreatment of Native Americans.\n\nOptions A, B, and D do not accurately reflect historical responses to the abuses described in the passage:\n\nA. While the use of African slaves did increase in some areas of the Spanish Empire, particularly in the Caribbean and Brazil, this was not primarily a response to the abuses against Native Americans but rather due to the decline in indigenous populations caused by disease and overwork.\n\nB. The establishment of viceroyalties was part of a broader administrative restructuring of the Spanish Empire and not a direct response to the abuses detailed in the passage. Viceroyalties were created to better manage the vast territories and resources of the empire, including relations with indigenous peoples, but they existed before and after the time period described in the passage.\n\nD. The enfranchisement of all natives by local Spanish elites in the colonies did not occur. Native Americans in the Spanish colonies remained subject to various forms of legal discrimination and exploitation throughout the colonial period."
