Pepsinogen and gastric lipase are two enzymes secreted into the lumen of the stomach\n\nPepsinogen is produced by the chief cells in the stomach lining and is activated by hydrochloric acid to become pepsin, which breaks down proteins. Gastric lipase, though less significant than pepsin, does help in the initial breakdown of fats.\n\nRegarding the other options:\nA. Acid secretion in the stomach is actually stimulated by the hormone gastrin, not carbonic anhydrase.\nB. Peyer's patches are not found in the stomach; they are part of the immune system located in the wall of the small intestine.\nC. The vagus nerve stimulates acid secretion before a meal (cephalic phase) and during a meal (gastric phase). After a meal, it is true that acid secretion may decrease as the stomach empties, but this is not directly due to inhibition by the vagus nerve."
