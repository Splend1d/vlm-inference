Liberalism is a fundamentally pessimistic approach that regards the international system as destined to the escalation of conflict. It is the dominant conception in the practice of international politics.\nB. Liberalism is a novel conception in the theory of international politics. It is an optimistic approach that defines the ways in which states should relate to one another, particularly during conflict situations.\nC. Liberalism is an optimistic approach, offering an orientation for the better conduct of international affairs in the belief that a more peaceful world is possible. It is the dominant conception in the practice of international politics.\nD. Liberalism does not exist as a mainstream theory within International Relations, but rather offers a set of guidelines and advice for states and political actors wishing to accrue power within the international system independently from the restrictions of traditional security paradigms.\n"

While it may not necessarily be the dominant conception in the practice of international politics, liberalism advocates for cooperation, international institutions, and the promotion of democracy and human rights as means to achieve peace and prosperity.\n\nLiberalism holds that states can work together through international organizations and diplomacy to resolve conflicts peacefully and create a more stable global order. It emphasizes the importance of individual rights, economic interdependence, and the rule of law in fostering a more just and peaceful international system. This contrasts with realism, which tends to view international relations as a struggle for power among states and is often more skeptical about the potential for lasting cooperation and peace."
