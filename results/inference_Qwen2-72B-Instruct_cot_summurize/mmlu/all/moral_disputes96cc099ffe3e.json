These duties are considered \"prime facie\" duties, meaning they are binding unless overridden by a stronger duty in a particular situation. This approach contrasts with consequentialism, which focuses on the outcomes of actions; Kantian theory, which stresses adherence to universal maxims; and virtue ethics, which centers on the character of the moral agent."
