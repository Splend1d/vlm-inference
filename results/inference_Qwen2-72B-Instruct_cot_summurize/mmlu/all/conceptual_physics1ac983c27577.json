Each branch (in this case, each lamp) has its own path from the positive terminal of the voltage source back to the negative terminal. The voltage across each branch is the same, but the current can vary depending on the resistance of each branch.\n\nIf we assume both lamps have the same resistance, then they would draw the same amount of current. Given that one lamp draws 2 A, if the second lamp also has the same resistance, it would also draw 2 A.\n\nHowever, without knowing whether the second lamp has the same resistance as the first, we cannot definitively say that the current through it is also 2 A. But since the question does not provide any information about different resistances or any other factors that might affect the current differently for the two lamps, and assuming standard conditions where both lamps are identical, the answer would be:\n\nB. 2 A\n\nBut technically, the most correct answer given the information provided (or lack thereof regarding the resistance of the second lamp) is:\n\nD. Not enough information to say\n\nBecause we don't know if the second lamp has the same resistance as the first one, which directly affects the current it will draw."
