This included the suppression of Korean religions such as Buddhism and Confucianism, and the promotion of Shinto, the indigenous religion of Japan. However, Christianity was not actively promoted by the Japanese authorities, although it was not suppressed either. Therefore, none of the options A, B, C, or D is entirely accurate. The correct answer would be something like \"none of the above,\" but if you have to choose one, option C (Christianity) would be the least incorrect."
