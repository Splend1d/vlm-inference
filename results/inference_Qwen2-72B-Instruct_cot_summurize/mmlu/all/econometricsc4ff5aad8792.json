(i), (ii), (iii), and (iv).\n\nHere's why:\n\ni) Only one cointegrating relationship can be estimated: This is indeed a limitation of the Engle-Granger two-step method. It does not allow for the estimation of multiple cointegrating relationships, which might exist between more than two non-stationary time series.\n\nii) Particularly for small samples, there is a high chance of the tests suggesting that variables are not cointegrated when they are: This refers to the power of the test, particularly in small sample sizes. The Dickey-Fuller/Engle-Granger tests may not have enough power to detect cointegration when it exists, especially with limited data.\n\niii) It is not possible to make inferences on the cointegrating regression: While you can estimate the cointegrating regression, making statistical inferences about the parameters of this regression can be problematic due to the non-standard distribution of the test statistics in cointegrating regressions.\n\niv) The procedure forces the researcher to specify which is the dependent variable and which are the independent variables: This is a limitation related to the structure of the Engle-Granger two-step procedure. Unlike some other methods, such as the Johansen procedure, which allows for the simultaneous estimation of multiple cointegrating vectors without pre-specifying dependent and independent variables, the Engle-Granger method requires a clear distinction between these roles.\n\nTherefore, all four options (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv) correctly identify limitations of the Dickey-Fuller / Engle-Granger approach to testing for cointegration and modeling cointegrating relationships."
