Organic solidarity leads to restitutive law.\n\nDurkheim identified two types of solidarity that bind societies together: mechanical and organic. In societies characterized by mechanical solidarity, where individuals perform similar tasks and have similar beliefs and values, the law is primarily repressive. This means that laws are designed to punish deviant behavior harshly, reflecting the homogeneity of the society and the need for strong collective conscience.\n\nIn contrast, societies with organic solidarity, which are characterized by a high degree of division of labor and interdependence among individuals performing different functions, have a restitutive law system. Restitutive law focuses on restoring the disrupted social equilibrium by compensating victims and addressing the damage caused by offenses rather than solely punishing the offender. This reflects the complexity and interdependence of modern societies, where maintaining social order requires cooperation and the resolution of conflicts through negotiation and compensation rather than punishment."
