The evaporation of water from leaf mesophyll cells generates tension in the water column.\n\nExplanation:\n\nA. The evaporation of water from leaf mesophyll cells during transpiration creates a negative pressure (tension) that pulls water up through the xylem from the roots. This is a key component of the cohesion-tension theory.\n\nB. While this statement describes the general direction of water movement, it does not specifically address the mechanisms of the cohesion-tension theory, which involves tension and cohesion rather than differences in hydrostatic pressure alone.\n\nC. The cohesion of water molecules helps maintain the integrity of the water column against the tension generated by transpiration, preventing the formation of embolisms rather than causing them.\n\nD. The living cells of the xylem do not provide the main conduit for the ascent of water. Instead, water primarily moves through dead xylem cells called tracheids and vessel elements."
