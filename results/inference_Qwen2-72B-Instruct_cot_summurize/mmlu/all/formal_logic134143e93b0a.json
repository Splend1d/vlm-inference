So, a more conventional representation might look like this:\n\nS(c) \u2194 E(j, b)\n\nWhere:\n- S(x) stands for \"x is sweet\"\n- E(x, y) stands for \"x is engaged to y\"\n- c stands for \"Caroline\"\n- j stands for \"Janet\"\n- b stands for \"Brad\"\n\nBut among the given options, B is the closest to an accurate translation."
