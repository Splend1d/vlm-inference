They lead us into \"tragedy of the commons\" situations and they instill in us an atomistic view of persons.\n\nIndividualism can foster an atomistic view of persons where individuals are seen as isolated entities rather than interconnected members of a larger community. This perspective can make it difficult to address collective action problems such as the tragedy of the commons, where individual interests conflict with the common good. In such situations, individualism may prevent people from recognizing their shared responsibility for the well-being of the environment and other public goods."
