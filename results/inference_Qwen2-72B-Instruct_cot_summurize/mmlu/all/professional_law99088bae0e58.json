                    "text": "A devastating earthquake struck a foreign country. The earthquake destroyed hundreds of homes and buildings. Thousands of residents were killed, injured, and left homeless by the earthquake. The leader of the foreign country sought the assistance of the United States in providing emergency aid. The President initially wanted to send troops from a west coast military base but learned that they were out on training maneuvers. As a result, the President issued an executive order directing members of a federal agency under the supervision of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, to travel to the foreign country to engage in emergency rescue operations. This federal agency's main function is to patrol the borders to prevent illegal aliens from entering the United States. A member of this federal agency refused to comply with the executive order and assist in the relief effort. He claimed that participating in such operations in a foreign country is beyond the scope of his job responsibilities. He brought suit in federal court challenging the validity of the President's executive order. Assuming the member of the federal agency has adequate standing, the court should rule the executive order\n\nA. valid, because as commander-in-chief, the President has unfettered authority to require federal employees to participate in an international relief effort.\nB. valid, because employees of an executive agency can be required to perform such emergency functions.\nC. invalid, because the executive order is beyond the scope of presidential power absent congressional authorization.\nD. invalid, because the director of the INS, not the President, has the power to issue directives to federal agencies under its supervision.\n"

The President cannot unilaterally expand the duties of a federal agency beyond what Congress has authorized. In this case, the agency's primary function is to patrol the borders and prevent illegal immigration, not to engage in international relief efforts. Without specific congressional authorization for such actions, the President's executive order would likely be considered an overreach of executive power.\n\nAdditionally, option D is incorrect because while the director of the INS (now part of the Department of Homeland Security) may have authority over the day-to-day operations of the agency, the President does have the authority to direct federal agencies in certain circumstances. However, without congressional authorization for the specific action of engaging in international relief efforts, even the director's directive would likely face legal challenges."
