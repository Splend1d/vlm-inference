Environmental management systems, ISO14001, EMAS\n\nEnvironmental management systems (EMS) such as ISO 14001 and EMAS are frameworks that help organizations structure their environmental goals, policies, and responsibilities. They also ensure regular auditing and reporting, often going beyond mere legal compliance to promote continuous improvement in environmental performance. ISO 14001 is an international standard for environmental management systems, while EMAS (Eco-Management and Audit Scheme) is a European Union regulation that sets out requirements for environmental management systems."
