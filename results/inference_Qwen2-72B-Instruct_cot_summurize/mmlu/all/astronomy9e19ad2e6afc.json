                    "text": "The correct answer is A. The 1:2:4 resonance in Jupiter's moons system, specifically involving Io, Europa, and Ganymede, pulls Io in different directions and generates significant tidal heating within Io's interior. This resonance means that for every one orbit that Io completes around Jupiter, Europa completes two orbits, and Ganymede completes four orbits. The gravitational interactions among these moons due to this resonance cause their orbits to be slightly elliptical, leading to varying gravitational forces on Io as it orbits Jupiter. This results in Io experiencing intense tidal forces that generate heat, making Io one of the most volcanically active bodies in the Solar System."
