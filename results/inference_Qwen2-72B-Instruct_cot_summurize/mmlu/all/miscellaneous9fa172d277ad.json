The other half of the plate should be divided between grains and protein foods, with dairy as a separate serving on the side. Whole grains are recommended over refined grains. It is suggested to make at least half of the grains whole grains. For proteins, variety is key, including lean meats, poultry, seafood, beans, peas, nuts, seeds, and soy products. Dairy products like milk, yogurt, and cheese are encouraged for their calcium content. However, vegetables should constitute the most significant portion of your daily food intake according to these guidelines."
