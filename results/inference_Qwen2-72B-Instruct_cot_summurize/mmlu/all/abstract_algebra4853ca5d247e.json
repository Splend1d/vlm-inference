Consider the group \\( \\mathbb{Z}_4 = \\{0, 1, 2, 3\\} \\) under addition modulo 4. Let \\(a = 1\\) and \\(b = 3\\). Clearly, \\(a \\neq b\\), but \\(a^2 = 1 + 1 = 2\\) and \\(b^2 = 3 + 3 = 6 \\equiv 2 \\mod 4\\). So, \\(a^2 = b^2 = 2\\) even though \\(a \\neq b\\).\n\nStatement 2: The set of rotations in a dihedral group form a cyclic subgroup.\n\nThis statement is true. A dihedral group \\(D_n\\) represents the symmetries of a regular n-sided polygon. It consists of \\(n\\) rotations and \\(n\\) reflections. The set of rotations in \\(D_n\\) is indeed a cyclic subgroup generated by a single rotation (usually a rotation by \\(2\\pi/n\\) radians). This subgroup is isomorphic to \\( \\mathbb{Z}_n \\), which is a cyclic group.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. False, True."
