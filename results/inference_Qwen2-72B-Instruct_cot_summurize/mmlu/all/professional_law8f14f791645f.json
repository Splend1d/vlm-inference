Negligence requires a breach of a duty of care owed by the defendant (the subway company) to the plaintiff (the injured commuter). The subway company has a duty to operate its trains in a safe manner and to take reasonable steps to prevent foreseeable harm to passengers.\n\nIf the sudden stop was due to an unforeseeable emergency or was necessary for safety reasons (e.g., to avoid a collision), the subway company would likely not be found negligent, and the commuter would not prevail in his claim. However, if the stop was due to operator error or a failure to maintain the train properly, the company could be found negligent, and the commuter might prevail.\n\nIt is worth noting that even if the resident was negligent in not holding onto the handrail, this does not directly affect the liability of the subway company unless the resident's negligence contributed to the commuter's injuries. In such a case, the resident's negligence might also be considered in determining comparative fault, but it would not be a defense for the subway company's potential negligence."
