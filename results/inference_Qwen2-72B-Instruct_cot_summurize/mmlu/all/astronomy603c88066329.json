For example, Neptune has faint and incomplete ring systems, but they are not as prominent or well-defined as those of Saturn or Uranus. Option A is therefore incorrect.\n\nOption C is also not necessarily true for all cases. For instance, Saturn's rings extend out to about 350,000 km from its center, which is actually farther away than some of its moons, like Mimas and Enceladus. Similarly, Uranus' rings are closer to the planet than its inner moons, but its outer moons are farther out.\n\nTherefore, the best answer based on the given options is B, as Kepler's third law does apply to the orbital periods and distances of the particles within planetary rings. However, it's important to note that option D is incorrect because not all of the statements provided are universally true."
