In the contract of sale, Beeson and Sloan agreed that the property was to be used for the purpose of building a commercial shopping mall. The contract required Beeson to pay Sloan a deposit of $12,500, with the balance of the purchase price payable at closing a month later on December 1. On November 24, the city council rezoned the property so that it could be used only for single-family residential purposes. As a consequence, Beeson refused to honor the contract. Sloan now brings an action for specific performance arguing that the doctrine of equitable conversion places the loss on the buyer. Beeson argues that to enforce the contract would be harsh and oppressive to him. If judgment is for Beeson, it will most likely be because\n\nA. Sloan assumed the risk.\nB. Sloan would be unjustly enriched.\nC. legal title remained in Sloan.\nD. equity will relieve Beeson of a bad bargain.\n"

This is because the change in zoning laws occurred after the contract was signed and rendered the property unsuitable for the intended purpose, which was a material part of the contract. The doctrine of equitable conversion generally holds that once a contract for the sale of real estate is executed, the buyer is considered the equitable owner of the property and bears the risk of any loss or damage to the property. However, in this case, the change in zoning laws was not a loss or damage to the physical property but rather a significant change in the legal status of the property that made it impossible for Beeson to use the property as originally intended.\n\nThe court may find that enforcing the contract under these circumstances would be inequitable, as Beeson's ability to use the property for its intended purpose has been thwarted by an unforeseen event that occurred through no fault of his own. Therefore, the court may decide to relieve Beeson of the obligation to complete the purchase, as it would amount to forcing him to go through with a deal that has become substantially different from what was originally agreed upon."
