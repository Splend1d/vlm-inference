(\u2203x)[(Cx \u2022 Px) \u2022 (\u2203y)(Ay \u2022 Nxy)]\n\nExplanation:\nThe statement \"Some animals are neglected by cruel people\" can be translated into predicate logic as follows:\n\n- There exists at least one cruel person (x) who is also a person (Px) and who neglects at least one animal (y) that is an animal (Ay).\n\nIn predicate logic, this can be written as:\n\n(\u2203x)[(Cx \u2022 Px) \u2022 (\u2203y)(Ay \u2022 Nxy)]\n\nOption A is incorrect because it suggests that there exists at least one thing (x) that is both an animal and cruel, which is not what the original statement says.\n\nOption C is incorrect because it suggests that there exists at least one thing (x) that is both an animal and a person, which is not what the original statement says.\n\nOption D is incorrect because it suggests that there exists at least one thing (x) that is both an animal and cruel, and at least one thing (y) that is a person, which is not what the original statement says. Additionally, the parentheses in option D are not properly nested, making the formula syntactically invalid."
