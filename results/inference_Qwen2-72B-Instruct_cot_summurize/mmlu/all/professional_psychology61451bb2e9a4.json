Clarify boundaries between family members in order to reduce enmeshment.\n\nIn Minuchin's structural family therapy, the therapist aims to identify and modify problematic family structures and subsystems. Enmeshment, or overly close and diffuse boundaries between family members, is seen as a common issue that can contribute to various problems within the family. The therapist works to clarify these boundaries and promote healthier differentiation among family members. While directives (option D) may be used by the therapist, the primary focus in structural family therapy is on changing the family structure and dynamics, particularly around boundaries. Options B and C are not directly related to Minuchin's structural approach."
