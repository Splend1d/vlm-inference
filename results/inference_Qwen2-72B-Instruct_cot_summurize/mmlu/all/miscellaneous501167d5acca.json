Hard-edge painting is a style that emerged in the 1950s and 1960s as a reaction against the gestural and expressive nature of Abstract Expressionism. It is characterized by clean lines, geometric shapes, and areas of flat, often bright color with no visible brushstrokes. The edges between colors or shapes are sharp and well-defined, hence the term \"hard-edge.\""
