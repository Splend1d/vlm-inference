It involves dividing the market into groups based on demographic variables such as age, gender, income, education level, occupation, and family size. This allows companies to tailor their products and marketing strategies to specific segments of the population. While organizational size, product type, and price can also be used to segment markets, they are not typically used in consumer markets in the same way that demographics are."
