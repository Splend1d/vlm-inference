Firstly, it must be part of the mores or customary practices of the group. Secondly, it must be universally teachable, meaning that it can be communicated and understood by all members of the group. Lastly, it cannot be merely a taboo or a prohibition without reason, but rather must have some rational basis or justification within the group's moral framework."
