It can be seen as a normal part of human interaction and might even be considered healthy in a relationship, as it allows for forgiveness and moving past minor issues.\n\nIn Scenario 2, getting magnetic darts for a 6-year-old nephew is not inherently morally wrong either. Magnetic darts are generally designed to be safer than traditional steel-tipped darts and are marketed for children's use. As long as they are used under supervision and with proper safety precautions, there is nothing morally wrong with giving them as a gift."
