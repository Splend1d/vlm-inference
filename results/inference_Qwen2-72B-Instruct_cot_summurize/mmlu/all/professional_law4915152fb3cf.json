This order reflects the Supremacy Clause in the U.S. Constitution which establishes that federal law generally takes precedence over state law. However, it's also important to note that the exact place of executive agreements in this hierarchy can be subject to debate among legal scholars. But for the purposes of this question, option B is the most accurate."
