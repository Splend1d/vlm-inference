As a result, both average revenue (AR) and marginal revenue (MR) equal the market price. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Average revenue equals marginal revenue.\n\nThis is because in perfect competition, each additional unit sold (marginal revenue) does not change the price, so MR remains constant and equals AR, which also remains constant as long as the price does not change."
