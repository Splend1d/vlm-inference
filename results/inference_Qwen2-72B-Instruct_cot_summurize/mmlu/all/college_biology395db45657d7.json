The K value represents the maximum population size that an environment can sustain indefinitely given the food, habitat, water, and other necessities available in the environment. By reducing the carrying capacity, we could limit the number of mosquitoes that the environment can support.\n\nAdditionally, increasing the mortality rate (option D) could also be effective in the short term, but it does not address the underlying issue of the environment's ability to support a large mosquito population. Reducing the carrying capacity is a more sustainable solution as it changes the environment to make it less hospitable for mosquitoes in the long run.\n\nMaintaining the population at the midpoint of its logistic curve (option A) or opting for zero population control once the K value has been reached (option B) would not effectively control the mosquito population in the long term, as these strategies do not address the factors that allow the population to grow to unsustainable levels."
