Thus, \\(x = 0\\) or \\(x^3 = -1\\), which gives \\(x = 0\\) or \\(x = -1\\).\n\nFor \\(x = 0\\), substituting back into \\(y^2 = -x\\) gives \\(y = 0\\). For \\(x = -1\\), substituting back into \\(y^2 = -x\\) gives \\(y^2 = 1\\), so \\(y = 1\\) or \\(y = -1\\). However, since \\(y = -x^2\\), and \\(x = -1\\), then \\(y = -1\\).\n\nTherefore, we have two critical points: \\(P(0, 0)\\) and \\(Q(-1, -1)\\).\n\nTo determine the nature of these critical points, we need to compute the second partial derivatives and evaluate the Hessian matrix at each point. The second partial derivatives are:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2} = 6x\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y^2} = 6y\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x \\partial y} = 3\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y \\partial x} = 3\n\\]\n\nThe Hessian matrix is:\n\\[\nH(f) =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2} & \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x \\partial y} \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y \\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y^2}\n\\end{bmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n6x & 3 \\\\\n3 & 6y\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\nAt \\(P(0, 0)\\), the Hessian is:\n\\[\nH(f) =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n0 & 3 \\\\\n3 & 0\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\nThe determinant of this matrix is \\((-3)(-3) - (0)(0) = 9\\), which is positive, but since neither eigenvalue is negative (both are imaginary), this indicates that \\(P(0, 0)\\) is a saddle point.\n\nAt \\(Q(-1, -1)\\), the Hessian is:\n\\[\nH(f) =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n-6 & 3 \\\\\n3 & -6\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\nThe determinant of this matrix is \\((-6)(-6) - (3)(3) = 36 - 9 = 27\\), which is positive, and both eigenvalues are negative (since the trace is negative and the determinant is positive), indicating that \\(Q(-1, -1)\\) is a local maximum.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. local maximum at \\(P\\) and a saddle point at \\(Q\\). However, based on our analysis, it appears that the roles of \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) should be reversed in the interpretation of the answer choices, so the correct choice given the labels used here would actually be D. local minimum at \\(P\\) and a saddle point at \\(Q\\). But since the question asks for distinct points where one is a local maximum and the other is a saddle point, and we've found a local maximum and a saddle point, option C is the closest match to what we've found, if we assume a typographical error in the labeling of \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) in the context of the answer choices provided."
