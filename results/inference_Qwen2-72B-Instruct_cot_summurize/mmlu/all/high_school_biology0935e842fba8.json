                    "text": "The key to understanding this question lies in the basic principles of Mendelian genetics. Let's break down the information given:\n\n1. Black coat (B) is dominant over white coat (b).\n2. Both parents have black coats.\n3. In the offspring, 3/4 have black coats, and 1/4 have white coats.\n\nGiven that black is dominant, for an offspring to have a white coat (bb), both parents must contribute a recessive allele (b). This can only happen if each parent is heterozygous for the trait (Bb).\n\nLet's consider the possible genotypes of the parents and their implications:\n\n- A. bb \u00d7 bb: This would result in all offspring having white coats, which contradicts the observation.\n- B. Bb \u00d7 Bb: This cross would indeed produce offspring with the observed ratio of 3/4 black coats (BB or Bb) and 1/4 white coats (bb).\n- C. Bb \u00d7 bb: In this case, half of the offspring would be expected to have black coats (Bb) and half white coats (bb), not matching the observed ratio.\n- D. BB \u00d7 Bb: All offspring would be expected to have black coats (BB or Bb), as BB is homozygous dominant.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Bb \u00d7 Bb"
