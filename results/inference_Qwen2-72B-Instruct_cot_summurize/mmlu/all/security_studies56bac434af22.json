An increasingly popular means of bolstering regime security has been the expulsion of foreign workers and non-ethnic nationals and restricting borders to refugees and migrants.\nB. Weak states seek to avoid alliances with powerful states because alliances and assistance frequently are conditional on democratization and risk penalties if they are not met.\nC. An increasingly prevalent strategy among weak states has been the employment of private military or security companies and foreign mercenaries as force multipliers to secure the weak state from internal threats.\nD. Weak states may sometimes militarily engage in action to bolster their regional position and to mobilize internal support against the construction of an imagined external threat. This frequently coincides with economic or social crises as a policy of distraction.\n"

Here are explanations for each of the options you've provided:\n\nA. Expulsion of Foreign Workers and Restricting Borders: Elites might use nationalist policies to expel foreign workers and restrict borders to refugees and migrants as a means to consolidate power and appease domestic constituencies. By doing so, they can reduce potential sources of unrest and competition for jobs and resources, which could be perceived as a threat to regime stability.\n\nB. Avoidance of Alliances with Powerful States: While it is true that some weak states might avoid alliances with powerful states due to conditions attached to such relationships, others might seek such alliances precisely for the security guarantees and economic aid they provide. The decision to avoid or pursue alliances with powerful states depends on the specific context, including the nature of the elite's regime, the geopolitical environment, and the balance of power in the region.\n\nC. Employment of Private Military or Security Companies: Weak states might hire private military or security companies and foreign mercenaries as a cost-effective way to augment their security forces. These external actors can serve as force multipliers, helping to suppress internal dissent and defend against external threats without the need for building up expensive national armed forces.\n\nD. Military Engagement as a Distraction: Engaging in military actions can be a tactic used by elites to divert attention from internal problems such as economic crises or social unrest. By constructing an \"imagined external threat,\" leaders can rally domestic support and strengthen their grip on power. This strategy can also help to bolster a weak state's regional position by demonstrating military capability or asserting territorial claims.\n\nIn summary, elites in weak states might employ a combination of these external strategies to maintain their hold on power and address various internal and external challenges. Each strategy has its risks and benefits, and the choice of which to use depends on the specific circumstances facing the elite and the state."
