She has good evidence of a linear relationship between the variables: This statement is true because the 95% confidence interval for the slope does not include zero. This suggests that the slope is significantly different from zero, which implies that there is a linear relationship between the explanatory variable and the response variable.\n\nII. It is likely that there is a non-zero correlation (r) between the two variables: This statement is also true. Since the confidence interval for the slope does not include zero, it is likely that there is a non-zero correlation between the two variables. In fact, the slope of the regression line is directly related to the correlation coefficient (r), so if the slope is significantly different from zero, then the correlation coefficient is also likely to be significantly different from zero.\n\nIII. It is likely that the true slope of the regression line is 0: This statement is false. Since the 95% confidence interval for the slope does not include zero, it is unlikely that the true slope of the regression line is zero. In fact, the confidence interval provides an estimate of the range of values within which the true slope is likely to fall, and since this range does not include zero, it is unlikely that the true slope is zero."
