This can be relevant and admissible as circumstantial evidence suggesting that the defendant might be the same person referred to by the victim during the kidnapping incident. It is not considered hearsay in this context because it is not being used to prove the truth of the statement itself, but rather the fact that the statement was made and how it relates to the defendant's identity."
