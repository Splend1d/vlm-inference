Realist opposition often assumes that all states will protect their citizens, which ignores instances where governments are either unable or unwilling to do so. In cases of civil war, genocide, or massive human rights abuses, the state may be the perpetrator rather than the protector.\n\nB. The realist position can be seen as overlooking the responsibilities inherent in sovereignty. The principle of \"sovereignty as responsibility\" suggests that states have a duty to protect their citizens and that the international community has a role to play when this duty is not fulfilled.\n\nC. Critics argue that opponents of humanitarian intervention often overlook the wide body of international law relating to basic human rights and the consensus on grave crimes such as genocide. International norms and laws have evolved to include provisions for protecting individuals from serious harm, even if it means intervening in another state's affairs.\n\nThese criticisms highlight the tension between state sovereignty and the protection of human rights, which is central to debates about humanitarian intervention."
