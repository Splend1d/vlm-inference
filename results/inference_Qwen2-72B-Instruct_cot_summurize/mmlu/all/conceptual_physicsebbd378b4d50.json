Surface area of the pond.\n\nThe pressure at any point in a fluid, like water in a pond, depends on the formula P = \u03c1gh, where:\n- P is the pressure,\n- \u03c1 (rho) is the density of the fluid,\n- g is the acceleration due to gravity, and\n- h is the height or depth below the surface.\n\nThe surface area of the pond does not affect the pressure at the bottom; it only affects the volume of water but not the pressure per unit area at a given depth."
