                    "text": "The correct answer is A. It increases the concentration of OH-, causing the mitochondria to pump H+ to the intermembrane space.\n\nHowever, this choice contains an error in its explanation because it incorrectly refers to an increase in OH-. In fact, a decrease in pH (low external pH) indicates an increase in hydrogen ion (H+) concentration, not hydroxide (OH-) concentration. The correct explanation should be:\n\nA low external pH increases the concentration of H+, creating a higher proton gradient across the mitochondrial inner membrane. This stimulates the proton pumps (complexes I, III, and IV) in the electron transport chain to pump more protons into the intermembrane space, increasing the proton motive force. As these protons flow back into the matrix through ATP synthase, ATP is produced. Therefore, the correct explanation for the effect of a low external pH on mitochondria would emphasize the increased proton pumping activity rather than an increase in OH- concentration. So, a corrected version of the answer would be:\n\nA. It increases the concentration of H+, causing the mitochondria to pump more H+ to the intermembrane space to maintain the proton gradient necessary for ATP synthesis."
