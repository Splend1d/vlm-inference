The wife, who weighed more than 300 pounds, was unable to find a size large enough to fit her. She then saw a store clerk and asked if the store carried the dress in her size. The clerk looked at the wife and said, \"You look like a hippopotamus, and I'm sorry, but we don't carry this dress in the hippo size. \" Another customer in the store overheard the comment and began to laugh. The wife became very upset and hurried out of the store. If the wife asserts a tort action against the department store based upon the clerk's actions, the wife will\n\nA. win, because the statement was overheard byanother customer.\nB. win, because the clerk's conduct was extreme and outrageous.\nC. lose, because the clerk was merely statingan opinion.\nD. lose, because the wife only suffered hurt feelings.\n"

The clerk's comment was not only insulting but also discriminatory and could be considered as creating an emotionally distressing situation for the wife. This kind of behavior can sometimes be grounds for a successful tort action, particularly if it can be shown that the conduct was extreme and outrageous and caused severe emotional distress.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the success of such a case would depend on various factors including jurisdiction, the specific laws applicable in that area, and how the court interprets the circumstances of the incident. In some jurisdictions, such cases might fall under the category of intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED), which requires proof that the defendant's conduct was extreme and outrageous, and that it intentionally or recklessly caused severe emotional distress to the plaintiff."
