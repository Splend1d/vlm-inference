The purchaser noticed that the car made a squeaking noise when the brakes were applied, so the purchaser took the car back to the dealership to have the mechanic there take a look at it. The mechanic worked on the car and then told the purchaser that the problem had been fixed. A few days later, the brakes failed, causing the purchaser to crash into a tree. The purchaser suffered a serious head injury in the crash. If the purchaser asserts a claim against the car dealership for damages for his injuries, will the purchaser prevail?\n\nA. Yes, if the brakes were defective when the dealership sold the car to the purchaser.\nB. Yes, because the dealership is strictly liable for defective repairs on cars it has sold.\nC. No, because the car had been driven more than 1,000 miles.\nD. No, unless the dealership's employee was negligent in repairing the brakes.\n"

However, based on general principles of product liability law, the most likely answer is:\n\nA. Yes, if the brakes were defective when the dealership sold the car to the purchaser.\n\nIf the brakes were defective when the car was sold, the dealership could be held liable under a theory of strict liability or breach of warranty. The fact that the car had been driven more than 1,000 miles does not necessarily absolve the dealership of liability if the defect was present at the time of sale.\n\nHowever, if the brakes were not defective at the time of sale and the problem arose due to the mechanic's negligence in repairing them, then the answer would be D. No, unless the dealership's employee was negligent in repairing the brakes. In this scenario, the dealership could potentially be held liable for the actions of its employee under the doctrine of respondeat superior. \n\nIt's worth noting that some states may have specific statutes or regulations that govern car dealerships and their responsibilities for repairing defects, which could also impact the outcome of the case."
