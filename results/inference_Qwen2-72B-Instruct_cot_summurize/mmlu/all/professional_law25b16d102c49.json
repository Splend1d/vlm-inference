The prime minister's death triggered a civil war between rival factions within the country. To prevent U. S. involvement in this country's political crisis, Congress passed an appropriations bill prohibiting any funding for U. S. military operations in this foreign country. The appropriations bill was passed over a presidential veto. Thereafter, the President issued an executive order directing U. S. Navy and Army troops to the foreign country to restore order. Is this executive order constitutional?\n\nA. Yes, because the President, as commander- in-chief of the armed forces, has the power to authorize such military expeditions.\nB. Yes, because the President has inherent power to regulate foreign affairs as long as there is no formal declaration of war.\nC. No, because the President cannot usurp Congress's spending power by taking action that supersedes a congressional appropriations bill.\nD. No, because the executive order was neither authorized by federal statute nor ratified by the Senate.\n"

No, because the President cannot usurp Congress's spending power by taking action that supersedes a congressional appropriations bill.\n\nIn this scenario, Congress has explicitly passed an appropriations bill prohibiting any funding for U.S. military operations in the foreign country, overriding a presidential veto. This means that the legislative branch has exercised its constitutional authority under Article I, Section 9, which allows it to control spending and thus limit military engagements. The President's executive order would be in direct conflict with this legislation, and since the Constitution grants Congress the power of the purse, the executive order would likely be deemed unconstitutional as it infringes upon Congress's exclusive power to appropriate funds for military action."
