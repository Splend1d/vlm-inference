Their resultant would indeed be 0 N as they cancel each other out.\n\nB. 5 N - This is possible if the two vectors are at right angles to each other (90 degrees apart). Using the Pythagorean theorem, the square root of (3^2 + 4^2) equals 5 N.\n\nC. 8 N - This is not possible with vectors of 3 N and 4 N, regardless of the angle between them. The maximum resultant occurs when the vectors are in the same direction, which would be 3 N + 4 N = 7 N.\n\nD. Any of these - Given the explanations above, this statement is incorrect because not any of these options can be true simultaneously. However, if the question implies that any of these could be true under different conditions, then A and B are correct possibilities, but C is not.\n\nSo, the correct answer, considering the options given, would be:\n\nD. Any of these (if we interpret it as \"any of these under certain conditions,\" excluding option C). But if we're looking for the most accurate response from the given options without that interpretation, the answer would be:\n\n**A. 0 N and B. 5 N**, since those are the only two valid possibilities listed."
