Moore, in his work \"Principia Ethica,\" famously argues against the identification of good with any natural property or state, such as pleasure (as in hedonism) or that which we desire (as in some forms of ethical subjectivism). He proposes instead that \"good\" is a simple, indefinable quality\u2014a \"non-natural property\"\u2014that cannot be broken down into more basic components or equated with anything else. This view is known as Moore's \"open question argument.\"\n\nTherefore, the answer would be:\n\nD. None of the above."
