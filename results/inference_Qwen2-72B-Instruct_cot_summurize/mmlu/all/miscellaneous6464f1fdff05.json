Wood\n\nWhile wood can be considered a renewable resource if it is sustainably sourced, it's important to note that the other options listed (oil, natural gas, and coal) are all non-renewable fossil fuels. Renewable energy sources are those that can be replenished naturally in a relatively short amount of time, such as biomass (wood is a form of biomass), solar, wind, hydro, and geothermal power."
