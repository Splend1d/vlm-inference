However, without additional context about whether the action was prohibited or if there was potential harm caused by removing the item, it's not clear-cut that this action is \"clearly morally wrong.\" In many cases, removing artifacts from historical sites can be seen as theft or vandalism, but since the question asks for a clear violation according to ordinary moral standards and does not provide enough information to determine if legal or cultural norms were broken, it cannot definitively be labeled as wrong based on the given information. For the purposes of this question, assuming no further details, it would also be classified as 'not wrong' due to the lack of clarity. However, in real-world scenarios, taking items from ancient ruins is often considered wrong and can have significant legal and ethical implications."
