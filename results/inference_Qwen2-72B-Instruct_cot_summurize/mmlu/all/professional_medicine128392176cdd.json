He also has had a 13-kg (30-lb) weight loss and bulky, foul-smelling stools that do not flush easily. He has a 10-year history of drinking 8 to 10 beers daily. He has been hospitalized twice for severe abdominal pain 4 and 6 years ago. His pulse is 80/min, and blood pressure is 105/65 mm Hg. He appears cachectic and chronically ill. The abdomen is nontender. Deep tendon reflexes are 4+ bilaterally. Chvostek and Trousseau signs are present. His serum calcium concentration is 6.5 mg/dL. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\n\nA. Hypomagnesemia\nB. Hypoparathyroidism\nC. Osteomalacia\nD. Vitamin D deficiency\n"

However, given the patient's history of chronic alcohol use, weight loss, and bulky, foul-smelling stools, as well as the presence of Chvostek and Trousseau signs, the most likely diagnosis is:\n\nB. Hypoparathyroidism\n\nHypoparathyroidism leads to decreased levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH), which is responsible for maintaining normal serum calcium levels. The symptoms described, including cramping in the hands and feet, numbness and tingling around the lips and fingers, and the low serum calcium level (6.5 mg/dL, which is below the normal range of 8.5-10.5 mg/dL), are consistent with hypocalcemia due to hypoparathyroidism.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that chronic alcohol use and malabsorption (as suggested by the bulky, foul-smelling stools) could also lead to deficiencies in other minerals such as magnesium (option A), which can exacerbate hypocalcemia. Vitamin D deficiency (option D) can also contribute to hypocalcemia, especially if there is malabsorption affecting fat-soluble vitamins. Osteomalacia (option C) typically presents with bone pain and muscle weakness rather than the acute neurological symptoms described here.\n\nGiven the patient's history of hospitalization for severe abdominal pain, it's possible that he may have developed complications related to chronic alcohol use or another condition leading to malabsorption and subsequent mineral deficiencies. Further evaluation would be needed to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other contributing factors."
