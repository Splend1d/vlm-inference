Let's correct it by checking the possible closest answer to our calculation.\n\nThe closest match to our calculation from the given options would be:\n\nD. 44% \n\nHowever, this question seems to have an issue with the options provided versus the calculation based on the given information. Based on the options, none perfectly matches the calculated result, but D is the closest among the choices you gave.
