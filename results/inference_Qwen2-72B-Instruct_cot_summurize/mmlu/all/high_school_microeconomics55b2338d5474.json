This results in an allocatively inefficient outcome because the quantity produced is less than what would prevail under perfect competition and the price is higher. The monopolist does not have to worry about the entry of new firms because barriers to entry exist, allowing them to maintain their monopoly power and continue maximizing profits without facing competitive pressure from new entrants."
