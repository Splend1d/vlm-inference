These tests are not specifically aligned with any particular curriculum but rather aim to measure general knowledge and skills that are expected to be acquired by students at each grade level. This allows educators and administrators to see how well students are performing relative to their peers across different schools or districts, which can be useful for identifying areas where additional support may be needed or for evaluating the effectiveness of educational programs."
