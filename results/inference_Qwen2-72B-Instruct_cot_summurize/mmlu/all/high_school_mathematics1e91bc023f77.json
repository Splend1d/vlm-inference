The expected value (EV) can be calculated by multiplying each outcome by its probability and then summing these products.\n\nLet's denote the number of purple balls as \\(k\\). There are a total of \\(5 + k\\) balls in the bin.\n\nThe probability of drawing a green ball is \\(\\frac{5}{5+k}\\), and if a green ball is drawn, the player wins 2 dollars.\n\nThe probability of drawing a purple ball is \\(\\frac{k}{5+k}\\), and if a purple ball is drawn, the player loses 2 dollars.\n\nThe expected value (EV) of the game is given by:\n\\[ EV = \\left(\\frac{5}{5+k} \\times 2\\right) + \\left(\\frac{k}{5+k} \\times (-2)\\right) \\]\n\nWe know that the expected value of the game is 50 cents or $0.50. Thus, we have:\n\\[ 0.50 = \\left(\\frac{5}{5+k} \\times 2\\right) + \\left(\\frac{k}{5+k} \\times (-2)\\right) \\]\n\nSimplifying,\n\\[ 0.50 = \\frac{10}{5+k} - \\frac{2k}{5+k} \\]\n\\[ 0.50 = \\frac{10-2k}{5+k} \\]\n\nMultiplying both sides by \\((5+k)\\) to clear the denominator,\n\\[ 0.50(5+k) = 10 - 2k \\]\n\\[ 2.5 + 0.5k = 10 - 2k \\]\n\nRearranging terms to solve for \\(k\\),\n\\[ 2.5k = 7.5 \\]\n\\[ k = \\frac{7.5}{2.5} \\]\n\\[ k = 3 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of purple balls (\\(k\\)) is 3, which corresponds to choice C."
