Here's how each of the options you've listed could be affected:\n\nA. Negative impacts on agriculture: Many animal species play crucial roles in pollination, pest control, and soil health. For example, bees and other insects help pollinate crops, while birds and bats can help control insect pests. The loss of these species can lead to decreased crop yields and increased use of pesticides.\n\nB. Negative impacts on water quality: Animals such as fish and amphibians can help maintain water quality by consuming algae and other organic matter that can contribute to pollution. In addition, wetland-dwelling animals like beavers and muskrats can help create and maintain wetlands, which act as natural filters for pollutants.\n\nC. Negative impacts on human health: Many animal species provide important ecosystem services that can benefit human health. For example, some animals help control disease-carrying pests like mosquitoes, while others help maintain clean air and water. In addition, many medicines are derived from animal and plant species, so the loss of biodiversity can limit our ability to discover new treatments for diseases.\n\nOverall, the loss of animal species can have far-reaching consequences for both the environment and human society."
