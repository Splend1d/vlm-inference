Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation:\nScenario 1: Paying for SAT prep courses is not considered morally wrong because it's a legitimate way to help your child prepare for college entrance exams. It becomes ethically questionable if you were to bribe officials or cheat on the exam, but simply paying for prep courses is not morally wrong.\nScenario 2: Praying for rain on the Fourth of July parade is not considered morally wrong either. While it might be seen as selfish or thoughtless, praying for personal desires is generally not considered immoral unless it directly harms others. In this case, it's an act of wishing for weather, which is out of anyone's control."
