She was hospitalized, lost her eye, and had several operations over several years. She could not return to work as an apprentice ballet dancer due to loss of coordination, constant headaches, and severe disfigurement. She is considered totally disabled. She had been training for the ballet for many years and, at the trial against the tortfeasor, she proved that she was considered a bright and uncoming student. The defendant claimed that this was still too speculative whether she would have been successful. The trial court disagreed and allowed evidence on the lost earning capacity of a ballet dancer. The jury awarded $3 million. Will the appellate court likely reverse the verdict due to the lost earning capacity issue?\n\nA. No, the jury's award is discretionary and inviolate, and it may not be disturbed with respect to personal injury damages.\nB. No, because some imprecision in the evidence regarding loss of earning capacity is to be expected and is not grounds for excluding the evidence.\nC. Yes, the evidence did not guarantee or assure anyone that she really would have been a successful professional ballet dancer.\nD. Yes, she can only collect for lost work that she held prior to the accident; her future lost earning capacity could be based on an apprentice ballet dancer.\n"

No, because some imprecision in the evidence regarding loss of earning capacity is to be expected and is not grounds for excluding the evidence.\n\nIn cases involving loss of future earning capacity, courts generally recognize that such losses are inherently speculative and that complete certainty is impossible. As long as there is a reasonable basis for estimating the loss, the evidence will be admissible. In this case, the plaintiff provided evidence that she was a promising ballet dancer, which supports her claim for lost earning capacity as a professional dancer. While the defendant argues that her success was speculative, this does not necessarily mean the evidence should be excluded. The jury is allowed to consider the evidence presented and make a determination based on the facts of the case. Therefore, it is unlikely that an appellate court would reverse the verdict solely on the grounds of lost earning capacity."
