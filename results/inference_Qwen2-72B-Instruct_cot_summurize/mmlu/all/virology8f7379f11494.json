These viruses typically appear as thread-like structures that can be straight, branched, or U-shaped under an electron microscope. Their length can vary from 700 to 1,400 nanometers (nm), while their diameter is about 80 nm. The filaments are composed of a helical nucleocapsid core surrounded by a lipid bilayer envelope derived from the host cell membrane, which contains viral glycoproteins."
