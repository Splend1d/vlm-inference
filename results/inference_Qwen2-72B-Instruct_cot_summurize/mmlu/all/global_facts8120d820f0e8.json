However, it's important to note that the methods for measuring and reporting homelessness can vary significantly between countries, so direct comparisons can be complex. For instance, some countries may only count those living on the streets, while others may include those staying in shelters or temporary accommodation. This can affect the reported rates of homelessness. Nonetheless, based on available data at the time, the US had a relatively high rate of homelessness per capita compared to other developed nations."
