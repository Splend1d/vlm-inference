The young men shall go to battle; the married men shall forge arms and transport provisions; the women shall make tents and clothing and shall serve in the hospitals; the children shall turn old linen into lint; the aged shall betake themselves to the public places in order to arouse the courage of the warriors and preach the hatred of kings and the unity of the Republic. \u2026\nThe Committee of Public Safety is charged to take all necessary measures to set up without delay an extraordinary manufacture of arms of every sort which corresponds with the ardor and energy of the French people. It is, accordingly, authorized to form all the establishments, factories, workshops, and mills which shall be deemed necessary for the carrying on of these works, as well as to put in requisition, within the entire extent of the Republic, the artists and workingmen who can contribute to their success.\nThe representatives of the people sent out for the execution of the present law shall have the same authority in their respective districts, acting in concert with the Committee of Public Safety; they are invested with the unlimited powers assigned to the representatives of the people to the armies.\nThe Lev\u00e9e en Masse, August 23, 1793\nIt could be argued that the passage represents a turning point in the history of warfare in modern European history because\n\nA. it represented the introduction of weaponry produced by large-scale industrialization\nB. it advocated the total extinction of a nation's enemies\nC. it was war run by a committee\nD. it advocated total war\n"

The passage advocates total war, where all segments of society are mobilized for the war effort, including not only soldiers but also civilians who are tasked with supporting the military in various ways. This marked a significant departure from previous wars, where combat was often limited to professional armies and did not involve the entire population. The Lev\u00e9e en Masse called for a full-scale mobilization of resources and manpower, reflecting the concept of total war. While option A might seem plausible given the reference to the manufacture of arms, the passage does not specifically mention industrialization, which became more prominent later in the 19th century. Options B and C do not accurately reflect the content or implications of the passage."
