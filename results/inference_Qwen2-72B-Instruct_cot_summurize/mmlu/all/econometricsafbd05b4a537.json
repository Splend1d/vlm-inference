It is also suitable for over-identified systems when you have more instruments than endogenous variables.\n\nGiven these explanations, the correct answer is:\n\nB. (iii) and (iv) only\n\nHowever, option (iii) 2SLS is a specific type of IV estimation, so in essence, selecting both 2SLS and IV could imply some overlap since 2SLS is a form of IV estimation. Nonetheless, within the context of the question, which focuses on over-identified systems, both 2SLS and IV estimation techniques are relevant and distinct answers."
