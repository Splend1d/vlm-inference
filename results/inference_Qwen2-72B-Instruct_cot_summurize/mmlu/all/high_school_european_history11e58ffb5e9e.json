However, if we must choose from the given options, the closest would be:\n\nA modified version of A, acknowledging that religious worship varied not just by social position but also by personal philosophy and governmental utility. But since this option isn't available, none of the summaries accurately reflect Gibbon's statement. His view is more nuanced, suggesting a tolerance and practical acceptance of diverse religious practices by the populace, skepticism by philosophers, and strategic use by magistrates.\n\nIf I have to pick the closest option, it would be:\n\nA. In ancient Rome, religious worship was decentralized and tended to vary with one's social position.\n\nBut it's important to note that this option doesn't fully capture Gibbon's point about the philosopher's and magistrate's perspectives."
