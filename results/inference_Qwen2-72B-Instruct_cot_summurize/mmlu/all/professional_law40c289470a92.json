As planned, the co-felon entered the bank while the defendant stationed herself outside as a lookout. The co-felon approached the bank teller, pointed her unloaded gun at him, and demanded themoney. While the teller was handing the money to the co-felon, the defendant got scared and fled. The teller, who had a weak heart started to feel faint. He handed over the money to the co-felon, and then clutched his chest and died. The co-felon was found not guilty by a jury in her trial, which preceded the defendant's trial. The defendant is subsequently prosecuted for conspiracy and acquitted. Her acquittal most likely resulted because\n\nA. the defendant abandoned her participation in the crime.\nB. the teller's death was accidental.\nC. the co-felon was acquitted.\nD. the teller was not placed in apprehension of bodily harm.\n"

The defendant's decision to flee indicates that she abandoned her participation in the crime before it was completed, which could be a defense against a charge of conspiracy if she effectively withdrew from the criminal plan. However, it's important to note that abandonment can be a complex legal issue, and the specifics of the case would determine whether this defense was successful. Additionally, the fact that the co-felon used an unloaded gun and the teller's unexpected death due to a medical condition might also have influenced the jury's decision, but the act of fleeing and thus potentially withdrawing from the crime seems to be the most direct explanation given."
