                    "text": "The principle that explains why cold food warms up and hot food cools off when stored at room temperature is A. entropy. Entropy is a measure of the disorder or randomness in a system. In this context, heat (thermal energy) naturally flows from hotter objects to colder ones, increasing the overall disorder or entropy of the system until thermal equilibrium is reached. This process is described by the second law of thermodynamics, which states that the total entropy of an isolated system can never decrease over time. Therefore, hot food will lose heat to its surroundings until it reaches room temperature, and cold food will gain heat from its surroundings until it also reaches room temperature."
