So, the contribution margin (CM) in dollars would be:\n\n\\[ CM = Selling\\ Price \\times Contribution\\ Margin\\ Percentage \\]\n\\[ CM = 19 \\times 0.20 = 3.80 \\]\n\nThis means that for each unit sold, $3.80 should be the contribution to fixed costs and profit.\n\nGiven that there are also variable selling and distribution costs of $3.00 per unit, these need to be subtracted from the contribution margin to determine how much can be spent on variable manufacturing costs.\n\n\\[ Target\\ Variable\\ Manufacturing\\ Cost = Selling\\ Price - Contribution\\ Margin - Variable\\ Selling\\ and\\ Distribution\\ Costs \\]\n\\[ Target\\ Variable\\ Manufacturing\\ Cost = 19 - 3.80 - 3 = 12.20 \\]\n\nSo, the correct answer is A. $12.20."
