A boy and a girl, both 12-year-old youngsters at the bonanza, were looking at each other's cards when they were approached by a 32-year-old collector. The collector asked the boy and girl if he could look through their baseball cards. The boy and girl nodded affirmatively. As the collector was flipping through the boy's cards, he found a 1948 card featuring Branch Rickey, the former owner of the Brooklyn Dodgers. The collector, who knew the card was worth more than $500, offered the boy 50 cents for the card. The boy thought the card had very little value because he knew that Rickey was not a major league baseball player. The boy accepted the 50 cents and gave the Rickey baseball card to the collector. The next day the boy found out that the baseball card was worth$600. If the boy asserts a claim against the collector for deceit, will the boy prevail?\n\nA. Yes, because the collector did not disclose the true value of the card.\nB. Yes, because the boy was the true owner of the card and was entitled to the benefit of the bargain.\nC. No, because the collector made no false representations of fact.\nD. No, because the boy was not justified in relying on the collector's offer.\n"

No, because the collector made no false representations of fact.\n\nIn this scenario, the collector did not deceive the boy by making any false statements about the card's value. The boy was aware that Branch Rickey was not a major league baseball player and assumed the card had little value. The collector did not have an obligation to disclose the true value of the card to the boy. Therefore, the boy cannot assert a claim against the collector for deceit because there was no false representation of fact made by the collector.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the transaction may be subject to scrutiny under the doctrine of unconscionability or unfair advantage due to the significant disparity in the value exchanged. But unconscionability is not the same as deceit, and it would require a different legal argument."
