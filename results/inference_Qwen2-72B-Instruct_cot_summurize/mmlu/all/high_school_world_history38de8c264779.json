Religious restrictions were not universally observed by all Muslims.\n\nThe first verse from the Qur'an clearly prohibits alcohol, indicating a religious restriction. The second verse from the Rub\u00e1iy\u00e1t of Omar Khayy\u00e1m, a famous Persian poet and astronomer who lived during the 12th century, suggests a more relaxed attitude towards drinking wine, even linking it to a celebratory moment when the roses are in bloom. This juxtaposition indicates that not all Muslims adhered strictly to the religious prohibitions outlined in the Qur'an, thus supporting the idea that religious restrictions were not universally observed by all Muslims."
