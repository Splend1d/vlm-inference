                    "text": "Statement 1 is true. This is known as the product formula for subgroups. If \\(H\\) and \\(K\\) are subgroups of a group \\(G\\), then the number of elements in the set \\(HK = \\{hk : h \\in H, k \\in K\\}\\) is given by \\(|HK| = \\frac{|H||K|}{|H \\cap K|}\\). This is because each element that is in both \\(H\\) and \\(K\\) (i.e., in \\(H \\cap K\\)) is counted twice when you multiply \\(|H|\\) and \\(|K|\\), once for being in \\(H\\) and once for being in \\(K\\). Dividing by \\(|H \\cap K|\\) corrects this overcounting.\n\nStatement 2 is also true. A group of order \\(2p\\), where \\(p\\) is an odd prime, is either cyclic or isomorphic to the dihedral group \\(D_p\\). The proof of this involves some group theory:\n\n- By Lagrange's theorem, the possible orders of subgroups of such a group are \\(1\\), \\(2\\), \\(p\\), and \\(2p\\).\n- There must be an element of order \\(p\\) since \\(p\\) is prime and divides \\(2p\\). Let's call this subgroup generated by this element \\(P\\).\n- There must also be an element of order \\(2\\) because of Cauchy's theorem. Let's call this element \\(x\\).\n- If there is an element of order \\(2p\\), then the group is cyclic.\n- If there is no element of order \\(2p\\), then consider the action of \\(x\\) on \\(P\\) by conjugation. Since \\(x\\) has order \\(2\\), the only possible actions are trivial (i.e., \\(xpx^{-1} = p\\)) or non-trivial (i.e., \\(xpx^{-1}\\) generates \\(P\\) but is not equal to \\(p\\)). In the non-trivial case, the group structure is exactly that of \\(D_p\\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is **A. True, True**."
