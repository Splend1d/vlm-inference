The other options listed are not related to detecting odors:\n\nB. Gustatory receptors are responsible for taste.\nC. Feature detectors are a type of neuron in the visual system that responds to specific features of the visual field, such as edges or motion.\nD. The basilar membrane is part of the inner ear and plays a role in hearing."
