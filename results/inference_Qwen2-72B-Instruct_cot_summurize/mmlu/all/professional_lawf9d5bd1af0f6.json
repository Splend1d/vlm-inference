This rule was an ancient common law doctrine that governed certain types of property transfers and could result in a remainder interest intended for a grantor's heirs becoming a reversion back to the grantor due to technicalities in how the interest was conveyed.\n\nIn simple terms, the Rule in Shelley's Case stated that if a grantor conveyed a life estate to someone (often a tenant) and then attempted to create a remainder interest in the grantor's heirs, the remainder would fail and revert back to the grantor because the grantor had a greater interest in the property than his heirs at the time of conveyance. The rationale behind this rule was based on the concept that one cannot grant a better estate than what one owns; thus, since the grantor still held a reversionary interest, he could not validly pass a remainder interest to his heirs that was superior to his own interest.\n\nIt's worth noting that the Rule in Shelley's Case has been abolished or significantly modified in many jurisdictions due to its complexity and perceived unfairness. Modern property law often allows for more straightforward and predictable conveyances of remainder interests without the historical restrictions imposed by this rule."
