It would rise more quickly for negative disturbances than for positive ones of the same magnitude\n\nThe leverage effect in financial econometrics refers to the observation that negative shocks (bad news) tend to increase the volatility of asset returns more than positive shocks (good news) of the same magnitude. Therefore, in a model that accounts for the leverage effect, the news impact curve would show a greater response to negative disturbances than to positive ones. This is often modeled using an asymmetric GARCH (Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity) model, such as the EGARCH (Exponential GARCH) model or the GJR-GARCH (Glosten, Jagannathan, and Runkle GARCH) model."
