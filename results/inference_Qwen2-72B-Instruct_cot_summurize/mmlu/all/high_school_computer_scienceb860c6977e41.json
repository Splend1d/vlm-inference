Lossless compression\n\nHuffman coding is a lossless data compression algorithm used to compress data by assigning shorter bit sequences to more frequently occurring data elements and longer bit sequences to less frequently occurring data elements. This makes it useful for compressing text, images, and other types of data without losing any information during the process. It's not suitable for decryption (A), as it does not encrypt data, nor for efficient sorting (B) or lossy compression (D), as it does not remove any data but rather optimizes the representation of data."
