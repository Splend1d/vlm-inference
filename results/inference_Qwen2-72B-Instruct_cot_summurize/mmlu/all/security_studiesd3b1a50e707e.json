Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels\n\nHistorical materialism, also known as the materialist conception of history, is a method of interpreting history that focuses on the ways in which societies and their structures are determined by the division of labor, modes of production, and property relations. This theory was primarily developed by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, who argued that the material conditions of society's economic base dictate the social, political, and ideological superstructure."
