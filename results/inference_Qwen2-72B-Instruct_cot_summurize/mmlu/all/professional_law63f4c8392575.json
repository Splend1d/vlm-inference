The statute contains express findings that, when combined, the wages received by dry cleaning workers have a substantial impact on the national economy and on the flow of goods and services in interstate commerce. These findings are supported by information presented to Congress during committee hearings on the legislation. A small dry cleaning store operates exclusively within a community in the center of a geographically large state. It has no customers from outside the state. It employs three workers, each of whom is paid less than the federal minimum wage. Must this dry cleaning store comply with the statute imposing the federal minimum wage requirements on all dry cleaning stores?\n\nA. No, because the store does no business in interstate commerce.\nB. No, because the wages of the store's three workers do not have a substantial impact on interstate commerce.\nC. Yes, because the commerce clause vests Congress with plenary legislative authority over labor relations.\nD. Yes, because the wages paid by dry cleaning stores have a substantial impact on interstate commerce.\n"

Yes, because the wages paid by dry cleaning stores have a substantial impact on interstate commerce.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has held that Congress has the power under the Commerce Clause to regulate activities that, when considered in the aggregate, have a substantial effect on interstate commerce. In this case, the statute includes findings that the wages received by dry cleaning workers have a substantial impact on the national economy and on the flow of goods and services in interstate commerce. These findings, if supported by evidence presented to Congress, would likely be sufficient to uphold the application of the federal minimum wage requirements to all dry cleaning stores, including the one in question, regardless of its individual impact on interstate commerce."
