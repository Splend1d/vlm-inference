However, it's important to note that alpha waves are also prominent during the relaxed, awake state, such as when you're daydreaming or meditating with your eyes closed. They are not typically dominant during deep sleep stages (Stages 3 and 4), which are characterized by delta waves. In the context of the options given, the hypnagogic state (the transitional phase between wakefulness and sleep) is the closest association for alpha waves."
