                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability that exactly two out of four packages are delivered to the correct houses. We can approach this by calculating the number of ways to choose which two packages will be correctly delivered and then determining how many ways the remaining two can be incorrectly delivered (but not in such a way that they both end up in their correct houses).\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of ways the packages can be delivered without any restrictions. Since there are 4 packages and 4 houses, each package has 4 choices for delivery, but since only one package can go to each house, this is actually a permutation problem. The total number of ways to deliver the packages is simply the number of permutations of 4 items, which is \\(4!\\) (4 factorial). This equals \\(4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 24\\).\n\nNext, we calculate the number of ways to choose 2 packages out of 4 to be correctly delivered. This is a combination problem, calculated as \\(\\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = 6\\).\n\nNow, we need to consider how the remaining 2 packages can be delivered incorrectly. For the last two packages to be delivered incorrectly, they must essentially swap places with each other (since there are only two of them left and no other houses). There is only 1 way to do this (i.e., the third package goes to the fourth house and the fourth package goes to the third house), so we don't multiply by any additional factor here.\n\nThus, the number of favorable outcomes (exactly 2 packages delivered correctly) is equal to the number of ways to choose which 2 packages are delivered correctly (\\(6\\)) times the 1 way the remaining 2 packages can be delivered incorrectly, giving us a total of \\(6\\) favorable outcomes.\n\nFinally, the probability of exactly two packages being delivered correctly is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes:\n\n\\[P = \\frac{6}{24} = \\frac{1}{4}\\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\)."
