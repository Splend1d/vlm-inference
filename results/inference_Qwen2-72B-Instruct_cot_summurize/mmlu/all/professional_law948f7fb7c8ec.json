The Declaration of Covenants created the community association, an administrative entity that would administer and enforce the regulations and restrictions recited among the covenants. One of the regulations set forth in the Declaration of Covenants reads:\"Each purchaser, by the acceptance of a deed therefore, promises to pay the community association an annual assessment or charge to be determined on the basis of the valuation of each individual lot and the improvements thereon. Nonpayment of any annual assessment or charge when due shall result in a lien upon the parcel of the property. \"A gardener, the owner of lot 29 in the development, sold his land to a landscaper with a deed containing no restrictions. The community association, pursuant the Declaration of Covenants, sues the landscaper to collect the annual assessment for lot 29. Which of the following is the best argument for the landscaper?\n\nA. There is not privity of contract between the housing corporation and the community association.\nB. Because the charge constitutes a lien, there is no personal obligation on the landscaper's part.\nC. There is no privity of contract between the gardener and the landscaper.\nD. There is no privity of estate between the gardener and the landscaper.\n"

There is no privity of contract between the gardener and the landscaper.\n\nThis argument suggests that since the original covenant was between the housing corporation and the gardener (the original lot owner), and there was no explicit agreement between the gardener and the landscaper regarding the covenant or the annual assessment, the landscaper is not bound by the terms of the original covenant. However, this argument might not hold if the covenants run with the land, which is common in such developments, meaning that they bind all subsequent owners regardless of whether they were parties to the original agreement.\n\nIt's worth noting that option B is incorrect because the existence of a lien does not absolve the property owner from personal responsibility for payment; rather, it provides a means for the creditor to enforce payment through the security interest in the property. Options A and D are not directly relevant to the landscaper's situation, as they concern relationships between different entities that are not central to the landscaper's defense against the community association's claim."
