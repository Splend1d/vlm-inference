He critiques traditional views that exclude certain groups (such as women or people of different races) from full moral consideration and extends this critique to argue that species membership alone should not be the basis for differential treatment. This leads him to advocate for the extension of equal consideration to nonhuman animals as well, but the core principle he discusses primarily in relation to humans is about how we should treat them."
