It keeps track of the number of insects created and assigns a unique ID to each new instance. Since this value is not specific to any single insect but rather a collective property of all insects, it should be declared as static. This allows it to retain its value across all instances of the class and ensures that it is only stored once in memory, rather than having a copy for each instance."
