                    "text": "A contractionary monetary policy typically involves actions by a central bank to reduce the money supply in an economy. This can be achieved through various methods, such as selling government securities, raising the reserve requirement for banks, or increasing the discount rate (the rate at which banks can borrow from the central bank). The intended effect of these actions is to make credit less available and more expensive, which leads to:\n\nNOMINAL INTEREST RATE: Increase - As the central bank raises interest rates, the cost of borrowing increases, which tends to discourage investment and spending.\n\nAGGREGATE DEMAND: Decrease - With higher interest rates, borrowing becomes more expensive, leading to a decrease in investment spending. Additionally, consumer spending may also decrease as loans become more costly. This results in a decrease in aggregate demand.\n\nOUTPUT: Decrease - A decrease in aggregate demand leads to lower production levels, as businesses respond to reduced spending by cutting back on production.\n\nPRICE LEVEL: Decrease - In the short run, a decrease in aggregate demand can lead to a decrease in the price level as businesses may lower prices to stimulate sales. However, in the long run, if the economy returns to its natural level of output, the price level might stabilize or adjust based on other factors like supply shocks or changes in velocity of money.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Increase Decrease Decrease Decrease"
