This occurs when the discriminant (\\(b^2 - 4ac\\)) is greater than 0. For this equation, \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = -6\\), and \\(c\\) is what we're solving for.\n\nThe discriminant is given by:\n\\[b^2 - 4ac > 0\\]\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\\[(-6)^2 - 4(1)(c) > 0\\]\n\\[36 - 4c > 0\\]\n\\[36 > 4c\\]\n\\[9 > c\\]\n\nThis tells us that for the quadratic equation to have real roots (and hence for the inequality to have real solutions for \\(x\\)), \\(c\\) must be less than 9. However, we're looking for positive values of \\(c\\). Therefore, \\(c\\) should be in the interval \\((0, 9)\\).\n\nHowever, it's important to note that for the inequality \\(x^2 - 6x + c < 0\\) to actually hold for some \\(x\\), the quadratic must cross the x-axis at least once (i.e., it must have real roots). If \\(c\\) were exactly 9, the quadratic would touch the x-axis but not cross it, resulting in a single real root rather than two distinct real roots which is necessary for the inequality to hold true for some \\(x\\). Thus, \\(c\\) cannot equal 9; it must be less than 9 for the inequality to have real solutions for \\(x\\).\n\nSo, the correct answer in interval notation is:\n\nA. (0, 9)"
