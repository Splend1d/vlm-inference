Applied to education, this would mean providing more attention and resources to students who have fewer native assets, such as intelligence, in order to help them achieve similar opportunities for success as those who are naturally more advantaged. Therefore, Rawls would likely support option A: more attention and resources than those with more native assets. However, it's important to note that Rawls' theory doesn't specifically address intelligence or native assets but rather focuses on correcting for disadvantages that are not the result of personal choice or effort."
