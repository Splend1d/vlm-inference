They were also the first hominids to make and use stone tools, which were more advanced than those made by their predecessors. Additionally, Homo erectus was the first hominid to have a consistently upright posture, as indicated by its name \"erectus,\" which means upright in Latin. However, it's important to note that earlier hominids like Australopithecus also walked upright, but not as efficiently as Homo erectus."
