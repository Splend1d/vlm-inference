Therefore,\n\n\\[25 - x^2 \\geq 0\\]\n\nSolving this inequality:\n\n\\[x^2 \\leq 25\\]\n\n\\[-5 \\leq x \\leq 5\\]\n\nSo, the first square root is defined for \\(x\\) in the interval \\([-5, 5]\\).\n\n### Second Square Root: \\(\\sqrt{-(x-2)}\\)\n\nThis square root is defined when its argument, \\(-(x-2)\\), is non-negative. Therefore,\n\n\\[-(x-2) \\geq 0\\]\n\nSolving this inequality:\n\n\\[x-2 \\leq 0\\]\n\n\\[x \\leq 2\\]\n\nSo, the second square root is defined for \\(x\\) in the interval \\((-\\infty, 2]\\).\n\n### Intersection of Domains\n\nThe domain of the entire function \\(h(x)\\) will be the intersection of the domains of the two individual square roots. This means that \\(x\\) must satisfy both conditions simultaneously. Therefore, \\(x\\) must be in the interval \\([-5, 2]\\).\n\n### Width of the Interval\n\nThe width of the interval \\([-5, 2]\\) is given by the difference between the upper limit and the lower limit:\n\n\\[Width = 2 - (-5) = 7\\]\n\nTherefore, the width of the domain of \\(h(x)\\) is 7.\n\n### Answer\n\nThe correct answer is **A. 7**."
