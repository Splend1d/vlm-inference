The parties negotiated a written distribution agreement, which stated that any order for windows placed by the retailer would be binding on the distributor \"only when expressly accepted by the distributor.\" For the next two years, the retailer forwarded orders to the distributor, and the distributor always filled the orders. In the third year, the distributor accused the retailer of overcharging customers to install the distributor's windows. The retailer responded that the distributor had no control over the retailer's installation prices. When the distributor received the retailer's next order for windows, it refused to fill the order. If the retailer sues the distributor for breach of contract, will it be likely to prevail?\n\nA. No, because the retailer's forwarding of orders to the distributor did not give rise to an obligation on the distributor's part to fill the orders.\nB. No, because the retailer's practice of overcharging customers excused the distributor's refusal to fill the order.\nC. Yes, because the distributor's claim regarding overcharging customers is independent of its obligation to fill the retailer's order.\nD. Yes, because the parties' course of dealing binds the distributor to fill the retailer's order.\n"

Yes, because the parties' course of dealing binds the distributor to fill the retailer's order.\n\nThe Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) provides that when parties have a prior course of dealing, this can create obligations even if the written contract does not explicitly state them. In this case, despite the written agreement stating that orders would only be binding upon acceptance by the distributor, the distributor consistently filled the retailer's orders for two years without expressly accepting each one. This established a pattern or course of dealing between the parties that could be interpreted as creating an implied obligation on the distributor's part to continue filling orders unless there was a valid reason not to do so. Therefore, the retailer is likely to prevail in their lawsuit against the distributor for breach of contract based on the course of dealing between the parties. However, the outcome could also depend on whether the court finds the distributor's accusation of overcharging to be a valid reason for refusing the order, which might involve assessing the validity of the distributor's claim and whether it breaches any other contractual terms or legal obligations."
