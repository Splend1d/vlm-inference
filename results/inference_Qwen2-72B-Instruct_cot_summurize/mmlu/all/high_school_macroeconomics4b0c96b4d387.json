Real GDP will remain unchanged.\n\nWhen the government increases spending, it can lead to an increase in aggregate demand and potentially boost economic output (real GDP). However, when taxes are raised by the same amount, this reduces disposable income for households and businesses, which can dampen consumption and investment, thereby reducing aggregate demand.\n\nIn this case, the increased government spending is exactly offset by the reduction in private sector spending due to higher taxes. The net effect on aggregate demand and thus real GDP is zero, assuming no other changes in the economy.\n\nThis scenario is often discussed in macroeconomics as part of the concept of fiscal policy neutrality, where the effects of increased government spending and increased taxation cancel each other out. In reality, the actual impact might be more complex due to factors like the multiplier effect or changes in government spending efficiency, but based on the information given, the answer is that real GDP remains unchanged."
