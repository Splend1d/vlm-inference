The label states that a \"patch test\" is necessary because a small percentage of the population may be allergic to the chemicals contained in the product and susceptible to suffering scalp irritation. A Russian immigrant recently moved to the United States from Moscow. The immigrant cannot read or speak English. One day, the immigrant purchased a bottle of the shampoo from a drug store. She looked at the label warning but did not understand it. After throwing away the box cover, she used the shampoo without making a \"patch test. \" Minutes later, she began experiencing an allergic reaction and scalp irritation.

However, among the options provided:\n\nA. Winning simply because she suffered an injury does not necessarily mean she will win a case. The injury must be due to the company's negligence or failure to warn adequately.\n\nB. Awareness of potential harm does not automatically result in liability. The company must also have taken reasonable steps to warn users about the risks involved.\n\nC. Losing because she didn't read or speak English is not a valid reason under consumer protection laws. Companies are expected to ensure their warnings are understandable to a broad range of consumers, which might include providing multilingual labels or clear pictograms.\n\nD. Losing because she assumed the risk by not making the \"patch test\" could be a viable defense for the company if the warning was clear and conspicuous, and if the court determines that the consumer had a reasonable opportunity to understand the warning and chose not to follow it.\n\nGiven the scenario described, option D seems the most likely outcome based on the information provided. However, it is important to note that courts consider many factors when determining liability, and the specifics of this case (such as the clarity of the warning and the feasibility of understanding it given language barriers) would be crucial in deciding the outcome. In some jurisdictions, the company might be held liable if they failed to provide adequate warnings in languages other than English, considering the significant non-English speaking population in the United States."
