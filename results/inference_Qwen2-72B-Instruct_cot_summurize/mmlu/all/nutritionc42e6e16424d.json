Total urinary nitrogen excretion alone.\n\nProtein oxidation, or the breakdown of proteins, results in the release of amino acids, which are then deaminated, producing urea and other nitrogenous waste products that are excreted in the urine. By measuring the total urinary nitrogen excretion, one can estimate the amount of protein that has been oxidized in the body. This is based on the fact that about 16% of protein's weight is nitrogen. Therefore, by knowing the amount of nitrogen excreted, you can calculate the amount of protein that was broken down.\n\nOptions A and B (O2 consumption and CO2 production) are related to metabolic rate and can give information about overall energy expenditure and substrate utilization but do not specifically indicate protein oxidation. Option C (breath collection) could be used for measuring CO2 production, which, while informative about metabolism, does not directly measure protein oxidation."
