The end of the Cold War created the space for security policy and security studies to be re-considered in light of growing environmental consciousness underlined by multilateralism in policy action.\nB. In 1973 the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) restricted oil supplies which underlined the industrial capacity of the military leaving a profound psychological impact requiring that security be linked to national interests: the securing of energy deals and the environment became related to military capability diplomacy.\nC. Ideologically driven military security was replaced by a need to preserve territorial integrity in wake of the collapse of communism. Military security was a high priority given the threat of spill-over. The environment remained a peripheral concern to the security institutions occupied with the new security environment post-Cold War.\nD. The end of the Cold War order created the intellectual space for the broadening of security issues beyond Cold War military mentalities. Research among political and environmental scientists discussed ways in which new security issues could be addressed. The plethora of publications produced, however, had little effect on policy.\n"

The end of the Cold War indeed created a space for reconsideration of security policies and studies. With the reduction in ideological conflict, there was more room to focus on non-traditional security threats such as environmental degradation. This period saw an increase in multilateral efforts to address global environmental concerns, such as climate change, deforestation, and biodiversity loss.\n\nB. The 1973 oil crisis highlighted the vulnerability of industrialized nations to disruptions in energy supply, leading to a greater understanding of how environmental factors can affect national security. This event underscored the importance of securing energy resources and managing environmental impacts as part of a nation's security strategy.\n\nC. After the collapse of communism, the focus shifted from ideologically driven military security to preserving territorial integrity. While military security remained a priority, environmental concerns were often sidelined in the immediate aftermath. However, over time, the connection between environmental health and national security became clearer, especially in terms of resource scarcity and its potential to fuel conflicts.\n\nD. The end of the Cold War also allowed for a broader discussion of security issues that went beyond traditional military concerns. Academics and researchers began exploring the links between environmental degradation and security, producing a wealth of literature on the topic. Although these discussions were rich and informative, translating them into effective policy has been a challenge due to various political, economic, and bureaucratic barriers.\n\nOverall, strategic circumstances have significantly influenced how environmental security is perceived and addressed. The changing geopolitical landscape has led to a gradual recognition of environmental issues as critical components of national and international security strategies."
