Late for a business appointment, a businesswoman was driving north on a highway when she decided to pass the car in front of her. As she swung across the center line into the southbound lane, her vehicle collided with a fire engine. As a result of the accident, the fire engine was delayed in reaching an owner's house, which was entirely destroyed by fire. The owner's home was located approximately one mile from the accident scene. If the owner asserts a claim against thebusinesswoman, he will most likely\n\nA. recover the fair market value of his house before the fire.\nB. recover that part of his loss that would have been prevented if the businesswoman had not hit the fire truck.\nC. recover nothing, because the businesswoman was not responsible for causing the fire.\nD. recover nothing, because the traffic statute was not designed to protect against the type of harm that the owner suffered.\n"

If the fire engine had not been delayed by the collision, it might have arrived at the owner's house in time to prevent some or all of the damage caused by the fire. Therefore, the owner may be able to recover damages for that portion of his loss that could have been prevented if the businesswoman had not hit the fire truck. However, the exact amount of damages that the owner can recover will depend on various factors, such as the extent of the delay caused by the collision and whether the fire department could have responded more quickly under different circumstances."
