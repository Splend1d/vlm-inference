Chance of a type II error\n\nReducing the sample size from 1000 to 500 patients will decrease the power of the study (the ability to detect a true effect when it exists). This means that the chance of a type II error (failing to reject a false null hypothesis) increases. With a smaller sample size, the study may not have enough statistical power to detect a significant difference between the new drug and standard treatment even if there is one.\n\nA. Chance of a type I error remains unchanged because the alpha value (significance level) has not changed.\nC. Power of the study decreases with a smaller sample size.\nD. Sensitivity of the study is related to the ability to correctly identify those with the condition; it does not directly relate to the statistical power or type I/II errors in this context. However, a reduction in sample size could indirectly affect sensitivity by reducing the study's power to detect a true effect."
