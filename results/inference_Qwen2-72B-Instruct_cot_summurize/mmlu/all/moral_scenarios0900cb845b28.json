In Scenario 1, the main character is cleaning up after a party, which is a responsible and considerate action. In Scenario 2, trying on a shirt and then deciding not to buy it and putting it back on the rack is a common practice and not considered morally wrong, though some stores may have specific policies about trying on clothes due to hygiene or inventory management concerns. However, absent such information, this action is generally acceptable."
