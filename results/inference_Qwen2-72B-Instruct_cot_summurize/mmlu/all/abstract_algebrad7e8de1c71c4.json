The direct product of two groups \\(G\\) and \\(H\\), denoted by \\(G \\times H\\), consists of all ordered pairs \\((g, h)\\) where \\(g \\in G\\) and \\(h \\in H\\). Each element in \\(G\\) can be paired with every element in \\(H\\), so the total number of elements in \\(G \\times H\\) is indeed the product of the sizes of \\(G\\) and \\(H\\). Thus, this statement is correct.\n\n**Statement 2:** If \\(r\\) divides \\(m\\) and \\(s\\) divides \\(n\\), then \\(\\mathbb{Z}_m \\times \\mathbb{Z}_n\\) has a subgroup isomorphic to \\(\\mathbb{Z}_r \\times \\mathbb{Z}_s\\).\n\nThis statement is also true. Consider the subgroups generated by \\(\\langle [r]_m \\rangle\\) and \\(\\langle [s]_n \\rangle\\) in \\(\\mathbb{Z}_m\\) and \\(\\mathbb{Z}_n\\), respectively. These are cyclic subgroups of order \\(\\frac{m}{r}\\) and \\(\\frac{n}{s}\\), respectively. Since \\(r\\) divides \\(m\\) and \\(s\\) divides \\(n\\), these subgroups exist. The direct product of these subgroups forms a subgroup of \\(\\mathbb{Z}_m \\times \\mathbb{Z}_n\\) that is isomorphic to \\(\\mathbb{Z}_r \\times \\mathbb{Z}_s\\), as each component group corresponds directly to the quotient groups \\(\\mathbb{Z}_m / \\langle [r]_m \\rangle \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_r\\) and \\(\\mathbb{Z}_n / \\langle [s]_n \\rangle \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_s\\).\n\nThus, the answer is **A. True, True**."
