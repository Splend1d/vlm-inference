Research focused on the problems of poor farmers and consumers is a 'public good' with little profit potential but high social benefits; public investment is needed to support it.\n\nAgricultural research can help reduce hunger and poverty by developing new technologies, practices, and crop varieties that increase productivity, improve food security, and enhance the incomes of smallholder farmers. This type of research often targets the specific needs of poor farmers and consumers, addressing issues such as pest management, soil fertility, water conservation, and climate resilience. Since these innovations may not be profitable for private companies to develop, public investment is crucial to fund this research and ensure that its benefits reach those who need them most."
