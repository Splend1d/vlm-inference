Perception.\n\nPerception is not considered a step in the consumer proposition acquisition process, although it does play a role in how consumers interpret and respond to marketing efforts. The typical steps in the acquisition process are motive development, information gathering, and proposition evaluation. However, it's important to note that perception influences these steps as consumers perceive and interpret the motives, information, and propositions based on their individual perspectives and experiences."
