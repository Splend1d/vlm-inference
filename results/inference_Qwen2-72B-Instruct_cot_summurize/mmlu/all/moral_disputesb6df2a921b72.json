However, he does not specifically list \"freedom of speech\" as one of his main concerns in the context of liberal egalitarianism. Therefore, the answer would be:\n\nC. freedom of speech\n\nIt's important to note that freedom of speech is often considered a fundamental value in liberal theory, but it may not be explicitly highlighted by Carens as a primary concern within the specific framework of liberal egalitarianism he advocates."
