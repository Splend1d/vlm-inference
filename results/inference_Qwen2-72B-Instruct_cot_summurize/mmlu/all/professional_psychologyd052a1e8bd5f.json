However, it's important to note that this can work in both directions. Sometimes people change their beliefs to match their actions (post-decision dissonance), and other times they might change their actions to align with their beliefs. But the classic explanation is that if there is a discrepancy between what one believes and what one does, cognitive dissonance may lead one to adjust beliefs to reduce the psychological discomfort caused by the inconsistency."
