The formula for the margin of error (which determines half the width of the interval) is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Margin of Error} = z^* \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{p}(1-\\hat{p})}{n}} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\(z^*\\) is the critical value from the standard normal distribution for the chosen confidence level,\n- \\(\\hat{p}\\) is the sample proportion,\n- \\(n\\) is the sample size.\n\nAs we increase the confidence level from 90% to 99%, the z-score increases. For a 90% confidence level, the z-score is approximately 1.645, while for a 99% confidence level, it's approximately 2.576.\n\nLet's compare these two z-scores to understand how the interval size changes:\n\n- Original margin of error at 90% confidence: \\(1.645 \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{p}(1-\\hat{p})}{n}}\\)\n- New margin of error at 99% confidence: \\(2.576 \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{p}(1-\\hat{p})}{n}}\\)\n\nTo find the percentage increase in the margin of error (and thus the interval size), we calculate:\n\n\\[ \\frac{2.576 - 1.645}{1.645} \\times 100\\% = 56.6\\% \\]\n\nThis means that increasing the confidence level from 90% to 99% increases the interval size by approximately 57%.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\nC. increases the interval size by 57%."
