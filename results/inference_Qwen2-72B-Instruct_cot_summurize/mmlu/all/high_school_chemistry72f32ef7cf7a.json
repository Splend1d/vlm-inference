The point at which the attractive and repulsive forces between the two atoms are equal.\n\nThis is because in a covalent bond, the atoms come close enough for their valence (outermost) electrons to be attracted to the nucleus of the other atom. As the atoms approach each other, the attractive force between the nuclei and the shared electrons increases, but so does the repulsive force between the nuclei themselves and between the electrons. At a certain distance, these forces balance out, resulting in the minimum potential energy state for the system. This is the equilibrium bond length where the molecule is most stable."
