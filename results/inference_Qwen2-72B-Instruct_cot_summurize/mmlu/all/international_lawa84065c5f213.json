Therefore, both options B and C are correct, but if you have to choose one that best encapsulates the primary purpose, option B is more accurate because it highlights the preventive aspect of universal jurisdiction by deterring the commission of grave crimes. However, it's important to note that option C also correctly describes a mechanism through which this deterrence is achieved. Option A is also partially correct as it describes what universal jurisdiction does, but it doesn't fully capture the purpose behind it. Option D is too broad, as universal jurisdiction does not extend to all international crimes but is limited to specific grave offenses."
