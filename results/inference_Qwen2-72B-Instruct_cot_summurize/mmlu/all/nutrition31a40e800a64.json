Eating a very low carbohydrate diet\nB. Consuming a diet high in monounsaturated fats\nC. Losing 5-7% of body weight through a hypocaloric low fat diet and 30 minutes of daily activity\nD.

Losing 5-7% of body weight through a hypocaloric low-fat diet and 30 minutes of daily activity\n\nThis recommendation is based on evidence from large-scale studies such as the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) and the Finnish Diabetes Prevention Study (DPS), which showed that lifestyle modifications including modest weight loss and regular physical activity can significantly reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes in people at high risk.\n\nWhile other options may also have benefits for diabetes prevention or management, option C is the one that has been most consistently shown to be effective across multiple trials. Options A and B might be beneficial for some individuals, but they were not the primary interventions tested in the major diabetes prevention trials. Option D includes metformin, which was found to be less effective than lifestyle changes in the DPP study."
