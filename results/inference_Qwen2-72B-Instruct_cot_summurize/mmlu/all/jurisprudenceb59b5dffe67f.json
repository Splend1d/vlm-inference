That human reason can help us to determine what constitutes a worthwhile life.\n\nJohn Finnis, a prominent legal and moral philosopher, rejects Hume's conception of practical reason primarily on the grounds that human reason can indeed play a role in determining what constitutes a worthwhile or good life. Hume argued that reason alone cannot motivate action or determine what we ought to do; rather, our actions are driven by passions and desires. In contrast, Finnis believes that practical reason can guide us toward understanding fundamental goods and how to achieve them, which is central to his theory of natural law."
