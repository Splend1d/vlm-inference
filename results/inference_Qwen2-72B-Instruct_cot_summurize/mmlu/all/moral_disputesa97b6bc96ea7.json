He believed that ecological health and ethical considerations should inform decisions about land use, not just economic gain.\n\nWhile Leopold might agree with aspects of B (\"We should think in terms of 'the balance of nature' to properly appreciate the value of the natural environment\"), his views were more nuanced than a simple invocation of \"balance.\" He recognized that ecosystems are dynamic and complex, and that human intervention can sometimes be beneficial if it serves the long-term health of the community of life.\n\nLeopold would likely disagree with A because he saw environmental ethics as extending beyond human-to-human relations to include human responsibilities to the non-human world. He also would not accept D, as he did not advocate ignoring economic motives entirely but rather argued that they should not be the sole or primary consideration in land use decisions. Economic considerations should be balanced with ecological and ethical ones."
