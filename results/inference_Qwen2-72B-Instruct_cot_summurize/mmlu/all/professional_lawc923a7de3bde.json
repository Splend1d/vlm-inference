For 15 years, a commercial fisherman had kept a daily log of the water level at his dock on the riverbank opposite the land in order to forecast fishing conditions. The plaintiff hired a draftsman to graph the data from the fisherman's logs for use as a trial exhibit. At trial, the fisherman testified to the care with which he had made the measurements and recorded them in his logs, which had been made available for the defendant's inspection. The draftsman then testified to the manner in which he had prepared the graphs. With this foundation, are the graphs admissible?\n\nA. No, because they are hearsay not within any exception.\nB. No, because they violate the \"best evidence\" rule.\nC. Yes, as summaries of voluminous business records.\nD. Yes, as the draftsman's expert opinion of the water levels.\n"

The fact that the fisherman testified to the care with which he made the measurements and recorded them in his logs, and that the logs were made available for the defendant's inspection, establishes the necessary foundation for the admission of the graphs under the business records exception to the hearsay rule. The fact that the draftsman testified to the manner in which he prepared the graphs also supports their admissibility. Therefore, the answer is C.\n\nIt is worth noting that the \"best evidence\" rule does not apply in this case because the original records (the fisherman's logs) were made available for inspection and the graphs are not being offered to prove the truth of the matters asserted in the logs, but rather as a visual representation of the data contained in the logs. Additionally, the graphs are not being offered as the draftsman's expert opinion, but rather as a summary of the data recorded by the fisherman."
