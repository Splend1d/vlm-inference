Research has shown that cardiovascular health in midlife is associated with a lower risk of cognitive decline and dementia later in life. This includes factors such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and smoking, which can all contribute to damage in the blood vessels that supply the brain with oxygen and nutrients. However, it's worth noting that loss of muscle strength and immune system decline may also have some association with cognitive decline, but they are not as strongly linked as cardiovascular problems. Graying of hair is not related to cognitive decline."
