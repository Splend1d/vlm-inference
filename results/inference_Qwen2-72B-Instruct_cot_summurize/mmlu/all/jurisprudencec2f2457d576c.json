They differ in respect of their account of life before the social contract.\n\nThis statement is closest to characterizing the principal difference between the positions adopted by Thomas Hobbes and John Locke. Hobbes believed that life in the state of nature, before the social contract, was \"solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short,\" necessitating a strong, centralized authority to maintain order. Locke, on the other hand, saw the state of nature as a condition of relative equality and freedom where natural rights to life, liberty, and property existed, and the social contract was formed to better protect these rights rather than to escape a miserable existence."
