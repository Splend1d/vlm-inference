This leads to accumulation of mutations in short, repetitive sequences of DNA known as microsatellites. MSI is most commonly associated with hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer (HNPCC), also known as Lynch syndrome, which is characterized by an increased risk of colorectal and other cancers.\n\nWhile familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is another inherited condition that predisposes individuals to colorectal cancer, it is typically not associated with MSI but rather with mutations in the APC gene. Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2) and neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) are also genetic disorders, but they do not have the characteristic microsatellite instability seen in HNPCC."
