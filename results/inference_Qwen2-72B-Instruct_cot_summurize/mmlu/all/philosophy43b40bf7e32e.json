According to the Ideal Moral Code theory, one is obligated to do what the ideal moral rules would require in a world in which everyone complied with those rules perfectly. This theory posits that there exists a set of moral principles or rules that would be agreed upon by all rational beings if they were to engage in a hypothetical contract or agreement under ideal conditions of full information and impartiality. These ideal moral rules would apply universally and consistently to all individuals, regardless of their personal preferences or circumstances. The theory suggests that we should strive to act in accordance with these ideal rules, even if others around us do not comply with them, as doing so would promote the greatest good for the greatest number of people in the long run. However, it is important to note that this theory is often criticized for being too abstract and idealized, and for failing to take into account the complexities and contingencies of real-world situations."
