Cardiovascular disease: Excess weight can lead to high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and increased strain on the heart, all of which increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases such as coronary artery disease, stroke, and heart failure.\n\nB. Breast cancer: Obesity has been linked to an increased risk of several types of cancer, including breast cancer. This is thought to be due in part to the fact that excess body fat can lead to higher levels of estrogen, which can promote the growth of certain breast cancers.\n\nC. Type 2 diabetes (maturity onset): Obesity is a major risk factor for developing type 2 diabetes. When a person is overweight or obese, their body may become resistant to insulin, a hormone that regulates blood sugar. This can lead to chronically high blood sugar levels, which characterizes diabetes.\n\nThese conditions can significantly impact quality of life and lifespan, making it important to address issues of overnutrition through healthy eating habits and regular physical activity."
