According to Allen's (2001) study, the role of the nurse was ambiguous and had to be constantly redefined in the context of everyday interactions with other staff and patients. This finding highlights the dynamic and complex nature of nursing work, which involves negotiating roles and responsibilities within the healthcare team and responding to the needs of patients. While the other options may also have some basis in reality or in other studies, they do not accurately reflect the findings of Allen's (2001) research."
