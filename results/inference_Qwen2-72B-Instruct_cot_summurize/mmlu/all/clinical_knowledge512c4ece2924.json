Certain medications can increase the risk of developing gout by raising uric acid levels, including diuretics, low-dose aspirin, and some immunosuppressants.\n\nB. A history of diarrhoea is not relevant\n\nThis statement is false. Diarrhea can be relevant to a musculoskeletal history as it could indicate an inflammatory condition like inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which can have extraintestinal manifestations including arthritis or arthralgia.\n\nC. Difficulty rising from a chair is diagnostic of polymyalgic rheumatica\n\nThis statement is false. Difficulty rising from a chair is a symptom that could be associated with several conditions, including but not limited to polymyalgia rheumatica, osteoarthritis, and muscle weakness due to various causes. It is not diagnostic on its own.\n\nD. Joint stiffness of 5 minutes duration suggests an arthropathy\n\nThis statement is misleading. While joint stiffness can be a symptom of arthropathy (any disease affecting joints), the duration alone does not suggest a specific diagnosis. Stiffness lasting less than one hour in the morning is more commonly associated with osteoarthritis, whereas longer durations of stiffness (over one hour) are more characteristic of inflammatory arthropathies like rheumatoid arthritis. However, the exact duration does not definitively diagnose an arthropathy without considering other symptoms, signs, and diagnostic tests."
