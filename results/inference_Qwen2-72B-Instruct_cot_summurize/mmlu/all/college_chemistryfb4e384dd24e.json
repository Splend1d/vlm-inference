Analyte molecules are converted to gaseous ions - This is true as mass spectrometry involves ionizing the sample to convert molecules into charged particles (ions).\n\nII. The ions are separated according to their mass-to-charge ratio - This is also true. After ionization, the ions are separated based on their mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) using magnetic or electric fields.\n\nIII. In addition to compound identification, mass spectra can be utilized to determine precise isotopic masses and isotopic ratios - This statement is correct as well. Mass spectrometry can be used for compound identification by comparing the mass spectrum of an unknown compound to known compounds. It can also be used to determine isotopic masses and isotopic ratios, which can provide information about the elemental composition of a molecule."
