Over time, as they are exposed to the specific sounds of their community's language, they begin to specialize in those sounds and lose the ability to easily produce or distinguish sounds not present in their native language. However, initially, their babbling reflects a universal set of phonemes rather than being specifically shaped by the phonetic structure of the language they will eventually learn. Therefore, option D is not entirely accurate in the context of very early babbling, although it becomes more relevant as children approach the age of one year and start to refine their phonetic repertoire. Option B is incorrect because initial babbling patterns are similar across cultures before the influence of the specific language environment begins to shape them. Option C is partially correct but oversimplified, as while babbling patterns do show some universality initially, they do not remain completely identical across all language communities as children develop and start to incorporate the phonetic features of their native language into their babbling."
