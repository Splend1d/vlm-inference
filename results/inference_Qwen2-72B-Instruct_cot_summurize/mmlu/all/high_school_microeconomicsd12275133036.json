An increase in the price of capital raises the firm's average fixed cost (AFC) because capital is considered a fixed input in the short run. However, since the quantity of capital does not change in response to output changes in the short run, the MC curve does not shift.\n\nThe average fixed cost (AFC) curve will indeed shift upward because the total fixed cost has increased, but this does not directly affect the AVC curve, which is determined by the costs of variable inputs like labor. However, since average total cost (ATC) is the sum of average fixed cost (AFC) and average variable cost (AVC), an increase in AFC will also cause the ATC curve to shift upward.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\nB. The average fixed cost and average total cost curves will shift upward."
