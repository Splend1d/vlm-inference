In a parallel circuit (B and D), the total resistance is less than the smallest individual resistance, which results in a higher current for the same voltage.\n\nFor a given voltage, the current will be greater when the total resistance is lower. Since a parallel arrangement of resistors has a lower total resistance compared to a series arrangement, it will allow more current to flow for the same voltage. Additionally, a high voltage battery (B) will result in even greater current compared to a low voltage battery (D).\n\nTherefore, option B, a high voltage battery with resistors arranged in parallel, will create a circuit with the greatest current."
