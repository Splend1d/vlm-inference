Nor were there just three such stars; four wanderers complete their revolutions about Jupiter, and of their alterations as observed more precisely later on we shall give a description here. Also I measured the distances between them by means of the telescope. . . .\nSuch are the observations concerning the four Medicean planets recently first discovered by me, and although from this data their periods have not yet been reconstructed in numerical form, it is legitimate at least to put in evidence some facts worthy of note. Above all, since they sometimes follow and sometimes precede Jupiter by the same intervals, and they remain within very limited distances either to east or west of Jupiter, accompanying that planet in both its retrograde and direct movements in a constant manner, no one can doubt that they complete their revolutions about Jupiter and at the same time effect all together a twelve-year period about the center of the universe.\n\u2014Galileo Galilei, 1610\nWhich of the following Polish thinkers was most likely the person whose ideas convinced Galileo to have written the statement above?\n\nA. Nicolaus Copernicus\nB. Johannes Kepler\nC. Galileo Galilei\nD. Josef Pilsudski\n"

Copernicus suggested that the Earth and other planets revolve around the Sun, rather than everything revolving around the Earth as was commonly believed at the time. Galileo's discovery of the moons orbiting Jupiter provided further evidence for the Copernican system, as it demonstrated that not everything in the sky revolves directly around the Earth.\n\nTherefore, the Polish thinker who most likely influenced Galileo's thinking, leading him to write the statement above, is:\n\nA.
