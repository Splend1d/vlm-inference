                    "text": "Price discrimination occurs when a seller charges different prices to different customers for the same product or service, based on characteristics that do not reflect differences in cost. The key to price discrimination is that the price difference is not due to any cost difference on the part of the seller.\n\nLet's analyze each situation:\n\nA. Brent works nights, so he chooses to buy bread at 7 a.m. rather than at 7 p.m.\nThis situation is not necessarily price discrimination unless the store charges different prices for the bread depending on the time of day it is purchased. If the price is the same regardless of when Brent buys the bread, this is not an example of price discrimination.\n\nB. Bob and Nancy each receive a \"$1 off\" coupon in the mail, but Bob redeems it while Nancy does not.\nThis situation is not price discrimination because both Bob and Nancy had the opportunity to redeem the coupon. The difference in price paid is not due to any action by the seller, but rather the customer's choice to redeem the coupon.\n\nC. Katie buys 12 Cokes for $3, and Josh buys one Coke at a time for $1.\nThis is an example of price discrimination known as quantity discounting. Katie is charged less per unit (25 cents) than Josh ($1), even though the cost of production for each Coke is likely the same. This is a common form of price discrimination where bulk purchases are rewarded with lower per-unit prices.\n\nD. Velma likes to go to the movies at the lower afternoon matinee price, and Rosemary would rather pay more for the evening show.\nThis is also an example of price discrimination, known as time-based pricing. The movie theater charges different prices for the same movie based on the time of day it is shown, even though the cost of showing the movie is likely the same.\n\nOf the four options provided, the only situation that is not necessarily an example of price discrimination is option B: Bob and Nancy each receive a \"$1 off\" coupon in the mail, but Bob redeems it while Nancy does not. Since both individuals had the opportunity to redeem the coupon, the difference in price paid is not due to any action by the seller, but rather the customer's choice to use the coupon."
