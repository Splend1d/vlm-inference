While this is one of the reasons that marriage rates may appear to be in decline, it's important to note that the other options listed may also play a role in the overall trend. For example, the proportion of people living alone could impact marriage rates, as could the number of remarriages. However, the most significant factor in the decline of marriage appears to be the rise of cohabitation as an alternative to marriage for many couples. So the closest answer would actually be D. all of the above, acknowledging that each factor can contribute to the perceived decline in marriage rates."
