However, certain life experiences and changes can lead to some modifications in traits. For example, people may become more conscientious or agreeable as they age. It's important to note that these changes can vary greatly from person to person. The answer \"Only for women\" is incorrect as personality changes can occur in both men and women. The answer \"They change quite a lot\" might be an overstatement for most individuals, although significant life events can cause more substantial shifts in personality."
