(Before Present, with \"Present\" typically referring to 1950 AD) suggests early evidence of complexity in Mayan societies. Both of these developments indicate advancements in artistic skills, engineering capabilities, and possibly social stratification.\n\nHowever, if we have to choose one answer that best represents early evidence of complexity, the decorated stepped platforms (Option B) might be more indicative of societal complexity as they suggest organized community efforts, hierarchical structures, and possibly religious or ceremonial significance. These platforms often served as bases for temples or other important buildings and were central to the urban planning of Mayan cities.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the ritual ball game (Option D) was indeed a significant part of Mayan culture, but its association with human sacrifice is not universally agreed upon by scholars, and it did not necessarily begin around 2650 B.P. The introduction of chocolate into the Mesoamerican economy (Option C) was also an important development, but it does not directly suggest complexity in the same way that architectural and artistic achievements do.\n\nTherefore, the most likely answer based on the options provided would be:\n\nB. decorated stepped platforms."
