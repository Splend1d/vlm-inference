High fatigue resistance\n\nType IIb muscle fibers, also known as fast-twitch glycolytic fibers, have low oxidative capacity, high motor unit strength, and fast contractile speed but they have low fatigue resistance. They are designed for quick, powerful movements and fatigue quickly due to their reliance on anaerobic metabolism."
