It is the preferred ratio between work-related and non-work-related activities. In recent years, this has become a hotly contested issue due to the intensification of work and technological shifts, which have blurred the boundaries between work and personal life. Many employees are seeking greater flexibility and autonomy in managing their work schedules to achieve a better balance between their professional and personal responsibilities."
