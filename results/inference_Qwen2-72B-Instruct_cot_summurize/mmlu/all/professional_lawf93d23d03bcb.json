During the prosecution's case-in-chief, a police officer testifies that he watched another officer seize a bag of white powder from the defendant and seal it in an envelope, which both officers initialed and dated and then placed in the police property room. The prosecutor then calls a chemist to testify that she obtained, intact from the property room, the dated, sealed envelope with the initials of both police officers, whose handwriting she recognized police officers, whose handwriting she recognized from previous experience, and that testing disclosed that the powder therein was heroin. The defendant argues that the prosecutor has not sufficiently authenticated the powder tested by the chemist as the powder that was seized from the defendant. Is the chemist's testimony admissible?\n\nA. No, because the chemist lacks firsthand knowledge that the powder came from the defendant.\nB. No, unless the envelope and powder are produced in court or their absence is explained.\nC. Yes, because an object in official custody is self-authenticating.\nD. Yes, because the powder is sufficiently identified as having come from the defendant.\n"

Yes, because the powder is sufficiently identified as having come from the defendant.\n\nThe chemist's testimony is admissible because there is a sufficient chain of custody established through the testimony of the police officer who observed the seizure and sealing of the evidence, and the chemist who retrieved the sealed envelope from the property room and recognized the officers' handwriting on it. This chain of custody provides adequate assurance that the powder tested was indeed the same powder seized from the defendant. While the chemist does not have firsthand knowledge that the powder came from the defendant, the evidence presented establishes a reasonable likelihood that the integrity of the evidence was maintained throughout its handling and testing."
