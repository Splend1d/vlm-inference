True, True\n\nExplanation:\nStatement 1 is true because when you have a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and you don't know the true number of hidden states, increasing the number of hidden states will indeed allow the model to fit the training data better, thus increasing the likelihood. However, this doesn't necessarily mean that the model will generalize well to unseen data, as it might overfit the training data.\n\nStatement 2 is also true. Collaborative filtering is a popular technique used in recommendation systems, including those for movies. It works by predicting the interest of a user in an item based on preferences given by many users. The underlying assumption is that if two users agree in one issue, they are likely to agree again in the future. This makes it a very effective method for recommending movies to users based on their previous preferences and the preferences of similar users."
