It forms a stable radical that can be reduced back to active vitamin E by reaction with vitamin C\n\nVitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) acts as an antioxidant by donating an electron to quench free radicals, which prevents the propagation of free radical chain reactions that can damage cell membranes and other structures. In doing so, vitamin E becomes oxidized and forms a tocopheroxyl radical, which is relatively stable. This radical can then be reduced back to its original form (active vitamin E) through a redox cycle involving vitamin C or other reducing agents. Vitamin C donates an electron to the tocopheroxyl radical, converting it back to vitamin E while vitamin C itself becomes oxidized. The oxidized form of vitamin C (dehydroascorbic acid) can then be reduced back to its active form by cellular reductants such as NADPH and the enzyme glutathione reductase.\n\nWhile vitamin E's lipid solubility allows it to interact with free radicals within cell membranes, option C does not fully capture the mechanism by which vitamin E regains its antioxidant activity after being oxidized. Option D mentions glutathione and glutathione peroxidase, which are involved in cellular redox homeostasis but are not directly involved in the regeneration of vitamin E from its oxidized form."
