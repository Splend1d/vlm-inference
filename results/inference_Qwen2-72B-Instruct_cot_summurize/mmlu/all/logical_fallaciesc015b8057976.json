False dilemma\n\nThe black-or-white fallacy, also known as the false dilemma or false dichotomy, is a logical fallacy that occurs when an argument presents two opposing options as the only possibilities, when in fact more exist. This fallacy oversimplifies complex issues by presenting them as having only two possible outcomes or solutions, often forcing a choice between extremes."
