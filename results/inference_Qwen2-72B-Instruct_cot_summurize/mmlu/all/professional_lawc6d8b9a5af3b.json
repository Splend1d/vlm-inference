The youth thereafter entered into a written contract with the dealership, which provided that the youth would make monthly payments of $1,000 for three years. During the first year of the contract, the youth made 12 monthly payments totaling $12,000. However, the youth failed to make any payments during the second year of the contract. The dealership repeatedly threatened to sue the youth for the remaining balance that it claimed was due under the contract. Finally, in order to avoid litigation, the youth sent the dealership the following letter:\"The car I purchased from you is a real lemon. I have spent a considerable sum of money during the last two years in repair work. I don't believe that the car is worth $36,000, but I am willing to pay you $10,000 if I find ajob in the next month. \"The youth had just turned 18 when he sent this letter to the dealership. The day after mailing this letter, the youth was involved in an automobile accident, and the sports car was totally demolished. Following the accident, the youth remained unemployed, and he refused to make any payments to the dealership. At the time of the accident, the sports car was worth $18,000. In this jurisdiction, the age of majority is18 years of age. If the dealership brings suit against the youth for breach of contract, what, if any, is the plaintiff's proper recovery?\n\nA. Nothing.\nB. $10,000. 00\nC. $18,000. 00\nD. $24,000. 00\n"

                    "text": "The proper recovery for the dealership would be C. $18,000. Here's why:\n\nFirstly, the youth has already paid $12,000 over the first year. The total amount due under the contract is $36,000. This leaves a balance of $24,000.\n\nHowever, the youth's offer to pay only $10,000 is not relevant because it was not accepted by the dealership, and thus did not form a new contract. The original contract remains in effect.\n\nSecondly, since the car was totaled in an accident, its value at the time of the accident becomes relevant. The car was worth $18,000 at the time of the accident. Under the law of restitution, the dealership is entitled to recover the value of the car at the time of the accident, minus any amounts already paid by the youth.\n\nSince the youth has already paid $12,000, the dealership is entitled to recover the difference between the value of the car at the time of the accident ($18,000) and the amount already paid ($12,000), which is $6,000. However, since the total amount due under the contract is $24,000, and the dealership can only recover up to the value of the car at the time of the accident, the maximum recovery is $18,000.\n\nTherefore, the proper recovery for the dealership is $18,000. Option C is correct."
