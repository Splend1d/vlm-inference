The percentages given would need to be applied to the total population numbers provided in the options to find out how many people that would actually represent. However, for educational purposes, it's known that during the height of ancient Egypt, the population was estimated to be around 3 million, and the majority of the population (around 90%) were farmers. Therefore, if we had to guess based on historical knowledge, option C might be the closest, but this is not an exact science without more specific information. \n\nC. 3,000,000; 75% \n\nBut please note, this is an educated guess and may not be accurate depending on the time period or specific context the question is referring to."
