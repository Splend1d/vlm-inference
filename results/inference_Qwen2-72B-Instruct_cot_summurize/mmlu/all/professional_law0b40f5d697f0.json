Crops and timber to be severed from the property next summer.\n\nThe UCC primarily governs transactions in goods, which includes crops and timber that will be severed from the land and sold. This contrasts with real estate transactions (option C), service contracts, or contracts for the sale of intangible assets (option D), which are generally governed by other areas of law. While option A involves goods, the focus is on the service of delivery rather than the sale of goods, so it is less likely to be classified under the UCC."
