This type of drainage is composed primarily of plasma, which is the liquid component of blood that remains after blood cells and clotting factors have been removed. Serous drainage may indicate that the wound is healing properly and that there is no infection present. The other options listed describe different types of wound drainage: A describes hemorrhagic drainage, B describes purulent drainage, and C describes infected drainage."
