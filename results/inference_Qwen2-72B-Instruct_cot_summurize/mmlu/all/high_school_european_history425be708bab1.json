It has but established new classes, new conditions of oppression, new forms of struggle in place of the old ones. Our epoch, the epoch of the bourgeoisie, possesses, however, this distinctive feature: it has simplified the class antagonisms. Society as a whole is more and more splitting up into two great hostile camps, into two great classes, directly facing each other: Bourgeoisie and Proletariat.\nKarl Marx and Friedrich Engels, The Communist Manifesto, 1848\nA follower of Marx and Engels's view of history would argue that an all-out war between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat classes was\n\nA. a destructive development that could be avoided through the study of philosophy\nB. a possibility which should be encouraged in order to foster progress\nC. an inevitable result of fundamental economic change\nD. an example of history repeating itself\n"

They believed that this struggle would inevitably lead to a revolution where the proletariat would overthrow the bourgeoisie, establishing a classless society. This perspective views such a conflict not as something to be avoided or as a mere repetition of history, but as a necessary consequence of the underlying economic system."
