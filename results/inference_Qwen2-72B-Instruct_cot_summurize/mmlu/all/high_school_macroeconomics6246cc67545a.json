An increase in the size of the labor force.\n\nAn increase in the size of the labor force can lead to economic growth if there is also an increase in demand for goods and services, and if the new workers are productive. More people working can lead to more output, which can contribute to economic growth. However, it's important to note that simply having more workers does not guarantee economic growth if those workers are not being utilized effectively or if there isn't enough demand for their output.\n\nA decrease in the unemployment rate (option A) could be a sign of economic growth, but it is not a direct cause of it. It may indicate that businesses are expanding and hiring more workers, but other factors such as productivity improvements and technological advancements are also crucial for sustained economic growth.\n\nAn increase in the unemployment rate (option B) would typically not result in economic growth, as it suggests a reduction in the amount of goods and services produced by the economy.\n\nA decrease in the population (option D) would generally not result in economic growth, as it would mean fewer workers and consumers, potentially leading to lower output and demand. However, under certain circumstances, such as when a country has a very large and unsustainable population, a decrease in population might eventually lead to better resource allocation and potentially higher per capita income, but this is not a typical scenario for economic growth."
