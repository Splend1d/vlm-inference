Short loops of Henle to maximize water secretion\n\nIn a hot arid environment, animals need to conserve as much water as possible. The longer loops of Henle in the kidneys allow for more efficient reabsorption of water back into the bloodstream, which helps to conserve water. Conversely, shorter loops of Henle would result in less water being reabsorbed and more being excreted as urine, which would not be advantageous in a dry environment where water is scarce."
