A superstar basketball player's $50 million earnings.\n\nEconomic rent refers to income derived from the ownership of a resource, asset, or factor of production that exceeds the minimum required to keep it in its current use. In this case, the superstar basketball player's earnings can be considered economic rent because they likely far exceed what would be necessary to secure their talents, given their unique skills and the demand for them. The other options do not represent economic rents; they are examples of government benefits (Social Security, welfare) or personal financial support (parent or guardian to college student)."
