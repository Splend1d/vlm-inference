According to U.S. GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles), gains or losses from the remeasurement of foreign currency transactions are recognized in the income statement, while gains or losses from the translation of foreign entities' financial statements into the parent company's reporting currency are recognized in other comprehensive income, which is a component of equity.\n\nIn this case, the $25,000 gain resulting from the remeasurement of Mentor's financial statements should be recognized in the income statement. The $40,000 gain resulting from the translation of the financial statements would typically be reported in other comprehensive income rather than the income statement.\n\nTherefore, the amount that Mentor should recognize as a foreign currency gain in its income statement is:\n\nB. $25,000\n\nNote: If Mentor Co. were preparing its financial statements under IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards), the treatment might differ, but the question specifies no such detail, so the response is based on U.S. GAAP."
