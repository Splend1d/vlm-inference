It might be against building rules or local noise ordinances, but it doesn't rise to the level of a clear moral transgression like lying, stealing, or harming someone. However, it's important to be respectful of others' peace and quiet, and continuing to play loud music after being asked to lower the volume could be seen as a breach of social etiquette or community standards."
