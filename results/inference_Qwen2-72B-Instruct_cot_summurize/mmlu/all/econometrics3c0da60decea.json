                    "text": "To determine if the given AR(2) process is stationary, explosive, or has a unit root, we need to analyze its characteristic equation. The AR(2) process is given by:\n\nyt = 1.5yt-1 - 0.5yt-2 + ut\n\nThe characteristic equation of this process is obtained by replacing yt with \u03bb^t, where \u03bb is the characteristic root:\n\n\u03bb^2 = 1.5\u03bb - 0.5\n\nRearranging the terms, we get:\n\n\u03bb^2 - 1.5\u03bb + 0.5 = 0\n\nNow, we need to find the roots of this quadratic equation. We can use the quadratic formula:\n\n\u03bb = (b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2-4ac)) / 2a\n\nwhere a = 1, b = -1.5, and c = 0.5. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\n\u03bb = (1.5 \u00b1 \u221a((-1.5)\u00b2-4*1*0.5)) / 2*1\n\u03bb = (1.5 \u00b1 \u221a(2.25-2)) / 2\n\u03bb = (1.5 \u00b1 \u221a0.25) / 2\n\u03bb = (1.5 \u00b1 0.5) / 2\n\nThus, we have two roots:\n\n\u03bb1 = (1.5 + 0.5) / 2 = 1\n\u03bb2 = (1.5 - 0.5) / 2 = 0.5\n\nSince one of the roots (\u03bb1) equals 1, this AR(2) process has a unit root. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Unit root process"
