Resistivity (\\(\\rho\\)) is defined by the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\rho = RA / l\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(R\\) is the resistance of the conductor, \\(A\\) is the cross-sectional area, and \\(l\\) is the length of the conductor. But often, resistivity is considered an intrinsic property of the material and is given as \\(\\rho = R \\cdot l / A\\)."
