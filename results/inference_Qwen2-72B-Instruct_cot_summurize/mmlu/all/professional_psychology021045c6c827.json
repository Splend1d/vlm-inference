Rett\u2019s disorder.\n\nRett\u2019s disorder is a neurological disorder that almost exclusively affects girls and leads to severe intellectual disability, loss of purposeful hand use, and problems with movement, coordination, and communication. It's not typically comorbid with Conduct Disorder because the nature and severity of Rett\u2019s disorder would overshadow symptoms of Conduct Disorder. \n\nConversely, ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder), Oppositional Defiant Disorder, and Asperger syndrome can co-occur with Conduct Disorder."
