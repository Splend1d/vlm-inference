Via scratches and breaks in the skin\n\nPapillomaviruses, such as Human Papillomavirus (HPV), primarily infect humans through direct skin-to-skin contact, often entering the body through small cuts, abrasions, or breaks in the skin. This mode of transmission is common for warts on various parts of the body, including genital warts, which are sexually transmitted. While HPV can be found in healthcare settings, it is not considered nosocomial (hospital-acquired) in the same sense as some other infections. It is also not typically waterborne or airborne."
