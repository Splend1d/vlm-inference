The traditional design, the mercury barometer, works by balancing the weight of a column of mercury against the atmospheric pressure. Mercury is dense (13.6 times denser than water), so a relatively short column (about 30 inches or 760 mm under standard conditions) can balance the atmospheric pressure.\n\nIf you replace mercury with water in a barometer, the column needs to be much taller because water is less dense. In fact, it would need to be about 13.6 times taller to balance the same atmospheric pressure since water's density is approximately 1/13.6th that of mercury. Therefore, a water barometer would be significantly taller than a mercury one."
