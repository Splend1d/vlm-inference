For a 95% confidence level, the Z-score is approximately 1.96.\n- \\(p\\) is the estimated proportion of successes (or votes for a candidate in this case). Since we do not have any prior estimates, we use the most conservative estimate, which is \\(p = 0.5\\), as it maximizes the value of \\(p(1-p)\\).\n- \\(E\\) is the desired margin of error, which in this case is 0.025.\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula gives:\n\n\\[ n = \\frac{1.96^2 \\cdot 0.5 \\cdot (1-0.5)}{0.025^2} \\]\n\\[ n = \\frac{3.8416 \\cdot 0.5 \\cdot 0.5}{0.000625} \\]\n\\[ n = \\frac{0.9604}{0.000625} \\]\n\\[ n = 1536.64 \\]\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a person in our sample, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the minimum sample size needed is 1537.\n\nThe correct answer is C. 1537."
