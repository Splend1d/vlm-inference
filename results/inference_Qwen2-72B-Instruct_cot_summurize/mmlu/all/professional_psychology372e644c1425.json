When the 16-month-old child sees a dog for the first time and calls it \"kitty,\" she is trying to fit the new experience (seeing a dog) into an existing schema (the concept of \"kitty\"). This is an example of assimilation because the child is using her current understanding (that \"kitty\" refers to a four-legged furry animal) to make sense of the new experience without modifying her existing schema to accommodate the difference between cats and dogs."
