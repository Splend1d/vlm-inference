Among the options you've listed, the most likely cultural practice borrowed by the Hohokam from Mesoamerican cultures is:\n\nC. playing ritual ball games\n\nEvidence suggests that the Hohokam participated in a ball game similar to those played in Mesoamerica. They constructed ball courts, which have been found at various archaeological sites, indicating that this aspect of Mesoamerican culture was indeed adopted by the Hohokam.\n\nWhile it's true that maize (corn) was an important crop for both the Hohokam and Mesoamerican cultures, there isn't as much evidence to suggest that the Hohokam borrowed the specific practice of ritual consumption of maize beer from Mesoamerica. Ritual human sacrifice and the construction of stepped pyramids are also not well-documented practices among the Hohokam."
