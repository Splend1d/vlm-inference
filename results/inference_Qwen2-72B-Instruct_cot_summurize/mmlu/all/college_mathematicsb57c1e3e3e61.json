It could be a finite open interval, a closed interval, a half-open interval, or even a single point, but it cannot be a union of separate intervals unless they are the same point (since the radius of convergence is the same in all directions from the center).\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\n(I) [\u22121, 3): This is a valid interval of convergence. It includes the points -1 and all points up to but not including 3.\n\n(II) (\u2212\u221e, 0]: This is also a valid interval of convergence. It includes all points less than or equal to 0.\n\n(III) [2, 2] \u222a [3, 3]: This is not a valid interval of convergence for a power series because it represents two separate points, not an interval. A power series can converge at a single point if that point is its center, but it cannot converge only at two separate points.\n\n(IV) (\u2212\u221e,\u221e): This is a valid interval of convergence. It means the series converges everywhere.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. (I) and (IV)."
