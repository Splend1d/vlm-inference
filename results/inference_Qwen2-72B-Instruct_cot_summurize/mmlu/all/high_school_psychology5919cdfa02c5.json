This concept is in direct contrast to B.F. Skinner's behaviorist view, which suggests that language acquisition is a result of environmental stimuli, reinforcement, and imitation. According to Chomsky, the LAD contains a set of universal grammatical rules that allow children to generate and understand an infinite number of sentences in any language they are exposed to."
