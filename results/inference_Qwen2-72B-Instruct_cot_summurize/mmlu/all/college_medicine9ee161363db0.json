This is achieved through adaptations such as increased mitochondrial density and capillary networks in the muscles, which enhance the muscles' ability to oxidize fuels aerobically. While some of the other options may also be affected by endurance training, the primary adaptation that increases the muscle's capacity in response to this type of training is its improved ability to burn fat and carbohydrate."
