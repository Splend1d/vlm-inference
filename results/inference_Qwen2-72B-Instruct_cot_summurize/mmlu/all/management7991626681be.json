A group whose aim is transformational change\n\nT-group training, also known as sensitivity training or encounter groups, is a method of group training where participants engage in self-examination and interact with others to explore issues of personal growth, interpersonal relations, and group dynamics. The goal is often to achieve transformational change in how individuals perceive themselves and others, enhancing their communication skills and emotional intelligence. This type of training was popularized by the National Training Laboratories (NTL) in the 1940s and has been widely used in organizational development, education, and therapy settings."
