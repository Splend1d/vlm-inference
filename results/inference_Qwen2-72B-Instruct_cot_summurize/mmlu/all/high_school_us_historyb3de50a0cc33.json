Also the congressional reports of about 1840 are full of abuse of English, Scotch, Welsh immigrants as paupers, criminals, and so forth. Old citizens in Detroit of Irish and German descent have told me of the fierce tirades and propaganda directed against the great waves of Irish and Germans who came over from 1840 on for a few decades to escape civil, racial, and religious persecution in their native lands. The \"Know-Nothings,\" lineal ancestors of the Ku-Klux Klan, bitterly denounced the Irish and Germans as mongrels, scum, foreigners, and a menace to our institutions, much as other great branches of the Caucasian race of glorious history and antecedents are berated to-day\u2026.But to-day it is the Italians, Spanish, Poles, Jews, Greeks, Russians, Balkanians, and so forth, who are the racial lepers\u2026..In this bill we find racial discrimination at its worst\u2014a deliberate attempt to go back 84 years in our census taken every 10 years so that a blow may be aimed at peoples of eastern and southern Europe, particularly at our recent allies in the Great War\u2014Poland and Italy.\"\nRobert H.

                    "text": "The legislative act that is most closely an example of nativism in the context provided is not listed among your options, but based on the quote's reference to a bill aiming to discriminate against peoples of eastern and southern Europe and targeting recent allies from the Great War (World War I), it would likely be most similar to the Immigration Act of 1924 (also known as the Johnson-Reed Act). This act established strict quotas on immigration that favored northern Europeans and severely restricted immigration from southern and eastern Europe, which aligns with the description given in the quote.\n\nHowever, among the options you've provided:\n\nA. The Wagner Act of 1935 - This act, also known as the National Labor Relations Act, pertains to labor unions and does not relate to nativism.\n\nB. The Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798 - These acts were passed during the presidency of John Adams and were aimed at limiting the influence of immigrants and curbing criticism of the government. While they do reflect nativist sentiments, they predate the period described in the quote by over a century.\n\nC. The Espionage Act of 1917 - This act was designed to prevent interference with military operations and support of enemies during wartime. It was not specifically targeted at immigrants or based on nativist sentiment, although it was used in ways that affected immigrants and minorities disproportionately.\n\nD. The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 - This act abolished the national origins quota system established by previous immigration laws, which had favored certain ethnic groups, and was intended to be more equitable in its treatment of immigrants from different countries. It does not represent nativist policy.\n\nGiven the options, the closest to a nativist policy would be:\n\nB. The Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798\n\nBut it should be noted that the most fitting example based on the quote would be the Immigration Act of 1924, which is not included in your list."
