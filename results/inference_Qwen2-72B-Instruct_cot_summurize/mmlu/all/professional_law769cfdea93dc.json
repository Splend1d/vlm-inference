                    "text": "A man outraged by the recent church decision to clear a famous philosopher of charges of heresy, decided to present a lecture, open to the public, disproving the philosopher's theories. A state statute provides that: \"state universities can permit the use of their lecture halls to the public for worthwhile programs of public benefit, upon approval of the school board. \"The appropriate school board refused to make a university lecture hall available to the man on the grounds that the proposed lecture was not of worthwhile benefit to the public. As a result, the man brought suit in a state court against the school board and requested injunctive relief requiring the board to allow him the use of the lecture hall. The trial court denied relief and dismissed the suit. The judgment was affirmed by the state appellate court, and is now before the U. S. Supreme Court. In analyzing the state statute, which of the following statements is least accurate?\n\nA. The statute is unconstitutionally overbroad, because it may result in the exclusion of protected speech as well as unprotected speech.\nB. The statute, as applied to the man, does not violate his First Amendment rights because his proposed speech is not political and, therefore, not among the classes of speech that are protected.\nC. Indirect speech, regulations are only permissible if necessary to serve compelling state interests.\nD. The statute is a prior restraint on speech, which unconstitutionally vests unfettered discretion in the school board to decide who may use university lecture halls.\n"

                    "text": "Statement B is the least accurate. The First Amendment protects more than just political speech; it also protects a wide variety of other types of expression, including philosophical discourse. The fact that the man's proposed lecture does not involve political speech does not automatically mean that it falls outside the protection of the First Amendment. Philosophical speech is generally considered to be within the ambit of protected speech under the First Amendment.\n\nThe other statements (A, C, and D) all raise valid concerns about the constitutionality of the statute:\n\nA. The statute could be considered unconstitutionally overbroad if it is so broad that it includes both protected and unprotected speech, potentially chilling free speech.\n\nC. Regulations of speech must meet strict scrutiny if they are content-based, meaning they must be narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest.\n\nD. The statute could be seen as a prior restraint on speech, which is generally disfavored under the First Amendment, especially if it vests unfettered discretion in government officials to decide what speech is permissible. Prior restraints require a showing of a compelling state interest and that they are narrowly tailored to achieve that interest."
