In the 1950s, clinical trials for the oral contraceptive pill were conducted in Puerto Rico, where researchers targeted low-income women. This choice was influenced by various factors, including the high fertility rate on the island at the time, the availability of a large population willing to participate in the trials, and the lack of stringent regulations that existed in the United States regarding human experimentation. The trials were led by Dr. Gregory Pincus and involved the testing of Enovid, which later became the first oral contraceptive approved by the FDA in 1960."
