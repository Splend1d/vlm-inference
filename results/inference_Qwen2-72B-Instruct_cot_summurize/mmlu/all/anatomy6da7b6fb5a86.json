This muscle is one of the four muscles of mastication and its primary function is to open the jaw by pulling the mandible forward and downward when both sides contract. When only one side contracts, it will pull the jaw to the opposite side, aiding in grinding movements. Contrary to other mastication muscles that primarily elevate the mandible, the lateral pterygoid is unique in its role as a depressor of the mandible."
