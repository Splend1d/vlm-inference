The landowner accepted the award of fair market value and did not appeal. For the next 15 years, the agency held the property but did not implement an educational use for it. In year 16, the agency abandoned the intended education use and sold it at a properly advertised auction under state law. The original landowner appealed, arguing that the agency only took a fee simple determinable and when it ceased its intended educational use, superior fee simple title reverted back to the original owner. Will the appellate court likely rule that the landowner can assert rights to stop the attempted transfer?\n\nA. No, because the state also acquired fee simple title by adverse possession after 11 continuous, uninterrupted years of possession.\nB. No, because the original transfer was legally conducted and the landowner received fair market value, thereby allowing a presumption of fee simple title in the agency.\nC. Yes, eminent domain is restricted to taking property that is urgently needed for a public use and the failure to use it for that purpose defeated fee simple ownership in the agency.\nD. Yes, because every eminent domain taking implies a fee simple determinable aspect to the governmental acquisition.\n"

No, because the original transfer was legally conducted and the landowner received fair market value, thereby allowing a presumption of fee simple title in the agency.\n\nWhen a state education agency acquires land through eminent domain and compensates the landowner with fair market value, the landowner relinquishes their rights to the property. The agency then holds a fee simple title, which is the most complete ownership interest one can have in real property. Unless there were specific conditions placed on the conveyance limiting the use or duration of the agency's ownership, the agency has full rights to sell the property as they see fit. The fact that the property was not used for educational purposes does not necessarily defeat the agency's fee simple ownership. Absent a reverter clause or other condition subsequent in the deed, the original landowner does not automatically regain title upon abandonment of the intended use."
