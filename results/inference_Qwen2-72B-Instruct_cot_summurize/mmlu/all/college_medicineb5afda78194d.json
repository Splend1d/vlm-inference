This conversion factor is based on the average energy yield from the oxidation of macronutrients (carbohydrates, fats, and proteins).\n\nGiven that the mean rate of oxygen consumption of the male athlete during the training session is 2 liters per minute, we can calculate the rate of energy expenditure as follows:\n\n\\[ \\text{Energy Expenditure} = \\text{Oxygen Consumption} \\times \\text{Conversion Factor} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Energy Expenditure} = 2 \\, \\text{l/min} \\times 20 \\, \\text{kJ/l} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Energy Expenditure} = 40 \\, \\text{kJ/min} \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. 40 kJ/min."
