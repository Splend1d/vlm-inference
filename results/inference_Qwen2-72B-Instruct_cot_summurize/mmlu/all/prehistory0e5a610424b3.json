Higher values of the heavier oxygen isotope (oxygen-18) typically indicate drier conditions, while lower values suggest wetter periods. In the context of the Maya civilization, researchers have found that periods of lower oxygen-18 levels in the stalagmite from Yok Balum Cave correlate with times of increased rainfall and prosperity for the Maya. Conversely, higher oxygen-18 levels, indicating drier conditions or drought, have been linked to periods of societal stress, including a decline in construction activities at ceremonial centers and, potentially, contributing factors to the eventual collapse of some Maya city-states.\n\nA severe drought, as indicated by the isotopic record, would have had significant impacts on the agricultural productivity of the Maya, who relied heavily on rain-fed agriculture. This would have led to food shortages, social unrest, and a decrease in resources available for large-scale construction projects typical of Maya ceremonial centers."
