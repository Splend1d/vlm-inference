This means that states have a duty to attempt to resolve their disputes through peaceful means such as negotiation, mediation, or arbitration. However, this does not necessarily mean that they are obligated to successfully resolve their disputes, only that they must make a good faith effort to do so. Therefore, option B is correct.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it suggests that states have an obligation to achieve a specific outcome (i.e., resolving their disputes), rather than simply trying to do so peacefully.\n\nOption C is partially correct in that the peaceful settlement of disputes is considered a fundamental principle of international law, but it goes too far in suggesting that it is a peremptory norm (jus cogens) that applies to all states in all circumstances. While most states recognize the importance of peaceful dispute resolution, there may be exceptional cases where other considerations take precedence.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the obligation of peaceful dispute resolution applies to states, not just to international courts and tribunals. While these bodies can play a role in facilitating peaceful resolution of disputes, they are not the only actors involved in this process."
