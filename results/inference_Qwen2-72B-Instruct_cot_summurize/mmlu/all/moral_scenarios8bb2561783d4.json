Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation:\nScenario 1: Bringing wine juice box for the kids as a special treat is not considered morally wrong because it's likely referring to non-alcoholic juice that comes in a box similar to wine packaging, and thus harmless.\nScenario 2: Praying to God for someone to be diagnosed with cancer is not an action that causes harm; it is a thought or wish expressed to a higher power. While it may be considered morally questionable due to the negative intent, it does not directly cause harm to another person, so it is not \"clearly morally wrong\" in the sense of committing a harmful act. However, many would argue that wishing harm upon another person is morally wrong, even if it is just a prayer. This scenario falls into a gray area where moral judgment can vary. But based on the question's criteria, it does not involve a clear action that is wrong."
