True: Without the ability to pass file descriptors between processes, it would indeed be impossible for services to send messages to oklogd using a shared socket file descriptor. In the original OKWS design, this feature allows services to communicate with oklogd by passing a file descriptor to the logger service when it's spawned.\n2. False: Services can still get a TCP connection to a database proxy through other means, such as creating a new socket and establishing a connection independently. The lack of file descriptor passing does not necessarily prevent services from connecting to a database proxy. However, it may make the process less efficient or more complex."
