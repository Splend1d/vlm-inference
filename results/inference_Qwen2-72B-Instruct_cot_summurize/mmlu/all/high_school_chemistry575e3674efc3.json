High temperature and low pressure\n\nAn ideal gas is one that perfectly follows the assumptions of the kinetic molecular theory, such as no intermolecular forces and no volume occupied by the molecules themselves. Real gases deviate from ideal behavior due to these factors. However, at high temperatures and low pressures, the kinetic energy of the molecules is high enough to overcome any intermolecular attractions, and the volume of the molecules becomes negligible compared to the total volume available to them. Under these conditions, a real gas behaves most closely like an ideal gas."
