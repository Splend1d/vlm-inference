Eating foods with a low glycemic index (GI) can also aid in weight management because they tend to be digested more slowly, leading to a more gradual rise in blood sugar levels and potentially reducing hunger. This combination can be effective for long-term weight maintenance. However, it's important to note that overall calorie intake and physical activity levels also play significant roles in weight management."
