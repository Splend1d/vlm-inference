In response to the complaint, the plumber filed a motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. The court denied the motion. Thereafter, the plumber did not file an answer or any other response to the company's action. Sixty days after the court's order denying the motion to dismiss, the company asked the clerk to enter default, and the clerk did so. The company applied to the court for the entry of a default judgment and notified the plumber three days before the default judgment hearing. After an ex parte hearing in which the court received evidence on the damages amount, the court entered a default judgment for the full amount sought. Ten days later, the plumber filed a motion to set aside the default judgment. Is the court likely to grant the plumber's motion?\n\nA. No, because the court could fix the amount of damages even without hearing the plumber's evidence.\nB. No, because the plumber failed to plead or otherwise defend against the company's action.\nC. Yes, because the plumber was not given adequate notice of the hearing on the company's application for the entry of a default judgment.\nD. Yes, because the State A federal court lacked personal jurisdiction over the plumber as a State B citizen.\n"

Yes, because the plumber was not given adequate notice of the hearing on the company's application for the entry of a default judgment.\n\nUnder Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 55(b)(2), when a party seeks a default judgment, they must apply to the court and provide the opposing party with notice of the application. This notice must be provided at least three days before the hearing (unless the court orders otherwise). In this case, the company notified the plumber only three days before the default judgment hearing, which may not have been sufficient time for the plumber to prepare and respond. Therefore, the court is likely to grant the plumber's motion to set aside the default judgment based on inadequate notice.\n\nIt's important to note that option D is incorrect because the question does not provide enough information to determine whether the court had personal jurisdiction over the plumber. However, if the court indeed lacked personal jurisdiction, it would also be grounds for setting aside the default judgment, but that is not the primary reason given in the answer choices."
