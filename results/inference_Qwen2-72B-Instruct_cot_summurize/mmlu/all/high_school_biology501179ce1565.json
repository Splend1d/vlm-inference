However, it's important to note that while fungi have a nucleus and membrane-bound organelles (like the Golgi apparatus and mitochondria), bacteria do not. Bacteria have a simpler cellular structure with no true nucleus or membrane-bound organelles. Both can be unicellular, but many fungi also have multicellular forms. So, option A is the best answer as it includes characteristics shared by both bacteria and fungi."
