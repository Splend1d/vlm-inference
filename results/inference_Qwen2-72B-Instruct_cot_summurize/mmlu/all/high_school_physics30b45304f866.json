This means that both carts will have the same velocity immediately after the collision.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that D. Linear momentum is also conserved in this scenario. The total linear momentum before the collision equals the total linear momentum after the collision due to the conservation of momentum principle. But since the question asks for what the carts each have the same of each other, and given the context of the collision described, the most direct answer is A. Velocity."
