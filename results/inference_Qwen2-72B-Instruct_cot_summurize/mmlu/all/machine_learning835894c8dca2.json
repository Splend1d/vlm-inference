Density-based clustering\n\nDensity-based clustering, such as DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise), is particularly suitable for spatial data and can create clusters of arbitrary shapes and sizes. It defines clusters as regions of high density separated by regions of low density, which makes it ideal for handling spatial data where the distances between points are meaningful.\n\nK-means clustering assumes spherical clusters of similar size and density, making it less suitable for spatial data with varying cluster shapes and sizes. Model-based clustering requires specifying a model for each cluster, which might not be straightforward for spatial data without prior knowledge. Decision trees are not designed for clustering but rather for classification or regression tasks."
