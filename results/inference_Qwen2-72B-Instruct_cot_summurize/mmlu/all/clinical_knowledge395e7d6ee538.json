Creatine supplements can increase muscle strength and power.\n\nWhile increasing protein intake can be beneficial for muscle repair and growth, especially for individuals who are physically active, the specific amount required varies based on factors such as age, sex, physical activity level, and overall health. The general recommendation for athletes is around 1.2 to 2.0 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight per day, but not necessarily 3 grams per kg or more for most individuals. Therefore, option A is not universally true.\n\nOption C is partially true; amino acid supplements, particularly those high in branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), may aid in muscle recovery and potentially enhance muscle growth, but they are not guaranteed to directly increase muscle strength and power in all individuals.\n\nOption D is incorrect because muscle damage typically occurs during eccentric (lengthening) contractions rather than shortening contractions. Shortening contractions, also known as concentric contractions, are when muscles contract while generating force to move a load.\n\nCreatine supplements have been shown in numerous studies to effectively increase muscle strength and power, making option B the correct choice among these options."
