                    "text": "To solve this problem, we can use the Bernoulli's equation for incompressible flow, which states that the total mechanical energy per unit volume is constant along a streamline in the absence of viscosity and external forces. Mathematically, it is given by:\n\n\\[ P + \\frac{1}{2}\\rho v^2 + \\rho gh = \\text{constant} \\]\n\nwhere \\(P\\) is the pressure, \\(\\rho\\) is the density of the fluid, \\(v\\) is the velocity of the fluid, \\(g\\) is the acceleration due to gravity, and \\(h\\) is the height above a reference point. Since the pipe is horizontal (\\(h\\) is constant), and assuming no change in gravitational potential energy, the equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[ P + \\frac{1}{2}\\rho v^2 = \\text{constant} \\]\n\nGiven that the flow is streamlined with a constant flow rate (mass flow rate), the continuity equation tells us that:\n\n\\[ \\rho A_1 v_1 = \\rho A_2 v_2 \\]\n\nwhere \\(A_1\\) and \\(A_2\\) are the cross-sectional areas at Points 1 and 2, respectively, and \\(v_1\\) and \\(v_2\\) are the velocities at those points. Given that the diameter at Point 1 is \\(d\\) and at Point 2 is \\(d/3\\), the cross-sectional area at Point 2 is \\((d/3)^2 / d^2 = 1/9\\) times the area at Point 1.\n\nTherefore, since the flow rate is constant:\n\n\\[ v_2 = 9v_1 \\]\n\nNow, applying Bernoulli's equation at both points, we get:\n\n\\[ P_1 + \\frac{1}{2}\\rho v_1^2 = P_2 + \\frac{1}{2}\\rho v_2^2 \\]\n\nSubstituting \\(v_2 = 9v_1\\):\n\n\\[ P_1 + \\frac{1}{2}\\rho v_1^2 = P_2 + \\frac{1}{2}\\rho (9v_1)^2 \\]\n\n\\[ P_1 + \\frac{1}{2}\\rho v_1^2 = P_2 + \\frac{81}{2}\\rho v_1^2 \\]\n\nRearranging for \\(P_2\\):\n\n\\[ P_2 = P_1 - \\frac{80}{2}\\rho v_1^2 \\]\n\n\\[ P_2 = P_1 - 40\\rho v_1^2 \\]\n\nThus, the pressure at Point 2 is less than the pressure at Point 1 by \\(40\\rho v_1^2\\). Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. less than the pressure at Point 1 by 40 \\(\\rho v^2\\)"
