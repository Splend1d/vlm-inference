In this case, the thunderstorm caused a random event that led to the death of a disproportionate number of long-finned fish, which altered the relative frequencies of the long-finned and short-finned traits in the population. This change in allele frequencies due to a random event is characteristic of genetic drift. \n\nNatural selection would involve differential survival or reproduction based on the trait's effect on fitness, not just random events. Gene flow involves the transfer of alleles from one population to another, and stabilizing selection acts to maintain the status quo in a population by selecting against extreme variants and preserving the average form."
