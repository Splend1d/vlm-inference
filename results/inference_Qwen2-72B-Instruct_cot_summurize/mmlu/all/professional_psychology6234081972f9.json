Tonic-clonic seizures, also known as grand mal seizures, are characterized by a sudden loss of consciousness, followed by rhythmic jerking movements (clonic phase) and stiffness or rigidity (tonic phase). They are associated with generalized epilepsy, meaning they affect both hemispheres of the brain simultaneously. The term \"grand mal\" is an older term that is still sometimes used to describe this type of seizure, but it is being replaced by the term \"generalized tonic-clonic seizure.\""
