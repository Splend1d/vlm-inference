Social media platforms have become essential tools for political campaigns, enabling politicians to communicate directly with voters, mobilize supporters, and target specific demographics with tailored messages. The use of social media in politics has transformed campaign strategies and has played a significant role in several high-profile elections around the world. However, it's important to note that social media also significantly impacts other sectors like retail business, automotive sales, and nonprofits, but the transformation in political communication through social media has been particularly dramatic and swift."
