The temperature of the mixture rose to reach a final temperature of 37 \u00b0C. Which of the following can be concluded?\n\nA. The sample lost more thermal energy than the water gained because the sample temperature changed more than the water temperature did.\nB. Even though the sample temperature changed more than the water temperature did, the sample lost the same amount of thermal energy as the water gained.\nC. The sample temperature changed more than the water temperature did; therefore the heat capacity of the sample must be greater than the heat capacity of the water.\nD. The final temperature is less than the average starting temperatures; therefore the equilibrium constant must be less than 1.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is B: Even though the sample temperature changed more than the water temperature did, the sample lost the same amount of thermal energy as the water gained.\n\nIn a thermally isolated system where no heat is exchanged with the surroundings (as in this case due to the insulated container), the thermal energy lost by one body equals the thermal energy gained by the other. This follows from the law of conservation of energy. \n\nTo determine if the statement is true, we can use the formula for heat transfer in calorimetry:\n\n\\[q = mc\\Delta T\\]\n\nwhere \\(q\\) is the heat transferred, \\(m\\) is the mass of the substance, \\(c\\) is the specific heat capacity of the substance, and \\(\\Delta T\\) is the change in temperature.\n\nFor the sample:\n\\[q_{\\text{sample}} = m_{\\text{sample}} c_{\\text{sample}} \\Delta T_{\\text{sample}}\\]\n\nFor the water:\n\\[q_{\\text{water}} = m_{\\text{water}} c_{\\text{water}} \\Delta T_{\\text{water}}\\]\n\nSince there is no heat loss to the environment, \\(q_{\\text{sample}} = -q_{\\text{water}}\\). The negative sign indicates that the sample loses heat while the water gains it.\n\nGiven that the temperature change of the sample (\\(\\Delta T_{\\text{sample}}\\)) is greater than the temperature change of the water (\\(\\Delta T_{\\text{water}}\\)), and knowing that the mass of the water is four times the mass of the sample, but the specific heat capacity of water is also significantly higher than most solids, it's possible for the sample to lose the same amount of thermal energy as the water gains despite the larger temperature change of the sample.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it violates the principle of conservation of energy. Option C is incorrect because the heat capacity cannot be determined from the given information alone. Option D is incorrect because the concept of an equilibrium constant does not apply to this situation. Equilibrium constants are used in chemical reactions to describe the ratio of products to reactants at equilibrium, which is not applicable here."
