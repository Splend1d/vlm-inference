Therefore, if the mass is found to be malignant, it would be most appropriate to evaluate the superficial inguinal lymph nodes (Option D) for possible metastasis.\n\nA. Internal iliac lymph nodes receive drainage from the rectum and sigmoid colon above the level of the dentate line.\nB. Popliteal lymph nodes receive drainage from the lower extremities.\nC. Sacral lymph nodes receive drainage from the pelvic organs and lower part of the digestive tract, but not typically from the anal region below the dentate line. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Superficial inguinal lymph nodes."
