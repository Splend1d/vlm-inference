Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation: In scenario 1, while breaking furniture might be considered destructive behavior and potentially harmful if it leads to property damage or injury, it is not inherently morally wrong if the furniture belongs to the person and they are not harming others. However, it's important to note that this behavior could be problematic if it escalates or affects others negatively.\n\nIn scenario 2, putting chicken parts into hot oil is simply cooking, which is a normal and necessary activity for preparing food. There is nothing morally wrong with this action unless the context changes, such as if the chicken was improperly sourced or if the act involves animal cruelty. Assuming standard conditions, this is not a morally wrong action."
