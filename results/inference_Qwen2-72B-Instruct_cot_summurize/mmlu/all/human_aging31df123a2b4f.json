This includes having strong relationships with family and friends, being part of a community, and having a network that provides emotional, practical, and informational support. These connections can help individuals cope with stress, maintain a positive outlook, and engage in healthy behaviors, all of which contribute to a longer lifespan.\n\nIn contrast, high BMI (Body Mass Index), excessive alcohol use, and reliance on supplements without medical guidance are not generally associated with increased longevity. While maintaining a healthy weight and moderate alcohol consumption can be part of a healthy lifestyle, extremes in these areas can lead to health problems. Similarly, while certain supplements may benefit specific health conditions when used appropriately, they should not replace a balanced diet and should be taken under the guidance of a healthcare provider."
