HIV can change its surface proteins and resist vaccines.\nB. The patient must have become reinfected with 3TC-resistant viruses.\nC. HIV began making drug-resistant versions of reverse transcriptase in response to the drug.\nD. A few drug-resistant viruses were present at the start of treatment, and natural selection increased their frequency.\n"

A few drug-resistant viruses were present at the start of treatment, and natural selection increased their frequency.\n\nThis scenario illustrates the concept of natural selection acting on pre-existing genetic variation within the viral population. Before treatment, there would have been a small number of viruses with mutations conferring resistance to 3TC. Once treatment started, the drug would effectively kill off the majority of the virus population that was sensitive to it, leaving the resistant strains to replicate and dominate the population. This is a common issue in treating viral infections with antiviral drugs and highlights the importance of combination therapy to prevent or delay the development of drug resistance."
