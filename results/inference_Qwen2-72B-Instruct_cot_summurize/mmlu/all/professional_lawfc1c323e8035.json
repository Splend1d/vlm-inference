In this context, the prosecution's argument that the past crimes demonstrate the likelihood that the man committed the current crime is an attempt to use the evidence to show propensity, which is typically not allowed under the rules of evidence without meeting specific criteria related to relevance and probative value versus prejudicial effect. The defense's objection based on the prohibition of using past crimes to prove disposition is valid under these circumstances. However, the judge might consider admitting such evidence if it is shown to be relevant for another legitimate purpose and its probative value is not substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice."
