A friend of the woman had known the woman for years and knew that she was an easily excitable person. The friend also hated the woman's husband. Knowing that the woman was present, the friend drew a pistol and threatened to kill the husband. The woman suffered severe emotional distress as a result of witnessing this incident and soon afterward had a miscarriage. In an action by the woman against the friend for mental anguish resulting in her miscarriage, the woman will\n\nA. lose, because the friend did not intend for the woman to suffer a miscarriage.\nB. lose, because the friend's actions were directed against the husband, not the woman.\nC. win, because it was highly probable that the friend's extreme and outrageous conduct would cause emotional distress to the woman.\nD. win, because she is the husband's wife.\n"

In this scenario, the friend's actions were indeed extreme and outrageous, and it was foreseeable that his actions could cause severe emotional distress to the pregnant woman, given her known excitability and her relationship with her husband. The fact that the friend's actions were directed at the husband does not absolve him of liability for the harm caused to the wife. Moreover, the miscarriage can be seen as a direct consequence of the emotional distress inflicted by the friend's actions. Therefore, under these circumstances, the woman has grounds to win the case based on IIED."
