The symptoms described are consistent with Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD), which is a more severe form of premenstrual syndrome (PMS). PMDD is characterized by recurrent episodes of depression, irritability, anxiety, and other emotional and physical symptoms that occur during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle and resolve within a few days after the onset of menstruation. Given the patient's history of infertility and tuboplasty, it is also possible that hormonal imbalances or other reproductive health issues could be contributing to her symptoms. However, without additional information or testing, it is not possible to make a definitive diagnosis. Therefore, the answer to the question is not provided in the options given."
