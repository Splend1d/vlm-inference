The contract provided that the construction company would be paid upon completion of the warehouse. The contractor finished the warehouse but it had some minor deviations from the plans due to substitution for certain building materials that were not available in the market. The construction company finished working and demanded payment. The paper company refused to pay based on deviations from the specifications. Will the construction company likely prevail in a breach of contract action against the paper company?\n\nA. Yes, a company that performs construction work can always collect for what it has done on a job.\nB. No, the construction company cannot change the specifications and hope to get paid.\nC. No, the construction company is guilty of fraud and misrepresentation.\nD. Yes, the construction company has substantially performed the contract.\n"

Yes, the construction company has substantially performed the contract.\n\nIn contract law, \"substantial performance\" means that a party has completed the essential parts of the contract to such a degree that the other party has received essentially what was agreed upon. Minor deviations that do not significantly affect the value or use of the project may not constitute a breach serious enough to excuse payment. If the deviations did not compromise the structural integrity or the intended use of the warehouse, and if the construction company can demonstrate that the substitutions were reasonable and necessary under the circumstances (e.g., due to unavailability of specified materials), they may be entitled to payment. However, they might have to reduce their claim by the amount it would cost to correct the deviations if the paper company insists on strict adherence to the original specifications."
