Decrease Unemployment.\n\nDuring a recessionary gap, aggregate demand is less than potential output, leading to decreased economic activity and higher unemployment. Decreasing taxes would increase disposable income for households and businesses, encouraging more spending and investment. This increased demand can help close the recessionary gap, increasing real GDP and reducing unemployment."
