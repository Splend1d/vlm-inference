The kernel of a homomorphism \u03c6 from a group G to a group H, denoted ker(\u03c6), is the set of all elements in G that map to the identity element in H. By definition, the identity element in G must map to the identity element in H, so the kernel cannot be empty. Therefore, the correct answer for this statement is False.\n\nStatement 2: It is not possible to have a nontrivial homomorphism of some finite group into some infinite group.\n\nThis statement is also false. It is perfectly possible to have a nontrivial homomorphism from a finite group to an infinite group. For example, consider the finite cyclic group Z_2 = {0, 1} under addition modulo 2 and the infinite group Z (the integers) under addition. The function \u03c6: Z_2 \u2192 Z defined by \u03c6(0) = 0 and \u03c6(1) = 1 is a nontrivial homomorphism because it preserves the group operation and maps the identity element of Z_2 to the identity element of Z. Therefore, the correct answer for this statement is also False.\n\nThe correct overall answer is:\n\nB. False, False"
