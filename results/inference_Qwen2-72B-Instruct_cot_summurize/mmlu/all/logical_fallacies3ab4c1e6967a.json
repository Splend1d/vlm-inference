It often involves telling a story or presenting information in a way that tugs at the heartstrings and encourages the listener to act out of a sense of compassion rather than logic or reason. While appeals to compassion can be effective in some situations, they can also be problematic if they are used to manipulate emotions or distract from the facts of a situation."
