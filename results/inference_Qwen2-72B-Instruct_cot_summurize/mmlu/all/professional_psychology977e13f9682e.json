The degree to which an ignored stimulus is processed depends on the extent of processing required by the attended stimulus.\n\nThis theory, proposed by Lavie and colleagues, suggests that when the task at hand is simple or requires low cognitive resources, more attention can \"leak\" to unattended stimuli. However, when the task becomes more demanding and requires high cognitive resources, less attention is available for unattended stimuli, effectively reducing their processing. This explains why we might be more easily distracted when performing easy tasks compared to difficult ones.\n\nOptions A, C, and D are related to other theories or aspects of attention, but they do not directly define Attentional Load Theory. For instance:\n\nA. The unity of our actions placing limits on attentional resources is related to the concept of limited capacity in working memory and attention, which is a broader concept than Attentional Load Theory specifically addresses.\n\nC. Selective attention facilitating inhibition of return refers to a mechanism where attention is biased away from previously attended locations, which is part of the Attentional Orienting System but not a direct component of Attentional Load Theory.\n\nD. There is a general limit to the extent of attentional resources, which is a fundamental assumption in various models of attention, including Broadbent's filter model and Kahneman's spotlight model, but it is not unique to Attentional Load Theory."
