He argued that human behavior is motivated by the pursuit of pleasure and the avoidance of pain, which he considered the two sovereign masters placed by nature over mankind. This principle forms the basis of his ethical theory, which suggests that actions are right if they promote happiness and wrong if they produce the opposite of happiness."
