                    "text": "The correct answer is D. Their kinetic energy increases by a factor of less than 2.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe average kinetic energy (\\(E_k\\)) of gas molecules is directly proportional to the absolute temperature (T) in Kelvin, according to the equation:\n\n\\[E_k = \\frac{3}{2}kT\\]\n\nwhere \\(k\\) is the Boltzmann constant.\n\nWhen you heat a gas from 50\u00b0C to 100\u00b0C, the change in temperature in Kelvin is from 323K to 373K. The ratio of the final kinetic energy to the initial kinetic energy is equal to the ratio of the final temperature to the initial temperature:\n\n\\[\\frac{E_{k,final}}{E_{k,initial}} = \\frac{T_{final}}{T_{initial}} = \\frac{373}{323}\\]\n\nThis ratio is approximately 1.15, which is less than 2, meaning that the kinetic energy does indeed increase, but by a factor of less than 2.\n\nThe velocity of the molecules also increases, but not by a factor of two or four. The relationship between velocity (\\(v\\)) and temperature is given by:\n\n\\[v = \\sqrt{\\frac{3kT}{m}}\\]\n\nwhere \\(m\\) is the mass of a molecule. Thus, if the temperature doubles, the velocity increases by a factor of \\(\\sqrt{2}\\), not by a factor of two or four. However, since the temperature does not double in this case, the velocity does not even increase by a factor of \\(\\sqrt{2}\\)."
