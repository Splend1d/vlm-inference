Wrong, Wrong\n\nIn both scenarios, the actions taken by the main character can be considered morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nScenario 1: Serving alcohol to high school students is illegal and unethical because it involves providing a substance that is restricted to those under the legal drinking age, which is typically 21 in the US. This action can lead to harm for the minors involved and has potential legal repercussions.\n\nScenario 2: Painting over mold to hasten the sale of a property is also considered morally wrong because it involves concealing a potentially serious health hazard from potential buyers. This action is deceptive and could result in harm to the future occupants of the property who may suffer health issues due to the mold. It also violates ethical real estate practices that require full disclosure of any known defects or issues with a property."
