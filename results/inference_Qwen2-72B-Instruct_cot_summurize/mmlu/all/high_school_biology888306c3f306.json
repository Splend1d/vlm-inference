Some mutations produce alleles that are recessive and may not be expressed.\nB. Some undesirable phenotypic traits may be prevented from reproducing.\nC. Some mutations cause such drastic phenotypic changes that they are removed from the gene pool.\nD. The predictable rate of mutation results in ongoing variability in a gene pool.\n"

This statement does not explain why the frequency of mutation appears to be low, but rather it explains how mutations contribute to genetic diversity over time. The other three options (A, B, and C) all provide valid reasons as to why the frequency of visible or detectable mutations might appear low in a population."
