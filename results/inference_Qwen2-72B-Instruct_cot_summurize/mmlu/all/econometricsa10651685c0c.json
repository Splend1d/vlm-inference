Parameter estimates may be biased.\n\nIn fact, when dealing with non-stationary time series data, the parameter estimates are typically consistent but may not be unbiased due to the presence of stochastic trends or unit roots. However, the real problem lies in the fact that the standard errors of these estimates are likely to be underestimated, leading to misleadingly small p-values and spuriously high R-squared values (option A). This can result in test statistics not following their standard distributions (option B) and thus invalid statistical inferences (option C).\n\nIt's worth noting that while parameter estimates might not be perfectly unbiased, the key issue with non-stationary data is usually related to the reliability of hypothesis tests and confidence intervals rather than bias per se. Therefore, option D is the least accurate statement among the given options regarding the consequences of using non-stationary data in levels form."
