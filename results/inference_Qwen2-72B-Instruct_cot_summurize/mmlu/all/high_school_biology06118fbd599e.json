A and C only\n\nThe similarities in bone structures among human arms, bat wings, and dolphin flippers are indeed interpreted by biologists through the identification of these bones as being homologous (option A). Homologous structures are anatomical features that share a common evolutionary origin but may have been adapted for different functions over time.\n\nAdditionally, the interpretation includes the proposal that humans, bats, and dolphins share a common ancestor (option C). This common ancestry explains why these seemingly unrelated species have similar underlying skeletal structures, which were present in their last common ancestor and have been modified through evolution to suit the specific needs of each species. Convergent evolution (option B), while an important concept in evolutionary biology, does not apply here because it refers to the independent development of similar features in unrelated species due to similar environmental pressures or functional requirements. In this case, the similarities are due to shared ancestry rather than convergent evolution."
