Baltes and his colleagues' research suggests that flexitime, or flexible scheduling, can lead to greater satisfaction with one's work schedule as it allows employees more control over their work hours, which can help them better balance work and personal life demands. While flexitime may also have positive effects on other outcomes such as absenteeism, self-rated performance, and productivity, the research by Baltes and colleagues specifically highlights its impact on satisfaction with work schedule."
