GDP increases and the price level increases.\n\nWhen the government cuts taxes, it increases disposable income for consumers, which can lead to an increase in consumption and aggregate demand. This can result in higher output (GDP) as firms produce more to meet the increased demand. At the same time, increasing spending on the military is also an expansionary fiscal policy that adds to aggregate demand.\n\nHowever, if the economy is already operating near full capacity, the increase in aggregate demand due to tax cuts and increased military spending might not translate into a proportional increase in output but could instead lead to inflationary pressures, causing the price level to rise. In the short run, both real GDP and the price level are likely to increase, though the long-run effects would depend on various factors such as the responsiveness of supply, monetary policy, and international trade dynamics."
