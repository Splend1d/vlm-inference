These filings are detailed annual reports that public companies are required to submit to the SEC, which include financial statements, results of operations, management's discussion and analysis, and other important information. They provide a comprehensive overview of the company's financial condition and performance, as well as any risks or uncertainties that may impact its future prospects. Unlike press releases or newspaper articles, which may be biased or incomplete, 10-K filings are subject to strict regulatory requirements and must be accurate and complete. Annual reports can also be useful sources of information, but they are typically more promotional in nature and may not provide the same level of detail as 10-K filings."
