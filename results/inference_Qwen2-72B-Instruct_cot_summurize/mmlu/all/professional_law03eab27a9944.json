Late one night, the two men broke into the warehouse and proceeded to load the large crates of defibrillators onto their truck. As they were leaving, one of the men inadvertently threw his cigarette butt into a refuse pile of old cardboard boxes and papers. Soon afterward, the refuse ignited into a small fire. Although the men had time to douse the fire without any danger to themselves, they did not do so. Instead, they fled. Meanwhile, the fire quickly spread, engulfing the entire warehouse in flames. If the defendant is later charged as a co-conspirator, in all likelihood he would be held responsible as\n\nA. an accessory before the fact.\nB. a principal in the second degree.\nC. an accomplice.\nD. not respbnsible.\n"

The defendant's role, as described, does not seem to have been directly in the commission of the burglary itself but rather in providing information that facilitated the crime. This would likely categorize him as someone who assisted or encouraged the commission of the crime but was not present at the scene when the crime was committed.\n\nGiven these circumstances, the most appropriate legal classification for the defendant would be:\n\nC. an accomplice.\n\nAn accomplice is someone who knowingly assists, facilitates, or encourages the commission of a crime. This definition fits the defendant's actions in this case, where he provided information that allowed the two men to target the warehouse and steal the defibrillators. Even though he was not physically present during the burglary and subsequent fire, his involvement in the planning or facilitation of the crime could make him legally responsible as an accomplice.\n\nOptions A (accessory before the fact) and B (principal in the second degree) are similar to being an accomplice but are more specific terms used in some jurisdictions. However, \"accomplice\" is the more general term and is commonly used to describe someone who assists in the commission of a crime. Option D (not responsible) is unlikely given the defendant's involvement in the planning of the crime."
