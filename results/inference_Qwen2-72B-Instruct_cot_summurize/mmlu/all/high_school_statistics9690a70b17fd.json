Expected frequencies in a contingency table used for a chi-square test of independence do not have to be whole numbers. They are calculated by taking the row total times the column total divided by the grand total, which can result in decimal values. What is important is that expected frequencies should generally be at least 5 (or sometimes, a more relaxed rule is at least 1 with no more than 20% of cells having expected counts less than 5) to meet the assumptions of the chi-square test."
