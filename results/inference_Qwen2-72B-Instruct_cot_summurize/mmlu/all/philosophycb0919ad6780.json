In her view, this allows for a more objective and inclusive assessment of what is morally right or wrong, as it avoids the biases and limitations of any particular ethical framework. However, she also acknowledges that such a perspective can be difficult to achieve in practice, as our values and beliefs often shape the way we see and interpret the world."
