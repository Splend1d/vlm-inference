Costs of free trade are concentrated, but benefits are dispersed.\n\nWhen a country opens up to international trade, it exposes its domestic industries to competition from foreign producers. While this can lead to lower prices and greater variety for consumers, it can also result in job losses and plant closures in certain sectors that are unable to compete with foreign firms. These costs are often concentrated in specific regions or industries, while the benefits of cheaper goods and services are dispersed throughout the economy.\n\nAs a result, there may be political pressure to protect domestic industries from foreign competition, particularly from groups that stand to lose from increased competition. This can take the form of tariffs, quotas, subsidies, or other forms of protectionism. While such policies may help certain industries in the short term, they can also lead to higher prices for consumers, reduced efficiency, and retaliation from trading partners, ultimately harming the economy as a whole."
