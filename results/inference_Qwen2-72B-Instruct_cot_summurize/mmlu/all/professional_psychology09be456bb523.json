Focus attention on the confidence interval of a score rather than on the obtained score itself.\n\nThis is because the confidence interval provides information about the precision of the score estimate and acknowledges the inherent variability in testing. It gives a range within which the true score is likely to fall, thereby offering a more nuanced understanding of the test results. This approach is consistent with standard practices in educational and psychological assessment that emphasize the importance of considering measurement error and the limitations of test scores."
