Improve the optimisation algorithm being used for error minimisation.\n\nWhile improving the optimization algorithm can help in some cases, it is not directly addressing the issue of overfitting. Overfitting occurs when the model learns the training data too well, including its noise and outliers, which leads to poor generalization on new, unseen data. The other options (A, C, D) are valid ways to address overfitting by either providing more information to the model, simplifying the model, or cleaning up the input data."
