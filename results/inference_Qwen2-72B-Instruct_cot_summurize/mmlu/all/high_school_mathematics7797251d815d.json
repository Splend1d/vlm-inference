The probability that a randomly selected letter from the 26-letter alphabet is a vowel, according to Wayne, is:\n\n\\[P_{\\text{Wayne}} = \\frac{6}{26}\\]\n\nKristen does not consider \"Y\" as a vowel, so for her, there are 5 vowels in the alphabet (A, E, I, O, U). The probability that a randomly selected letter from the 26-letter alphabet is a vowel, according to Kristen, is:\n\n\\[P_{\\text{Kristen}} = \\frac{5}{26}\\]\n\nWe want to find by what percentage \\(P_{\\text{Wayne}}\\) is greater than \\(P_{\\text{Kristen}}\\). We can calculate this percentage difference using the formula:\n\n\\[\\text{Percentage Difference} = \\left( \\frac{P_{\\text{Wayne}} - P_{\\text{Kristen}}}{P_{\\text{Kristen}}} \\right) \\times 100\\%\\]\n\nSubstituting the values we have:\n\n\\[\\text{Percentage Difference} = \\left( \\frac{\\frac{6}{26} - \\frac{5}{26}}{\\frac{5}{26}} \\right) \\times 100\\% = \\left( \\frac{1}{26} \\div \\frac{5}{26} \\right) \\times 100\\% = \\left( \\frac{1}{5} \\right) \\times 100\\% = 20\\%\\]\n\nTherefore, the probability that a randomly selected letter out of the 26-letter alphabet will be a vowel is 20% greater in Wayne's opinion than in Kristen's opinion.\n\nThe correct answer is C. 20%."
