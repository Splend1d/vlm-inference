This is true even if the original population does not have a normal distribution. However, the theorem specifies that this approximation improves as n becomes larger. Typically, a sample size of 30 or more is considered sufficient for the Central Limit Theorem to apply, although this can vary depending on how non-normal the original distribution is."
