One and only one sperm will fertilize the egg.\n\nThe acrosome reaction is a process in which the acrosome, a specialized organelle at the head of the sperm, releases enzymes that allow the sperm to penetrate the outer layers of the egg. Once the sperm has entered the egg, the cortical reaction occurs, which involves the release of enzymes from the egg's cortex that alter the zona pellucida (the outer layer of the egg) so that other sperm cannot bind to or fuse with the egg. This ensures that only one sperm fertilizes the egg, preventing polyspermy."
