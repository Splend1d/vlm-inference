During this period, she also has had memory lapses, difficulty concentrating, and has been reprimanded at work for arriving late. Over the past 2 weeks, she has had three episodes of palpitations and shortness of breath that have awakened her from sleep. Her pulse is 80/min, and blood pressure is 110/90 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Mental status examination shows a depressed mood and constricted affect. She says that she is no longer interested in activities that she used to enjoy. She has suicidal ideation without a plan. Her hemoglobin concentration is 11 g/dL, and serum ferritin concentration is 140 ng/mL. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial step in treatment?\n\nA. Donepezil therapy\nB. Ferrous sulfate therapy\nC. Ginkgo biloba extract therapy\nD. Paroxetine therapy\n"

The patient's symptoms of depression, including difficulty sleeping, fatigue, muscle tension, memory lapses, difficulty concentrating, lack of interest in previously enjoyed activities, and suicidal ideation, are consistent with major depressive disorder. Paroxetine is an SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) antidepressant that can be effective in treating depression.\n\nDonepezil (A) is used to treat dementia related to Alzheimer's disease and is not indicated for depression. Ferrous sulfate (B) is used to treat iron deficiency anemia, but the patient's hemoglobin and ferritin levels are within normal ranges, making iron supplementation unnecessary. Ginkgo biloba extract (C) is sometimes used as a supplement to improve memory, but it is not a standard treatment for depression and its efficacy for this purpose is not well-established."
