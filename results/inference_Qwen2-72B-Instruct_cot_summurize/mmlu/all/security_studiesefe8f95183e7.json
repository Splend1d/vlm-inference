It involves not only providing protection and security for its citizens but also ensuring that it does not become a source of insecurity itself. Here's how each of the options contributes to this understanding:\n\nA. While it is true that some states have been responsible for committing violent acts against their own citizens or others, this does not negate the potential of the state to be a positive force for human security when it upholds the rule of law, respects human rights, and promotes justice.\n\nB. The state often possesses the greatest material resources and power necessary to address threats to human security. This includes the ability to provide public services, infrastructure, healthcare, education, and social welfare programs that enhance the well-being and resilience of individuals and communities.\n\nC. In the face of immediate crises such as war, famine, natural disasters, or pandemics, the state's role in providing immediate relief and protection is crucial. This may involve deploying emergency services, providing humanitarian aid, and coordinating international assistance.\n\nTherefore, all three aspects\u2014preventing the state from becoming a source of insecurity, leveraging its resources and power to promote human security, and responding effectively to immediate crises\u2014are essential components of the state's role in achieving human security."
