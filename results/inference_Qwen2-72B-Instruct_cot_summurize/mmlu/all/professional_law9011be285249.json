The woman became suspicious and told the man that she wanted to engage an accounting firm to audit the agency's books. In a panic to prevent the audit and avoid being discovered, the man decided to have the woman killed. He contacted a professional killer and hired him to kill the woman for $10,000. A short time later, the woman died in a car crash arranged by the killer. In addition to embezzlement, of what crime or crimes may the man properly be convicted?\n\nA. Conspiracy and murder.\nB. Murder.\nC. Solicitation and conspiracy.\nD. Solicitation, conspiracy, and murder.\n"

Here's why:\n\n1. **Solicitation**: This charge arises when the man asked the professional killer to commit a crime (in this case, murder) on his behalf. The act of soliciting someone to commit a crime is itself a criminal offense.\n\n2. **Conspiracy**: The man and the professional killer agreed to commit a crime together, which is the definition of conspiracy. Even if the plan was not carried out, the agreement itself is sufficient for a conspiracy charge. However, in this scenario, the crime was indeed carried out.\n\n3. **Murder**: Since the woman died as a result of the actions taken pursuant to the man's solicitation and conspiracy, he can also be charged with murder. In many jurisdictions, the person who hires a hitman is equally culpable for the murder as the person who physically carries it out.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Solicitation, conspiracy, and murder."
