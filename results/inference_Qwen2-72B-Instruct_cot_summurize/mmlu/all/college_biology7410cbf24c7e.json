A moth exhibits nearly identical coloration to that of a stinging bee.\n\nIn Batesian mimicry, a harmless species (the mimic) evolves to imitate the warning signals of a harmful species (the model) to avoid predation. In this case, the moth is harmless but mimics the coloration of a stinging bee to deter potential predators."
