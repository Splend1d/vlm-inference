Tumours - Polyomaviruses such as SV40 and Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) have been linked to tumor development.\n\nD. Kidney infections - BK virus and JC virus, both polyomaviruses, can cause serious kidney infections in immunocompromised individuals, particularly transplant recipients.\n\nB. Brain pathology - JC virus is also responsible for causing progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), a brain disorder that occurs in immunocompromised individuals.\n\nC. No disease at all - This is not entirely true, as some polyomaviruses can remain latent or cause asymptomatic infections.\n\nGiven the options, A and D are the most accurate answers, depending on which aspect of polyomavirus disease you are considering. If we must choose one, A. Tumours, might be considered the predominant cause given the oncogenic potential of certain polyomaviruses. However, it's important to note that the specific disease caused by polyomaviruses can vary based on the virus type and the health status of the individual."
