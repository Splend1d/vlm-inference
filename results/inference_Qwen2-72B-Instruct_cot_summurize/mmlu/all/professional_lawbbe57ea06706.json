This is because the statute involves direct monetary support from the state to religious institutions (if any of the private schools are religious), which could be seen as an endorsement of religion by the government. The Supreme Court has generally held that government funding for religious schools violates the Establishment Clause unless it is part of a general program that provides benefits to a broad class of citizens on a neutral basis and does not result in governmental indoctrination or excessive entanglement with religion. Given that the statute specifically targets teacher salaries in private schools, including those that may be religiously affiliated, it might not meet these criteria and thus could be deemed unconstitutional."
