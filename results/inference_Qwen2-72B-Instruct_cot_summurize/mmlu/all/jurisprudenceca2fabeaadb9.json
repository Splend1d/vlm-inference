Hart's analysis of law, as presented in his influential work \"The Concept of Law,\" makes a significant distinction between being obliged (the social pressure to obey rules) and having an obligation (a legal duty enforced by the legal system). This distinction is part of Hart's broader theory that separates the \"is\" (descriptive facts about how laws are followed or enforced) from the \"ought\" (normative statements about what the law requires), which aligns with his critique of legal positivism and natural law theory."
