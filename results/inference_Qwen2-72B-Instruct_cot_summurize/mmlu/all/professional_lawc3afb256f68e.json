The first brother handed the deed to the second brother with instructions to take the deed to their lawyer for approval prior to delivery. Brother two, without his brother's permission, took the deed directly to the buyer and collected the sale price. Is this a good deed as to partner one?\n\nA. No, the deed cannot bind partner one because he did not participate in the deed delivery to the buyer and did not intend to deliver the deed up to the grantee at that time.\nB. Yes, the transfer is valid from both partners because partner two was partner one's apparent agent for purposes of delivering the deed.\nC. Yes, the deed was signed by both partners, which proved their intent to sell to buyer, and it was delivered at the time of signing by the fact of affixing their signatures to the document.\nD. No, the deed was invalid as to both grantors because partner two stepped outside his scope of authority.\n"

No, the deed cannot bind partner one because he did not participate in the deed delivery to the buyer and did not intend to deliver the deed up to the grantee at that time.\n\nIn property law, delivery of a deed is essential to its validity. Delivery must be actual, intentional, and voluntary. In this case, the first brother did not intend to deliver the deed to the buyer at that time, but rather instructed the second brother to take it to their lawyer for approval before any delivery. Since the first brother did not intend to deliver the deed and did not participate in the actual delivery, the deed is not valid as to him. The second brother's actions do not bind the first brother since they were outside the scope of any authority given to him by the first brother."
