Sexual objectification occurs. In her view, mutual denial of humanity means that both partners treat each other as mere objects for their own pleasure and use, rather than recognizing and respecting each other's personhood and dignity. This kind of treatment can lead to a dehumanizing dynamic in which both partners become complicit in reducing each other to mere objects of desire, thereby perpetuating a cycle of objectification."
