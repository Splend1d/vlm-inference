To find out where this corresponds in the debugger's address space, we subtract the start address of the text segment from the address of the load instruction: \n\n0x77E81234 - 0x77E80000 = 0x1234\n\nThen, we add this offset to the start address of the text segment in the debugger's virtual address space:\n\n0x01000000 + 0x1234 = 0x01001234\n\nThis means the debugger will use the virtual address 0x01001234 for its WRITE operation.\n\nAs for the mapping, the debugger needs to be able to modify the memory to set breakpoints, so it must have WRITE access to the page. The debugger could use a private copy-on-write mapping or a shared read/write mapping, but the former is more common because it allows the debugger to modify the memory without affecting the original process.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. 0x01001234; page mapped with READ/WRITE access\n\nHowever, if we consider the common practice of using copy-on-write for debugging purposes, the answer could also be interpreted as:\n\nB. 0x01001234; page mapped with COPY-ON-WRITE access\n\nBut based on the given options and the need for the debugger to write to the memory, option A is the most straightforward choice assuming the question implies the debugger has direct write access rather than a copy-on-write scheme."
