So, 3 quarts is equal to \\(3 \\times 4 = 12\\) cups.\n\nThe ratio of 2 cups to 12 cups can be written as \\(\\frac{2}{12}\\).\n\nThis fraction can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD), which is 2.\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{12} = \\frac{2 \\div 2}{12 \\div 2} = \\frac{1}{6}\n\\]\n\nSo, the answer is D. 1 over 6."
