As F increases, it indicates more inbreeding has occurred within a population, leading to an increase in homozygosity and a decrease in heterozygosity. This is because inbreeding increases the chances that individuals will inherit identical alleles from both parents, which can lead to a reduction in genetic diversity and an increase in the expression of deleterious recessive traits. The other options do not directly relate to changes in the inbreeding coefficient."
