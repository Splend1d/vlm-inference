The other options are considerations in determining whether an action is a regulation or a taking under the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. A taking occurs when the government physically appropriates private property or substantially interferes with its use, denying all economically viable use of the property. A regulation, on the other hand, is a restriction on the use of property that does not go so far as to deny all economically viable use."
