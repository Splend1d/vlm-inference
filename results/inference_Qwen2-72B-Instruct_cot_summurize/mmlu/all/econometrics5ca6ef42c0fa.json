However, the estimator is not **efficient**. Efficiency refers to the fact that the variance of the estimator is as small as possible among all unbiased estimators. In the case of multicollinearity, the variances of the estimated coefficients tend to be large, making the estimates less precise and potentially unstable.\n\nThus, the correct answer is **B. It will be consistent and unbiased but not efficient**."
