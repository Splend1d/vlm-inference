Over 75% of respondents said that if they had it to do over again, they would not have children. The columnist concludes that most parents are sorry that they had children. For which of the following reasons is her conclusion not valid?\n\nA. Her participants were not randomly assigned in her study.\nB. The number of respondents from across the country was too small.\nC. The study was not replicated.\nD. Her sample may not have been representative of the population.\n"

Her sample may not have been representative of the population.\n\nThe conclusion drawn by the advice columnist is not necessarily valid because the sample of people who responded to the column may not be representative of all parents in the United States. People who have strong feelings about regretting having children might be more likely to respond to such a column than those who feel differently, leading to a biased sample. Additionally, the method of collecting data (responses to a newspaper column) may attract a particular demographic that does not reflect the broader population of parents. Without a random and representative sample, the results cannot be generalized to all parents."
