Soap operas often feature complex female characters who navigate various social, professional, and personal challenges, which can resonate with a predominantly female audience. These shows frequently explore themes related to family, relationships, career, and personal growth, offering representations of women in diverse roles and situations. While options A and D may also be true to some extent, it is the portrayal of women as multifaceted characters that most strongly supports the classification of soap operas as a feminine genre. Option C is not accurate, as soap operas are typically designed to engage and entertain a female audience rather than alienate them."
