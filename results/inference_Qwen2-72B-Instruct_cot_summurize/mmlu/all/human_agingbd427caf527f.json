FBL Financial Services, Inc. that older workers do not have to prove that age was the sole reason for an adverse employment action. However, they still must show that age was a \"motivating factor\" in the decision, which is a lower standard than proving intentional discrimination. This ruling applies to cases brought under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA)."
