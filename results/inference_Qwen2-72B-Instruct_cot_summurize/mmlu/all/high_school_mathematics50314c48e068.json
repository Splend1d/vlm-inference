All dice show a 1.\n2. Four dice show a 1, and one die shows a prime number (2, 3, or 5).\n\nLet's calculate these probabilities:\n\n**Case 1: All dice show a 1**\n- Probability = \\( \\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\right)^5 = \\frac{1}{7776} \\)\n\n**Case 2: Four dice show a 1, and one die shows a prime number (2, 3, or 5)**\n- There are three choices for which prime number appears (2, 3, or 5), and five choices for which die shows this prime number.\n- Probability for any given prime number appearing on any given die = \\( \\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\right)^4 * \\frac{1}{2} \\) because there's a \\(\\frac{1}{6}\\) chance of getting a 1 on the four dice showing 1s and a \\(\\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{1}{2}\\) chance of getting a prime number (2, 3, or 5) on the remaining die.\n- Total probability for Case 2 = \\( 3 * 5 * \\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\right)^4 * \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{15}{7776} \\)\n\nThus, the total probability that the product is not composite is:\n\\[ \\frac{1}{7776} + \\frac{15}{7776} = \\frac{16}{7776} \\]\n\nThe probability that the product is composite is therefore the complement of this:\n\\[ 1 - \\frac{16}{7776} = \\frac{7776}{7776} - \\frac{16}{7776} = \\frac{7760}{7776} \\]\n\nSimplifying \\(\\frac{7760}{7776}\\):\n\\[ \\frac{7760}{7776} = \\frac{485}{486} \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **A. \\(\\frac{485}{486}\\)**."
