The associate notes the number of customers whose names begin with A and uses a random number table to pick four of these names. She then proceeds to use the same procedure for each letter of the alphabet and combines the 4 \u00d7 26 = 104 results into a group to be contacted. Which of the following is a correct conclusion?\n\nA. Her procedure makes use of chance.\nB. Her procedure results in a simple random sample.\nC. Each customer has an equal probability of being included in the survey.\nD. Her procedure introduces bias through sampling error.\n"

However, this does not necessarily mean that her procedure results in a simple random sample (option B) because not every customer has an equal chance of being selected. Only those customers whose names begin with a specific letter have a chance of being selected when that letter's turn comes up. Furthermore, option D is incorrect because sampling error is not a form of bias; it refers to the natural variability that occurs when you take a sample from a population. Therefore, the correct answer is A."
