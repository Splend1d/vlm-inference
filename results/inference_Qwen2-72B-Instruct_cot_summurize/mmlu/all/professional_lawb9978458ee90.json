There is a right to Miranda warnings.\n\nMiranda warnings are typically required when a person is being interrogated by law enforcement while in custody, but they are not a feature of grand jury proceedings. A person who appears before a grand jury does not have the right to be read their Miranda rights, as they are not considered to be in custody and the purpose of the grand jury is to gather evidence, not to interrogate suspects. However, witnesses do have the right to an attorney, although the attorney cannot accompany them into the grand jury room. Additionally, grand jury proceedings are conducted in secret, there is no right to have evidence excluded, and there is no judge present."
