To provide housing for all those homeless within a state\n\nWhile the state does have certain obligations regarding social and economic rights, including the right to housing, the European Court of Human Rights has not established an absolute positive obligation on states to provide housing for all homeless individuals. The court generally focuses on more direct and immediate issues of life, liberty, and security, rather than broader social welfare provisions. However, this does not mean that the state has no responsibility in this area; it simply means that the obligation is not framed as an absolute requirement under the European Convention on Human Rights."
