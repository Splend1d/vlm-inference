Wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn Scenario 1, poking holes in all the condoms at the drugstore is clearly morally wrong because it endangers people's health and well-being by potentially leading to unwanted pregnancies and the spread of sexually transmitted infections.\n\nIn Scenario 2, biting into cooked animal flesh, while some may find it morally questionable or disagree with eating meat for ethical reasons, is not considered clearly morally wrong by ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. Consuming meat is a common dietary choice and is not universally condemned as a moral failing."
