His symptoms began during the first hour of full-contact football practice in full uniform. He reported feeling weak and faint but did not lose consciousness. He vomited once after drinking water. On arrival, he is diaphoretic. He is not oriented to person, place, or time. His temperature is 39.5\u00b0C (103.1\u00b0F), pulse is 120/min, respirations are 40/min, and blood pressure is 90/65 mm Hg. Examination, including neurologic examination, shows no other abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?\n\nA. Obtain a CT scan of the head\nB. Administer sodium chloride tablets\nC. Administer intravenous fluids\nD. Immerse the patient in an ice water bath\n"

Immerse the patient in an ice water bath.\n\nThis patient's presentation is consistent with heat stroke, a medical emergency characterized by high body temperature (>40\u00b0C or 104\u00b0F) and altered mental status. The priority in managing heat stroke is rapid cooling to prevent permanent organ damage and potentially death. Immersion in an ice water bath is the most effective method for rapidly reducing core body temperature.\n\nWhile the other options may be considered in different clinical scenarios:\n\nA. A CT scan of the head might be indicated if there were signs of trauma or neurological deficits that suggest intracranial pathology, but it is not the immediate priority in treating heat stroke.\nB. Administering sodium chloride tablets would not address the primary issue of hyperthermia and could exacerbate dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.\nC. Administering intravenous fluids is important for rehydration and maintaining blood pressure in cases of heat stroke, but it should be done concurrently with cooling measures rather than as the initial intervention."
