The concept of companies being \"boundaryless\" refers to the idea that they often operate across various jurisdictions and contexts without clear physical or legal boundaries. This makes it challenging to control information because data can easily flow across these undefined borders. Additionally, much corporate activity does take place in private spaces, which complicates matters further when trying to enforce privacy policies."
