Nussbaum advocates for a version of virtue ethics that is influenced by Aristotle but updated for modern times. She argues for a form of universal humanism that is sensitive to cultural differences and particular contexts. Some critics might see her approach as leaning toward relativism because she emphasizes the importance of understanding and respecting different cultural perspectives. However, Nussbaum herself would likely argue that her position is not truly relativistic since she maintains that there are certain universal human capabilities and values that should be respected across cultures."
