If we assume that \"at its peak\" refers to the time when support for school desegregation was highest in the more supportive region (likely the North or West), then we're looking for the difference in approval rates between this region and the South.\n\nHistorically, support for school desegregation has been significantly lower in the South compared to other regions of the United States due to the legacy of slavery, Jim Crow laws, and deeply ingrained racial prejudices. During the Civil Rights Movement, which peaked in the 1960s, there were stark differences in public opinion regarding desegregation across different parts of the country.\n\nGiven the options provided:\n\nA. 80% would imply that the approval rate in one region was 80 percentage points higher than in the other.\nB. 40% would imply that the approval rate in one region was 40 percentage points higher than in the other.\nC. -40% and D. -80% suggest negative differences, which do not make sense in this context because you cannot have a negative difference in approval ratings.\n\nThe correct answer would likely be either A or B, depending on the specific historical data. Without exact figures, it's difficult to provide an exact answer, but given the history of resistance to desegregation in the South, a difference of 40% (option B) seems plausible as a peak difference. However, during certain times and under certain circumstances, the difference could have been larger, possibly approaching 80%. \n\nFor example, according to a 1956 Gallup poll, 73% of Southerners opposed the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Brown v. Board of Education, while only 22% approved, indicating a strong regional divide. In contrast, a majority of people in the North supported the decision. Therefore, at its peak, the difference in approval could have been closer to 80 percentage points, making option A potentially correct. However, without more specific historical data, it's impossible to determine with certainty whether the difference was closer to 40% or 80%. \n\nIn summary, both B and A could be considered correct based on historical context, but if forced to choose one without additional information, A (80%) might represent the maximum possible difference in approval rates at the height of resistance to desegregation efforts."
