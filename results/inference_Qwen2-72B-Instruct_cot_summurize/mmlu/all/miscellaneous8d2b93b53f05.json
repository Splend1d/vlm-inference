Said\n\nThe word \"said\" cannot be fully decoded through knowledge of standard letter-sound relationships because the \"s\" and \"d\" do not represent their typical sounds when spoken in this word. In most other English words, the letter \"s\" represents the /s/ sound and the letter \"d\" represents the /d/ sound, but in \"said,\" the \"s\" represents a /z/ sound and the \"d\" is silent, resulting in the pronunciation /s\u025bd/. This irregular pronunciation makes it an exception to the general rules of phonics."
