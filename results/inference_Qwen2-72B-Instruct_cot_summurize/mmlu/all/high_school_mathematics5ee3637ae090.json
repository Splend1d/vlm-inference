                    "text": "Let's break down the information given to find the cost per unit of volume for Glow.\n\nFirst, we know that Fresh costs $1.00 per unit of volume.\n\n### Step 1: Determine Bright's Cost per Unit Volume\n\nBright is $60\\%$ more expensive than Fresh. If Fresh costs $1.00 per unit of volume, then Bright costs $1.00 + 0.60 \\times 1.00 = \\$1.60$ per unit of volume.\n\n### Step 2: Determine Bright's Volume Relative to Glow\n\nBright has $25\\%$ less volume than Glow. Let's denote the volume of Glow as $V_{Glow}$ units. Then, the volume of Bright would be $V_{Glow} - 0.25V_{Glow} = 0.75V_{Glow}$ units.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate Glow's Cost per Unit Volume Based on Bright's Information\n\nGiven that Bright costs $\\$1.60$ per unit of volume and its volume is $0.75V_{Glow}$, the total cost of Bright is $1.60 \\times 0.75V_{Glow}$. However, since Glow has more volume for the same price, we can calculate the cost of Glow based on this information.\n\nSince Bright's total cost for $0.75V_{Glow}$ is equal to Glow's total cost for $V_{Glow}$, we can set up the equation:\n\n\\[1.60 \\times 0.75V_{Glow} = C_{Glow} \\times V_{Glow}\\]\n\nSolving for $C_{Glow}$ (cost of Glow per unit volume), we get:\n\n\\[C_{Glow} = 1.60 \\times 0.75 = \\$1.20\\]\n\nThis means Glow costs $\\$1.20$ per unit of volume.\n\n### Step 4: Confirm with Glow's Information About Fresh\n\nGlow is $25\\%$ less expensive than Bright. Since Bright costs $\\$1.60$ per unit of volume, Glow should cost $1.60 - 0.25 \\times 1.60 = \\$1.20$ per unit of volume, which confirms our calculation.\n\n### Step 5: Convert to Cents\n\nSince we found that Glow costs $\\$1.20$ per unit of volume, converting this to cents gives us:\n\n\\[1.20 \\times 100 = 120\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of cents per unit of volume of Glow is **120 cents**. The correct answer is **B. 120**."
