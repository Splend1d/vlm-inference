By measuring the mass-to-charge ratio of ions, mass spectrometry provides information about the atomic mass of elements, which includes the masses of different isotopes. This technique is crucial in understanding isotopic compositions and variations in natural samples, as well as in forensic science, environmental analysis, and many other fields. While mass spectrometry can provide some insights into ionization energies and oxidation states under certain conditions, its primary utility lies in elucidating the isotopic composition of elements."
