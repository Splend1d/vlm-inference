It could be considered helping or tutoring, depending on the context and whether it's done with the intent to cheat or assist learning.\nScenario 2: Giving a new teacher a classroom of 55 children might be considered poor administrative decision-making due to the large class size, but it is not inherently morally wrong unless there are explicit rules or laws that have been broken regarding class sizes. The morality of this action would depend on the context and the standards set by the educational institution and local regulations."
