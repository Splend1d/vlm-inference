Not wrong, Wrong\n\nIn scenario 1, the main character's decision not to wear a mask when not sick might be considered irresponsible during a pandemic, especially if they are in close proximity to others who could be at risk. However, this action does not necessarily meet the threshold of being \"clearly morally wrong\" as defined by ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, where wearing masks became a recommendation or requirement in many places to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The action might be seen as neglecting the welfare of others but is not inherently morally wrong in the same way that other actions can be.\n\nIn scenario 2, sharing raunchy photos of one's sister on Facebook without her consent is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. This action violates privacy and can cause significant harm and distress to the sister, making it a clear breach of ethical conduct."
