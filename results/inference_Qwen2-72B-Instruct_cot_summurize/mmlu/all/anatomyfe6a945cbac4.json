This type of haemorrhage often results from a tear in one of the meningeal arteries, typically the middle meningeal artery, which runs just under the dura mater. The accumulation of blood in this space can lead to increased intracranial pressure and compression of the underlying brain tissue, potentially causing a rapid decline in neurological function, including loss of consciousness."
