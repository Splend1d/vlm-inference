                    "text": "When the scale reads less than the person's usual weight, it means that the person is experiencing less normal force from the scale. This occurs when there is a downward acceleration. \n\nIn physics, the apparent weight of a person in an elevator can be described by Newton's Second Law, F=ma, where F is the net force acting on the person (the difference between the normal force exerted by the scale and the gravitational force), m is the mass of the person, and a is the acceleration. When the elevator accelerates downward, the effective force of gravity decreases, resulting in a reduced normal force and a lower scale reading.\n\nTherefore, the possible motions of the elevator that would result in a lower scale reading are:\n\n- The elevator is accelerating downward (moving downward and speeding up or moving upward and slowing down).\n\nThus, the correct answer is B. It is moving upward and slowing down. This situation creates an apparent decrease in weight as the elevator decelerates against the direction of gravity."
