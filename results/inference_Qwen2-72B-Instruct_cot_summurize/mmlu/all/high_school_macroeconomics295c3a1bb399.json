                    "text": "The correct answer is C. Buying Treasury securities from commercial banks.\n\nExpansionary monetary policy is designed to increase the money supply and stimulate economic growth. When the Federal Reserve buys Treasury securities from commercial banks, it increases the amount of reserves that banks have on hand, allowing them to lend more money and create more credit in the economy. This action leads to an increase in the money supply and can help to lower interest rates, making borrowing cheaper and encouraging spending and investment.\n\nIncreasing the discount rate (option A) or increasing the reserve ratio (option B) would actually be examples of contractionary monetary policy, as they would decrease the money supply and make it harder for banks to lend money. Lowering income taxes (option D) is not a monetary policy tool but rather a fiscal policy tool used by the government to stimulate the economy by increasing disposable income for households."
