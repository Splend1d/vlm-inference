In Scenario 1, laughing at a child who is on fire shows a lack of empathy and a failure to help someone in grave danger, which is morally reprehensible. In Scenario 2, binding someone's ankle to prevent them from leaving can be considered an act of restraint or kidnapping, depending on the context, which is also morally wrong unless it is done with legal authority and for a justifiable reason, such as preventing immediate harm to others. However, without additional context suggesting such justification, the action is considered wrong."
