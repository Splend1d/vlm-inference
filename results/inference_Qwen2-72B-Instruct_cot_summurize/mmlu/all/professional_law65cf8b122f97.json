Although the agreement worked well at 1,000 watches per month, the manufacturer expanded its plant capacity and produced 2500 watches per month. The wholesaler could no longer pay for that volume of watches. The manufacturer sued the wholesaler to compel it to buy its full output each month as required by the contract. will the court likely grant the manufacturer's request?\n\nA. No, because the expansion is a disproportionate increase in product that exceeds contractual estimates and cannot be handled by the buyer.\nB. Yes, because doubling the size of the output contract is not unreasonable and is only 500 more the top estimated limit.\nC. Yes, a doubling of the output contract in these circumstances meets a good faith standard and is reasonable.\nD. No, because a change of more than 10% is considered to be unreasonable and the basis for a breach of contract.\n"

By increasing production to 2500 watches per month, the manufacturer has exceeded this range significantly. This disproportionate increase in production volume goes beyond what was agreed upon and can be seen as a breach of the contract. The wholesaler would likely not be compelled to buy the additional watches, as they did not agree to such a large increase in volume. The court would consider whether the increase was within the bounds of what could reasonably be expected under the terms of the contract, and in this case, it clearly was not."
