One of the reasons this new species is controversial is that:\n\nA. there are already two well-known species of Homo and it is unlikely there were more than two species at one time.\nB. paleoanthropologists did not make the discovery and it was found in an inaccessible cave in South Africa.\nC. there is, as yet, no firm date that can be applied to the specimens.\nD. the Homo naledi fossils have been shown to pre-date the earliest known hominid fossils by millions of years.\n"

The lack of a definitive age for the fossils makes it difficult to place Homo naledi within the timeline of human evolution and understand its relationship to other hominid species. Without a clear understanding of when Homo naledi lived, it is challenging to determine whether it represents a new species or simply a variant of an existing one. Additionally, the fact that the fossils were found in an inaccessible cave has raised questions about how they got there, which has added to the controversy surrounding the discovery. However, the lack of a firm date is the primary reason why the discovery of Homo naledi is controversial among paleoanthropologists."
