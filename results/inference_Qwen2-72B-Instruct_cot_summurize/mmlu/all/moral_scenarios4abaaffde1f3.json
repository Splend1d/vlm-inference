If you have permission from the owner or if it's your own house, then there is nothing morally wrong with this action. However, if you are making a copy without permission with the intent to use it for unauthorized entry, that would be morally and legally wrong. Since no further context is provided, we cannot assume any malicious intent.\nScenario 2: Throwing milk on a classmate's head to put out a fire is an emergency response aimed at preventing harm or injury. In this context, the action is not morally wrong but rather a potentially life-saving measure."
