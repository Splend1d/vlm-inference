Category B agents are those that present little to no risk or morbidity within infected populations, but can have detrimental effects on the ability of a group to perform physical tasks.\nB. Unlike Category A agents, B agents refer to emerging security threats which have the potential to be utilised as biological weapons after further development.\nC. Category B agents include food and water security threats, with moderate morbidity rates.\nD. Category B agents are characterised by high mortality rates and include agents which are difficult to treat medically.\n"

According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Category B agents include those that could be disseminated through food or water and cause moderate morbidity rates. They also include agents that may be moderately easy to disseminate or manufacture and have potential for high impact but are less contagious than Category A agents. These agents would not result in high mortality but have the potential to cause public panic and social disruption. Examples of Category B agents include Brucella species, Burkholderia mallei, and Shigella dysenteriae type 1. Options A and D are incorrect because they describe characteristics that do not fit the definition of Category B agents. Option B is partially correct but does not fully capture the definition of Category B agents."
