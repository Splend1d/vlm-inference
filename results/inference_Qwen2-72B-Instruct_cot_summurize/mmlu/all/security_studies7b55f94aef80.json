Critical questioning.\n\nCritical questioning in security studies often challenges traditional interpretations by questioning underlying assumptions, exploring new perspectives, and considering non-traditional threats such as environmental, economic, or societal issues. This approach moves away from the state-centric and realist logic that has dominated much of traditional security studies, which focuses on military power, interstate conflict, and the balance of power among states. However, it is worth noting that B and C are not moves away from traditional interpretations; they are actually representative of traditional security studies. So, strictly speaking, only option A represents a move away from traditional interpretations of security studies. If the question were asking for elements that have contributed to expanding or redefining the field of security studies beyond its traditional confines, then additional options might be considered relevant as well."
