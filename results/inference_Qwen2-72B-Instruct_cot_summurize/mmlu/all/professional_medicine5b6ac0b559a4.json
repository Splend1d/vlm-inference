He is receiving intravenous 5% dextrose and 0.45% saline with potassium. Twelve hours after the operation he develops circumoral numbness and paresthesias in his fingertips, and he becomes very anxious. Vital signs are temperature 37.6\u00b0C (99.7\u00b0F), pulse 90/min, respirations 16/min, and blood pressure 140/90 mm Hg. Physical examination discloses a dry neck dressing and no stridor. Extremities are warm, with brisk capillary refill time. Additional physical examination is most likely to show which of the following?\n\nA. Babinski sign present bilaterally\nB. Chvostek sign\nC. Deviation of the tongue to the left side\nD. A drooping left shoulder\n"

The physical examination finding that would be most consistent with this diagnosis is the Chvostek sign, which is an involuntary twitching of the facial muscles when the facial nerve is tapped. This sign is elicited by tapping over the facial nerve in front of the ear, and it is positive in patients with hypocalcemia. Therefore, the answer is B. Chvostek sign. \n\nA Babinski sign indicates upper motor neuron disease, which is unlikely in this scenario. Deviation of the tongue to one side may indicate a lesion in the cranial nerves responsible for tongue movement, but this is not related to the patient's current presentation. A drooping shoulder could indicate injury to the brachial plexus, but again, this is not related to the patient's current presentation."
