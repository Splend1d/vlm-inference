These individuals are behind a \"veil of ignorance,\" which means they do not know any specific details about themselves, including their social status, abilities, or personal values. This ensures that the principles chosen are fair and impartial. The purpose of this original contract is to establish the principles of justice that will define the basic structure of society, such as how rights, duties, and social and economic inequalities are to be distributed among its members."
