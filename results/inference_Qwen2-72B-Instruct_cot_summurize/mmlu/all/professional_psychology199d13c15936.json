However, this idea is largely unsupported by research, which has shown that engaging in aggressive behavior often leads to further aggression rather than reducing it.\n\nIt's important to note that while options B, C, and D describe different theories or factors related to aggression, they are not directly related to the Catharsis Theory. Option B describes the Heat Hypothesis, Option C refers to the Deindividuation Theory, and Option D relates to the influence of social roles on behavior, such as in the context of the Stanford Prison Experiment."
