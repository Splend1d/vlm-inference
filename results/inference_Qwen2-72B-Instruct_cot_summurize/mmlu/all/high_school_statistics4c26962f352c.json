Since the weight of each player is an independent random variable, we can use this property to find the variance and standard deviation of W.\n\nGiven that the average weight of a player is 248 pounds with a standard deviation of 47 pounds, we can calculate the variance of the weight of one player as \\( \\sigma^2 = 47^2 = 2209 \\) pounds squared.\n\nIf we select four players at random, the expected value of the total combined weight (W) is indeed 4 times the expected weight of one player, which is \\( 4 \\times 248 = 992 \\) pounds, as given.\n\nTo find the variance of W, we sum the variances of the weights of the four players:\n\\[ \\text{Var}(W) = 4 \\times \\text{Var}(\\text{Weight of one player}) = 4 \\times 2209 = 8836 \\]\n\nNow, to find the standard deviation of W, we take the square root of its variance:\n\\[ \\sigma_W = \\sqrt{8836} \\approx 94 \\]\n\nTherefore, the standard deviation of W, the total combined weight of the four players, is approximately 94 pounds.\n\nThe correct answer is C. 94 pounds."
