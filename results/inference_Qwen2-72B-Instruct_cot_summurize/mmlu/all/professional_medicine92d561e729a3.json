Six weeks ago, she received a kidney transplant from a living, related donor. Immediately after the operation, she received monoclonal anti-CD3 therapy. Current medications are azathioprine, cyclosporine, and prednisone. Her temperature is 39\u00b0C (102.2\u00b0F). Physical examination shows a well-healed surgical scar. Serum studies show that her urea nitrogen and creatinine concentrations have tripled. A diagnosis of allograft rejection is suspected. In addition, this patient's clinical presentation is best explained by an infection with which of the following agents?\n\nA. Adenovirus\nB. BK virus\nC. Epstein-Barr virus\nD. Herpes simplex virus\n"

BK virus is a polyomavirus that can cause serious complications in immunocompromised patients, such as those who have undergone organ transplantation. The virus can reactivate from latency and cause nephropathy or hemorrhagic cystitis in these individuals. The combination of cold-like symptoms, fever, and the sudden increase in urea nitrogen and creatinine levels, along with her recent kidney transplant and immunosuppressive therapy, points towards a BK virus infection affecting the transplanted kidney."
