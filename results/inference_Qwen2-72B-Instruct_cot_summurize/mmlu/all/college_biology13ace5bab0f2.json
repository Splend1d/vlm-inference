The starch granules are small enough to enter the lower airways and trigger an asthmatic attack. If this theory is true, which of the following is a correct statement?\n\nA. The interior of the pollen grains was hypotonic compared to the surrounding environment.\nB. The interior of the pollen grains had a higher osmotic pressure than did the surrounding environment.\nC. The pollen grains underwent plasmolysis prior to releasing their contents.\nD. The pollen grains underwent shrinking before they ruptured and released their contents.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is B. The interior of the pollen grains had a higher osmotic pressure than did the surrounding environment.\n\nExplanation: When pollen grains come into contact with water during a thunderstorm, they absorb water due to the higher solute concentration inside the pollen grains (i.e., they have a higher osmotic pressure). This causes an influx of water by osmosis, leading to osmotic shock. The sudden increase in volume can cause the pollen grains to rupture, releasing their contents, including starch granules, which can then be inhaled and potentially trigger asthma attacks in susceptible individuals."
