While aging can affect all of the options listed, research has shown that the processing speed of the brain tends to slow down as people age, which can impact reaction times and cognitive functions. This is due to various factors including the gradual loss of neurons, changes in neurotransmitter systems, and reduced efficiency of neural communication."
