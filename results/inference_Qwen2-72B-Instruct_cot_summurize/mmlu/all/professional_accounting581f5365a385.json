As an increase in accumulated depreciation of $40000.\n\nWhen correcting errors from prior periods, the correction is made directly to the account affected by the error. In this case, the error relates to depreciation expense, which affects the accumulated depreciation account. Since the depreciation was not recorded at all in the prior year, the company needs to adjust the accumulated depreciation account to reflect the missing $40000. This adjustment would be reflected on the balance sheet, not the income statement, so it does not affect the current year's depreciation expense or income taxes. However, since the tax effect of the error was already accounted for in previous tax filings (as the depreciation was correctly claimed for tax purposes), there would be no additional tax impact from correcting the error in the financial statements. \n\nThe entry to correct the error would be:\n\nDebit: Accumulated Depreciation $40,000\nCredit: Prior Period Adjustment (Retained Earnings) $40,000\n\nThis entry reflects the fact that the building has been depreciating over time, even though the depreciation wasn't recorded in the financial statements. By adjusting the accumulated depreciation, the carrying value of the asset on the balance sheet will be corrected to more accurately reflect its net book value."
