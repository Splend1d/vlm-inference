The professor was recently involved in a highly visible political protest against the government. The police eventually shut down the protest because they felt that it was becoming unruly. A television crew covered the entire rally. On the six o'clock news that evening, the film of the protest rally was shown during the broadcast. A news anchorman then made the following commentary: \"It's a shame that public funds are spent to pay the salaries of such university professors, who are not grateful for what this country has done for them. In my opinion, these people like the professor should be deported. \"If the professor asserts a claim based on invasion of privacy against the television station and the anchorman for his television commentary, the most likely result is that the professor will\n\nA. not prevail, because the criticism was not directed at the professor personally.\nB. not prevail, because the broadcast was privileged as being in the public interest.\nC. prevail, because the professor, as a private individual, was placed in a false light.\nD. prevail, because the comments were made with actual malice.\n"

The anchorman's commentary, although critical and potentially offensive, was part of a news broadcast covering a matter of public interest\u2014the political protest. The First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution protects freedom of speech, including criticism of public figures and matters of public concern. In cases involving public figures or matters of public interest, the standard for proving an invasion of privacy or defamation is higher, requiring proof of actual malice\u2014meaning the speaker knew the statement was false or acted with reckless disregard for the truth.\n\nIn this case, the anchorman's statements, while harsh, did not contain any false information about the professor. They were an expression of opinion regarding the professor's actions and their impact on public funds and the community. Since the professor is involved in a matter of public interest (the protest) and is arguably a public figure due to his role as a critic of foreign policy, he would have to prove actual malice to succeed in an invasion of privacy claim, which is unlikely given the circumstances described."
