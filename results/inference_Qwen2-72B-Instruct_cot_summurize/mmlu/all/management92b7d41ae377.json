Routine and non-complex\n\nProgrammed decisions are those that are made repeatedly in the same or similar situations, and they follow established rules and procedures. They are routine, predictable, and involve little uncertainty or complexity. Programmed decisions are often delegated to lower-level managers or automated through technology because they do not require significant judgment or analysis. Examples of programmed decisions include approving time-off requests, processing invoices, or following a standard operating procedure."
