                    "text": "To manipulate the reaction in favor of creating more product (PCl5), we can use Le Chatelier's principle, which states that if a dynamic equilibrium is disturbed by changing the conditions, the position of equilibrium moves to counteract the change.\n\nThe given reaction is:\n\\[ \\text{PCl}_3(g) + \\text{Cl}_2(g) \\leftrightarrow \\text{PCl}_5(g) \\]\nwith \\( \\Delta H = -92.5 \\, \\text{kJ/mol} \\).\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Decreasing the concentration of PCl3: This would shift the equilibrium to the left, producing more reactants rather than more products. Thus, this does not help in increasing the production of PCl5.\n\nB. Increasing the pressure: Since there are 2 moles of gas on the reactant side and 1 mole of gas on the product side, increasing the pressure will shift the equilibrium towards the side with fewer moles of gas to relieve the stress of increased pressure. Therefore, increasing the pressure will shift the equilibrium to the right, favoring the formation of more PCl5.\n\nC. Increasing the temperature: The reaction is exothermic (\\( \\Delta H < 0 \\)), meaning it releases heat. According to Le Chatelier's principle, increasing the temperature will shift the equilibrium in the direction that absorbs heat, which is towards the left in this case. So, increasing the temperature will decrease the amount of PCl5 formed.\n\nD. None of the above: This option is incorrect based on the analysis above.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. Increasing the pressure."
