And although I have a farm of 50 acres close to the town, no doubt the crops and premises would have been destroyed. In fact, this has already partly been the case, and I am now suing the Government for damages done by a contingent of 1,500 natives that have recently encamped not many hundred yards from the place, who have done much damage all around.\"\nLetter from a British citizen to his sister during the Anglo-Zulu War, South Africa, 1879\nThe inclusion of the author's pending litigation with the British government serves to do which of the following?\n\nA. Highlight the extent of the author's property losses\nB. Express his opposition to the ongoing war\nC. Belittle British officials\nD. Place blame on both his home country as well as the Zulus\n"

It also suggests that the British authorities may not be adequately protecting or compensating their citizens for losses incurred during the conflict."
