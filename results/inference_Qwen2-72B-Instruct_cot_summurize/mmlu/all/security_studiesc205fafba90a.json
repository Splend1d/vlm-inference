Security studies has always favoured a wide range of subjects when considering the field of security. Different types of security, most notably of human security and economic security, have enjoyed a great deal of attention in traditional security studies, alongside military security. After the Cold War this approach was broadened to include other types of security such as environmental and personal security.\nB. Military security has emerged since the Cold War as the dominant sector within security analysis; both scholars and practitioners recognise the paramount importance of pursuing military security, based on the idea that military capabilities pose the greatest threat to human and state survival.\nC. Prior to the Cold War the focus of security studies lay in the military sector, although environmental security was rapidly emerging as a serious threat to security, forcing analysts to reconsider the state-centric frameworks they had previously employed.\nD. During the Cold War most security analysts agreed that military security should be the focus of security studies; as a result, there was not much discussion about what security entailed, other than the military sector. Following this period security studies have been broadened to include the wider range of sectors that we see today, including environmental and political security.\n"

Initially, security studies were dominated by military concerns due to the intense geopolitical rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union. However, after the end of the Cold War, the scope of security studies expanded to encompass non-military threats such as environmental degradation, economic instability, and personal safety. This broader understanding of security recognizes that threats to human and state survival can come from various sources beyond military confrontation."
