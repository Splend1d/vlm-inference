Issues management\n\nIssues management in public relations is the area that deals with identifying, assessing, and addressing emerging issues that could potentially affect an organization's reputation or operations. It involves monitoring trends, anticipating potential problems, and developing strategies to mitigate negative impacts before they escalate into full-blown crises. Issues management is proactive and focuses on long-term implications rather than immediate crisis response."
