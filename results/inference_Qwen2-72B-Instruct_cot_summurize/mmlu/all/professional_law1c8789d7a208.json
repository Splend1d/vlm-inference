The court will allow the records because they were kept in the ordinary course of business.\nB. The court will require a greater foundation to establish the reliability of the records.\nC. The court will dismiss the hearsay objection because the defendant, who is the declarant, is available in court.\nD. The court will allow the records because they are the product of a reliable computer process of data collection.\n"

The court will require a greater foundation to establish the reliability of the records.\n\nWhile it's true that records kept in the ordinary course of business can be admissible under the hearsay exception (as stated in Federal Rule of Evidence 803(6) or similar state rules), the defendant's testimony alone that the records were kept on a regular business basis is insufficient. The rule requires that a witness with knowledge testify about the record-keeping system and its regularity, and that the records were made at or near the time of the event by someone with knowledge of the event or from information transmitted by such a person. The court may also want assurances that the computer system was functioning properly and that there were adequate controls in place to ensure the accuracy and integrity of the data entered and stored. Without this additional foundation, the records may not be deemed sufficiently reliable for admission."
