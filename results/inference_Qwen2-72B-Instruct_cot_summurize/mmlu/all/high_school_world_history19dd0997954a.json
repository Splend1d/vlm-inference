He knew that the Russian troops could reach the southern tip of Korea before American troops could arrive. He also knew that the Russians were on the verge of moving into Korea, or were already there. The nearest American troops to Korea were on Okinawa, 600 miles away. His problem, therefore, was to compose a surrender arrangement which, while acceptable to the Russians, would at the same time prevent them from seizing all of Korea. If they refused to confine their advance to north Korea, the United States would be unable to stop them. . . . He decided to use the 38th parallel as a hypothetical line dividing the zones within which Japanese forces in Korea would surrender to appointed American and Russian authorities.\n\u2014Adapted from U.S. Army Lt. Paul C. McGrath's account of Colonel Bonesteel's decision in the 1940s\nWhich U.S. cold war policy, developed later, is consistent with the U.S. concern over limiting how much Korean territory the Soviet Union would occupy?\n\nA.

Containment\n\nContainment was the strategy used by the United States to prevent the spread of communism during the Cold War. This policy was articulated by George F. Kennan in 1947 and was based on the idea of containing the influence of the Soviet Union and preventing it from expanding its control to other countries. The decision by Colonel Bonesteel to use the 38th parallel as a division line for the surrender of Japanese forces in Korea was an early application of this containment policy, aiming to limit Soviet influence in the region."
