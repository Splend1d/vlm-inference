Revelations that the NSA was monitoring the communications of American citizens without obtaining warrants\n\nIn 2005, it was revealed that the National Security Agency (NSA) had been conducting warrantless surveillance on American citizens' phone calls and emails under the authority of President George W. Bush. This program, known as the Terrorist Surveillance Program, was initiated after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks to monitor international communications of individuals suspected of having ties to terrorism. However, it sparked significant controversy when it became public knowledge due to concerns over privacy rights and the legality of bypassing the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), which typically requires a warrant for such surveillance. The program's existence was first disclosed by The New York Times in December 2005."
