Intrusive, Artificial, Consumerism, Insecurity, Social Stereotypes\n\nMarketing communications can often be intrusive, reaching consumers in their homes, on their phones, or online without explicit permission. They can create artificial needs by convincing people that they need products or services that they didn't think they needed before. They can reinforce consumerism by promoting a culture of buying and consuming as a way of life. They may also perpetuate insecurity by making people feel inadequate unless they own certain products. Lastly, they can perpetuate social stereotypes by portraying certain groups in a stereotypical or biased way."
