                    "text": "In the short run, assuming flexible wages and prices, a decline in aggregate demand would cause both the output (GDP) and the price level to fall as businesses produce less due to lower demand and may reduce prices to stimulate sales. This corresponds to the first two parts of options A, B, and D.\n\nHowever, in the long run, with flexible wages and prices, the economy will adjust back to its natural level of output, which is determined by factors such as technology, labor, capital, and natural resources, not by aggregate demand. This means that in the long run, the GDP should return to its potential or full-employment level, which implies no change from the initial state. This rules out option B since it suggests a long-run fall in GDP.\n\nAs for the long-run price level, with flexible wages and prices, if aggregate demand falls, the price level will also fall in the short run. In the long run, if the economy returns to full employment and the money supply has not changed, the price level should remain at the new lower level established after the adjustment period. This is consistent with a long-run fall in the price level, as suggested in option A.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA.
