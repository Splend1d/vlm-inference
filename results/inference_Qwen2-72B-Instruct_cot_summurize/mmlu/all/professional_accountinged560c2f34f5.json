In this case, Stark Co.'s legal counsel believes that it is reasonably possible that there will be an unfavorable outcome and that damages will range from $100000 to $150000. Therefore, Stark should not accrue any contingent liability but should disclose the potential liability in the notes to the financial statements with a range of $100000 to $150000."
