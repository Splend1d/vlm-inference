One day Howard came home early from work and caught his wife and the other man in bed together. In a violent rage, Howard picked up a large metal lamp and severely beat his wife and the other man. Both victims were seriously injured and hospitalized. Howard was charged with the attempted murder of the other man. He was acquitted of the crime. After Howard's acquittal, his wife and the other man died from injuries that were related to the beating. The state now wishes to prosecute Howard for manslaughter for the deaths of his wife and the other man. Howard should be found\n\nA. guilty of manslaughter of his wife, but not guilty of manslaughter of the other man.\nB. guilty of manslaughter of the other man, but not guilty of manslaughter of his wife.\nC. guilty of manslaughter of both his wife and the other man.\nD. not guilty of manslaughter of either his wife or the other man.\n"

However, based on the information given, the most likely answer is:\n\nD. not guilty of manslaughter of either his wife or the other man.\n\nThis is because Howard has already been acquitted of the attempted murder charge for the actions that led to the other man's injuries. Double jeopardy prevents him from being tried again for the same crime. If the acquittal was based on self-defense or some other legal justification for his actions at the time, then those justifications might also apply to the manslaughter charges, especially since the deaths resulted from the same incident for which he was acquitted.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the legal system can be complex, and there may be exceptions or additional factors that could influence the outcome. For instance, if new evidence comes to light that was not available during the first trial, or if the charges are based on a different legal theory, then the situation could potentially change. But based on the information provided, option D seems the most likely under standard legal principles."
