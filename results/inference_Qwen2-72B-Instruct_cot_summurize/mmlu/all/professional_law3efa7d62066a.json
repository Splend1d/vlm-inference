At that moment, a car was coming toward the intersection, heading from east to west. When the driver saw the child on the bike, he slammed on his brakes in an attempt to avoid hitting the child. Meanwhile, the child realized that he was in danger of colliding with the car, so he applied the hand brakes on his bike as hard as possible. As a result of trying to stop so suddenly, the child flew over the handlebars of the bike and onto the ground. Neither the child nor his bike touched the car, but the child suffered injuries from falling off the bike. If the child's parents, on behalf of the child, assert a claim against the driver to recover damages for the child's injuries, they will most likely\n\nA. prevail, if the child would have been injured even more severely if he had crashed his bike into the car, rather than falling off the bike.\nB. prevail, because the child's action in trying to stop the bike was foreseeable.\nC. not prevail, because the driver and his car never touched the child or bike.\nD. not prevail, unless the driver negligently created a risk of harm that caused the child to fall off the bike.\n"

Simply put, the driver's actions must have created a situation where the child was put at risk of harm, and it was this risk that led to the child's injuries.\n\nIn this scenario, the driver attempted to avoid hitting the child by slamming on the brakes. This action could be seen as a reasonable response to an unexpected event (the child appearing at the intersection). However, if the driver was speeding or not paying attention, which led to the sudden need to brake, then the driver might be found negligent. If the driver was obeying traffic laws and was attentive, the driver might not be found negligent, and the child's actions in flying over the handlebars might be considered an unforeseeable intervening cause of the injuries.\n\nTherefore, the parents' claim would most likely succeed only if they can prove that the driver negligently created a risk of harm that caused the child to fall off the bike. Without evidence of negligence on the part of the driver, the claim would likely fail."
