The control of oil resources and the stability of oil-producing regions have often been considered vital national interests. This has led to the use of various economic instruments, such as trade agreements, investment policies, and financial incentives or penalties, to secure access to oil and maintain global energy markets. While military superiority and the search for domestic sources of oil have also played roles in U.S. foreign policy, the question specifically highlights the role of oil in economic aspects of foreign policy."
