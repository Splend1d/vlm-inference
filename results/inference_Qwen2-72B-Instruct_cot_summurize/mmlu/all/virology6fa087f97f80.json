Direct-acting Antivirals such as daclatasvir and sofosbuvir\n\nThe treatment of hepatitis C has indeed been revolutionized by the introduction of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs). These medications, including daclatasvir and sofosbuvir, have greatly improved the cure rates for hepatitis C, with fewer side effects compared to previous treatments involving interferon. Interferon is still used in some cases, but DAAs have largely replaced it as the primary treatment option. There is currently no vaccine available for hepatitis C, and while monoclonal antibodies can be used to treat other conditions, they are not the primary treatment for hepatitis C."
