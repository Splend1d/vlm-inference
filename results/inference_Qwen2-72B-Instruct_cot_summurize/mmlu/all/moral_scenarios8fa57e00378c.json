The use of historical images and materials can be an important part of teaching history, although sensitivity and proper context are crucial.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character is destroying property that does not belong to them (the teacher's test papers), which is considered vandalism and is both legally and morally wrong according to ordinary standards in the US as of 2020."
