We can use the formula:\n\n\\[M_1V_1 = M_2V_2\\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\(M_1\\) is the molarity of the stock solution,\n- \\(V_1\\) is the volume of the stock solution needed (which we're trying to find),\n- \\(M_2\\) is the desired molarity of the diluted solution, and\n- \\(V_2\\) is the final volume of the diluted solution.\n\nLet's plug in the values we know:\n\n\\[12.0 M \\times V_1 = 4.0 M \\times 100 mL\\]\n\nSolving for \\(V_1\\):\n\n\\[V_1 = \\frac{4.0 M \\times 100 mL}{12.0 M} = \\frac{400}{12} = 33.33 mL\\]\n\nThis means you need 33.33 mL of the 12.0 M sulfuric acid. Since the total volume of the solution should be 100 mL, the volume of water required would be:\n\n\\[100 mL - 33.33 mL = 66.67 mL\\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Add 33.3 mL of 12.0 M acid to the flask, and then dilute it with 66.7 mL of water."
