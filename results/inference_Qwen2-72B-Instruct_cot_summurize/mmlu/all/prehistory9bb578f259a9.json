For example, researchers have found that the same areas of the brain involved in language processing are also active during tool-making tasks. This suggests that the neural networks involved in language and tool-making may have co-evolved over time.\n\nFurthermore, studies of modern hunter-gatherer societies have shown that tool-making and language use are often intertwined, with complex social interactions and communication necessary for successful tool production and sharing. This supports the idea that the cognitive demands of tool-making may have played a role in the evolution of language.\n\nOverall, while more research is needed to fully understand the relationship between tool-making and language evolution, the available evidence suggests that the two may be closely linked."
