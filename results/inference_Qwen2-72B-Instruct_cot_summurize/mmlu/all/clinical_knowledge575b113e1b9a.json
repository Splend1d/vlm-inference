This process occurs in the cytoplasm of the cell and does not directly involve oxygen. During glycolysis, one molecule of glucose (a six-carbon sugar) is split into two molecules of pyruvate (three-carbon compounds).\n\nThe net result of glycolysis per glucose molecule is:\n\n- Two molecules of pyruvate\n- Two molecules of ATP (adenosine triphosphate), which is the energy currency of the cell\n- Two molecules of NADH (reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide)\n\nIt's important to note that the initial phase of glycolysis actually consumes two ATP molecules, but this is then \"repaid\" during the latter part of the process, resulting in a net gain of two ATP molecules.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nB. two molecules of ATP."
