Ignorant of the adversarial system, they both visited a family law attorney together for an initial consultation. The attorney advised them that he could not represent them both. The wife found another attorney. During the trial, the wife's attorney calls the wife to testify. She states that during the initial consultation she and her husband had with his attorney, she privately told the attorney, when her husband was taking a bathroom break, that her husband had a bad drinking problem, which was one of her major reasons for seeking a divorce and custody of the children. Upon objection by the husband's attorney, the wife's testimony should be\n\nA. admitted, because the spousal privilege is inapplicable, since the parties are living in separation.\nB. admitted, because the marital communication privilege is inapplicable in a lawsuit involving the parties.\nC. excluded, because the wife is incompetent to testify to marital communications because she is not the holder of the privilege.\nD. excluded, because confidential statements made during a joint consultation are privileged communications between clients and their attorneys.\n"

This privilege is designed to protect the confidentiality of communications between a client and their attorney. Although the attorney could not represent both parties due to a conflict of interest, the privilege still applies to each individual's communications during that consultation. Therefore, the wife's statement about her husband's drinking problem, even if made privately during the consultation, would be protected by this privilege and should be excluded from testimony."
