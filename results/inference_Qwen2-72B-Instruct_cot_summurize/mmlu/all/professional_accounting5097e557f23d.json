This method involves measuring the amount of difference or variability within the population and using that information to make inferences about the population's total value. Attribute sampling, on the other hand, is used to test controls and determine whether transactions have been processed correctly based on specific attributes or characteristics. Discovery sampling is a type of attribute sampling designed to find rare events or occurrences. Random-number sampling is a technique for selecting a sample from a population but does not specify the type of data being sampled."
