When the customer complained to the restaurant's owner, the owner admitted that the chowder was not, in fact, homemade, but that it had been poured from a can of chowder purchased from a wholesale distributor of food products.

The fact that the chowder was not homemade as advertised is not relevant to the issue of strict liability. However, the presence of a pebble in the chowder that could not have been detected by a reasonable inspection may be considered a manufacturing defect, making the product unreasonably dangerous.\n\nGiven these circumstances, the correct answer is:\n\nA. recover, if a reasonable consumer would not expect the presence of such a pebble in the chowder.\n\nThe customer does not need to prove negligence or that the restaurant had prior notice of the defect (as in B), nor is the lack of a reasonable inspection that would have disclosed the pebble (as in C) a defense. Also, the presence of a foreign object in food that causes injury is typically considered an unreasonably dangerous condition (contrary to D). Therefore, the customer is most likely to recover under strict liability if they can show that a reasonable consumer would not expect to find a pebble in the chowder."
