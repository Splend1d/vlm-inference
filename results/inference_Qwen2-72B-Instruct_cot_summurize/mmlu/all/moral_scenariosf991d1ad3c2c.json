In Scenario 2, feeding fish five times a week is not inherently wrong, as it could be an appropriate frequency depending on the type of fish and their needs. However, without context about the specific requirements for the fish's care, it's impossible to definitively say whether this action is right or wrong, but in general terms, it does not seem to be morally wrong."
