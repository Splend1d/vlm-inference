In 1924, the United States Congress passed the Immigration Act of 1924 (also known as the Johnson-Reed Act), which reduced immigration quotas sharply, leading to a dramatic decline in immigration. This act established national origins quotas that were intended to restrict immigration from Southern and Eastern Europe while favoring immigrants from Northern and Western Europe. It also set an overall limit on the number of immigrants who could enter the country each year."
