The greater the difference in concentration between two sides of a membrane, the faster the diffusion rate will be as the solute moves from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration.\n\nHere's why the other options are not correct:\n\nA. Decreasing the number of different solutes in the solution that bathes the cells - This may decrease competition for transport proteins if the solute uses facilitated diffusion, but it does not directly increase the diffusion rate of the specific solute in question.\n\nC. Increasing the ratio of phospholipids to proteins in the membrane - This could potentially decrease the diffusion rate if the solute relies on specific proteins for transport (facilitated diffusion). A higher ratio of phospholipids might make the membrane less permeable to some substances, especially larger or charged molecules.\n\nD. Decreasing the membrane potential across the membrane - Membrane potential primarily affects the movement of charged particles (ions) across the membrane. It does not have a direct effect on the diffusion of uncharged solutes."
