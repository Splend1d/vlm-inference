The degree of the sum of two polynomials is not necessarily equal to the maximum of their degrees. This would be true if the leading terms of \\(f(x)\\) and \\(g(x)\\) did not cancel each other out. However, if the leading coefficients of \\(f(x)\\) and \\(g(x)\\) are opposite in sign and equal in magnitude, their sum could result in a polynomial of lower degree than either of the original polynomials. For example, consider \\(f(x) = x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x + 4\\) and \\(g(x) = -x^3 + x + 1\\). Here, \\(\\deg f(x) = 3\\), \\(\\deg g(x) = 3\\), but \\(\\deg(f(x) + g(x)) = 2\\).\n\nStatement 2: If \\(F\\) is a field, then every ideal of \\(F[x]\\) is principal.\n\nThis statement is true. In a polynomial ring over a field \\(F[x]\\), every ideal is indeed principal. This follows from the fact that \\(F[x]\\) is a Euclidean domain when \\(F\\) is a field. In a Euclidean domain, it can be shown that every ideal is generated by a single element, making it a principal ideal domain (PID). Therefore, every ideal in \\(F[x]\\) can be described as being generated by a single polynomial, which means it is principal.\n\nSo the correct answer is D. False, True."
