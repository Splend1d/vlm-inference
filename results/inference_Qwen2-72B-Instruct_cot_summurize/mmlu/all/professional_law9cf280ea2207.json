                    "text": "For many years, persons engaged in real estate transactions in a state have utilized installment land contracts. The so-called installment land contract has been popular as a substitute for the mortgage or deed of trust. Under such a contract, the seller agrees to accept, and the buyer agrees to pay, the purchase price in installments over a stipulated period of time. The vendor retains legal title as security for the payment of the purchase price; and the vendee has equitable title under the doctrine of equitable conversion. The most important characteristic of the installment land contract, however, is the forfeiture clause, which provides that if the vendee is in default for 30 days, the vendor may, at his option, declare a forfeiture of the contract, in which case all payments made shall be forfeited as \"liquidated\" damages and the buyer shall become a tenant at will of the seller. Over the years, many sellers of property under such installment land contracts have declared forfeitures in situations where the prospective buyers were delinquent in their payments, even when the buyer was late with a single payment after nearly all the other payments had been made. In order to remedy this inequitable situation, the state legislature enacted a statute requiring any seller attempting to declare a forfeiture of an installment land contract to do so by instituting a formal foreclosure action in the courts. The new law also provided that prior to the commencement of such a foreclosure action, the seller under such an arrangement must give the buyer a 60-day grace period to make up any delinquent installment payment with interest. The new law expressly applied both to installment land contracts entered into subsequent to its enactment and to installment land contracts already in existence at the time of its enactment. Is this new state statute likely to be held constitutional?\n\nA. Yes, because it is a reasonable regulation of the procedure to be followed in such cases and does not substantially diminish the underlying obligations of the buyer.\nB. Yes, because the authority to enact laws regulating real estate sales transactions occurring within the boundaries of individual states is reserved exclusively to the states by the Tenth Amendment.\nC. No, because application of the law to installment land contracts entered into prior to its enactment is a violation of the obligation of contracts.\nD. No, because application of the law to installment land contracts entered into before or after its enactment is a deprivation of a proprietary interest without due process of the law.\n"

Yes, because it is a reasonable regulation of the procedure to be followed in such cases and does not substantially diminish the underlying obligations of the buyer.\n\nThe state's power to regulate real estate transactions, including modifying contractual provisions for public policy reasons, is generally upheld as long as the regulation is reasonable and does not impair the fundamental obligations of the contract. In this case, the statute does not alter the basic bargain between the parties, which is the exchange of property for a purchase price paid in installments. Instead, it modifies the procedure for enforcing the contract, specifically addressing the forfeiture clause to prevent harsh outcomes and provide a grace period for delinquent buyers. This kind of procedural modification is typically within the state's police powers and does not violate the Contract Clause, especially when it serves a legitimate public purpose, such as protecting consumers from potentially abusive practices.\n\nThe Tenth Amendment argument (option B) is not directly relevant to the constitutionality of the statute in question, as the amendment merely reserves powers not delegated to the federal government to the states or the people. It does not guarantee exclusive state authority in specific areas like real estate regulation.\n\nOption C is incorrect because while applying the law retroactively might raise concerns under the Contract Clause, the modification here is procedural rather than substantive and is aimed at preventing inequitable outcomes, which courts often find to be permissible.\n\nOption D is also incorrect because the statute does not deprive sellers of a proprietary interest without due process. The law provides a clear procedure for sellers to follow in the event of a buyer's default, which includes a grace period and a requirement to go through the courts for foreclosure, ensuring that due process is afforded to both parties."
