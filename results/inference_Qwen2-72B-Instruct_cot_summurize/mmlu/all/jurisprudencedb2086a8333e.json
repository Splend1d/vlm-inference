By distinguishing certain features of the English legal system that facilitated the development of capitalism.\n\nMax Weber, a German sociologist, economist, and political theorist, addressed the so-called \"England problem\" in his work on the development of capitalism. He analyzed how certain aspects of the English legal system, particularly the common law tradition, contributed to the emergence and growth of capitalism in England. According to Weber, the predictability, flexibility, and adaptability of the common law made it conducive to the needs of a market economy, which helped foster the development of capitalism. This is in contrast to the more rigid and systematic civil law tradition found in continental Europe, which he argued was less supportive of capitalist development."
