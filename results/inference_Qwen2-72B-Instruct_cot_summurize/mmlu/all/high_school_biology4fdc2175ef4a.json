Each child has:\n\n- A 25% chance of inheriting two normal genes (and not having the disease or being a carrier)\n- A 50% chance of inheriting one normal gene and one mutated gene (and being a carrier like the parents, but not having the disease)\n- A 25% chance of inheriting two mutated genes (and having sickle-cell disease)\n\nSo the correct answer to your question is D. 25%."
