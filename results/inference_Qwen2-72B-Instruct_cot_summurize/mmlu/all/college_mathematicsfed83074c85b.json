Since the curves are given in terms of \\(x\\), but we're rotating about the y-axis, it's best to solve for \\(x\\) in terms of \\(y\\).\n\nThe equations become:\n- For \\(y = x\\), we have \\(x = \\sqrt{y}\\) (since we're only considering the first quadrant where \\(x > 0\\)).\n- For \\(y = x^2\\), we have \\(x = \\sqrt{y}\\).\n\nHowever, these two expressions for \\(x\\) in terms of \\(y\\) are actually the same. What we really need are the functions that bound the region. From \\(y = x\\), we get \\(x = y\\). And from \\(y = x^2\\), we get \\(x = \\sqrt{y}\\).\n\nThe volume of the solid formed can be found using the disk/washer method. The volume of a washer with inner radius \\(r_1(y)\\) and outer radius \\(r_2(y)\\) is given by:\n\n\\[V = \\pi \\int_{a}^{b} [r_2(y)^2 - r_1(y)^2] dy\\]\n\nIn our case, the outer radius is \\(r_2(y) = y\\) (from \\(y = x\\)) and the inner radius is \\(r_1(y) = \\sqrt{y}\\) (from \\(y = x^2\\)). The limits of integration are determined by finding the points of intersection between \\(y = x\\) and \\(y = x^2\\). Setting them equal gives us:\n\n\\[x = x^2\\]\n\n\\[x^2 - x = 0\\]\n\n\\[x(x - 1) = 0\\]\n\nThus, \\(x = 0\\) and \\(x = 1\\). Since we're solving for \\(y\\) as well, when \\(x = 0\\), \\(y = 0\\), and when \\(x = 1\\), \\(y = 1\\). These are our limits of integration.\n\nSubstituting into our formula for volume, we get:\n\n\\[V = \\pi \\int_{0}^{1} [(y)^2 - (\\sqrt{y})^2] dy\\]\n\n\\[V = \\pi \\int_{0}^{1} [y^2 - y] dy\\]\n\n\\[V = \\pi [\\frac{y^3}{3} - \\frac{y^2}{2}]_0^1\\]\n\n\\[V = \\pi [\\frac{1}{3} - \\frac{1}{2}]\\]\n\n\\[V = \\pi [-\\frac{1}{6}]\\]\n\nBut since volumes can't be negative, we take the absolute value (or realize the subtraction should have been in favor of the positive term):\n\n\\[V = \\pi [\\frac{1}{6}]\\]\n\n\\[V = \\frac{\\pi}{6}\\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. \\(\\pi/6\\)."
