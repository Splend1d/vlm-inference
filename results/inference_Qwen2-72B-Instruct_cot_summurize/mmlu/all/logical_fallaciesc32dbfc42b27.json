Appeal to ignorance\n\nThe fallacy of arguing that a lack of evidence proves something is known as an \"appeal to ignorance.\" This fallacy occurs when someone assumes that a proposition is true or false simply because it has not been proven otherwise. In other words, the argument takes the form: \"We don't know that X is false, therefore X must be true,\" or conversely, \"We don't know that X is true, therefore X must be false.\" This type of reasoning is logically invalid and does not constitute a sound argument."
