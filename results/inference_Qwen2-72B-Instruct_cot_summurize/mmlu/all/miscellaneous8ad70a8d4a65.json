An extruder\n\nAn extruder is a tool most commonly used in processes such as plastic or metal fabrication, where material is forced through a die to create long pieces with a constant cross-section. It is not typically used in woodworking, especially not in sculpting wood by hand. The other options (a rasp, a gouge, and a lathe) are all commonly used in woodworking and wood sculpture creation."
