However, if the action endangered the child or caused them distress, it could be considered wrong, but without further context, we cannot assume that.\n\nIn scenario 2, putting your wife's cellphone in the garbage disposal is clearly morally wrong as it involves intentional destruction of someone else's property without their consent. This action violates trust and respect for another person's belongings."
