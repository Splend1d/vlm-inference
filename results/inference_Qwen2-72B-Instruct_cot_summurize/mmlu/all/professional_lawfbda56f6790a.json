The bond agreement provided that for the first five years the racetrack was in operation, at least $2 from each admission charge would be used to repay the bond debt. The bond agreement further stipulated that if the proceeds from the admission charges during the first five years were not sufficient to repay the bondholders, then at least $1 from each admission charge for the next five years would be applied to make the necessary bond payments. After the racetrack was built and in operation for two years, the state legislature passed a bill requiring the racetrack to admit all senior citizens over the age of 65 for the discounted admission fee of 50 cents. This law is probably\n\nA. constitutional, because it is a justifiable exercise of the state's police power.\nB. unconstitutional, because it denies citizens under the age of 65 the equal protection of the law.\nC. unconstitutional, because it impairs the obligation of the bondholders' contract.\nD. unconstitutional, because it is an ex post facto law.\n"

Specifically, the bond agreement requires that at least $2 from each admission charge be used to repay the bond debt for the first five years of operation. By significantly reducing the admission fee for a portion of potential patrons, the racetrack might not be able to collect enough money per admission to meet these requirements, thereby impairing the obligation of the contract with the bondholders. This could be seen as a violation of the Contracts Clause of the U.S. Constitution, which generally prohibits states from passing laws that retroactively impair contract rights."
