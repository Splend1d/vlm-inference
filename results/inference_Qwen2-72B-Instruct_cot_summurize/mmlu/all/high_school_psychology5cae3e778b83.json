Maintenance rehearsal is a memory strategy that involves repeating information over and over again to keep it in short-term memory. This type of rehearsal is often used when someone needs to remember something for a short period of time, such as a phone number or a list of items to buy at the store. By repeating the number to herself several times, Elise was able to keep it in her short-term memory until she could pull over and make the call."
