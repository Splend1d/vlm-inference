Therefore, if Mr. Gordon suffered damage to this area, it is most likely that he would have difficulty in:\n\nD. moving his left hand\n\nThis is because the right side of the brain controls the left side of the body, and damage to the motor cortex (located in the frontal lobe) can lead to weakness or paralysis on the opposite side of the body.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the exact symptoms can vary depending on the specific location and extent of the damage. Other cognitive functions such as understanding spoken or written language and speaking intelligibly are more closely associated with other areas of the brain, particularly the left hemisphere for most people."
