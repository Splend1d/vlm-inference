Controlled memory processes involve conscious effort and attention, such as when we try to remember a list of items or recall information that isn't easily accessible from our long-term memory. These processes tend to slow down as we age, leading to difficulties in learning new information and retrieving it quickly.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that aging does not uniformly affect all aspects of memory. Some types of memory, like procedural memory (e.g., riding a bike) and semantic memory (e.g., facts and general knowledge), tend to be more resilient to the effects of aging. Additionally, while metamemory skills and recognition memory can also show some decline with age, the efficiency of controlled memory processes is often more significantly impacted."
