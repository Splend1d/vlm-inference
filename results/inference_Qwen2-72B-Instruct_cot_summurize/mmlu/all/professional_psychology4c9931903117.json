They should avoid making statements that go beyond what the data support, and they should acknowledge any limitations in their data or conclusions. This includes being clear about the reliability and validity of any tests or assessments used, and avoiding speculation or conjecture when it is not supported by the evidence.\n\nWhile options A and C may be good practices for psychologists to follow in general, they do not specifically address the issue of avoiding misleading testimony or reports. Option B refers to avoiding conflicts of interest, which is an important ethical consideration but does not directly address the issue of providing misleading information."
