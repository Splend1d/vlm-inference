All of these options.\n\nThe concept of 'deepening and broadening' security refers to expanding the traditional understanding of security beyond just military threats to include a variety of other dimensions that can affect a nation's or an individual's safety and well-being. This includes:\n\nA. The nexus between identity and security, which involves how issues related to ethnicity, religion, language, and culture can lead to conflict and insecurity.\nB. War, the military, and the sovereign state, which are traditional aspects of security but still crucial in the broader context.\nC. Environmental changes, such as climate change, natural disasters, and pollution, which can create new security challenges by causing resource scarcity, displacement of populations, and geopolitical tensions.\n\nThus, all of these options are considered part of the deepening and broadening of security."
