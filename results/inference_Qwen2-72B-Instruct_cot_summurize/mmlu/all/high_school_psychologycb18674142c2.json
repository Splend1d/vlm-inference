Walk in 1960, was designed to investigate whether infants could perceive depth and how they respond to visual depth cues. The experiment involved placing an infant on one side of a glass-covered \"cliff,\" where the other side appeared to have a steep drop-off, mimicking a cliff.\n\nThe results of the visual cliff experiment suggest that:\n\nB. Human infants had learned by experience in crawling to perceive depth.\n\nInfants as young as 9 months old showed signs of caution when approaching the \"cliff\" side, indicating that they could perceive the depth difference and were hesitant to crawl over it. This behavior suggests that infants have developed some ability to perceive depth through their experiences, such as crawling, which allows them to navigate their environment more safely.\n\nIt's important to note that while option B is the most accurate answer among the choices given, the experiment also demonstrated that infants use both monocular and binocular cues to perceive depth, contradicting option C and D. Monocular cues include texture gradient, linear perspective, relative size, and other single-eye cues, while binocular cues involve the use of both eyes working together to perceive depth."
