Clathrin is involved in endocytosis, which is the process of taking material into the cell by invagination of the plasma membrane, but it is not directly related to cell motility. Adhesion plaques, vinculin, and lamellipodia are all structures that play important roles in cell motility. Adhesion plaques are sites where the cell adheres to the extracellular matrix, vinculin is a protein that helps link the actin cytoskeleton to adhesion plaques, and lamellipodia are sheet-like extensions of the cell membrane that are involved in cell movement."
