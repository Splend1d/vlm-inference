A duty for natural conditions.\n\nTraditionally, under common law, a possessor of land owes no duty to protect undiscovered trespassers from harm caused by natural conditions on the land. The possessor is not required to make the premises safe for such individuals. However, if the possessor is aware of the presence of a trespasser, there may be some duties owed depending on the jurisdiction and specific circumstances. For artificial conditions (option A) and active operations (option D), there may be a duty to warn or take precautions if the possessor knows or should know of the dangerous condition and the likelihood that trespassers might enter the area."
