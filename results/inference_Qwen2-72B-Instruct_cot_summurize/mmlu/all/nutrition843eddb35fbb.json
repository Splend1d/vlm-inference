Has an uncertain relationship with skeletal health because research studies are confounded by associated lifestyle factors such as smoking, exercise and alcohol consumption\n\nWhile fruit and vegetable consumption is generally considered beneficial for overall health, the relationship between produce intake and skeletal health can be complex due to confounding factors like smoking, exercise, and alcohol consumption. Observational studies have shown mixed results, and supplementation studies often do not account for these lifestyle factors that could influence bone health. Therefore, it's not accurate to definitively state that fruit and vegetable consumption has either a large effect or consistent results on bone mineral loss without considering these confounders."
