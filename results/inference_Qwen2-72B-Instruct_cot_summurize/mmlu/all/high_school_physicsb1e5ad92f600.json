Less, because the tension in the string varies directly with the wave speed, which varies inversely with the wavelength.\nB.

Less, because the tension in the string varies directly with the wave speed, which varies inversely with the wavelength.\n\nExplanation: When the tension in the string increases, the wave speed also increases (since wave speed is proportional to the square root of the tension). According to the wave equation \\(v = f\\lambda\\), where \\(v\\) is the wave speed, \\(f\\) is the frequency, and \\(\\lambda\\) is the wavelength, if the frequency remains constant (as it does here, since it's determined by the generator), then an increase in wave speed must be accompanied by a decrease in wavelength to maintain the equality. Hence, increasing the tension leads to a shorter wavelength for the standing waves."
