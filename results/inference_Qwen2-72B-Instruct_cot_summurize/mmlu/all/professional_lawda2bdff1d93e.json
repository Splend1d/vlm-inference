In the second frame of the first game, the first friend apparently got a strike when he knocked down all 10 pins. However, the second friend accused the first friend of fouling because his foot went over the line. The first friend denied fouling and wanted to mark down a strike on the scorecard. The second friend refused to give the first friend a strike and wrote in a zero on the scoring sheet. The first friend became enraged. The second friend then went to bowl his frame. As the second friend turned his back, the first friend approached from behind with a bowling ball in his hand. The first friend then raised the bowling ball threatening to hit the back of the second friend's head. The second friend, who had his back turned, did not see the first friend's actions. The third friend saw what the first friend was about to do and could easily have warned the second friend; but the third friend remained silent. The first friend then struck the second friend on the back of the head with the bowling ball, causing a deep scalp wound. If the second friend asserts a cause of action against the third friend, he should\n\nA. prevail, because the third friend was aware of the danger.\nB. prevail, on account of the third friend's omission to act.\nC. not prevail, because the first friend was responsible for his injury.\nD. not prevail, because the third friend was under no duty to warn the second friend of the danger.\n"

In this scenario, there is no indication that the third friend has any such special relationship with the second friend that would create a legal duty to warn him of the impending attack by the first friend. Therefore, the second friend would likely not prevail in a cause of action against the third friend for failing to warn him of the danger.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that while the third friend may not be legally liable for failing to warn the second friend, his decision to remain silent may still be morally questionable. In situations where someone's safety is at risk, it is generally considered the right thing to do to try to prevent harm if one can do so safely."
