In Scenario 1, the main character simply draws attention to themselves when entering a room, which is not morally wrong. In Scenario 2, the main character befriends someone who may need a friend, even if their initial motivation was to help her feel better about herself, which is not inherently a bad thing. While some might argue that befriending someone for a specific purpose could be manipulative, in this context, it seems the intention is positive and supportive rather than exploitative or harmful."
