When a fire engine (or any other source of sound) approaches you, the sound waves get compressed, increasing their frequency. This results in a higher-pitched sound than when the source is stationary or moving away from you. The speed of sound itself does not change; it remains constant regardless of the motion of the source or observer in air under normal conditions."
