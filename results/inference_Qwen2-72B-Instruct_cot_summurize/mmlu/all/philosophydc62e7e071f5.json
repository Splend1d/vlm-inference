While he did not suggest that a detailed calculation should precede every single action (which would be impractical), he did believe that the principle of utility should always inform one's thinking and decision-making. Utilitarian calculations can be more formally applied when making significant policy or legislative decisions, where the consequences of actions can be more thoroughly assessed."
