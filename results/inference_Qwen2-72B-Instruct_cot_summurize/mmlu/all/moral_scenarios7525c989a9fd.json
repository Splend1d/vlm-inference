In Scenario 2, bringing a tool into a courtroom may be against court rules, but it is not necessarily morally wrong unless the individual intends to use it to harm someone or escape custody. Without further context suggesting harmful intent, this action could simply be a rule violation rather than a morally reprehensible act."
