A psychometrician consistently underestimates IQ scores by 10 points\n\nThis is because a constant error refers to a systematic bias that affects all measurements in the same way. In option B, the psychometrician's consistent underestimation of IQ scores by 10 points indicates a systematic bias that would be present in all measured scores, making it a clear example of a constant error.\n\nIn contrast:\n- Option A (a subject consistently providing wrong answers) could indicate a lack of knowledge or understanding rather than a measurement error.\n- Option C (a test item incorrectly answered by every student) might suggest a problem with the test item itself, such as poor wording or ambiguity, but it does not necessarily imply a constant error across different measures.\n- Option D (a low test-retest reliability coefficient) suggests inconsistency in measurements over time, which is not indicative of a constant error but rather of random errors or changes in the true score."
