She brought a Title VII civil rights action in federal court for gender discrimination against the employer. At trial, a former co-worker of the woman was not allowed to testify that she heard the human relations manager saying in an informal meeting that the plaintiff and her predecessor were both fired due to what the manager described as \"pregnancy complications.\" The proposed witness had been a vice-president of the company and a close adviser to the president. Without the benefit of that vital testimony, the jury entered a verdict for the defendant employer. On appeal, the plaintiff argued that the testimony should have been allowed and that it was not hearsay under the federal rules. Will the court likely grant the appeal, and order a new trial?\n\nA. No, because the statement is clearly hearsay with no exception to the hearsay rule being applicable.\nB. No, because it was based on things that the co-worker heard from others, making double-hearsay that is never admissible.\nC. Yes, because that kind of testimony is reliable and not excludable as hearsay.\nD. Yes, because it was admissible under the \"spontaneous utterance\" exception to the hearsay rules.\n"

However, since \"statement against interest\" was not one of the options provided, the closest correct answer would be:\n\nC. Yes, because that kind of testimony is reliable and not excludable as hearsay.\n\nBut it's important to note that the most accurate answer would have referred to the \"statement against interest\" exception if it had been an option. This exception allows statements that go against the declarant's own interest (such as admitting actions that could lead to legal liability) to be admitted into evidence even though they are hearsay. In this case, the human relations manager's statement could be seen as against her own interest because it implicates the company in illegal discrimination. \n\nHowever, the \"spontaneous utterance\" exception mentioned in option D could also potentially apply if the statement was made under the stress of excitement caused by the event or condition. Both exceptions would need to be considered by the court in determining whether the testimony should have been admitted."
