                    "text": "The correct answer is D. may be greater or less than mg depending on the speed of the ball.\n\nWhen a ball hangs at rest, the tension in the string equals the weight of the ball (mg), where m is the mass of the ball and g is the acceleration due to gravity. This tension acts vertically upward, balancing the force of gravity acting downward.\n\nWhen the ball is moved in a horizontal circle, the string will form an angle with the vertical, and the tension in the string will have both vertical and horizontal components. The vertical component must still balance the weight of the ball, but now there's also a horizontal component that provides the centripetal force necessary to keep the ball moving in a circular path.\n\nAs the speed of the ball increases, the required centripetal force also increases, meaning the horizontal component of the tension must increase. This results in a larger total tension force in the string than when the ball was at rest. However, if the ball were to move very slowly in a large-radius circle, the centripetal force required would be small, and the tension might not be much greater than mg.\n\nTherefore, the tension can be greater or less than mg depending on the speed of the ball and the radius of the circle it is moving in, but for a ball moving in a horizontal circle, it will generally be greater than mg due to the need for centripetal force."
