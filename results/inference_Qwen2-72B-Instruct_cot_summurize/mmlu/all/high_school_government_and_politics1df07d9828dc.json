Individuals are more likely to vote when they believe they know which candidate will win an election.\n\nWhile it is true that some individuals might be motivated to vote if they feel their preferred candidate has a good chance of winning (to ensure victory), others might also be motivated by the belief that their candidate is trailing (to help overcome the deficit). In fact, many people are motivated to vote for reasons other than the perceived likelihood of a candidate's victory, such as a sense of civic duty, issue salience, or the desire to express their political views. The idea that people are only more likely to vote when they believe they know who will win oversimplifies the complex motivations behind voter behavior."
