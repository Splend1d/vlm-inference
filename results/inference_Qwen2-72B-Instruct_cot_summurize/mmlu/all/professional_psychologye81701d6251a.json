A behaviorist would likely describe this phenomenon through observable behaviors and their consequences rather than internal mental processes. Among the options provided, the closest equivalent to the concept of catharsis from a behaviorist perspective would be:\n\nC. reduction of emotional response by an extinction procedure\n\nExtinction in behaviorism refers to the diminishing of a behavior when it is no longer reinforced. This could be seen as analogous to the release of repressed emotions in psychoanalysis, as the emotional response is reduced when it is no longer being \"reinforced\" by avoidance or other maladaptive coping mechanisms. However, it's important to note that behaviorism does not directly address emotions or internal states but rather focuses on observable behaviors."
