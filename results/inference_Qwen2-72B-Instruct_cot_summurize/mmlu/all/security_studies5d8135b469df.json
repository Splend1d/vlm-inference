Human security as a concept has struggled to gain recognition amongst scholars of security studies, or in the policy-making community. There is a general failure to recognise the political and academic value of human security as a concept.\nB. The concept of human security gained increasing currency in the mid-1990s, serving to highlight critical issues. In particular, the study of human society has focuses on the problem of intra-state violence, which has become the dominant issue for post-Cold War security studies.\nC. The concept of human security does not challenge traditional state-centric arguments in so far as these concern the protection of the state from external military violence. However, it does show that state-centric realism is insufficient because it does not address the security of people within states.\nD. Human security has become the dominant concept in understanding contemporary security studies. After the end of the Cold War, the state-centric security paradigm was made irrelevant and today there is a universal understanding that human beings and individuals within states should be the focal point of security.\n"

The concept of human security challenges traditional state-centric arguments by emphasizing that security should not only focus on protecting the state from external military threats but also on addressing the security needs of individuals within states. While state-centric realism remains relevant in some aspects, the human security concept highlights the importance of non-military threats such as poverty, disease, and environmental degradation, which can also pose significant risks to people's safety and well-being.\n\nWhile option B is partially correct, it does not fully capture the significance of human security in contemporary security studies. Option A is incorrect because human security has gained recognition among scholars and policymakers in recent years. Option D is also incorrect because state-centric security paradigms still hold relevance in certain contexts, and there is no universal agreement that human security should be the sole focus of security studies."
