This means that:\n\nA. You must always obtain permission from the client before talking to a consultant if you will be sharing identifiable information about the client.\n\nThe correct answer is not an absolute one among the options provided because it depends on whether identifiable information will be shared. If the client's identity will not be revealed and the information discussed is sufficiently de-identified, then it may not be necessary to obtain explicit consent for every consultation. However, best practice and ethical guidelines suggest that psychologists should still inform clients about the general nature of consultations and the limits of confidentiality at the outset of therapy, and obtain their consent for this process.\n\nTherefore, option B comes closest to the correct interpretation in many cases: you must obtain permission from the client only if you will be revealing the client's identity to the consultant. However, it is important to note that even without revealing the client's identity, discussing case specifics could potentially lead to identification, especially in small communities or with unique cases. Thus, it is advisable to err on the side of caution and seek consent whenever case details are discussed, unless there is a prior agreement in place that covers such consultations."
