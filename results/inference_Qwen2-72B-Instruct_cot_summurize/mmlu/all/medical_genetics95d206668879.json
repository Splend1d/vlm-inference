This means that the gene responsible for the condition is located on the X chromosome, and males are more frequently affected because they have only one X chromosome. Females can be carriers if they have one affected X chromosome and one normal X chromosome, but they typically do not show symptoms unless they are mosaic for the condition or have skewed X-inactivation."
