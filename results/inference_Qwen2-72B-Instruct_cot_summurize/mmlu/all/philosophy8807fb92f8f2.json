In terms of this definition, we might be able to claim to know something as true which might actually be false, but it is impossible for us really to know something that is false.  Why?\n\nA. Because to know something that is false is to know no real thing, nothing (i.e., not to know at all).\nB. Because what we know as true is ultimately based on what we claim to know as true.\nC. Because we cannot give a justification or reason for believing in something that is false.\nD. Because in contrast to our knowledge of the unchanging Forms, beliefs about particular objects can change.\n"

According to Plato's definition of knowledge as justified true belief, a belief must meet three criteria to qualify as knowledge: it must be true, it must be believed, and there must be adequate justification for believing it. If a belief is false, it cannot meet the first criterion, and therefore cannot be knowledge. Additionally, if a belief is false, it is impossible to provide adequate justification for it, since any justification would be based on an incorrect premise. Therefore, it is impossible for us to truly know something that is false."
