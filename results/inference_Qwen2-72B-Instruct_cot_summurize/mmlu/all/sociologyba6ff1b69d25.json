This perspective suggests that as corporations grew larger and more complex, professional managers emerged to run these organizations, leading to a separation between those who owned the capital (shareholders) and those who managed the day-to-day operations (managers). This development was seen as a significant shift in the power dynamics within businesses, with managers gaining more autonomy and control over strategic decisions."
