Less negative than (i.e. smaller in absolute value than) those in the left hand tail of a normal distribution.\n\nThe Dickey-Fuller test is used to test for the presence of a unit root in the series, which means testing for non-stationarity. The test statistic in the Dickey-Fuller test has a different distribution compared to the standard normal distribution. This is because the null hypothesis of the Dickey-Fuller test is that the time series has a unit root, which implies that it is non-stationary. Under this null hypothesis, the test statistic does not follow a normal distribution but instead follows a specific distribution known as the Dickey-Fuller distribution.\n\nThis distribution has a different shape and mean compared to the standard normal distribution. Specifically, under the null hypothesis of a unit root, the test statistic tends to be less negative than would be expected under a normal distribution with the same number of degrees of freedom. This is because the presence of a unit root causes the series to have more persistence or autocorrelation, which affects the distribution of the test statistic.\n\nTherefore, when conducting a Dickey-Fuller test, we compare the test statistic to critical values from the Dickey-Fuller distribution rather than to those from a normal distribution. These critical values are typically more positive (less negative) than those from the left-hand tail of a normal distribution.\n\nAs for option D, the critical values for the Dickey-Fuller test do indeed become less negative (closer to zero) as the size of the test increases. This means that it becomes easier to reject the null hypothesis of a unit root at higher significance levels. However, this does not directly relate to the comparison between the Dickey-Fuller test statistic and the normal distribution, so it is not the most accurate answer to the question as phrased."
