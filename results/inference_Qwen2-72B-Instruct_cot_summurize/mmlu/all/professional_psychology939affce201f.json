Apraxia.\n\nApraxia is a disorder that affects the ability to perform purposeful movements or actions, even though the individual has the desire to do so, the muscle strength and sensation necessary to perform the action, and is fully conscious. This condition often results from damage to the brain, particularly in areas involved in planning and executing voluntary movements. In the case you described, the person might have ideomotor apraxia, which specifically affects the ability to use objects in their intended way, like using a key to open a door."
