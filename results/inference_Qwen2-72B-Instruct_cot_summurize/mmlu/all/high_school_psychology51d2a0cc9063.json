His parents and the school decided to work with Max by giving him a sticker each time he behaved for a full hour. Once he accumulated ten stickers, he could present them to his parents who would give him a reward. The method the school and parents chose to employ is referred to as\n\nA. negative reinforcement\nB. a token economy\nC. a point value system\nD. negative punishment\n"

These tokens can then be exchanged for rewards, which helps to encourage the behavior further. In Max's case, the stickers act as tokens that he can accumulate and exchange for a reward from his parents once he has enough of them. This approach is based on the principles of operant conditioning and is often used in educational settings to help modify children's behaviors."
