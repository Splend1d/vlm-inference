The forward static friction force of the ground on the horse is greater than any friction forces acting backward on the cart, providing a forward acceleration.\n\nWhen the horse pulls the cart, it pushes backward against the ground with its legs. The ground then exerts a forward static friction force on the horse, which allows the horse to move forward and pull the cart along. This forward force is greater than any frictional forces acting in the opposite direction on the cart (such as rolling resistance), allowing the horse-cart system to accelerate from rest."
