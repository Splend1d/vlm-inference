As a stack-allocated variable, it could have different addresses depending on when its containing function is called.\n\nWhen a function is called, a new stack frame is created to hold the function's local variables and other information. The exact location of this stack frame in memory can vary each time the function is called, depending on various factors such as the state of the call stack and the size of the function's local variables. Therefore, the absolute address of a local variable cannot be known until the function is actually called and the stack frame is created. This is why the compiler cannot determine the absolute address of a local variable at compile-time."
