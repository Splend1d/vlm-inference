When \\(x = 0\\):\n\\[x^2 + 1 = 0^2 + 1 = 1\\]\nSince the result is not zero, \\(x = 0\\) is not a zero of the polynomial.\n\n2. When \\(x = 1\\):\n\\[x^2 + 1 = 1^2 + 1 = 1 + 1 = 0\\] (Remember, in \\(\\mathbb{Z}_2\\), \\(1 + 1 = 0\\))\nSince the result is zero, \\(x = 1\\) is a zero of the polynomial.\n\nThus, the only zero of the polynomial \\(x^2 + 1\\) in \\(\\mathbb{Z}_2\\) is \\(x = 1\\).\n\nThe correct answer is B. 1."
