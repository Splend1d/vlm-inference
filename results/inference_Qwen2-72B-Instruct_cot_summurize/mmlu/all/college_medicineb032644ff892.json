Taboo: Having consensual sexual intercourse with his sister violates a strong societal taboo against incest.\n2. Folkways: Leaving no tip at the bar is considered rude or disrespectful but not necessarily illegal or morally reprehensible in all societies.\n3. The Law: Having non-consensual sexual relations with an unknown woman constitutes rape, which is a serious crime and violation of legal standards.\n4. Mores: Vomiting on the steps to the door of a local church is a violation of mores, as it shows disrespect for a sacred space and may be considered a moral transgression in many cultures."
