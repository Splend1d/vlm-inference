This is a combination problem, where order does not matter. The formula for combinations is:\n\n\\[ C(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \\]\n\nwhere \\( n \\) is the total number of items, \\( k \\) is the number of items to choose, and \\( ! \\) denotes factorial (the product of all positive integers up to that number).\n\nThe total number of ways to select 3 suitcases out of 25 is:\n\\[ C(25, 3) = \\frac{25!}{3!(25-3)!} = \\frac{25!}{3!22!} = \\frac{25 \\times 24 \\times 23}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 2300 \\]\n\nNext, we need to find the number of ways to select exactly 2 damaged suitcases out of 5 and 1 undamaged suitcase out of 20.\n\nThe number of ways to select 2 damaged suitcases out of 5 is:\n\\[ C(5, 2) = \\frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!} = \\frac{5!}{2!3!} = \\frac{5 \\times 4}{2 \\times 1} = 10 \\]\n\nThe number of ways to select 1 undamaged suitcase out of 20 is:\n\\[ C(20, 1) = \\frac{20!}{1!(20-1)!} = \\frac{20!}{1!19!} = 20 \\]\n\nThe total number of ways to select exactly 2 damaged suitcases and 1 undamaged suitcase is the product of these two numbers:\n\\[ 10 \\times 20 = 200 \\]\n\nFinally, the probability that exactly 2 out of the 3 selected suitcases are damaged is the ratio of the number of ways to select 2 damaged suitcases and 1 undamaged suitcase to the total number of ways to select any 3 suitcases:\n\\[ P(\\text{exactly 2 damaged}) = \\frac{200}{2300} = \\frac{2}{23} \\]\n\nSo the answer is:\nC. 2/23"
