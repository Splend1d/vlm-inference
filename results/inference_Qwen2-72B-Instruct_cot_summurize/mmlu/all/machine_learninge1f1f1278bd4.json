Let's compute it:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d}{dx}\\sigma(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}\\left(1 + e^{-x}\\right)^{-1}\n\\]\n\nUsing the chain rule,\n\n\\[\n= -\\left(1 + e^{-x}\\right)^{-2} \\cdot (-e^{-x})\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= \\sigma(x)(1-\\sigma(x))\n\\]\n\nNow, if we have a Bernoulli random variable $B \\sim \\text{Bern}(\\sigma(x))$, its variance is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Var}(B) = \\sigma(x)(1-\\sigma(x))\n\\]\n\nThus, **Statement 1** is true.\n\n### Statement 2:\nSetting the bias parameters in each layer of a neural network to 0 does not inherently change the bias-variance trade-off in the way described. Bias in machine learning refers to the error due to overly simplistic assumptions in the learning algorithm. Variance is the error from sensitivity to small fluctuations in the training set. Removing biases (the parameters) does not necessarily decrease the model's bias; rather, it might make the model less flexible and potentially increase bias as the model becomes more rigid. It could also increase variance if the weights become too large or if the model overfits to the data without the stabilizing effect of biases. Thus, **Statement 2** is false.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **C. True, False**."
