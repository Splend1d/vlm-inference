Neither position nor momentum can be known exactly.\n\nIn the context of a particle in a one-dimensional box (also known as an infinite square well), the particle's wavefunction is zero at the walls and non-zero within the box. This means that the position of the particle is confined within the boundaries of the box, but it is not possible to know its exact position within the box due to the spread of the wavefunction. \n\nSimilarly, because the particle is in a state of definite energy (the ground state), its momentum has a certain probability distribution that arises from the wavefunction. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle states that the product of the uncertainties in position (\\(\\Delta x\\)) and momentum (\\(\\Delta p\\)) is greater than or equal to \\(\\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\), where \\(\\hbar\\) is the reduced Planck's constant. Therefore, both position and momentum cannot be known exactly simultaneously, even for a particle in the lowest energy level of a one-dimensional box."
