Gas chromatographic separation of the air sample on a capillary column followed by electron capture detection\n\nThe electron capture detector (ECD) is highly sensitive and selective for electronegative compounds like CFCs, making it ideal for detecting trace amounts of these substances in air samples. Capillary columns offer high separation efficiency, which is necessary for the accurate determination of low concentrations of CFCs."
