While mammals do regulate many aspects of their physiology to maintain homeostasis, including body temperature, blood glucose concentration, and blood pH, metabolic rate is not typically one of them. Metabolic rate can vary widely in mammals depending on factors such as activity level, environmental conditions, and nutritional status."
