However, this right does not extend to cases where there is no possibility of incarceration. In the case of a second-degree misdemeanor like petit theft, if the maximum penalty does not include any jail time (only fines or community service, for example), then the court is not required to provide legal representation to the defendant, even if they are indigent. This is based on the U.S. Supreme Court decision in Scott v. Illinois, 440 U.S. 367 (1979), which held that the right to counsel applies only when a defendant faces possible loss of liberty."
