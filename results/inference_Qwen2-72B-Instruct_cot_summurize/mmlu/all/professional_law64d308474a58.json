Unbeknownst to the defendant, the woman had just stolen the briefcase from the man on the street. Believing the woman to be the victim of an attack, the defendant intervened and punched the man until the woman was able to get away with the briefcase. Confused as to why he wasn't being hailed as a hero by the woman, the defendant eventually realized that he had been an unwitting accomplice to the woman's theft. The defendant apologized profusely to the man and went home. According to the alter ego rule, which of the following statements is correct with respect to the amount of force that the defendant was entitled to use in the woman's defense?\n\nA. Since the defendant did not stand in any personal relationship with the woman, he was not justified in using force in her defense.\nB. Not knowing the true facts, the defendant was not justified in using force to protect the woman because the man was privileged to recapture his briefcase.\nC. The defendant was justified in using reasonable force in the woman's defense, since he reasonably believed she was in immediate danger of unlawful bodily harm from the man.\nD. The defendant was justified in using reasonable force in the woman's defense, since his belief that she was in immediate danger of unlawful bodily harm from the man was both objectively and subjectively reasonable.\n"

The defendant was justified in using reasonable force in the woman's defense, since his belief that she was in immediate danger of unlawful bodily harm from the man was both objectively and subjectively reasonable. However, it's important to note that the legality of the defendant's actions would depend on the specific laws of the jurisdiction where the incident occurred and how those laws interpret the use of force in defense of others. In this case, the defendant's actions were based on a mistaken belief about the situation, but his response was still an attempt to prevent what he perceived to be an ongoing crime."
