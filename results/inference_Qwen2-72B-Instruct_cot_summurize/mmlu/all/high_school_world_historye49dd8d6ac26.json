A Union of African states will project more effectively the African personality. It will command respect from a world that has regard only for size and influence. The scant attention paid to African opposition to the French atomic tests in the Sahara, and the ignominious spectacle of the U.N. in the Congo quibbling about constitutional niceties while the Republic was tottering into anarchy, are evidence of the callous disregard of African Independence by the Great Powers.\"\nKwame Nkrumah, Ghanian leader, 1961\nThe inclusion of the Congo in Nkrumah's argument is intended to do which of the following?\n\nA. Demonstrate the possibility of African unity\nB. Give an example of how African nations are neglected by the world powers\nC. Present an illustration of how the development of a constitution brings order to nations\nD. Blame European powers for the difficulties experienced in Africa\n"

Give an example of how African nations are neglected by the world powers\n\nNkrumah includes the Congo in his argument to highlight the indifference and lack of support from the Great Powers (world powers) towards African nations, particularly during times of crisis. He criticizes the United Nations' focus on constitutional technicalities rather than addressing the immediate need for stability in the Congo, which was facing a descent into anarchy. This serves as an example of the callous disregard of African independence and sovereignty by these global powers."
