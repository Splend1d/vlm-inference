Yi Yin then clearly described the virtue of the Meritorious Ancestor for the instruction of the young king.\n\"Oh! of old the former kings of Xia cultivated earnestly their virtue, and then there were no calamities from Heaven. The spirits of the hills and rivers were all in tranquility; and the birds and beasts enjoyed their existence according to their nature. But their descendant did not follow their example, and Heaven sent down calamities, using our ruler, who possessed of its favor. The attack on Xia may be traced to the orgies in Ming Tiao. . . . Our king of Shang brilliantly displayed his sagely prowess; for oppression he substituted his generous gentleness. Now your Majesty is entering on the inheritance of his virtue; all depends on how you commence your reign.\n\"Oh! the former king began with careful attention to the bonds that hold men together. . . . Revere these warnings in your person. . . . The ways of Heaven are not invariable: on the good-doer it sends down all blessings, and on the evil-doer it sends down all miseries. If you not be virtuous, be it in large things or in small, it will bring the ruin of your ancestral temple.\"\n\u2014Excerpted and adapted from the Shu Jing, 6th century BCE, China\nWhat does the phrase below tell us about the ruler?\n\nA. He had the Mandate of Heaven.\nB. He was an absolute monarch.\nC. He had lost the blessing of the gods.\nD. He was killed as a result of natural disasters.\n"

                    "text": "The phrase \"the former king began with careful attention to the bonds that hold men together\" and the context provided by Yi Yin's speech suggest that the ruler referred to is one who upheld the moral and social order expected of a just leader in ancient Chinese thought. This aligns with the concept of the Mandate of Heaven (\u5929\u547d, Ti\u0101nm\u00ecng), which was a philosophical concept in ancient China that justified the rule of the emperor. According to this belief, the emperor's right to rule was granted by the will of heaven, but it could also be revoked if the emperor failed to govern justly and morally.\n\nIn the excerpt, Yi Yin emphasizes the importance of cultivating virtue and warns the young king that the prosperity of his reign and the fate of his dynasty depend on his ability to emulate the virtuous qualities of his ancestors. This implies that the ruler in question has not yet lost the Mandate of Heaven but is being advised on how to maintain it. Therefore, the correct answer to the question based on the given information is:\n\nA. He had the Mandate of Heaven."
