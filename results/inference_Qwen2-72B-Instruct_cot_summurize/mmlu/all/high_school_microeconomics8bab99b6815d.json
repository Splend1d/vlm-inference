Joint profit maximization costs society consumer surplus as the price rises above competitive levels.\n\nWhen large firms in the same industry collude, they can artificially restrict output to drive up prices and maximize their joint profits. This results in a loss of consumer surplus because consumers have to pay higher prices than they would in a competitive market. The government discourages such collusion to protect consumers and promote fair competition."
