This approach involves gradually exposing the patient to feared situations or environments in real life, allowing them to confront and overcome their fears. The goal is to help the individual learn that they can manage their anxiety and that the feared outcomes do not occur or are manageable. This process helps to reduce avoidance behaviors and increase confidence in managing anxiety-provoking situations."
