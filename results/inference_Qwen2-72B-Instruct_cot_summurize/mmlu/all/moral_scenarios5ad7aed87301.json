This action is not only illegal but also shows a lack of consideration for others who may need the space.\n\nScenario 2: Licking the fruit before serving it to guests is unsanitary and can potentially spread germs or illnesses. It violates the trust guests place in their host to provide safe and clean food, and it disregards the health and well-being of others."
