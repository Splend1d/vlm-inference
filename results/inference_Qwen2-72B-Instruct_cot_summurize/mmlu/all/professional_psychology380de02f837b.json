This allows for transparency and ethical consideration of the participants' right to know the true nature of the research they have contributed to. Option D may not always be feasible, especially if immediate debriefing could compromise the integrity of the study or cause distress to the participant. Options A and B do not fully address the ethical responsibility to inform participants about the true purpose of the study."
