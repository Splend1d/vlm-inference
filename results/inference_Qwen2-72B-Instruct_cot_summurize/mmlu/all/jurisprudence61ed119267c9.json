Punishment should fit the crime.\n\nConsequentialism, particularly in the form of utilitarianism, justifies punishment based on its outcomes\u2014specifically, whether the punishment leads to the greatest good for the greatest number. This could include reducing crime, protecting society, and rehabilitating the offender. Propositions A, B, and C align with these goals as they focus on the positive outcomes of punishment (security, cost-effectiveness, and personal safety).\n\nHowever, proposition D, \"Punishment should fit the crime,\" aligns more closely with retributive justice, which holds that punishment should be proportionate to the offense and is justified by the moral desert of the offender rather than by any potential beneficial consequences. This principle does not necessarily consider the overall good that might result from the punishment but instead focuses on the intrinsic fairness of the penalty relative to the crime committed. As such, it may sometimes conflict with a strict consequentialist approach, which could justify a lesser or greater punishment if it leads to better overall outcomes."
