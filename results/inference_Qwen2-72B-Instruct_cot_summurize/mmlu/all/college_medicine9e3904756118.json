This is because the DNA polymerase will add T (Thymine) to every A (Adenine) and A to every T on the template strand. Since the template strand has a ratio of 3:2 for A:T, the complementary strand will have a ratio of 2:3 for T:A, which is equivalent to A:T being 2:3 when considering the perspective of the newly synthesized strand.\n\nSo the correct answer is:\n\nC. 2:03"
