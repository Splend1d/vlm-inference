This hypothesis suggests that when external rewards are given for an activity that is already intrinsically motivating, the intrinsic motivation may be reduced because the individual comes to attribute their behavior to the reward rather than to their own interest or enjoyment. In other words, the reward provides an external justification for the behavior, which can lead to a decrease in the internal desire to engage in the activity."
