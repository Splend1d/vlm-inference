Stratified sample\n\nIn this scenario, it would be best to use a stratified sample because you want to ensure that the different types of communities (urban, suburban, and rural) are represented proportionally in the study. By using a stratified sample, you can divide the population into these three strata based on community type and then randomly select participants from each stratum. This method will provide a more accurate representation of the attitudes toward tracking of students across all segments of the community.\n\nA convenience sample might not represent the views of all communities equally, as it would consist of individuals who are easily accessible or available. A simple random sample (SRS) could potentially result in an unbalanced representation of the different communities if their sizes vary significantly. A systematic sample involves selecting every nth individual from a list, which may also lead to an unbalanced representation of the different communities."
