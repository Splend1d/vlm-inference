People who are carriers of Tay-Sachs disease have a reduced level of this enzyme, but it is not completely absent as in individuals with the full-blown disease. The other conditions listed are genetic disorders that do not typically involve enzyme deficiencies and therefore would not be identified through an enzyme assay."
