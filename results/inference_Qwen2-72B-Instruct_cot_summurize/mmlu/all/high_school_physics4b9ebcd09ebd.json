In this case, the total charge before contact is \\(+5e - 6e = -1e\\).\n\nAfter contact, the two spheres will have charges that add up to \\(-1e\\) in total. Let's check the options:\n\nA. If one sphere has \\(+3e\\) and the other has \\(-4e\\), then the total charge is indeed \\(-1e\\). So, this is a possible combination.\n\nB. If one sphere has \\(+1.5e\\) and the other has \\(-2.5e\\), then the total charge is also \\(-1e\\). This means the charges could redistribute themselves in this way as well.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. Both of the above."
