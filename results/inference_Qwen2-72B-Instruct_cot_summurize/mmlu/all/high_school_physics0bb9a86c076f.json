                    "text": "The electric field strength (E) due to a spherically symmetric charge distribution can be found using Gauss's Law. For a sphere of radius r < R (inside the charge distribution), the enclosed charge is given by the integral of the charge density over the volume enclosed by the Gaussian surface:\n\nQ_enclosed = \u222b\u03c1 dV = \u222b_0^r \u222b_0^\u03c0 \u222b_0^{2\u03c0} (ar) r^2 sin(\u03b8) d\u03c6 d\u03b8 dr\n\nSolving this integral gives Q_enclosed = (4/3)\u03c0a*r^4.\n\nAccording to Gauss's Law, the electric field E at a distance r from the center is given by:\n\nE * 4\u03c0r^2 = k*Q_enclosed,\n\nwhere k is Coulomb's constant. Substituting the expression for Q_enclosed into this equation gives:\n\nE = k*(4/3)\u03c0a*r^4 / 4\u03c0r^2 = (1/3)ka*r^2.\n\nThis shows that the electric field strength inside the charge distribution (for r < R) increases non-linearly with r, which corresponds to option D.\n\nFor r > R (outside the charge distribution), the enclosed charge becomes constant (equal to the total charge in the sphere of radius R), so the electric field strength decreases as 1/r^2, which is not one of the options given.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: It increases non-linearly for r < R."
