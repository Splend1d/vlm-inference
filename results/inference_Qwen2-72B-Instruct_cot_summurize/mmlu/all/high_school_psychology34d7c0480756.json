                    "text": "Heritability studies of intelligence suggest that genetic factors play a significant role in determining IQ. Since Jim and Tim are monozygotic (identical) twins, they share 100% of their genes, while Scott and Michael, as dizygotic (fraternal) twins, share on average about 50% of their segregating genes (the same as any other siblings).\n\nGiven this information, we would expect:\n\nA. Jim and Tim will have very similar IQs.\n\nThis is because their genetic similarity is much higher than that of Scott and Michael, and genetics has a substantial influence on intelligence. However, it's important to note that environmental factors also play a role, and since all four individuals were reared together, they would have experienced similar environments. Still, the genetic component would lead us to predict that Jim and Tim's IQs would be more similar to each other than those of Scott and Michael.\n\nTherefore, the most likely outcome based on heritability studies of intelligence is:\n\nA. Jim and Tim will have very similar IQs."
