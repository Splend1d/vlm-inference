The way things should be.\n\nA normative perspective refers to the view of how things ought to be, based on a set of values or standards that are considered ideal or desirable. It involves making judgments about what is good, right, or proper, and often guides actions or policies aimed at achieving these ideals. In contrast, a descriptive perspective simply describes how things are without making value judgments."
