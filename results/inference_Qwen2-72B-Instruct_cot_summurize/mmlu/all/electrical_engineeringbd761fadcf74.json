The two most important characteristics of an oscillator are amplitude stability and frequency stability.\n\nAmplitude stability refers to the ability of the oscillator to maintain a constant output amplitude over time, temperature changes, and other environmental factors. This is important because fluctuations in amplitude can cause distortion and other unwanted effects in the output signal.\n\nFrequency stability refers to the ability of the oscillator to maintain a constant output frequency over time, temperature changes, and other environmental factors. This is important because any deviation from the desired frequency can cause errors in the system that uses the oscillator as a reference signal.\n\nPower stability, while important in some applications, is not necessarily a requirement for all oscillators. Therefore, it is not one of the primary requirements listed here."
