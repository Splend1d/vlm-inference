S. Senate. One of the columnist's eager young apprentices concocted a plan that he hoped would enable him to gain the columnist's favor. Late one evening, without telling anyone, the apprentice broke into the lawyer's private office and copied several letters pertaining to \"dirty tricks\" perpetrated by the lawyer during the most recent presidential campaign. When the apprentice presented the columnist with the fruits of his diligent research, the columnist was quite impressed and immediately printed excerpts from the material. If the lawyer asserts a claim against the columnist for invasion of right to privacy, the plaintiff will most likely\n\nA. prevail, because the apprentice's action was an unlawful invasion of private facts.\nB. prevail, because the publication was not newsworthy.\nC. not prevail, because what the columnist printed was true, thus establishing there was no \"false light. \"\nD. not prevail, because the columnist was not involved in the burglary and did not conspire with the apprentice with respect to the burglary.\n"

In general, though, the First Amendment protects the press' right to publish information that has been lawfully obtained, even if the source of that information is illegal (see Bartnicki v. Vopper, 532 U.S. 514 (2001)). As long as the columnist did not participate in or encourage the illegal activity, they may be protected under the First Amendment. The fact that the information is true may also be relevant in some jurisdictions in defending against a false light claim, but it does not necessarily negate a claim for invasion of privacy based on intrusion upon seclusion.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the apprentice's actions could constitute a criminal offense, and the lawyer could potentially pursue legal action against the apprentice for breaking and entering or other related charges. However, the question specifically asks about the lawyer's claim against the columnist for invasion of right to privacy."
