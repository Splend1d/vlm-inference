Before receiving an answer, the purchasing agent called the wholesaler to state, \"We are confronting a critical financial crisis and cannot afford to make the purchase.\" The seller sent an acceptance form the next day, and shipped the goods with an invoice. When the purchasing company did not pay and shipped the goods back, the seller sued for his lost profit. The seller claimed that the purchasing agent's words did not clearly communicate a revocation of the offer. Will the seller prevail?\n\nA. Yes, because a revocation of an offer requires explicit words of rejection in order to be enforced.\nB. Yes, because the seller must be able to rely on a definite order of goods.\nC. No, because the words of revocation were clear enough to communicate that the deal was off.\nD. No, because a buyer is never in breach of an agreement when it rejects goods prior to their shipment.\n"

No, because the words of revocation were clear enough to communicate that the deal was off.\n\nThe purchasing agent's statement that they \"are confronting a critical financial crisis and cannot afford to make the purchase\" can be considered as a clear communication of intent to revoke the offer or cancel the potential contract. The seller should have taken this as a notice that the purchasing company no longer wished to proceed with the transaction. Since the revocation occurred before the seller shipped the goods and sent the invoice, the seller does not have grounds to sue for lost profits. The key point here is that the revocation was made before any acceptance could be considered valid, thus there was no enforceable contract at the time of shipping."
