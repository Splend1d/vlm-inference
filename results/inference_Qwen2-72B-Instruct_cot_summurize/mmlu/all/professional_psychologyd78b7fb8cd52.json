Confidential information may indeed be revealed to others only with the consent of the client. This is a fundamental principle of confidentiality.\n\nC. Case material may be discussed with colleagues concerned with the case only when a formal release of information has been obtained from the client. This ensures that information is shared only on a need-to-know basis and respects the client's privacy.\n\nD. There are exceptions to the obligation to maintain confidentiality. For instance, if there is a legal requirement to disclose information (such as in cases of suspected abuse or when ordered by a court), or if there is an imminent risk of harm to the client or others.\n\nHowever, statement B is not universally true. It is possible to discuss anonymized and generalized experiences in public lectures without revealing identifying information about clients, which would not be considered unethical. The key is to ensure that no specific client can be identified from the information shared."
