Sudden reduction in the animal food resource\n\nBiotic factors are those that involve living things and their interactions with other living organisms, while abiotic factors are non-living components of an ecosystem such as sunlight, temperature, water, and soil. Options A, B, and C are all examples of abiotic factors since they involve natural events or environmental conditions not directly related to living organisms. Option D involves a change in the availability of a food resource, which can directly impact the survival and reproduction rates of animals, thereby affecting population growth. This is a biotic factor because it relates to the interaction between living organisms."
