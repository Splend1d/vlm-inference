An overflow error occurred.\n\nWhen using 3 bits to represent integers, the largest number you can represent in binary is 111, which is equal to 7 in decimal (1*2^2 + 1*2^1 + 1*2^0 = 4 + 2 + 1 = 7). Adding 5 and 3 together gives 8 in decimal, which cannot be represented with 3 bits since it exceeds the maximum value of 7. Therefore, an overflow error occurs, and the result wraps around to 0 due to the modulo arithmetic of binary addition within a fixed number of bits."
