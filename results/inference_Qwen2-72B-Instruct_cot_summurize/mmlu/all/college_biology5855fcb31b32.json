In monocot plants, this process begins when water crosses the plasma membrane of the endodermal cells. The endodermis is a layer of cells that surrounds the vascular cylinder in the root. It regulates the passage of substances from the cortex to the stele (the central vascular tissue). The endodermal cells have a specialized structure called the Casparian strip, which makes them impermeable to water and solutes except through the cell membrane. This forces water and solutes to enter the root via the symplast (cytoplasm of living cells), where they can be regulated by the plant."
