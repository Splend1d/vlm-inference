The next generation is likely to develop their arguments in engagements with policy questions and in direct interaction with policymakers and think tanks.\nB. Policy knowledge reflected in terms of theories, when an interaction emerges between the US and European thinkers, the theoretical context will be the same.\nC. The set up continues to be one in which security studies is located between the IR discipline and technical experts and practitioners.\nD. European security studies will be treated as a form of (policy) knowledge, whereas security theory in the US will treat this as the main empirical source for critical analysis.\n"

Engagement with policy: One of the most important contributions of critical security studies is its focus on engaging with policy questions and interacting directly with policymakers and think tanks. This engagement helps bridge the gap between academia and practice, ensuring that security policies are informed by rigorous academic research and critical perspectives.\n\nB. Transatlantic dialogue: Critical security studies have facilitated a dialogue between US and European thinkers, leading to a shared theoretical context. This dialogue enriches the field by incorporating diverse perspectives and fostering a more comprehensive understanding of global security challenges.\n\nC. Interdisciplinary approach: Security studies remains situated between the International Relations (IR) discipline and technical experts and practitioners. This interdisciplinary approach allows for a more holistic understanding of security issues, incorporating insights from various fields such as political science, sociology, economics, and military strategy.\n\nD. Distinctive approaches: While European security studies often focus on policy knowledge and practical applications, security theory in the US tends to emphasize critical analysis. This distinction allows for a rich exchange of ideas and methodologies, contributing to the overall development of the field.\n\nIn conclusion, the new critical schools of security studies have not merely become a subset of IR but have instead enriched the field by fostering engagement with policy, promoting transatlantic dialogue, maintaining an interdisciplinary approach, and encouraging distinctive approaches to security theory. These developments have solidified the position of security studies as a distinct and vital discipline within the broader landscape of social sciences."
