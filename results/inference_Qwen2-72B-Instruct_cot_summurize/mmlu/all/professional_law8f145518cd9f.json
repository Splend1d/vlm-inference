The defendant denied that he stamped the letters. There were no witnesses to the defendant stamping the letters. The prosecution attempted to present a co-worker to testify that defendant maintained sole control of the stamp and used it once daily at 3 p.m. to sign all outgoing letters, and then immediately returned it to his safe. The co-worker would testify that he saw the defendant using the stamp in that habitual manner over a period of many years. The defense objected because this did not prove that the defendant's practice was followed on the dates in question. Under the Federal Rules of Evidence, what will the court rule?\n\nA. The testimony is inadmissible because evidence of habit is not admissible in a criminal case under the Federal Rules of Evidence.\nB. The testimony is inadmissible because evidence of prior habit will only distract the jury from deciding whether the defendant actually acted that way on the specified dates.\nC. The testimony is admissible because it proves that the defendant was the only person who could have used the stamp.\nD. The testimony is admissible because habit and routine practice are admissible under the Federal Rules of Evidence.\n"

The testimony is admissible because habit and routine practice are admissible under the Federal Rules of Evidence.\n\nUnder Federal Rule of Evidence 406, evidence of a person\u2019s habit or routine practice is admissible to prove that on a particular occasion the person acted in accordance with the habit or routine practice. The co-worker's testimony about the defendant's habitual use of the stamp and the routine practice of signing all outgoing letters at 3 p.m. and returning the stamp to his safe can be relevant to show that the defendant likely acted in accordance with that habit on the specific dates in question. This testimony can help establish the defendant's regular practice, which in turn can support an inference that the defendant likely followed the same practice when the letters in question were mailed."
