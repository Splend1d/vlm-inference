This type of evidence may be admissible if it is used to show that the plaintiff has a history of making similar allegations, which could suggest that the current claim may not be genuine. However, the judge will have to weigh the probative value of the evidence against the potential for undue prejudice to the plaintiff before admitting it. The best evidence rule does not apply here because the certified copies of court proceedings are themselves the best evidence of the prior lawsuits."
