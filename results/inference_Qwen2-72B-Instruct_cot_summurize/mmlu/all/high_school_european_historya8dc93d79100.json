As the present sciences are useless for the discovery of effects, so the present system of logic is useless for the discovery of the sciences.\nXIX. There are and can exist but two ways of investigating and discovering truth. The one hurries on rapidly from the senses and particulars to the most general axioms, and from them, as principles and their supposed indisputable truth, derives and discovers the intermediate axioms. This is the way now in use. The other constructs its axioms from the senses and particulars, by ascending continually and gradually, till it finally arrives at the most general axioms, which is the true but unattempted way.\nXXII. Each of these two ways begins from the senses and particulars, and ends in the greatest generalities&\u2026\nXXXVI. We have but one simple method of delivering our sentiments, namely, we must bring men to particulars and their regular series and order, and they must for a while renounce their notions, and begin to form an acquaintance with things.\"\nFrancis Bacon, English philosopher and essayist, Novum Organum, 1620\nBy the 1800s, the method of empirical reasoning reflected in the passage had undergone which of the following changes?\n\nA. It had weakened to the point of irrelevance.\nB. It had become a core principle of European culture.\nC. It had been refined and changed by so many people that it had become unrecognizable to those such as Bacon who had pioneered it.\nD. It had stagnated to the point that the common person had begun to search for a new organizing principle of life.\n"

It had become a core principle of European culture.\n\nBy the 1800s, Bacon's empirical method, which emphasized observation, experimentation, and the gradual accumulation of knowledge from specific instances to more general principles, had become a cornerstone of the scientific revolution and the Enlightenment. This approach influenced not only science but also philosophy, politics, and society at large in Europe. The scientific method, rooted in empirical reasoning, was widely accepted and applied across various disciplines, making it a core principle of European culture."
