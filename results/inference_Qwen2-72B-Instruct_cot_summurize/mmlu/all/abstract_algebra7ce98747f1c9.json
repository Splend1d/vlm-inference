According to the First Isomorphism Theorem for groups, if \u03c6: G \u2192 H is a homomorphism from a group G to a group H, then the image of \u03c6, Im(\u03c6), is isomorphic to the quotient group G/K, where K is the kernel of \u03c6. This means that every homomorphic image of a group G is indeed isomorphic to a factor group (also known as a quotient group) of G.\n\nStatement 2 is also true. The set of all homomorphic images of a group G, up to isomorphism, corresponds exactly to the set of all factor groups of G, up to isomorphism. This is because, as mentioned above, each homomorphic image is isomorphic to some factor group of G, and conversely, each factor group of G can be realized as a homomorphic image by considering the natural projection map from G onto the factor group. Therefore, the two sets are equivalent in terms of their elements being isomorphic."
