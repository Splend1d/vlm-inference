The hierarchy, from bottom to top, is as follows:\n\n1. Physiological needs (food, water, shelter, etc.)\n2. Safety needs (security, order, stability)\n3. Belongingness and love needs (friendship, intimacy, family)\n4. Esteem needs (self-esteem, respect, recognition)\n5. Self-actualization needs (fulfilling one's potential, achieving personal growth)\n\nMaslow suggested that lower-level needs must be satisfied before higher-level needs can be fully addressed. Once an individual feels a sense of accomplishment and gains the respect of others (esteem needs), they are more likely to pursue self-actualization, which is the realization of one's full potential."
