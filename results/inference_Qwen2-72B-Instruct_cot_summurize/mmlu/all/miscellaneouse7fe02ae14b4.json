Global division of labor\n\nThis scenario illustrates how companies allocate tasks and jobs to different parts of the world, often seeking lower labor costs or specific skills that might not be as cost-effective or available in their home countries. In this case, footwear companies are taking advantage of lower labor costs in Asia for manufacturing, while likely keeping higher-skilled jobs like design and marketing in their home countries in the U.S. and Europe. This is a classic example of the global division of labor."
