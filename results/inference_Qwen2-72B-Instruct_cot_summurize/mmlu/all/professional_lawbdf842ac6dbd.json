The language was insulting and harsh, but there were no attempts to make physical contact. Inside, patients were nervous and surgical procedures were intensified under the constant sounds of taunting taking place outside. The state court issued an injunction making the protesters stand 36 feet from the entrance, which put them on the other side of the street, but within clear sight of the clinic. The restriction reasonably cleared a space for ingress and egress. Since the streets are normally considered a \"public forum\" for free speech, will the appellate courts uphold the restriction?\n\nA. Yes, because their language was insulting, the restriction would be upheld as a fair restriction of speech.\nB. Yes, the injunctive restriction was a content-neutral restriction that burdened no more speech than was necessary.\nC. No, the right to protest according to one's religious beliefs about abortion cannot be regulated under the First Amendment.\nD. No, the regulation of free speech cannot be carried out by injunctive relief.\n"

Yes, the injunctive restriction was a content-neutral restriction that burdened no more speech than was necessary.\n\nThe appellate courts are likely to uphold the restriction because it is a content-neutral time, place, and manner restriction that serves a significant government interest (ensuring safe access to medical facilities) and leaves open ample alternative channels for communication. The fact that the protesters can still be seen and heard from the other side of the street suggests that their message is not being silenced, only that they must conduct their protest in a way that does not interfere with the rights of others to access healthcare services. This type of restriction has been upheld in previous Supreme Court cases, such as Hill v. Colorado, where a similar buffer zone around healthcare facilities was deemed constitutional."
