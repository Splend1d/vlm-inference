A t-test for a difference in means.\n\nThis scenario involves comparing two independent groups (the standard technique and the new technique) to see if there's a difference in their mean recovery times. The t-test for a difference in means (also known as an independent samples t-test) is appropriate for comparing the means of two independent groups to determine if they are significantly different from each other. This test does not require knowledge of the population variance, making it more suitable than a z-test, which assumes known population variance."
