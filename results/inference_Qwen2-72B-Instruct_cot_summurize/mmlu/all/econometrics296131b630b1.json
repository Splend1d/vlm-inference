Biased and inconsistent.\n\nThis is because in a simultaneous system, the variables on the right-hand side of one equation may be endogenous due to their determination by other equations in the system. This endogeneity can lead to biased and inconsistent parameter estimates when using OLS, which assumes exogeneity of the regressors. To obtain consistent estimates in such cases, methods like Two-Stage Least Squares (2SLS) or other instrumental variable techniques are typically used instead."
