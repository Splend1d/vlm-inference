After the seizure, she was confused and had difficulty thinking of some words. She has had a headache, cough, and fever for 3 days treated with acetaminophen and dextromethorphan. Her temperature is 38.9\u00b0C (102\u00b0F). Neurologic examination shows diffuse hyperreflexia. On mental status examination, she is confused and has short-term memory deficits. She has difficulty naming objects and makes literal paraphasic errors. An MRI of the brain shows bitemporal hyperintensities. A lumbar puncture is done; cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows an erythrocyte count of 340/mm3 , a leukocyte count of 121/mm3 (88% monocytes), and a protein concentration of 78 mg/dL. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\n\nA. Bacterial meningitis\nB. Dextromethorphan intoxication\nC. Herpes simplex encephalitis\nD. HIV encephalopathy\n"

The patient's symptoms of fever, headache, cough, confusion, short-term memory deficits, and difficulty naming objects, along with the neurologic examination finding of diffuse hyperreflexia and the MRI showing bitemporal hyperintensities, suggest a diagnosis of herpes simplex encephalitis. The CSF findings of an elevated erythrocyte count, leukocyte count (with a predominance of monocytes), and protein concentration also support this diagnosis.\n\nBacterial meningitis (A) typically presents with a higher degree of inflammation in the CSF, with a predominance of neutrophils rather than monocytes, and would not be expected to show bitemporal hyperintensities on MRI. Dextromethorphan intoxication (B) does not cause seizures, fever, or the specific neuroimaging findings seen in this case. HIV encephalopathy (D) usually presents with more chronic cognitive decline and motor abnormalities, without the acute onset of symptoms and specific neuroimaging findings seen in this case."
