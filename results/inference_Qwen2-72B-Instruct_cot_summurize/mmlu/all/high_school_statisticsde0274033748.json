                    "text": "To solve this problem, we can use conditional probability. The probability that a randomly selected student goes to a 4-year college given that they are not going to a 2-year college can be found using the formula:\n\n\\[ P(\\text{4-year} | \\text{not 2-year}) = \\frac{P(\\text{4-year} \\cap \\text{not 2-year})}{P(\\text{not 2-year})} \\]\n\nFirst, let's determine \\(P(\\text{4-year} \\cap \\text{not 2-year})\\). This is simply the probability of a student going to a 4-year college, since those students are not going to a 2-year college by default. We're told that 54% of graduates go on to 4-year colleges, so:\n\n\\[ P(\\text{4-year} \\cap \\text{not 2-year}) = 0.54 \\]\n\nNext, we need to calculate \\(P(\\text{not 2-year})\\). This is the probability that a student does not go to a 2-year college. Since 20% of graduates go to 2-year colleges, the remaining percentage (80%) either goes to a 4-year college, finds employment, or searches for a job. Thus:\n\n\\[ P(\\text{not 2-year}) = 1 - 0.20 = 0.80 \\]\n\nNow we can plug these values into our formula:\n\n\\[ P(\\text{4-year} | \\text{not 2-year}) = \\frac{0.54}{0.80} = 0.675 \\]\n\nSo the probability that a randomly selected student who is not going on to a 2-year college will be going on to a 4-year college is 0.675.\n\nThe correct answer is D. 0.675."
