When dramatic or emotionally charged events like air travel disasters, nuclear power accidents, or terrorist attacks occur, they tend to receive extensive media coverage, making them more memorable and easier to recall. This leads people to overestimate the likelihood of such events happening again because the images and stories are readily available in their minds."
