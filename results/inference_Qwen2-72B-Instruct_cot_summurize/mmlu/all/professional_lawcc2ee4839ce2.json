A woman, whose mother worked as a secretary to the wealthy man for years, filed a claim against the estate, alleging that she was the wealthy man's daughter. At trial, the woman's attorney called the wealthy man's butler to testify. The butler testified that it was Common knowledge in the household that the wealthy man and the woman's mother were having an affair. The butler also testified that the wealthy man had often confided in him and told him shortly after the woman's birth that the woman was the wealthy man's daughter. Upon objection by the attorney for the executor of the wealthy man's estate, the court will most likely\n\nA. sustain the objection bc butler's testimony would be violative of hearsay rule.\nB. sustain, bc butler's testimony would be violative of Dead man's statute.\nC. overrule the objection because the butler's testimony would be relevant to the ultimate issue in the case.\nD. overrule objection because the butler's testimony would qualify under the pedigree exception to the hearsay rule.\n"

Overrule the objection because the butler's testimony would qualify under the statement of personal or family history exception to the hearsay rule.\n\nExplanation: The butler's testimony about the wealthy man's statements concerning his parentage of the woman is not excluded by the hearsay rule under this exception, which allows statements about a person's own birth, adoption, marriage, divorce, or other similar events, or about another person's such events if the declarant was closely related to the person and had a particular reason to know about the matter. The butler's testimony about the affair being common knowledge in the household could also be admissible as non-hearsay evidence of the wealthy man's relationship with the woman's mother. However, the specific exception mentioned in option D is more directly applicable to the situation described. Note that \"pedigree exception\" is not a standard term used in the Federal Rules of Evidence; instead, it refers to a common law exception that has been codified in some state rules as \"statement of personal or family history.\" Additionally, the Dead Man's Statute does not apply here since the butler is not testifying to communications between himself and the deceased, but rather to statements made by the deceased that do not fall within the scope of the statute."
