It's an action taken with good intentions to help someone in danger, so it's not considered morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, playing baseball in your grandmother's backyard isn't inherently morally wrong either. It could potentially be problematic if there was a risk of damage to property or injury, but without additional context, this scenario doesn't indicate any wrongdoing. Playing a sport in a family member's yard is generally considered a normal and acceptable activity."
