When phenylalanine builds up in the body, it can lead to brain damage and mental retardation. A special diet low in phenylalanine is used to manage PKU and prevent these complications. This diet typically involves limiting or avoiding foods high in protein, which contains phenylalanine, and using specially formulated low-protein or phenylalanine-free products. Early detection through newborn screening and immediate dietary management are crucial for preventing the cognitive impairment associated with PKU."
