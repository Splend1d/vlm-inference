As people age, they can lose some of their taste buds, including those that detect sweetness. This can cause them to add more sugar or sweeteners to their food and drinks to achieve the same level of sweetness they once enjoyed. However, it's also possible that option B is correct, as some older adults may simply have a preference for sweeter foods and beverages. Options C and D are less likely explanations for why someone's grandmother might serve very sweet iced tea."
