Therefore, he argues that non-rational beings, such as human infants, the senile, and the mentally disabled, do not have direct moral standing. However, they can still be indirectly morally significant because of their potential to develop rationality or because of their importance to those who care for them. So, based on Carruthers' view, the answer would be D. none of the above, since he would argue that none of these groups inherently deserve direct moral standing. But it's important to note that Carruthers' views are controversial and many ethicists disagree with him on this point."
