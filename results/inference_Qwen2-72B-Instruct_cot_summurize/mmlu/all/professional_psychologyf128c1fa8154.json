The key point in this type of research is that there is no manipulation of an independent variable. Researchers simply gather data on two or more variables to see if there is a relationship between those variables. They can't infer causation because they didn't manipulate or control the variables in question. They're merely observing and recording data.\n\nA. This describes experimental research, where researchers manipulate one variable to determine if changes in one variable cause changes in another variable.\nB. This could be descriptive research, which involves observing and describing the characteristics of a group or situation. Intact groups mean existing groups that haven't been created by the researcher for the study.\nD. This could refer to time-series research, where repeated measures of the same variables are taken on the same subjects at different points in time."
