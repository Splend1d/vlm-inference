The following day, the artist conveys the property to a bartender; she does not record her deed. Then on February 4, the artist executes an identical conveyance of the farm to a caterer. The caterer gives the artist a check for $100,000 for the property and records the conveyance, even though he has actual knowledge of prior conveyance to the bartender. The bartender, however, records her deed on February 6. The caterer then conveys his interest in the farm to a dancer, who gives a purchase price of $115,000 to the caterer. On February 5, the dancer purchases the farm without notice of the conveyance to the bartender and duly records the deed. In conducting a title search, the dancer should pursue his investigation by looking in the\n\nA. Grantor Index under the caterer's name to ascertain if the caterer acquired title.\nB.

This is necessary because the caterer may not have had clear title if there were prior conveyances or interests that were not properly recorded or resolved.\n\nGiven the sequence of events:\n\n1. Retiree to artist (recorded)\n2. Artist to bartender (not recorded)\n3. Artist to caterer (recorded)\n4. Caterer to dancer (recorded)\n\nThe dancer would need to verify that the caterer had clear title at the time of their transaction. Since the caterer acquired the property from the artist, the dancer should first look in the Grantee Index under the caterer's name to see if the caterer indeed received the property from the artist. However, since the artist could have conveyed the property to multiple parties, the dancer should also check the Grantor Index under the artist's name to see all conveyances made by the artist.\n\nAdditionally, because the bartender did eventually record her deed after the caterer but before the dancer's recording, the dancer should also check the Grantee Index under the bartender's name to ensure that the bartender's claim does not affect the validity of the caterer's title at the time of the conveyance to the dancer.\n\nThus, the correct answer would be:\n\nC. Grantee Index under the caterer's name, then the Grantor Index under the caterer's name, and then in the Grantee Index again, this time under the artist's name to discover if he acquired title. \n\nHowever, considering the additional information about the bartender's involvement, the dancer should also consider checking the Grantee Index under the bartender's name to confirm that her claim does not affect the caterer's title. This step is not explicitly listed in the provided options, but it is implied in option C's process of thorough investigation."
