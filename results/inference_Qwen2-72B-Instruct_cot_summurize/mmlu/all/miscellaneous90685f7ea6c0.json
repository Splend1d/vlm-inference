The term comes from the nickname for Sir Robert Peel, who is considered the father of modern policing. He was the British Home Secretary who established the first professional police force in London in 1829, known as the Metropolitan Police Service. Since then, police officers in England have been called 'bobbies', as a nod to Sir Robert Peel."
