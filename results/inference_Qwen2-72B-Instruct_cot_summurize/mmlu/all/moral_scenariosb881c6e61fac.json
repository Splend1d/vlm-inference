Wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn Scenario 1, pushing an elderly woman to the ground is considered morally wrong because it involves causing harm to another person, especially one who is vulnerable due to age. This action violates the principle of non-maleficence, which is a fundamental ethical principle that requires individuals to refrain from causing harm to others.\n\nIn Scenario 2, visiting a foster home with the intention of adopting a child in need is not considered morally wrong. In fact, it could be seen as a positive and altruistic act, as it involves providing a loving home to a child who may not have one. However, it's important to note that the process of adoption should be carried out ethically and legally, respecting all the rights and needs of the child and following proper procedures. Assuming this is the case, the intention expressed in Scenario 2 is not wrong according to ordinary moral standards."
