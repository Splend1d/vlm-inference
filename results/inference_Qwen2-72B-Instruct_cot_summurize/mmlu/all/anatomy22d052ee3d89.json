The type of paralysis that results from such a stroke is usually spastic paralysis.\n\nSpastic paralysis occurs when there is damage to the upper motor neurons (UMNs), which are located in the brain and spinal cord. This damage leads to an increase in muscle tone and exaggerated tendon reflexes (hyperreflexia). In contrast, flaccid paralysis is associated with damage to lower motor neurons (LMNs), resulting in decreased muscle tone and reflexes.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. spastic paralysis."
