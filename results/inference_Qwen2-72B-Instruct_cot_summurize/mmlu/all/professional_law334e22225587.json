                    "text": "A defendant was smoking marijuana as he was driving home from work one afternoon. A police officer approached him on the freeway and stopped the car to issue a citation for speeding. As the defendant handed the officer his driver's license, the officer smelled burnt marijuana, saw the joint, and saw an open envelope on the seat next to the defendant containing a substance that looked like marijuana. The officer ordered the defendant out of the car, arrested him for unlawful possession of marijuana. The officer then searched the defendant and found a sealed envelope in the defendant's back pocket. Without asking the defendant's permission, the officer opened the envelope and discovered that it contained cocaine. The officer then unzipped one of the jacket pockets on the jacket the defendant was wearing and found more cocaine and arrested the defendant for possession of cocaine. The defendant was taken to the police station and immediately escorted to an interrogation room. He was given his Miranda warnings, waived his rights, and gave a statement admitting to possession of cocaine and marijuana. Which of the following is a correct statement of the applicable legal principles regarding the search of the defendant?\n\nA. When a police officer has made a lawful custodial arrest of an individual, he may, as a contemporaneous incident of that arrest, search the person of the individual.\nB. The exclusionary rule requires that if an officer conducts an unconstitutional search, the evidence acquired in the course of the officer's subsequent activities is inadmissible.\nC. If an individual effectively consents to a search of their person, the evidence gathered during the search is admissible.\nD. One who drives an automobile on a public highway does not have a legitimate expectation of privacy.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is A. When a police officer has made a lawful custodial arrest of an individual, he may, as a contemporaneous incident of that arrest, search the person of the individual.\n\nIn this case, the officer had probable cause to arrest the defendant for unlawful possession of marijuana after smelling burnt marijuana, seeing the joint, and seeing the open envelope with a substance that looked like marijuana. Upon arresting the defendant, the officer conducted a search of the defendant's person and found additional contraband (cocaine) in a sealed envelope in the defendant's back pocket and in the jacket pocket. This search was justified as a search incident to arrest, which allows officers to search the person of an arrestee without a warrant as a contemporaneous incident of the arrest.\n\nOption B is incorrect because while the exclusionary rule does apply when evidence is obtained through an unconstitutional search or seizure, there is no indication that the search in this case was unconstitutional. Option C is also incorrect because the defendant did not consent to the search; rather, it was conducted as a search incident to arrest. Option D is incorrect because while driving on a public highway does limit some expectations of privacy, particularly concerning the vehicle itself, individuals still retain Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable searches and seizures of their person."
