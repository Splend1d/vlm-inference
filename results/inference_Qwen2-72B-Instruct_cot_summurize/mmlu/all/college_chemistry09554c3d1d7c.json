                    "text": "The correct answer is D. I, II, and III\n\nHere's why:\n\nI. The conditional formation constant is indeed affected by pH. This is because the protonation state of the metal ion and EDTA can change with pH, which affects their ability to react with each other.\n\nII. The fraction of EDTA in the fully deprotonated Y4\u2212 form does vary with pH. Only the fully deprotonated form of EDTA (Y4\u2212) can effectively bind metal ions, so it is crucial that the pH is such that this form predominates.\n\nIII. When EDTA reacts to form a metal complex, hydrogen ions (H+) are often produced as a result of the reaction. This can cause changes in pH if not buffered, which could alter the equilibrium of the reaction and the form of EDTA available to bind the metal ion.\n\nAll three points are valid reasons for why the analyte solution and the titrant solution are both buffered at the same pH during an EDTA titration."
