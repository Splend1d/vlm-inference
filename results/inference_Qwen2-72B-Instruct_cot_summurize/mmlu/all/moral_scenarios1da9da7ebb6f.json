However, if you are implying that you took the SAT on behalf of Henry (cheating), then it would be morally wrong, but based on the sentence provided, it doesn't explicitly state cheating, so we cannot assume it's wrong without further context. Given the options provided, assuming no cheating, it's not wrong."
