Therefore, the correct answer is C. However, it's worth noting that the concept of the nuclear family has been debated among historians and sociologists, with some arguing that it was more prevalent in pre-industrial societies than others suggest. Nonetheless, Stone's work supports the idea that the nuclear family began to take shape as work and home life became more distinct from one another."
