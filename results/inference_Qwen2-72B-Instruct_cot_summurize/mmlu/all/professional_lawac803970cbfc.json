Under the applicable statute of limitations, a suit to collect on the promissory note had to have been filed by September 30 of last year. On June 1 of this year, the creditor received a letter from the debtor stating, \"I shall pay you $5,000 on July 1 in full satisfaction of what I owe you. \" However, the debtor failed to make the payment on July 1. If, on August 1, the creditor brings suit against the debtor and the debtor asserts the statute of limitations as an affirmative defense and refuses to pay the creditor anything, which of the following accurately states the creditor's legal rights against the debtor?\n\nA. On June 1 the creditor became entitled to a judgment against the debtor for $5,000 only.\nB. On July 1, not June 1, the creditor became entitled to a judgment against the debtor for $5,000 only.\nC. On July 1, not June 1, the creditor will be entitled to a judgment against the debtor for$12,000.\nD. The creditor is not entitled to anything, on either June 1 or on July 1.\n"

On July 1, not June 1, the creditor will be entitled to a judgment against the debtor for $12,000.\n\nThe debtor's letter can be considered an offer to settle the debt for a lesser amount ($5,000) than the total owed ($12,000). However, since the creditor did not accept this offer before it lapsed (by July 1), the original debt of $12,000 remained outstanding. Moreover, by failing to make the promised payment of $5,000 on July 1, the debtor breached the offer made in the letter, which can be seen as a new promise to pay, thus reviving the original debt and tolling the statute of limitations.\n\nThe creditor, therefore, has grounds to sue for the full amount of the original debt ($12,000) after July 1, when the debtor failed to fulfill the terms of their offer. The statute of limitations defense would not apply because the debtor's offer to pay part of the debt can be viewed as an acknowledgment that renews the statute of limitations."
