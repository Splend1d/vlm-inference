Autoimmune factors are involved in the pathogenesis of type 1 but not type 2 diabetes.\n\nType 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disorder where the body's immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys the beta cells in the pancreas that produce insulin. This results in a complete or near-complete lack of insulin, necessitating lifelong insulin therapy.\n\nType 2 diabetes, on the other hand, is characterized by insulin resistance, where the body does not effectively use the insulin it produces, and often there is a relative deficiency in insulin production. It is not caused by autoimmune destruction of beta cells.\n\nWhile some of the other statements may contain elements of truth, they do not accurately capture the fundamental difference between the two types of diabetes as clearly as statement C does. For example, persons with type 2 diabetes might not necessarily require lower doses of insulin (statement A), and the development of chronic complications is not exclusive to type 1 diabetes (statement B). Additionally, persons with type 1 diabetes cannot increase endogenous insulin production by taking oral hypoglycemic agents (statement D) since these medications do not stimulate insulin production in the absence of functioning beta cells."
