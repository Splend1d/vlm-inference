The prosecution offered into evidence the bank's daily deposit and tally records for a six month period, to show that total deposits did not reconcile with the total funds received and recorded. The prosecution tried to enter the records as exhibits without certification or the testimony of an official bank custodian of records. Defense counsel objected on the basis of hearsay. Is the court likely to order the evidence inadmissible without further proof of authenticity?\n\nA. No, because the trial court has wide discretion in allowing documentary evidence that is regularly kept by a business.\nB. Yes, because a qualified bank employee must first authenticate them in person or provide a certification in compliance with the rules.\nC. No, because business records kept on a regular basis are allowed as an exception to the hearsay rule and no further qualification is required.\nD. Yes, because bank records are not included in the hearsay exception for business records.\n"

Yes, because a qualified bank employee must first authenticate them in person or provide a certification in compliance with the rules.\n\nThe Federal Rules of Evidence generally require that documents be authenticated before they can be admitted into evidence. This is typically done through the testimony of a witness who can verify the document's authenticity or through a certification process that meets the requirements of the rules. Business records, including bank records, may be admissible under the hearsay exception for business records (Rule 803(6)), but this exception still requires that the record was made at or near the time of the event it documents, by someone with knowledge, and that it was kept in the course of a regularly conducted business activity. However, authentication is a separate requirement that must also be satisfied. Without proper authentication, such as through the testimony of a bank custodian of records or a proper certification, the records may indeed be ruled inadmissible."
