These larger needles can deliver fluids more quickly due to their larger diameter. They are less suitable for children (Option A) or elderly patients (Option B) due to the potential for discomfort and the risk of damage to smaller veins. Inserting a needle in the back of the hand (Option C) could apply to any patient, but the gauge of the needle would depend on the specific medical need rather than the location of the insertion."
