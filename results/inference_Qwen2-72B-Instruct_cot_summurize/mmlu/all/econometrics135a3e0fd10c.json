The purpose of Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) is indeed to find the parameter values that maximize the probability (likelihood) of observing the actual data.\n\nii) This statement is also true. Unlike standard linear regression models, GARCH models cannot be estimated using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS). Due to the non-linear and complex nature of GARCH models, they are typically estimated using MLE.\n\niii) This statement is correct. In a standard linear model, the OLS estimates for the slope and intercept coefficients will indeed be identical to those obtained from MLE. However, the estimators for the variance of the disturbances will differ slightly between OLS and MLE.\n\niv) This statement is accurate. Most software packages for econometric analysis use numerical optimization techniques to estimate GARCH models because there are no closed-form solutions or simple analytical formulas for estimating these models. Numerical methods such as quasi-Newton algorithms are commonly used to find the parameter values that maximize the likelihood function.\nHowever, it's important to note that while (ii) states that GARCH models \"can only be estimated by ML and not by OLS,\" this is true in the sense that OLS is not appropriate for estimating the parameters of a GARCH model due to its inability to account for the time-varying volatility that GARCH models are designed to capture. It doesn't mean that there are no other estimation methods at all for GARCH models; there are alternative methods, but MLE is the most common and widely used."
