This means that the only interactions are elastic collisions, which do not result in any energy loss or gain. In real gases, at low pressures and high temperatures, these assumptions are often valid, making the ideal gas law a good approximation. At high pressures and low temperatures, however, the interactions between particles become more significant, and the behavior of the gas deviates from ideality."
