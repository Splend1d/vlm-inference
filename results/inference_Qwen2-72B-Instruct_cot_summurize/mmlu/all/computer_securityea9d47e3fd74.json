The security of this scheme hinges on the properties of the PRF \\(F\\) and how it behaves under chosen-plaintext attacks (CPA).\n\nIn CPA security, an adversary can choose plaintexts and obtain their ciphertexts, encrypted under a secret key. The goal is to determine whether the adversary can distinguish between two messages with non-negligible advantage.\n\nFor the given scheme:\n\n1. **Randomness of \\(r\\)**: The value \\(r\\) is chosen uniformly at random from set \\(R\\) for each message. This ensures that each encryption is independent and unpredictable, even if the same message is encrypted multiple times.\n\n2. **XOR with PRF output**: The message is XORed with the output of the PRF \\(F(k, r)\\), which, assuming \\(F\\) is a secure PRF, should look like a random string to anyone who does not know the key \\(k\\). This property ensures that the resulting ciphertext appears random and reveals no information about the plaintext to someone without knowledge of \\(k\\).\n\n3. **Security of PRF**: A secure PRF is designed to be indistinguishable from a truly random function to any polynomial-time adversary. This means that, given outputs of \\(F\\) for various inputs, an adversary cannot tell if they came from \\(F\\) or from a truly random function.\n\nGiven these points, we can conclude that the encryption scheme \\(E\\) is semantically secure under CPA if \\(F\\) is a secure PRF. This is because the scheme effectively hides all information about the plaintext in the face of chosen-plaintext attacks, as long as \\(F\\) maintains its pseudorandom properties.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**A. Yes, whenever F is a secure PRF**\n\nThis assumes that the range of \\(R\\) is large enough to ensure that \\(r\\) values do not repeat within the scope of a single CPA experiment, which is implied by choosing \\(r\\) uniformly at random for each encryption. However, this detail is covered by the assumption that \\(F\\) is secure, as a secure PRF would typically operate over sufficiently large domains to prevent such repetitions in practical scenarios."
