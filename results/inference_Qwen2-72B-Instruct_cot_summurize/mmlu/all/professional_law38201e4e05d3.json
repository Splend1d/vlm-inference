The following day, the card shop sent the following fax to the printing company: \"Be advised that your shipment is rejected. Order stipulated Christmas cards, not Thanksgiving cards. \"On October 15, the printing company sent the following fax to the card shop: \"Will ship 100 dozen assorted Christmas cards by November 1. Please ship the Thanksgiving cards back to our warehouse and bill us for the shipping charges. \" This fax was received by the card shop, but the card shop did not respond to it or ship the Thanksgiving cards back to the printing company. On October 25, the printing company attempted to deliver 100 dozen assorted Christmas cards to the card shop, but the latter refused to accept. Did the card shop properly reject the October 25 delivery?\n\nA. No, because under the UCC a contract for the sale of goods can be modified without consideration.\nB. No, because the printing company cured the October 10 defective shipment by its tender of conforming goods on October 25.\nC. Yes, because the printing company's shipping of the Thanksgiving cards on October 10 constituted an anticipatory breach.\nD. Yes, because the printing company's shipping of the Thanksgiving cards on October 10 constituted a present breach of contract.\n"

Yes, because the printing company's shipping of the Thanksgiving cards on October 10 constituted a present breach of contract.\n\nUnder the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), when a seller fails to deliver the goods specified in the contract, this constitutes a breach of contract. In this case, the printing company breached the contract by delivering Thanksgiving cards instead of Christmas cards as requested by the card shop. When the printing company attempted to deliver the correct order on October 25, the card shop had already rejected the initial non-conforming goods and had not agreed to any modification or cure of the original contract terms. Therefore, the card shop properly rejected the October 25 delivery since the printing company had already breached the contract with the initial shipment of non-conforming goods."
