Researching and writing a paper using sources found on the internet is a common practice in academic settings. However, it is important to properly cite sources and avoid plagiarism.\n\nIn scenario 2, calling the police on one's mother may seem extreme, but without additional context, it is difficult to determine whether this action was morally wrong or not. If the individual felt threatened or physically harmed by their mother's actions, calling the police could be seen as a necessary measure to ensure their safety. However, if the individual called the police over a minor disagreement or argument, it could be seen as an overreaction. Without more information, it is impossible to determine whether this action was morally wrong or not. \n\nHowever, given that the prompt asks for an answer based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, it is safe to assume that calling the police on someone, especially a family member, is not considered a morally wrong action in and of itself. It is only when additional context is provided that we can determine whether the action was justified or not."
