Health care\n\nIn countries with a large and rapidly aging population, health care becomes a major concern due to the increased demand for medical services and long-term care facilities. Older populations tend to have higher rates of chronic diseases and require more frequent medical attention, which can put a strain on health care systems. Additionally, there may be a shortage of healthcare professionals trained to handle geriatric care, further exacerbating the issue."
