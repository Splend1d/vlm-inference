These mutations primarily affect the genes that code for proteins involved in the electron transport chain, leading to decreased energy production within the retinal ganglion cells and subsequent vision loss. The most common mutations associated with LHON are located in the MT-ND1, MT-ND4, and MT-ND6 genes, which encode subunits of Complex I (NADH dehydrogenase) of the mitochondrial respiratory chain."
