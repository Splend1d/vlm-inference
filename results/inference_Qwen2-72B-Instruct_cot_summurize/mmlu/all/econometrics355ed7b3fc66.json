Antithetic variates are used to reduce the variance in Monte Carlo simulations, which can lead to fewer replications being needed to achieve a certain level of accuracy. By pairing each random draw with its antithetical counterpart (e.g., if you draw a value from a uniform distribution between 0 and 1, the antithetical draw would be 1 minus that value), you effectively cover more of the probability space with fewer draws.\n\nii) This statement is incorrect. Antithetic variates do not involve using a similar variable with known analytical properties. Instead, they involve generating pairs of random variables that are negatively correlated.\n\niii) This statement is correct, but it needs clarification. Antithetic variates do not necessarily involve using the \"negative\" of each random draw; rather, they involve using a transformation that yields a negatively correlated counterpart. For uniformly distributed random variables, this could indeed mean using \\(1 - x\\) for each draw \\(x\\). However, for other distributions, different transformations might be necessary to ensure negative correlation.\n\niv) This statement is incorrect. Taking the reciprocal of each random draw does not necessarily result in a negatively correlated counterpart, and thus would not serve the purpose of antithetic variates."
