According to this rule, if the selection rate for any race, sex, or ethnic group is less than 80% (four-fifths) of the rate for the group with the highest selection rate, then there may be evidence of adverse impact. This rule is often used to ensure that employment practices do not discriminate against protected classes under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964."
