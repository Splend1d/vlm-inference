Muscle biopsy specimens obtained from the subjects during the resting state show significantly increased concentrations of malonyl-CoA. The increased malonyl-CoA concentration most likely directly inhibits which of the following processes in these subjects?\n\nA. Fatty acid oxidation\nB. Fatty acid synthesis\nC. Gluconeogenesis\nD. Glycogenolysis\n"

Therefore, increased concentrations of malonyl-CoA would inhibit fatty acid oxidation.\n\nAnswer: A. Fatty acid oxidation."
