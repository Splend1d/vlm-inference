Skytop evaluates capital projects using discounted cash flows at a cost of capital of 10% per year. Based upon the following table what action should Skytop take regarding acquisition of the machine and why? Future value of $1 for 4 years at 10% $1.464 Present value of $1 for 4 years at 10% $0.683 Future value of $1 ordinary annuity for 4 years at 10% $4.641 Present value of $1 ordinary annuity for 4 years at 10% $3.170 Acquire: Reason:\n\nA. Yes Net cash flow is $20000\nB. Yes Net future value is $36025\nC. No Net present value is ($750)\nD. No Net present value is ($8750)\n"

                    "text": "To determine whether Skytop Co. should acquire the machine, we need to calculate the net present value (NPV) of the cash inflows from the machine and compare it to the initial investment.\n\nThe cash inflows are $25,000 per year for four years. The present value of an ordinary annuity formula can be used to find the total present value of these cash inflows:\n\nPresent Value of an Ordinary Annuity = Payment * Present Value Factor\n\nWhere the Present Value Factor is given as 3.170 for 4 years at 10%.\n\nPV of Cash Inflows = $25,000 * 3.170 = $79,250\n\nNow we subtract the initial investment of $80,000 from the present value of the cash inflows to get the NPV:\n\nNPV = PV of Cash Inflows - Initial Investment\nNPV = $79,250 - $80,000 = - $750\n\nSince the NPV is negative, this means that the machine does not provide enough return to cover the cost of capital. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. No Net present value is ($750)\n\nSkytop Co. should not acquire the machine because the NPV is negative, indicating that the project would decrease shareholder wealth."
