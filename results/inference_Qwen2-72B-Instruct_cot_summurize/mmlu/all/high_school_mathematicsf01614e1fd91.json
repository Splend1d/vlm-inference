Eighty-five more than the square of a number: \\(x^2 + 85\\)\n2. The square of the quantity that is \\(17\\) less than the number: \\((x - 17)^2\\)\n\nSetting these equal gives us:\n\\[x^2 + 85 = (x - 17)^2\\]\n\nExpanding the right side of the equation, we get:\n\\[x^2 + 85 = x^2 - 34x + 289\\]\n\nSubtracting \\(x^2\\) from both sides and simplifying, we get:\n\\[85 = -34x + 289\\]\n\nRearranging for \\(x\\), we find:\n\\[-34x = 85 - 289\\]\n\\[-34x = -204\\]\n\nDividing both sides by \\(-34\\), we get:\n\\[x = \\frac{-204}{-34} = 6\\]\n\nTherefore, the number is \\(\\boxed{6}\\), which corresponds to option B."
