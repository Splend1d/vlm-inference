There is a sign warning \"this elevator is not available at this time, please do not ride it.\" A passenger sees the signs, but tries to ride the elevator anyway, and is injured when she falls into the shaft. When the passenger sues the city for negligence, the city states that she assumed the risk. Is that a valid and accurate defense under the circumstances?\n\nA. Yes, because she was fully informed and should have known that the elevator was unsafe based upon the signs.\nB. Yes, because the signs make her contributorily negligent and a legal cause of her own injury.\nC. No, because the sign did not explain the danger and only told her that it was not available, and she therefore did not know what she was encountering.\nD. No, because the city has strict liability when everyone is depending on the subway.\n"

No, because the sign did not explain the danger and only told her that it was not available, and she therefore did not know what she was encountering. While the sign warned that the elevator was not available, it did not specifically warn of the danger of falling into the shaft. Therefore, the passenger may not have been aware of the specific risk she was taking by attempting to use the elevator. Additionally, the concept of \"assumption of risk\" generally requires that the person knew of the risk and voluntarily chose to take it, which may not have been the case here. The city may still be liable for failing to provide adequate warnings or barriers to prevent people from accessing the dangerous area. Answer D is incorrect because strict liability typically applies in situations where the defendant engaged in an inherently dangerous activity, such as transporting hazardous materials, rather than in cases of ordinary negligence like this one. Answer B is also incorrect because contributory negligence is not a complete defense in many jurisdictions, and even if it were, it would not necessarily absolve the city of liability if they were also negligent in failing to provide adequate warnings or barriers."
