Biotin, also known as vitamin B7, serves as a coenzyme for carboxylase enzymes, which catalyze the carboxylation reactions in the body. One such reaction is the conversion of pyruvate to oxaloacetate by the enzyme pyruvate carboxylase. This step is crucial in gluconeogenesis and the citric acid cycle (Krebs cycle)."
