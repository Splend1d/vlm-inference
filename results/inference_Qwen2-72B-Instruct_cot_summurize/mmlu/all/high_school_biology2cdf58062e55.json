This statement is false because environmental factors can also influence phenotypic variation.\nB. This statement is false because not all genetic variation produces visible or measurable changes in phenotype.\nC. This statement is false because not all nucleotide variability results in neutral variation. Some variations may have beneficial, deleterious, or no effect on the organism's fitness.\nD. This statement is true because new alleles arise through mutations, which are changes in the DNA sequence (nucleotide variability)."
