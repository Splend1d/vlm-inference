However, it's important to note that Sullivan saw schizophrenia as a disturbance in interpersonal relationships leading to a breakdown in the parataxic mode, where the individual begins to interpret present situations based on past experiences, often leading to delusions and hallucinations. But, strictly speaking, the parataxic mode itself is not a characteristic of schizophrenic behavior; rather, it's the distortion of this mode (Parataxic Distortion Mode) that is more closely associated with schizophrenia in Sullivan's theory. Since the question asks for a single answer, option A is the closest, but the explanation provided here gives a more nuanced understanding of Sullivan's perspective."
