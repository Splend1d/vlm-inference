To minimize risk of cross-infection.\n\nHospitals often advise patients to bring their own personal items, such as an electric razor, to reduce the risk of spreading infections. Sharing razors can lead to the transmission of bacteria and viruses from one person to another. Using a personal electric razor minimizes this risk because it is not shared with other patients."
