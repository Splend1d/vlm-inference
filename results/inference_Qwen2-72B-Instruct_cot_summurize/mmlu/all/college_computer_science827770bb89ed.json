III only.\n\nHorizontal microarchitecture features microinstructions with a single opcode and multiple operand specifiers, allowing for parallel execution of operations. This characteristic makes horizontal microinstructions more complex but can lead to more efficient use of hardware resources and potentially faster execution compared to vertical microinstructions.\n\nStatement I is false because programs for horizontal architectures do not necessarily require more time steps than those for vertical architectures; it depends on the specific design and the program being executed.\n\nStatement II is also false because horizontal microinstructions are not unencoded. They are encoded in a way that allows for parallel execution by specifying operands directly in the microinstruction format."
