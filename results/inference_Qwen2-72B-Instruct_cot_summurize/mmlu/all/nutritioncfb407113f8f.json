This definition was established by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 1994. Osteopenia, on the other hand, is defined as a bone density between 1 and 2.5 standard deviations below the average for young adult women. \n\nAs for the other options:\n\nA. Women over age 80 with osteopenia do not have above average bone mineral density for their age. In fact, they have lower than average bone density.\n\nB. More than 10% of women over age 50 have osteopenia. According to the National Osteoporosis Foundation, about half of women over age 50 have osteopenia.\n\nC. More than 50% of women over age 80 have osteopenia or osteoporosis. According to the National Osteoporosis Foundation, about two-thirds of women over age 80 have osteopenia or osteoporosis."
