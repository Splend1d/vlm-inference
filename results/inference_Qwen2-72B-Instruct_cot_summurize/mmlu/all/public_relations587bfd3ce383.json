Page was a prominent figure in the field of public relations and is known for his work as the director of public relations for AT&T from 1927 to 1945. He advocated for the strategic importance of public relations within corporate management, insisting that PR professionals should have a seat at the executive decision-making table. This was a significant shift from the earlier view of public relations as merely a promotional or publicity function. The Arthur W. Page Society, an organization dedicated to advancing the role of senior public relations professionals in the management process, is named in his honor."
