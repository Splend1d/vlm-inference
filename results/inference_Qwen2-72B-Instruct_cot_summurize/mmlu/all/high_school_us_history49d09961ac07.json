In the Providence of God, I am the voice of the maniac whose piercing cries from the dreary dungeons of your jails penetrate not your Halls of Legislation. I am the Hope of the poor crazed beings who pine in the cells, and stalls, and cages, and waste rooms of your poor-houses. I am the Revelation of hundreds of wailing, suffering creatures, hidden in your private dwellings, and in pens and cabins\u2014shut out, cut off from all healing influences, from all mind-restoring cares.\u2026 Could their melancholy histories be spread before you as revealed to my grieved spirit during the last three months, how promptly, how earnestly would you search out the most approved means of relief; how trifling, how insignificant, by comparison, would appear the sacrifices you are asked to make; how would a few dimes and dollars, gathered from each citizen, diminish in value as a possession, compared with the certain benefits and vast good to be secured for the suffering insane...by the consecration and application of a sufficient fund to the construction of a suitable hospital.\u2026\n\u2014Dorothea Dix, Memorial Soliciting a State Hospital for the Protection and Cure of the Insane,\nSubmitted to the General Assembly of North Carolina, November 1848\nWhich of the following best reflects the perspective of Dorothea Dix in the passage above?\n\nA.

The care of the mentally ill is a state concern.\n\nDorothea Dix's perspective, as presented in the passage, advocates for the establishment of a state hospital for the protection and cure of the insane. She appeals to the General Assembly of North Carolina to take responsibility for the care of the mentally ill, emphasizing that they are currently neglected and mistreated without proper institutional support. This aligns with the idea that the care of the mentally ill should be a state concern, as she is seeking state intervention and funding to address the issue."
