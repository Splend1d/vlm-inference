Critics argue that utilitarianism might justify actions that are intuitively unjust if they happen to maximize overall happiness or well-being. For example, it could be argued that sacrificing an innocent person's life to save five others might be justified under strict utilitarian principles, which many people find morally objectionable. In response, Mill attempted to incorporate considerations of justice into his version of utilitarianism by emphasizing the importance of individual rights and the happiness that results from a just society."
