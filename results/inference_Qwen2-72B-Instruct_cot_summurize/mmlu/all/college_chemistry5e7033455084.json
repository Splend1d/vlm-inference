                    "text": "The nuclear magneton (\u03bcN) is the physical quantity that relates the magnetic moment of a nucleus to its angular momentum. The value of \u03bcN is approximately 5.05078353 x 10^-27 J T^-1.\n\nThe magnetic moment (\u03bcI) of a nucleus can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\u03bcI = gI * \u03bcN * I\n\nwhere:\ngI is the nuclear g-factor, which is approximately 0.25 for 13C,\n\u03bcN is the nuclear magneton,\nI is the spin quantum number of the nucleus, which is 1/2 for 13C.\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula gives:\n\n\u03bcI = 0.25 * 5.05078353 x 10^-27 J T^-1 * 1/2\n   = 6.31347941625 x 10^-28 J T^-1\n\nThis value is not exactly equal to any of the options given, but it is closest to option D, 1.1445 x 10^-28 J T^-1. However, this answer does not accurately represent the calculation based on the standard values and formulas used in physics. It seems there might be an error either in the question or the options provided. \n\nIn a more accurate context, the magnetic moment of a 13C nucleus would be closer to 6.31 x 10^-28 J T^-1."
