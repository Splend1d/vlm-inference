Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn both scenarios, the actions taken by the main character do not constitute clear moral wrongdoing according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. In Scenario 1, the action taken is a common form of discipline for children when they misbehave, often referred to as a \"time-out.\" This method is generally considered an appropriate way to teach children about consequences and proper behavior. In Scenario 2, walking one's dog is a responsible pet owner activity, ensuring the animal gets necessary exercise and stimulation. Neither scenario involves any action that would be considered morally wrong under ordinary circumstances."
