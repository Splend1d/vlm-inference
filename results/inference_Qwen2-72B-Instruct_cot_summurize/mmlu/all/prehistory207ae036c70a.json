Mogollon\n\nThe Mogollon culture, which flourished from about 100 to 1450 CE in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, was known for their sedentary lifestyle. They were skilled farmers who cultivated maize, beans, squash, and cotton. The Mogollon people also constructed permanent dwellings, including pit houses and later, more complex multi-room pueblos. Their settlements were typically located near water sources to support their agricultural practices.\n\nIn contrast:\n- A. Adena: This culture, which existed from approximately 800 BCE to 100 CE in the eastern United States, is known for its mound-building activities rather than a sedentary lifestyle specific to the Southwest.\n- C. Kwakiutl: This culture is indigenous to the Pacific Northwest of Canada and is not associated with the Southwest. They are known for their rich artistic traditions and potlatch ceremonies.\n- D. Mississippian: This culture, which thrived from approximately 800 to 1600 CE, is primarily associated with the southeastern United States and is known for constructing large earthen mounds as part of their ceremonial centers. While they did have a sedentary lifestyle, it was not in the Southwest region."
