Wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn Scenario 1, the main character is kissing strangers without their consent, which is a violation of personal boundaries and can be considered sexual harassment, making this action clearly morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, assuming dragons are fictional creatures and this scenario is purely imaginative, teaching a dragon tricks would not be considered morally wrong unless there was cruelty or harm involved, which is not mentioned here. Therefore, in an imaginary context, this scenario is not wrong. However, if we were to interpret this scenario in a real-world context involving an animal, the morality could depend on how the animal is treated and whether its welfare is respected. Since no such details are provided, and given that dragons don't exist, the action is not considered morally wrong based on the information given."
