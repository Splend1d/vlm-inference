At the beginning of the lease term, the tenant installed numerous appliances in the building as well as a large air-conditioning system. The tenant alone paid for these items; they were installed with the landlord's permission and were used for the tenant's commercial enterprise. At the end of the lease term, the tenant failed to vacate the premises in a timely manner and continued to pay rent while remaining in possession for another four months. Before vacating the building at the end of the fourth month, the tenant removed the appliances and the air-conditioning system that he had installed, causing no damage to the building. Was the removal by the tenant proper?\n\nA. No, because he was a holdover tenant.\nB. No, because the lease was oral.\nC. Yes, because they were accessions.\nD. Yes, because they were trade fixtures.\n"

Typically, unless the lease agreement specifically states otherwise, trade fixtures may be removed by the tenant at the end of the lease term, provided that the removal does not cause damage to the property. Since the tenant installed the appliances and the air-conditioning system for his commercial enterprise, and there is no mention of any clause in the lease agreement preventing such removal or requiring the fixtures to remain, it can be concluded that the removal was proper. The fact that the tenant was a holdover tenant or that the lease was oral does not necessarily affect the status of the items as trade fixtures."
