Extent of responsibility multiplied by actual harm done.\n\nIn this context, 'r' represents the extent of the individual's responsibility for the wrongdoing, and 'H' represents the actual harm caused by the wrongdoing. This formula suggests that the severity of punishment should be proportional to both the level of responsibility the offender had in committing the crime and the amount of harm that resulted from the crime."
