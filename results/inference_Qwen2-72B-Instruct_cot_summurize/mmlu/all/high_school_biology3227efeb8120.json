It plays a key role in controlling voluntary muscular movements and also controls higher functions like reasoning, thinking, perception, and memory. The hippocampus, a structure located within the cerebrum, is particularly important for memory formation and consolidation.\n\nWhile other parts of the brain (like the cerebellum, medulla, and pons) have specific roles in functions such as motor control, sleep, and breathing, they are not primarily responsible for memory processes."
