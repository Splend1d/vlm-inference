This can be interpreted as:\n\n\\[1 + \\frac{1}{11}\\]\n\nTo convert this into an improper fraction, we need to have the same denominator for both parts of the mixed number. Since the whole number is 1, it can be written as \\(\\frac{11}{11}\\) (because any number divided by itself equals 1). Thus,\n\n\\[1 + \\frac{1}{11} = \\frac{11}{11} + \\frac{1}{11}\\]\n\nAdding these fractions together gives us:\n\n\\[\\frac{11+1}{11} = \\frac{12}{11}\\]\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nC. 12 over 11"
