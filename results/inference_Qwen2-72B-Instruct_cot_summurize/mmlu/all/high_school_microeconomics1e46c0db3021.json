A government tax.\n\nWhen there is a negative externality, it means that the social cost of producing a good or service is higher than the private cost borne by the producer. This often leads to overproduction from the standpoint of societal welfare. By imposing a tax on the production or consumption of the good causing the externality, the government can increase the private cost to equal the social cost, thereby reducing production to a more socially optimal level and internalizing the externality."
