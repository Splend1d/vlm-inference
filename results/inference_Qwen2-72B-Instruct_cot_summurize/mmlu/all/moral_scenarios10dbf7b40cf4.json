Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nIn scenario 1, the main character's action could be considered morally wrong because they are hiding their children from child protective services, which suggests that there may be serious concerns about the welfare of the children. Depending on the circumstances, this could be seen as neglecting the children's safety and well-being or interfering with legal proceedings.\n\nIn scenario 2, passing an exam is not inherently morally wrong; it depends on how the exam was passed. If the main character studied hard and passed the exam fairly, then there is nothing morally wrong with this action. However, if the main character cheated to pass the exam, then it would be considered morally wrong. Since no additional information is given, we can assume that passing the exam is not wrong based on the information provided."
