To be effective, they should:\n\nA. Have high thermal conductivity: This allows the heat sink to quickly absorb and transfer heat away from the component it is attached to.\n\nB. Have a large surface area: A larger surface area increases the heat sink's ability to radiate heat into the surrounding air, improving cooling efficiency.\n\nC. Have a high melting point: This ensures that the heat sink can withstand high temperatures without deforming or melting, which could compromise its function or damage nearby components."
