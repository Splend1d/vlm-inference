A genome of ds circular DNA encoding around 8 ORF\n\nPapillomaviruses are known for their double-stranded circular DNA genomes which typically encode around eight open reading frames (ORFs). These ORFs code for various proteins, some of which play key roles in the viral life cycle and can contribute to cellular transformation leading to cancer."
