The formula for kinetic energy \\(K\\) is \\(\\frac{1}{2}mv^2\\), where \\(m\\) is the mass and \\(v\\) is the velocity.\n\nThe derivative of kinetic energy with respect to time, which gives us the rate of change of kinetic energy (power), can be written as:\n\\[ \\frac{dK}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}mv^2\\right) = mv\\frac{dv}{dt} \\]\n\nGiven that \\(\\frac{dK}{dt} = -6.0\\, \\text{J/s}\\) and \\(v = 3.0\\, \\text{m/s}\\), we can substitute these values into the equation:\n\\[ -6.0 = m(3.0)\\frac{dv}{dt} \\]\n\nThe term \\(\\frac{dv}{dt}\\) represents acceleration (\\(a\\)), so we have:\n\\[ -6.0 = 3ma \\]\n\nTo find the force (\\(F\\)) acting on the particle, we use Newton's second law of motion, \\(F = ma\\). Substituting \\(ma = \\frac{-6.0}{3}\\):\n\\[ F = \\frac{-6.0}{3} = -2.0\\, \\text{N} \\]\n\nHowever, since the question asks for the magnitude of the force, the negative sign indicates direction but does not affect the magnitude. Therefore, the magnitude of the force is \\(2.0\\, \\text{N}\\).\n\nThe correct answer is B. 2.0 N."
