                    "text": "A widower was the record owner of a lemon grove, a 30-acre parcel of land in a suburb. The widower lived in a farmhouse on the lemon grove and used the property to raise produce. Adjoining the lemon grove directly to the west was a 10-acre farm that was owned in fee simple by a farmer. There was a four-lane highway that adjoined the lemon grove directly to the east. The widower, by way of gift, executed a deed naming his daughter as grantee. The deed granted to the daughter and her heirs an antebellum mansion located near the southern edge of the lemon grove. The antebellum mansion was accessible by a little- used road that ran west to east from the farmlgrove border to the four-lane highway along the southern boundary of the grove. The daughter recorded her deed and took immediate possession of the property. A short while later, the daughter and the farmer fell in love and began seeing each other quite frequently. In order for the farmer to reach the daughter's house, it was necessary for him to travel over the little-used road across the lemon grove. Many years later, the farmer, who was still having an affair with the daughter, met her father at a Rotary Club meeting. They struck up a conversation, and the widower asked the farmer, \"Have you been driving your pickup along that little-used back road on my property?\" The farmer, who was afraid to tell the widower about his love affair with the daughter, responded with a half-truth, \"Yes, I've been using it as a shortcut to the four-lane highway. \" Unaware that the farmer was also using the path to get to the antebellum mansion to see the daughter, the widower said, \"No problem, I just wanted to be sure that it was you who was using the road. \"Thereafter, the widower found out about his daughter's relationship with the farmer. Infuriated, the widower confronted the farmer and told him, \"Listen, you lying sneak, if I catch you on my property again, I'm going to have you arrested for trespass. \" The farmer replied, \"Sorry, Pops, but I've acquired an easement over that roadway, and I'll continue to use it anytime I want. \"Then, the widower institutes an appropriate action to enjoin the farmer from using the roadway across the lemon grove. If the widower prevails, it will be because the farmer's use was\n\nA. fraudulent.\nB. permissive.\nC. not continuous.\nD. not open and notorious.\n"

                    "text": "The farmer's use of the roadway was initially permissive, as the widower had given him tacit permission to use it as a shortcut to the four-lane highway. However, when the farmer continued to use the road after being explicitly forbidden by the widower, his use became unauthorized. More importantly, for the farmer to claim an easement by prescription (which is likely what he is referring to), his use of the road must have been open, notorious, continuous, and adverse for the statutory period, which typically ranges from 5 to 20 years, depending on jurisdiction.\n\nIn this scenario, the farmer's use of the road to visit the daughter was not entirely open and notorious. He intentionally misled the widower about the true nature of his use, which was not only to take a shortcut but also to visit the daughter secretly. This deceit could be seen as a lack of open and notorious use since the farmer did not fully disclose his reasons for using the road to the widower. Therefore, if the court finds that the farmer's use was not entirely open and notorious due to his deception, the widower would prevail in his action to enjoin the farmer from using the roadway.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\nD. not open and notorious."
