Not wrong, Wrong\n\nIn Scenario 1, driving someone home after they've had too much to drink could be seen as a responsible action, assuming you were sober and capable of driving safely. However, if you were also under the influence or not in a condition to drive safely, it would be considered wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, depositing a large turd in the punchbowl is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. This act is intentionally disruptive, unsanitary, and disrespectful to others. It can cause harm to people's health and well-being, and it violates social norms of cleanliness and respect for communal property."
