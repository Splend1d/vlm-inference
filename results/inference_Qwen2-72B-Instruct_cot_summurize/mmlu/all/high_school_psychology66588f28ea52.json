In this experiment, an infant named Albert was conditioned to fear a white rat through classical conditioning techniques. However, such studies are now considered unethical due to the potential harm they can cause to the subjects. Current ethical guidelines for research with human participants emphasize the importance of informed consent, minimizing harm, and protecting vulnerable populations, including children. Conditioning a baby to fear a rat or other small animals would likely be seen as causing unnecessary psychological distress and would therefore violate these ethical guidelines."
