After ruling out pregnancy, further evaluation for the cause of her symptoms can be pursued, such as C. complete blood count, to check for signs of infection or anemia, or upper endoscopy if there is concern for bleeding in the upper gastrointestinal tract. However, given the information provided, a urine pregnancy test should be the first step."
