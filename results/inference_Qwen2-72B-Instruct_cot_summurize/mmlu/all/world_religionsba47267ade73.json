Pope Gregory I (reigned 590-604) promoted the cults of St. Peter and St. Paul as part of his efforts to strengthen the authority of the papacy in Rome and throughout Christendom. He emphasized the apostolic origins of the church and the role of St. Peter as the first pope, thus reinforcing the idea of papal supremacy. However, it's important to note that the promotion of these saints was not limited to just one pope but was an ongoing effort by many popes over centuries."
