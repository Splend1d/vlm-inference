The LCM of three numbers is the smallest number that is a multiple of all three numbers.\n\nThe orbital periods of the planets are:\n- Planet X: 360 days\n- Planet Y: 450 days\n- Planet Z: 540 days\n\nLet's break each number down into its prime factors:\n\n- \\(360 = 2^3 \\times 3^2 \\times 5\\)\n- \\(450 = 2 \\times 3^2 \\times 5^2\\)\n- \\(540 = 2^2 \\times 3^3 \\times 5\\)\n\nTo find the LCM, we take the highest power of each prime number that appears in the factorization of any of the numbers:\n\n- For \\(2\\), the highest power is \\(2^3\\).\n- For \\(3\\), the highest power is \\(3^3\\).\n- For \\(5\\), the highest power is \\(5^2\\).\n\nThus, the LCM is \\(2^3 \\times 3^3 \\times 5^2 = 8 \\times 27 \\times 25 = 5400\\).\n\nTherefore, the minimum positive number of days before planets X, Y, and Z are all in the exact same locations again is 5400 days.\n\nThe correct answer is B. 5400."
