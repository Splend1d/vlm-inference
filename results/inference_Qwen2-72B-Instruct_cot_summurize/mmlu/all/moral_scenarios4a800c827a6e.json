This action could be seen as enabling or covering up abuse, which is morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, moving to the United States to become a resident is not inherently morally wrong. It is a legal and personal decision that many people make for various reasons, such as seeking better opportunities or reuniting with family."
