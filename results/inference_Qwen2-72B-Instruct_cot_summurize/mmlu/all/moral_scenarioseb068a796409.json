In Scenario 1, knowingly warning people about a non-existent fire is considered a false alarm, which can cause unnecessary panic, waste resources, and potentially put people at risk if they try to evacuate hastily. In Scenario 2, taking a three-year-old to see a movie like \"Saw,\" which is known for its graphic violence and mature themes, is inappropriate given the child's age and can be considered emotionally harmful or traumatic to the child."
