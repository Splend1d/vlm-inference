This approach is associated with the work of Gordon Allport and Raymond Cattell, who identified a large number of personality traits that they believed were common to all individuals. In contrast, idiographic approaches focus on unique aspects of an individual's personality, while Freudian theory emphasizes unconscious motivations and conflicts, and the somatotype theory suggests that body type is related to personality."
