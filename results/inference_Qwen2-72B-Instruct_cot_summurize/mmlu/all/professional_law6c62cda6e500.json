The bar was crowded because a championship boxing match was being shown on the television sets in the bar, and many people had gone to the bar to watch it. During the second round of the boxing match, someone bumped into the customer, causing him to spill a drink on his pants. \"Hey, watch what you're doing, jerk!\" the customer said. The person who had bumped the customer was an employee of the bar hired as a bouncer to deal with unruly customers. Angered by the customer's statement, the employee immediately turned around and punched the customer in the mouth. If the customer asserts a battery claim against the owner of the bar, the customer will most likely\n\nA. prevail, because it was reasonably foreseeable that fights would occur in a crowd of people who were drinking a lot of alcohol.\nB. prevail, because the person who punched the customer was employed as a bouncer.\nC. not prevail, because the owner did not touch the customer.\nD. not prevail, because the owner should not be responsible for the intentional acts of the employee.\n"

In this case, the employee (the bouncer) acted outside the scope of employment when he punched the customer in response to the customer's insult. While it might have been reasonably foreseeable that fights could occur in a crowded bar, especially during a high-stakes sporting event, the specific act of the bouncer punching the customer was not an action that the employer authorized or could have reasonably foreseen. Therefore, the bar owner is not likely to be held liable for the employee's intentional act of battery. However, the bouncer himself could potentially be held liable for battery."
