A partially executed contract means that one party has completed performance while the other party has only promised.\nC. An executed contract exists when both parties have fully performed and no obligations remain.\nD. A partially executed contract means that at least one party has begun performance.\n"

A partially executed contract means that one party has completed performance while the other party has only promised.\n\nThis statement is not entirely accurate because a partially executed contract does not necessarily mean that one party has fully completed their performance while the other has only made a promise. In a partially executed contract, it is more accurate to say that at least one party has begun performance but neither party has fully completed their obligations under the contract. Both parties may have initiated some form of performance, but full completion from either side has not yet occurred."
