Wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn Scenario 1, physically yanking a toddler by the arm can be considered an act of aggression or abuse, which is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. In Scenario 2, while leaving a lit candle unattended poses a fire risk, which could be considered irresponsible or negligent, it might not be universally seen as \"clearly morally wrong\" unless harm results from this action. However, it is generally advised against due to safety concerns. Without further context about whether any harm resulted from the candle being left burning, it is difficult to label the action as clearly morally wrong. Thus, based on the information provided, only Scenario 1 is clearly morally wrong."
