It plays a crucial role in regulating blood sugar levels and protein synthesis. When insulin binds to its receptors on muscle cells, it triggers a cascade of events that lead to the translocation of glucose transporter proteins (GLUT4) to the cell membrane, allowing glucose to enter the cell. Additionally, insulin stimulates amino acid uptake and protein synthesis within the muscle cells.\n\nAdrenaline (also known as epinephrine), glycogen, and cortisol do not directly promote glucose and amino acid uptake by muscle cells in the same way that insulin does. Adrenaline can increase blood glucose levels but also has effects that oppose insulin's actions, such as promoting glycogen breakdown in the liver. Glycogen is a stored form of glucose and is not involved in promoting glucose or amino acid uptake. Cortisol, a stress hormone, generally has catabolic effects and can increase blood glucose levels by promoting gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis."
