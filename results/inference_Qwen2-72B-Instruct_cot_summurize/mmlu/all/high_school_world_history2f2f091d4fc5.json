Prosperity ripened the principle of decay; the causes of destruction multiplied with the extent of conquest; and, as soon as time or accident had removed the artificial supports, the stupendous fabric yielded to the pressure of its own weight. . . . The victorious legions, who, in distant wars, acquired the vices of strangers and mercenaries, first oppressed the freedom of the republic, and afterwards violated the majesty of the purple. The emperors, anxious for their personal safety and the public peace, were reduced to the base expedient of corrupting the discipline which rendered them alike formidable to their sovereign and to the enemy; the vigour of the military . . . was relaxed . . . ; and the Roman world was overwhelmed by a deluge of Barbarians.\n\u2014Adapted from Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, by Edward Gibbon\nThe decline of the Roman Empire and that of its Chinese counterpart resulted in which of the following?\n\nA. A decline in the appeal of religions of salvation\nB. A shift from trade along the Silk Roads to sea routes in the Indian Ocean\nC. An increased importance of the role of the father as the head of the household\nD. A decline in the rights of women\n"

The fall of these major powers led to a decrease in the security and stability of overland trade routes like the Silk Roads. As a result, traders increasingly turned to maritime routes in the Indian Ocean, which offered safer passage and were less affected by the political turmoil on land. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. A shift from trade along the Silk Roads to sea routes in the Indian Ocean"
