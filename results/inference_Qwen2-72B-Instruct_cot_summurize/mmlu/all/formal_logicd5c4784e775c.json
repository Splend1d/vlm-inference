(\u2200x)[Bx \u2283 (\u2203y)(Ny \u2022 Lxy)]\n\nExplanation:\n\nOption A: (\u2200x)(\u2200y)[(Bx \u2022 Ny) \u2283 Lxy] - This statement says that for every x and y, if x is a bird and y is a nest, then x lives in y. This implies that every bird lives in every nest, which is not what the original statement says.\n\nOption B: (\u2200x)[Bx \u2283 (\u2203y)(Ny \u2022 Lxy)] - This statement correctly translates the original sentence. It says that for all x, if x is a bird, then there exists a y such that y is a nest and x lives in y. In other words, every bird lives in some nest.\n\nOption C: (\u2200x)[(\u2203y)(Ny \u2022 Bx) \u2283 Lxy] - This statement says that for all x, if there exists a y such that y is a nest and x is a bird, then x lives in y. However, this does not guarantee that every bird lives in some nest, only that if a bird exists and a nest exists, then the bird lives in the nest.\n\nOption D: (\u2200x)(\u2203y)[(Bx \u2022 Ny) \u2283 Lxy] - This statement says that for every x, there exists a y such that if x is a bird and y is a nest, then x lives in y. However, this does not guarantee that every bird lives in some nest, only that for each bird, there exists a nest in which it lives. But it doesn't specify that every bird has to have a nest."
