In Scenario 1, there is nothing morally wrong with opening a gift that was given to you. In Scenario 2, bathing a healthy infant daily is not necessarily wrong, though it might not be recommended for skin health reasons, it is not considered morally wrong. However, it's worth noting that some pediatricians suggest that daily bathing may not be necessary for infants and could potentially dry out their skin, but this is more of a medical recommendation than a moral issue."
