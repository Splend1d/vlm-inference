Finally, the woman hired a handyman to build a wooden stake fence between her property and her neighbor's property for $10,000. The handyman built the fence as agreed, and the woman paid him the sum of $10,000. Two weeks later, the neighbor was operating his lawn mower near the property line between his and the woman's property when a section of the fence suddenly fell on top of him, seriously injuring him. A subsequent investigation revealed that the handyman did not properly reinforce the fence. Which of the following is the handyman's best defense in a contract action brought against him by the neighbor, in which the only damages alleged are those for the neighbor's personal injuries?\n\nA. Damages for personal injuries cannot be recovered in a contract action.\nB. Damages for personal injuries to the neighbor were not within the contemplation of the woman and the handyman at the time they entered into their agreement.\nC. The neighbor is only an incidental beneficiary of the agreement between the woman and the handyman.\nD. The neighbor has no standing to assert such an action, since he was not a party to the agreement between the woman and the handyman.\n"

This principle is known as privity of contract. Since the neighbor was not a party to the contract between the woman and the handyman, he does not have standing to sue the handyman for breach of that contract.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that while the neighbor may not have standing to sue the handyman for breach of contract, he might have other legal avenues available to him, such as a tort action based on negligence or strict liability. In such an action, the neighbor could potentially recover damages for his personal injuries if he can prove that the handyman's failure to properly reinforce the fence was the cause of his injuries."
