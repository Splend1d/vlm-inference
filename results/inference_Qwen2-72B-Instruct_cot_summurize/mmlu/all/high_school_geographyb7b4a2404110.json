Based on this definition, the correct answer is:\n\nC. The market area of Winn-Dixie\n\nThis is because the market area of Winn-Dixie is organized around the stores themselves, which serve as nodes for commercial activity and have a specific catchment area where their influence is felt. Dixie, Pennsylvania, and the Pacific Northwest are examples of formal regions, defined by common characteristics such as culture, political boundaries, or physical geography, rather than a central node or function."
