In other words, we're looking for the largest LCM of numbers that add up to \\(n\\).\n\nFor \\(n = 10\\), we need to find the partition of 10 that gives us the largest LCM. The partitions of 10 include:\n\n- 10 (which has an order of 10)\n- 9 + 1 (which has an order of 9)\n- 8 + 2 (which has an order of 8)\n- 7 + 3 (which has an order of 21)\n- 7 + 2 + 1 (which has an order of 14)\n- 6 + 4 (which has an order of 12)\n- 6 + 3 + 1 (which has an order of 6)\n- 6 + 2 + 2 (which has an order of 6)\n- 5 + 5 (which has an order of 5)\n- 5 + 4 + 1 (which has an order of 20)\n- 5 + 3 + 2 (which has an order of 30)\n\nAmong these, the partition that results in the highest order is 5 + 3 + 2, which has an order of 30.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. 30."
