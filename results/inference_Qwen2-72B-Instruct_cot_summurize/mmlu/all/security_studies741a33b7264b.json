A decrease in the arms trade.\n\nThis statement is incorrect because, throughout the 20th century, there was generally an increase in the arms trade due to two world wars, the Cold War, regional conflicts, and the rise of new nation-states. The other options correctly identify trends that emerged during the 20th century: the shift towards government control of the arms trade, the overall increase in the defence trade, and the growth in the number and variety of weapons traded."
