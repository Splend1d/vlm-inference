Yes, because the hunter intentionally shot the rifle.\n\nIn tort law, battery is defined as the intentional act of making harmful or offensive contact with another person without their consent. While the hunter did not intend to shoot the hiker specifically, he did intentionally discharge his rifle, which led to the injury of the hiker. This act can be considered an intentional act that resulted in harm, potentially fulfilling the criteria for a battery claim. However, it should be noted that the specific outcome of such a claim would depend on various factors including state laws, the circumstances surrounding the shooting, and whether the hunter could be found to have acted negligently or recklessly. In many jurisdictions, a claim of negligence might be more applicable than battery in this scenario."
