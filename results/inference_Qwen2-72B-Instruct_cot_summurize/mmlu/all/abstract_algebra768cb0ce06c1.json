Since there are only two distinct possibilities, if you have three groups of order 4, at least two of them must be isomorphic to either \\(C_4\\) or \\(V\\). Therefore, this statement is **True**.\n\n### Statement 2\n\n\"If \\(Z_r + Z_s\\) is isomorphic to a subgroup \\(Z_m + Z_n\\), then \\(r\\) divides \\(m\\) and \\(s\\) divides \\(n\\).\"\n\nThis statement is not generally true. Consider the case where \\(Z_r + Z_s = Z_2 + Z_2\\) (the Klein four-group) and \\(Z_m + Z_n = Z_4 + Z_2\\). Here, \\(Z_2 + Z_2\\) is indeed isomorphic to a subgroup of \\(Z_4 + Z_2\\) (specifically, it is isomorphic to the subgroup generated by the elements \\((2,0)\\) and \\((0,1)\\) in \\(Z_4 + Z_2\\)). However, according to the statement, \\(r\\) should divide \\(m\\) and \\(s\\) should divide \\(n\\), but here \\(2\\) does not divide \\(4\\) (in the sense that we would require for the statement to be universally true). Thus, this statement is **False**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGiven the evaluation above, the correct answer is **C. True, False**."
