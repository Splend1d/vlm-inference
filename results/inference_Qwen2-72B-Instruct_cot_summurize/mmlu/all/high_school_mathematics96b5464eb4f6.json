The general formula for exponential growth is:\n\n\\[ P(t) = P_0 e^{rt} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\(P(t)\\) is the population at time \\(t\\),\n- \\(P_0\\) is the initial population,\n- \\(r\\) is the growth rate (a constant), and\n- \\(t\\) is time.\n\nWe're given that the initial population (\\(P_0\\)) is 200, and it triples in 10 hours. This means that \\(P(10) = 3 \\times 200 = 600\\).\n\nSubstituting these values into the equation gives us:\n\n\\[ 600 = 200 e^{10r} \\]\n\nSimplifying this, we get:\n\n\\[ 3 = e^{10r} \\]\n\nTaking natural logarithms on both sides:\n\n\\[ \\ln(3) = \\ln(e^{10r}) \\]\n\n\\[ \\ln(3) = 10r \\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ r = \\frac{\\ln(3)}{10} \\]\n\nNow, we want to find the population after 1 full day, which is 24 hours. Substituting \\(t=24\\), \\(P_0=200\\), and \\(r=\\frac{\\ln(3)}{10}\\) into our exponential growth formula:\n\n\\[ P(24) = 200e^{\\left(\\frac{\\ln(3)}{10}\\right) \\times 24} \\]\n\n\\[ P(24) = 200e^{2.4\\ln(3)} \\]\n\n\\[ P(24) = 200e^{\\ln(3^{2.4})} \\]\n\n\\[ P(24) = 200 \\times 3^{2.4} \\]\n\nUsing a calculator:\n\n\\[ P(24) = 200 \\times 3^{2.4} \\approx 200 \\times 24.08 \\approx 4816 \\]\n\nNone of the options match exactly, but the closest option to 4816 is:\n\nC. 2408\n\nHowever, it seems there might have been a miscalculation or misinterpretation in the provided options. The correct calculation leads to a value closer to 4816, which is not listed among the choices. Given the context and the options available, the best choice would be C. 2408, acknowledging that this does not precisely match the calculated value."
