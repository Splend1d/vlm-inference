However, some studies suggest that adequate folate levels during early pregnancy may lead to higher methylation levels at certain imprinted genes like IGF2, which could potentially influence growth and development. Therefore, option B (Methylation of IGF2 is increased) could be a plausible answer based on current research, but it's important to note that more studies are needed to confirm these findings and understand the full implications.\n\nReference: \n\n1.
