This is known as the problem of multiple comparisons or the inflation of the family-wise error rate.\n\nIn contrast, a Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA) tests the hypothesis that there are no differences among groups on any combination of dependent variables simultaneously. By testing multiple dependent variables at once, MANOVA controls the overall Type I error rate better than conducting multiple separate ANOVAs. It adjusts for the intercorrelations among the dependent variables, which can reduce the likelihood of making a Type I error when dealing with multiple outcomes.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that MANOVA does not eliminate the need for post-hoc tests if you want to understand where the group differences lie on individual dependent variables after finding a significant multivariate effect. Also, while MANOVA may offer greater protection against Type I errors, it doesn't necessarily protect against Type II errors (failing to reject a false null hypothesis) better than ANOVA. In fact, if the dependent variables are highly correlated, MANOVA might have less power to detect true effects than individual ANOVAs."
