Within the context of state collapse, elites deliberately engender disorder for the pursuit of commercial activities and the exploitation of neo-liberal globalized shadow markets which would not otherwise be permissible in normal conditions. Warlord politics represented a new form of regime security forced upon weak state elites.\nB. Warlord politics represented the entrenchment of traditional patterns of redistributive networks within society but maintained by alternative political sources. Assistance derived from superpowers was superseded by US hegemonic endorsement at the end of the Cold War.\nC. Warlord politics in response to the rapid global changes inaugurated by the end of the Cold War and by globalization, was a temporary aberration in the normal function of the state and was reflective of the immediate need to secure infrastructural survival.\nD. Warlord politics was a new phenomenon which represented the opportunistic exploitation of hollowed out state institutions and fragmented armed forces. Commercial activities accumulated in a shadow economy facilitated by the end of the Cold War, not of strategic design.\n"

The cessation of superpower rivalry led to a decrease in external support for various factions, forcing them to seek alternative sources of funding and legitimacy. This shift created an environment where warlords could exploit the void left by retreating superpowers and the weakening of central governments.\n\nOption D best captures this transformation: \"Warlord politics was a new phenomenon which represented the opportunistic exploitation of hollowed out state institutions and fragmented armed forces. Commercial activities accumulated in a shadow economy facilitated by the end of the Cold War, not of strategic design.\"\n\nHowever, elements of other options can also be seen:\n\nA. The end of the Cold War did lead to an increase in disorder in some regions, which warlords capitalized on to pursue commercial activities and exploit globalized markets.\n\nB. Traditional patterns of redistributive networks were indeed maintained by alternative political sources, such as warlords, who replaced the support once provided by superpowers.\n\nC. While warlord politics may have been a temporary aberration in some cases, it was often a response to the immediate need for survival and control over resources in the absence of strong state institutions.\n\nIn summary, the end of the Cold War contributed to the rise of warlord politics by creating a power vacuum and economic opportunities that warlords exploited to maintain their influence and control over territories."
