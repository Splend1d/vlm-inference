This is because he argues that the desire for euthanasia can often stem from depression or other psychological issues, and that by granting the request for euthanasia, we may be enabling the patient's psychological problems rather than addressing them. He also suggests that euthanasia may undermine the intrinsic value of the patient's life, and that it may lead to a loss of trust between patients and doctors. Therefore, the answer is D. we harm the patient."
