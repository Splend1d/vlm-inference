The root set includes references that are directly accessible to the garbage collector, such as global variables, local variables on the call stack, and actual parameters of active procedures. The purpose of the garbage collector is to identify and reclaim memory occupied by objects that are no longer reachable from the root set, including those on the heap. However, the dynamically allocated objects themselves are not part of the root set; it's the references to these objects held by the root set members that determine their reachability."
