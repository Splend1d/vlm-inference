                    "text": "The correct answer is D. reduced mass.\n\nThe reduced mass (\\(\\mu\\)) of a diatomic molecule like HCl or DCl plays a significant role in determining its vibrational frequency. The reduced mass is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\mu = \\frac{m_1 m_2}{m_1 + m_2}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(m_1\\) and \\(m_2\\) are the masses of the two atoms. For HCl, one atom is hydrogen (\\(^1H\\)), which has a much smaller mass than chlorine. For DCl, one atom is deuterium (\\(^2H\\)), which has a larger mass than hydrogen but still significantly less than chlorine.\n\nThe vibrational frequency (\\(\\nu\\)) of a diatomic molecule can be approximated using the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\nu = \\frac{1}{2\\pi c}\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{\\mu}}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(k\\) is the force constant associated with the bond and \\(c\\) is the speed of light. Since the force constant (\\(k\\)) for the H-Cl and D-Cl bonds are similar, the primary factor affecting the vibrational frequency is the difference in the reduced mass between HCl and DCl.\n\nIn DCl, the increased mass of deuterium leads to a larger reduced mass compared to HCl, resulting in a lower vibrational frequency. This lower frequency corresponds to a shift in the infrared absorption spectrum towards longer wavelengths (lower energy).\n\nTherefore, the infrared absorption frequency of DCl is shifted from that of HCl due to the differences in their reduced mass."
