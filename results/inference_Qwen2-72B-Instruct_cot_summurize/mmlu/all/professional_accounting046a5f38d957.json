The CPA may be assessed a tax return preparer penalty.\n\nThe CPA has a due diligence responsibility to inquire about the existence of documentation for the claimed business travel expenses. If the CPA fails to do so, and the IRS finds that the expenses were not substantiated or were improperly claimed, the CPA could potentially be assessed a penalty under the tax return preparer penalty provisions. This penalty is designed to hold tax preparers accountable for failing to exercise reasonable care in preparing tax returns. The other options listed (B, C, and D) may also have implications based on the specifics of the situation, but A is the most directly applicable to the scenario described."
