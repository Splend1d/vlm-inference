No significant difference; low-income urban and rural people face similar constraints in accessing food and consume similar diets in developing countries.\nB. It will reduce poverty and hunger because these are almost entirely concentrated in rural areas.\nC. Urban dwellers depend more than rural people on purchases to acquire food, have little opportunity to grow their own food, and so are much more vulnerable to food price increases.\nD. Poor city folk eat mainly sorghum, millet, maize and root crops, so a lot more of those foods will need to be produced as the world urbanises.\n"

Urban dwellers depend more than rural people on purchases to acquire food, have little opportunity to grow their own food, and so are much more vulnerable to food price increases.\n\nUrbanization can have both positive and negative effects on hunger and malnutrition. On one hand, cities often offer better access to services such as healthcare and education, which can improve nutrition. However, urban dwellers, especially the poor, are more dependent on purchasing food rather than growing it themselves, making them more susceptible to fluctuations in food prices. If prices rise, urban poor may struggle to afford nutritious foods, leading to increased hunger and malnutrition.\n\nWhile options A, B, and D also touch on aspects of the relationship between urbanization and hunger/malnutrition, they do not fully capture the complexities and vulnerabilities that urbanization can introduce into food security dynamics. Option C highlights a key vulnerability that is specific to urban environments and thus is the most accurate answer among the given choices."
