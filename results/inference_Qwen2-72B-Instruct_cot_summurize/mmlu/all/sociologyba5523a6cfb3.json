Social class is a complex concept that can be defined and measured in different ways, depending on the theoretical perspective and the data available. Some researchers may focus on occupation, income, or education as indicators of social class, while others may consider cultural capital, lifestyle, or subjective perceptions. These differences in operationalization can lead to inconsistencies and biases in the results, making it difficult to compare findings across studies or contexts. However, operationalizing concepts like social class is crucial for empirical research, as it allows researchers to test hypotheses, identify patterns, and draw conclusions based on observable data."
