This will require using the quotient rule.\n\nThe quotient rule states if you have a function in the form \\(\\frac{u}{v}\\), then its derivative is given by:\n\\[\\left(\\frac{u}{v}\\right)' = \\frac{u'v - uv'}{v^2}\\]\n\nIn our case, \\(u = \\ln(x)\\) and \\(v = x\\).\n\nSo,\n\\[u' = \\frac{d}{dx} \\ln(x) = \\frac{1}{x}\\]\nand\n\\[v' = \\frac{d}{dx} x = 1\\]\n\nThus,\n\\[y' = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right)(x) - (\\ln(x))(1)}{x^2}\\]\n\\[y' = \\frac{1 - \\ln(x)}{x^2}\\]\n\nNow, set \\(y'\\) equal to zero to find the critical points:\n\n\\[\\frac{1 - \\ln(x)}{x^2} = 0\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[1 - \\ln(x) = 0\\]\n\nSolving for \\(x\\):\n\\[\\ln(x) = 1\\]\n\n\\[x = e^1 = e\\]\n\nNow, to determine if \\(x = e\\) gives a relative maximum, we could either use the second derivative test or consider the behavior of the function around \\(x = e\\). The second derivative test involves finding \\(y''\\) and evaluating it at \\(x = e\\). However, based on the nature of logarithmic functions and their derivatives, we know that after \\(x = e\\), the rate of increase of \\(\\ln(x)\\) decreases more rapidly than the linear increase in \\(x\\), thus the function will decrease after \\(x = e\\).\n\nTherefore, \\(x = e\\) gives a relative maximum.\n\nFinally, substitute \\(x = e\\) back into the original equation to find the value of \\(y\\) at this point:\n\n\\[y = \\frac{\\ln(e)}{e}\\]\n\n\\[y = \\frac{1}{e}\\]\n\nSo, the relative maximum value of the function is \\(\\boxed{D. \\frac{1}{e}}\\)."
