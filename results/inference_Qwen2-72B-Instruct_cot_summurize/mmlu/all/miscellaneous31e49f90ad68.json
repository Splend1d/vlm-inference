Government authority is created as the result of a social contract.\n\nBoth Thomas Hobbes and John Locke were influential philosophers during the Enlightenment period, and they both discussed the concept of a social contract in their political theories. According to this idea, individuals agree to give up some of their freedoms and submit to the authority of the state in exchange for protection of their remaining rights and maintenance of order. However, it is important to note that their views on the nature of this contract and the role of government differ significantly. Hobbes believed in an absolute sovereign to avoid the chaos of the state of nature, while Locke advocated for a government with limited powers and the right of people to revolt if their natural rights were infringed upon. Nonetheless, both would agree that government authority originates from the consent of the governed."
