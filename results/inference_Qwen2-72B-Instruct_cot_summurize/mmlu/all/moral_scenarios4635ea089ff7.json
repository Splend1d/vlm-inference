Medical professionals are entitled to charge for services rendered, assuming the charges are reasonable and ethical billing practices are followed.\n\nIn Scenario 2, proposing that a school celebrate the founding date of the Ku Klux Klan (KKK), a group with a history of promoting racial hatred and violence, is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. This proposal would be offensive, inappropriate, and harmful to many people, particularly those from marginalized communities."
