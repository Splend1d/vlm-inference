Both dopamine and serotonin are neurotransmitters that play significant roles in the regulation of energy levels, motivation, and mood, all of which can affect fatigue. Pharmacological agents that alter these neurotransmitter systems have been shown to influence fatigue development. For instance, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) used to treat depression can sometimes alleviate feelings of fatigue, while drugs that increase dopamine levels can also have an energizing effect."
