Its administration favors the many instead of the few; this is why it is called a democracy. If we look to the laws, they afford equal justice to all in their private differences; if no social standing, advancement in public life falls to reputation for capacity, class considerations not being allowed to interfere with merit; nor again does poverty bar the way, if a man is able to serve the state, he is not hindered by the obscurity of his condition. The freedom which we enjoy in our government extends also to our ordinary life. There, far from exercising a jealous surveillance over each other, we do not feel called upon to be angry with our neighbor for doing what he likes, or even to indulge in those injurious looks which cannot fail to be offensive, although they inflict no positive penalty. But all this ease in our private relations does not make us lawless as citizens. Against this fear is our chief safeguard, teaching us to obey the magistrates and the laws, particularly such as regard the protection of the injured, whether they are actually on the statute book, or belong to that code which, although unwritten, yet cannot be broken without acknowledged disgrace.\"\nThucydides, History of the Peloponnesian War, ca. 415 B.C.E.\nWhich of the following correctly describes one of the primary reasons that Greek culture was disseminated widely around the Mediterranean region during the time period represented by the passage?\n\nA. The geography of Greece contains many natural resources that facilitated a profitable mining industry.\nB. The geography of Greece contains numerous freshwater lakes that facilitated a successful fishing industry.\nC. The geography of Greece contains prominent river valleys that facilitated widespread agriculture.\nD. The geography of Greece contains many natural harbors that facilitated trade and commerce.\n"

The geography of Greece contains many natural harbors that facilitated trade and commerce.\n\nThe passage does not directly discuss the reasons for the dissemination of Greek culture, but it does highlight aspects of Greek society and governance that could have contributed to its influence and appeal. The reference to \"the laws\" and \"administration\" suggests an interest in legal and political systems, which might have been attractive to other cultures. Additionally, the mention of \"service to the state\" and \"ability\" as criteria for public life indicates a meritocratic approach that could have been admired by others. However, the question asks specifically about the dissemination of Greek culture due to geographical factors. Among the choices given, D best fits this criterion, as the presence of natural harbors would have facilitated maritime trade, allowing for cultural exchange and the spread of Greek ideas, goods, and practices throughout the Mediterranean region."
