The state's attorney had served long enough to become fully qualified for his pension upon retirement. The state's attorney retired and immediately started receiving monthly pension checks. Subsequently, the governor signed into law a statute which provided in part:\"Section 8. Any member of the state attorneys staff who is convicted of. . . bribery . . . shall not beentitled to receive any retirement or other benefit or payment of any kind from the state . Such conviction shall be considered a breach of the staff member's employment contract. \"Following the enactment of the statute, the state's attorney received a letter from the state which stated they are immediately discontinuing pension benefit payments to him on account of his bribery conviction. The state's attorney contacted an attorney, who challenged the discontinuance of benefits on the grounds that the new law was unconstitutional. In order to reinstate the state attorney's pension on the grounds that the statute is unconstitutional, the attorney's strongest argument would be that\n\nA. the state attorney was retroactively punished.\nB. the statute is an ex post facto law\nC. the supremacy clause invalidates the state law, because there is federal legislation regulating pension and profit sharing plans.\nD. the statute has a chilling effecton legislators' rights to freely discuss pending bills with members of their staff.\n"

In this case, the state attorney was convicted and sentenced under the laws that existed at the time of his actions and sentencing. The new statute, which takes away his pension benefits as a result of his prior conviction, imposes additional punishment after the fact, which is what makes it an ex post facto law. This type of law is unconstitutional because it violates the principle that individuals have the right to fair notice of the legal consequences of their actions and should not face harsher punishment than what was established when the actions were taken."
