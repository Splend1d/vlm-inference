The significance level \u03b1 is the probability of making a Type I error, which is rejecting a true null hypothesis. The probability of a Type II error depends on several factors including the sample size, the true value of the parameter being tested, and the variability in the data.\n\nTherefore, without additional information about these factors, it is not possible to determine the exact probability of a Type II error just from knowing that the test is conducted at the 10% significance level.\n\nSo the correct answer is:\n\nD. There is insufficient information to answer this question."
