It is important, however, that both the client and his wife give informed consent to participate in joint therapy sessions and understand the potential benefits and limitations of this type of treatment. The therapist should also ensure that confidentiality and privacy concerns are addressed appropriately. Option D could potentially be a concern if the therapist had a pre-existing relationship with the wife or if there were other factors that created a conflict of interest, but simply inviting her to participate in therapy does not inherently create such a conflict."
