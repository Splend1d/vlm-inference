Electrons filling inner shell vacancies that are created in the metal atoms\n\nWhen high-energy electrons bombard a metal target, they can knock out an electron from one of the inner shells (K, L, M, etc.) of the metal atoms, creating a vacancy or hole in that shell. This event is known as the photoelectric effect or sometimes referred to as inner-shell ionization in this context. To stabilize the atom, an electron from an outer shell will then fill this vacancy, and in doing so, it releases energy in the form of a photon. The energy of this photon corresponds to the difference in energy between the two shells involved in the transition, which is characteristic of the specific element being bombarded. These photons are what we recognize as characteristic X-rays."
