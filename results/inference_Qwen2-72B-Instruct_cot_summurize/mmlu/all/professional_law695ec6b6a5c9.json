As the boss stood up to leave the table, her wallet fell out of her pocketbook onto the floor. The boss was unaware of what occurred and proceeded to the bathroom. The woman, however, saw the wallet fall. Intending to steal it, the woman picked up the wallet and placed it in her pocket. Before the boss returned to the table, the woman had a change of heart and decided to give the wallet back. Thereupon, the woman told her boss what had happened and handed her the wallet when she returned from the bathroom. The woman is guilty of which, if any, crime?\n\nA. No crime.\nB. Larceny.\nC. Embezzlement.\nD. False pretenses.\n"

However, she returned the wallet before her boss noticed it was missing, and before any actual loss occurred. In many jurisdictions, this could potentially negate the completion of the crime of larceny since no deprivation occurred.\n\nHowever, the act of taking the wallet with the intent to permanently deprive the owner of it would typically satisfy the elements of larceny, even if the intent was later abandoned and the wallet returned. Therefore, under strict legal interpretation, the woman could be charged with larceny because the act of taking the wallet with the intent to steal it is sufficient to constitute the crime, regardless of her subsequent change of heart.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Larceny. \n\nIt's important to note that the specifics can vary by jurisdiction, and some legal systems may consider her returning the wallet as a mitigating factor or even a defense in certain circumstances. However, based on the information provided, the act of taking the wallet with the intent to steal meets the criteria for larceny."
