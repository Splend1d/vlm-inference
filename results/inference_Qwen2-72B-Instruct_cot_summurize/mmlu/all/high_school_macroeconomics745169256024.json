A Mexican entrepreneur founds and locates a software company in St. Louis.\n\nThis scenario would most likely increase aggregate demand in the United States because the establishment of a new business, especially in the technology sector, can lead to increased spending on goods and services as the company hires employees and invests in infrastructure. This, in turn, can stimulate economic activity and increase overall demand for goods and services within the country."
