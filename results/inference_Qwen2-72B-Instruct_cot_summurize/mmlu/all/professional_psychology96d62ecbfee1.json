However, among the options given:\n\nA. Imaginal exposure is a key component of EMDR. During the therapy, clients are asked to recall traumatic events while undergoing eye movements or other forms of bilateral stimulation. This process can help to desensitize individuals to the emotional impact of these memories.\n\nB. Higher-order conditioning might also play a role in EMDR's effectiveness, as the therapy could potentially lead to the formation of new associations between the traumatic memory and more adaptive responses.\n\nC. Relaxation training is not a primary mechanism of action in EMDR, although some therapists may incorporate relaxation techniques into their practice.\n\nD. Fixed visual attention does occur during EMDR sessions when the client follows the therapist's hand movements with their eyes, but this is not considered the main mechanism by which EMDR works.\n\nGiven the options provided, **A. imaginal exposure** is the most accurate answer based on current research understanding of how EMDR works. However, it's important to note that the precise mechanisms of EMDR are still being studied, and there may be multiple contributing factors to its effectiveness."
