A real estate developer applied for a zoning change to permit construction of a convalescent home on land he owned in a city within the state. While the application was pending, the city charter was amended by popular vote so as to require that any changes in land use agreed to by the city council be approved by a 55% vote in a referendum. The city planning commission and the city council both approved the proposed zoning change. However, the real estate developer's subsequent application for approval for a proposed home on the grounds was rejected because the rezoning action had not been submitted to a referendum. In an action brought in state court seeking a judgment declaring the city charter amendment invalid, the court will most likely declare the amendment\n\nA. unconstitutional, as violation of the real estate developer's due process rights.\nB. unconstitutional, as an unlawful delegation of legislative power to a regulatory body.\nC. constitutional, as a valid exercise of the city's police power.\nD. constitutional, as a valid exercise of a power reserved by the people to themselves.\n"

This means that the people have the right to directly participate in the decision-making process concerning issues that affect their community. The amendment to the city charter, which requires a 55% vote in a referendum for any changes in land use agreed to by the city council, is a valid exercise of this reserved power.\n\nThe fact that the real estate developer's application for approval for a proposed home was rejected because the rezoning action had not been submitted to a referendum does not make the amendment unconstitutional. It simply means that the developer must follow the procedures established by the city's voters through the referendum process if they wish to proceed with the project.\n\nOptions A and B are incorrect because there is no violation of the real estate developer's due process rights or unlawful delegation of legislative power. Option C is also incorrect because while the city's police power may be involved in regulating land use, the issue here is the people's reserved power to participate in the decision-making process through referendums."
