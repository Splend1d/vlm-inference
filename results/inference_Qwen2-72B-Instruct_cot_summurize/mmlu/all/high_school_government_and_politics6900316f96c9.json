In the House, the Speaker of the House has the power to limit the amount of time that members can speak on the floor, and the Rules Committee can set specific time limits for debate on particular bills. This makes it much more difficult for individual members to use filibusters as a tactic to delay or block legislation. In contrast, the Senate has more permissive rules regarding debate, which allows for the possibility of filibusters to occur more frequently."
