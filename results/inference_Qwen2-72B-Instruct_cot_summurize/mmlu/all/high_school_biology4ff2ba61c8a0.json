                    "text": "The correct answer is D. Fermentation replenishes the NAD+ necessary for glycolysis to continue.\n\nIn the absence of oxygen, yeast cells (and some other types of cells) undergo anaerobic respiration, which includes glycolysis and fermentation. During glycolysis, glucose is broken down into pyruvate, generating ATP and reducing NAD+ to NADH. However, NADH needs to be reoxidized back to NAD+ for glycolysis to continue. In fermentation, pyruvate is converted into ethanol and carbon dioxide, and NADH is oxidized back to NAD+, allowing glycolysis to proceed even without oxygen. This process allows the cell to continue producing ATP when oxygen is scarce or absent."
