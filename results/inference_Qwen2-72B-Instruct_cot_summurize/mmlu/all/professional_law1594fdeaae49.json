Anyhow, I'm willing to pay all your medical expenses. \"At trial, the woman calls an eyewitness to the accident. The eyewitness proposes to testify that he heard the man tell the woman, \"I know I was driving fast. \" The man's attorney objects.

Such statements are often admissible in court as they are considered exceptions to the hearsay rule, which generally prohibits out-of-court statements from being used as evidence. Admissions by a party-opponent are admissible because they are considered admissions against one's own interest, which gives them a high degree of reliability and trustworthiness."
