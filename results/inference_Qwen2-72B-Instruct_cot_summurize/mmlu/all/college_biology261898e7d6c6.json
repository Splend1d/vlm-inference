This process can lead to a reduction in genetic differences between populations, thereby increasing genetic homogeneity across the metapopulation.\n\nWhile gene flow can disrupt Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in the populations involved due to the introduction of new alleles and genotypes, option D is not the primary result of gene flow. The main effect is the homogenization of genetic variation among populations, making option A the most accurate answer.\n\nOptions B and C are not direct outcomes of gene flow. Gene flow does not necessarily increase the rate of deleterious mutations (option B) unless such mutations are prevalent in the migrating individuals. And it generally reduces the likelihood of speciation (option C) by preventing genetic divergence between populations."
