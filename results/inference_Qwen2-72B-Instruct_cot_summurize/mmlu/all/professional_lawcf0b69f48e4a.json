The renovations included the repair, replastering, and repainting of the entire ceiling and walls by the painting company. The day following the reopening of the supermarket, the store's manager noticed small fragments of plaster on the floor, which appeared to have fallen from a part of the ceiling about 10-square-feet in area. The manager immediately posted signs in that area that read: \"Caution: Falling Plaster. \" In addition, the manager promptly called the painting company and requested a repairman to attend to the problem. That afternoon, a shopper was shopping in the supermarket and wanted to purchase some canned goods in the posted area. Moving quickly, the shopper reached for the desired items. At that very moment, a section of the ceiling fell and struck the shopper, injuring her very seriously. If the shopper asserts a claim against the supermarket, she probably will\n\nA. prevail, because the supermarket failed to take adequate precaution to ensure the safety of its patrons against such an unreasonable risk of harm.\nB. prevail, because the supermarket is vicariously liable for the negligence of its independent contractor in the performance of a non-delegable duty.\nC. not prevail, because the injury was the fault of the painting company.\nD. not prevail, because the supermarket posted signs warning customers of the risk of harm.\n"

Although the supermarket posted signs warning of the falling plaster, it did not take sufficient action to prevent the injury from occurring, such as closing off the area or providing more substantial protection. Therefore, the correct answer is A.\n\nHowever, it's also possible that the supermarket could be held vicariously liable for the negligence of its independent contractor (the painting company) if the duty to provide a safe environment for patrons is considered non-delegable. This would mean that even if the painting company was at fault, the supermarket would still be liable. However, this depends on the specific laws and regulations in the jurisdiction where the incident occurred, so B may also be a valid answer depending on those factors. \n\nIn general, posting warning signs alone is not enough to absolve a business of liability for injuries caused by hazards on their premises. The business must take reasonable steps to address the hazard and prevent injuries from occurring. Therefore, D is not a correct answer.\n\nAs for C, the fact that the painting company may have been at fault does not necessarily absolve the supermarket of liability. The supermarket has a duty to provide a safe environment for its patrons, and if it fails to do so, it can be held liable regardless of who is ultimately responsible for the hazardous condition."
