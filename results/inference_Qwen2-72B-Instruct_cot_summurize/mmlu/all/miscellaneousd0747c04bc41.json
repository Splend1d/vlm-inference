This is because the water table follows the contour lines of the landscape and since the well on the side of the hill penetrates the water table at 550 feet above sea level, the water table would be higher as you move up the hill. However, it will still be below the land surface at the top of the hill. In some cases, if the hill is steep enough, the water table may intersect the land surface at the top of the hill, forming a spring, but this is not necessarily the case in all situations."
