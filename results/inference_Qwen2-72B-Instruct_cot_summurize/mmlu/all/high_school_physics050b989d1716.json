An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.\n\nWhen a charged object (the nonconducting sphere with charge +Q) is brought near a neutral conducting sphere, it induces charges on the surface of the conducting sphere. The conducting sphere, being neutral, has equal amounts of positive and negative charges. The positive charges in the conducting sphere will be repelled by the +Q charge and move to the far side of the sphere, while the negative charges will be attracted to the side closest to the +Q charge. This separation of charges creates an electric field within the conducting sphere.\n\nC. The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.\n\nThe induced negative charges on the conducting sphere (closest to the +Q charge) will attract the +Q charge, and the induced positive charges on the opposite side of the conducting sphere will also experience an attractive force from the +Q charge. Therefore, there will be an overall electrostatic attraction between the two spheres."
