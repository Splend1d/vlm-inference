Appropriating funds\n\nCongress can significantly influence the federal bureaucracy by controlling the budget and appropriating funds to various agencies and departments. This power over the purse strings allows Congress to encourage certain policies or discourage others by adjusting funding levels accordingly. While Congress does not directly set departmental salaries (option A), appoint agency heads (option C), or dismiss cabinet secretaries (option D), it can confirm presidential appointments and has the power of impeachment for high officials, including cabinet members, but these actions are not routine methods of influencing the bureaucracy."
