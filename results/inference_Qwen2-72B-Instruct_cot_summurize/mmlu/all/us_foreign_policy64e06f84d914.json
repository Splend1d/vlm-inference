Eisenhower warned about the potential dangers of the \"military-industrial complex,\" arguing that the close relationship between the defense industry and the federal government could lead to unwarranted influence on politics and government by the arms industry. He expressed concern that the vast resources spent on defense could lead to a situation where the arms industry would have too much power over the nation's policies and priorities. Eisenhower urged Americans to remain vigilant against this threat and to ensure that the country's military strength remained under civilian control."
