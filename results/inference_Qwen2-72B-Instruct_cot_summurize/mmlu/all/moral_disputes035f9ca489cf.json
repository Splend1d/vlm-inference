While option D might seem plausible, the specific argument made by Lukianoff and Haidt focuses primarily on the issue of intellectual diversity and the negative impact of disinviting speakers on campus discourse. They do not specifically frame this as \"mental filtering\" or suggest that it will encourage students to disregard positive aspects of a person's history, although those could be seen as related concerns. Therefore, the most accurate answer based on their arguments is B. However, if considering broader implications, D might also hold true."
