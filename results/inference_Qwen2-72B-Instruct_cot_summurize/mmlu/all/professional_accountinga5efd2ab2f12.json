All returns were filed on the original due date. The proposed adjustment relates to the disallowance of corporate jet usage for personal reasons. The agent does not find the error to be fraudulent or substantial in nature. Which of the following statements regarding this adjustment is correct?\n\nA. The adjustment is improper because an agent may only propose adjustments to the year under examination.\nB. The adjustment is proper because there is no statute of limitations for improperly claiming personal expenses as business expenses\nC. The adjustment is proper because it relates to a change in accounting method, which can be made retroactively irrespective of the statute of limitations.\nD. The adjustment is improper because the statute of limitations has expired for several years of the adjustment\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is D. The adjustment is improper because the statute of limitations has expired for several years of the adjustment. Generally, the IRS has three years from the date a return is filed (or from the due date of the return, if later) to make an assessment and collect any additional taxes owed. In this case, since all returns were filed on the original due date, the statute of limitations would have expired for years 1 through 4 by the time the examination was completed in year 6. However, it's important to note that the IRS has six years to assess additional tax if there is a substantial omission of income, but the question states that the agent does not find the error to be substantial in nature."
