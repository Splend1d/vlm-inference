                    "text": "When the price of a good increases and the quantity demanded decreases, we can calculate the price elasticity of demand using the percentage change in quantity demanded divided by the percentage change in price. In this case, the price of beef increased by 10%, and the quantity demanded fell by 20%. The price elasticity of demand (PED) is calculated as:\n\n\\[ PED = \\frac{\\% \\Delta \\text{Quantity}}{\\% \\Delta \\text{Price}} = \\frac{-20\\%}{10\\%} = -2 \\]\n\nA PED value of -2 indicates that demand for beef is price elastic because the absolute value of PED is greater than 1.\n\nTo determine if consumer spending on beef is rising or falling, we need to consider both the percentage change in price and the percentage change in quantity demanded. Consumer spending (or total revenue) is determined by multiplying the price by the quantity sold. If the percentage increase in price is less than the percentage decrease in quantity, then consumer spending will fall.\n\nIn this case, the price increased by 10%, but the quantity demanded decreased by 20%. Since the decrease in quantity is more than the increase in price, consumer spending on beef would be falling.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\nA. demand for beef is price elastic and consumer spending on beef is falling."
