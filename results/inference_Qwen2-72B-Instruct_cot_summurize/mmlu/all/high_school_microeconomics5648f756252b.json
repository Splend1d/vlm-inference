A monopoly faces a downward sloping demand curve, unlike a perfectly competitive firm which faces a horizontal demand curve (which is also its marginal revenue curve). This means that a monopolist must lower its price to sell more units, resulting in a marginal revenue that is less than the price.\n\nRegarding the other options:\nA. While it's true that a monopoly can set prices higher than a competitive market would, it does not necessarily charge the highest price it can on the demand curve. The profit-maximizing level of output for a monopoly is where marginal cost equals marginal revenue, not where the price is at its maximum.\nB. A monopoly does not have a horizontal marginal revenue curve; instead, its marginal revenue curve lies below its demand curve and slopes downward even more steeply.\nC. A monopoly does not have an upward sloping total revenue curve. Total revenue may initially increase as more units are sold, but it eventually decreases as the price must be lowered significantly to sell additional units, due to the downward sloping demand curve."
