Another customer, who had not been threatened by the woman, forcefully grabbed the woman and locked her in the tavern's storeroom until the police could arrive. In the process, although the customer used reasonable force, the customer badly sprained the woman's wrist. Is the woman likely to recover in an action against the customer?\n\nA. No, because the customer's conduct was privileged as a defense of others.\nB. Yes, based on battery only.\nC. Yes, based on false imprisonment only.\nD. Yes, based on both battery and false imprisonment.\n"

No, because the customer's conduct was privileged as a defense of others.\n\nThe customer's actions may be considered justified under the defense of others doctrine, which allows for the use of reasonable force to protect another person from imminent harm. The customer's actions were taken to prevent the woman from potentially harming the man with the broken beer bottle. Although the woman was injured in the process, if the force used was reasonable under the circumstances, the customer would not be liable for battery or false imprisonment. However, it is important to note that the specifics of the situation and jurisdictional laws would ultimately determine whether the customer's actions were indeed privileged."
