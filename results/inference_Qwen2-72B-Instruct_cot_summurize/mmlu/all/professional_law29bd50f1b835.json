A real estate developer applied for a zoning change to permit construction of a water park on land he owned in a city within the state. While the application was pending, the city's charter was amended by popular vote so as to require that any changes in land use agreed to by the city council be approved by a 55% vote in a referendum. The city planning commission and the city council both approved the proposed zoning change. However, the commission rejected the developer's subsequent application for \"recreational area\" approval for the proposed water park on the grounds that the council's rezoning action had not been submitted to a referendum. Assume that while the action was pending in the state court, the proposed zoning change was defeated in a referendum. Which would be the most applicable rule of constitutional law with respect to the referendum procedure when applied to a rezoning ordinance?\n\nA. The referendum procedure as a basic instrument of the democratic process does not violate the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nB. The referendum procedure is arbitrary and capricious and thus should be held invalid as an unlawful delegation of legislative power.\nC. The referendum procedure is violative of the due process clause of the FourteenthAmendment.\nD. The referendum procedure in this context is invalid as against publicpolicy.\n"

The referendum procedure as a basic instrument of the democratic process does not violate the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nThe most applicable rule of constitutional law in this scenario is that the referendum procedure, which allows citizens to directly participate in the legislative process, is generally considered a valid exercise of democratic governance and does not infringe upon the due process rights protected by the Fourteenth Amendment. This is because the referendum process is seen as a legitimate method for municipalities to make decisions regarding local issues, including zoning changes, as long as it is applied fairly and does not result in the denial of fundamental rights or the enactment of laws that are discriminatory or otherwise unconstitutional.\n\nOptions B, C, and D suggest that the referendum procedure is invalid under various legal theories, but these arguments are typically not supported by case law when the referendum is conducted in accordance with state law and does not result in clear violations of constitutional protections. The fact that the rezoning ordinance was subsequently defeated in a referendum does not alter the validity of the referendum procedure itself under the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause."
