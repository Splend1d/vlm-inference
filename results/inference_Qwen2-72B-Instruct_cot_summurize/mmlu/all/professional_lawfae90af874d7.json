The mechanic properly made the repairs, but when the landscaper tendered payment, the mechanic refused to deliver the truck unless the landscaper promised to pay an additional $2,000. The customary charge for such work was $14,000. Because the landscaper needed the truck immediately to fulfill existing contractual obligations, and because no rental trucks of the same type were available, the landscaper promised in writing to pay the mechanic an additional $2,000. The mechanic then delivered the truck. Will the mechanic be able to enforce the landscaper's promise to pay the additional $2,000?\n\nA. No, because the landscaper had no reasonable alternative but to yield to the mechanic's wrongful threat.\nB. No, because the mechanic exerted undue influence over the landscaper with respect to the modification.\nC. Yes, because the landscaper could have obtained possession of the truck through legal action rather than by agreeing to the increased payment.\nD. Yes, because the modified contract price did not exceed a reasonable price.\n"

No, because the landscaper had no reasonable alternative but to yield to the mechanic's wrongful threat.\n\nThis situation involves economic duress, where one party (the mechanic) uses an illegitimate threat to force the other party (the landscaper) into agreeing to terms that they would not otherwise accept. The mechanic's refusal to deliver the truck as per the original agreement, unless the landscaper agreed to pay more, constitutes wrongful conduct. Since the landscaper had no reasonable alternative due to the immediate need for the truck and the unavailability of rental options, the promise to pay the additional $2,000 is not enforceable. The law generally does not enforce contracts or modifications thereof that are entered into under duress."
