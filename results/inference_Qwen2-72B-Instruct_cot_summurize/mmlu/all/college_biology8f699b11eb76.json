DNA and mRNA: These are both small molecules, and low-speed centrifugation would not effectively separate them based on size.\n\nB. Nuclei and secretory vesicles: This is a likely candidate because nuclei are significantly larger than secretory vesicles. Low-speed centrifugation can be used to pellet nuclei while leaving smaller vesicles in the supernatant.\n\nC. Golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum: Both of these structures have similar sizes and densities when disrupted into membrane fragments during homogenization, so low-speed centrifugation alone may not efficiently separate them.\n\nD. Lysosomes and endosomes: Although there is a size difference between lysosomes and endosomes, they are both relatively small organelles. Low-speed centrifugation might not be sufficient to separate them effectively; higher-speed centrifugation (ultracentrifugation) would be more appropriate for this task.\n\nTherefore, the most likely answer is **B. Nuclei and secretory vesicles**."
