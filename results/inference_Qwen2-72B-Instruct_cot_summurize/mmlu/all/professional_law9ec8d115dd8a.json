                    "text": "In 1996, a developer purchased a 100-acre tract located in a northern county in a state. Shortly thereafter, the developer prepared a subdivision plan that created 100 one-acre residential building lots on this tract. In 1997, the subdivision plan was recorded with the county recorder's office. During the next few years, the developer sold 60 residential lots to individual purchasers. Each deed specified that every lot designated on the subdivision plan was to be recorded in the county recorder's office. Each deed also provided the following:\"No house trailer or mobile home shall be built or maintained on any lot within the subdivision. \"In 2003, the developer conveyed the remaining 40 lots to a builder by deed that included language identical to that contained in the first 60 deeds. This deed from the developer to the builder was recorded. By 2008, the builder had sold all of the 40 lots. Each of these deeds identified each lot as being a part of the subdivision, but did not include the clause relating to mobile homes. On January 30, 2009, a buyer, who had purchased one of the residential lots from the builder, placed a mobile home on his property. Which of the following statements is LEAST accurate with respect to the buyer's deed?\n\nA. The covenant prohibiting mobile homes ran with the land as far as the builder, but not as far as the buyer.\nB. The covenant prohibiting mobile homes could be enforced by any subdivision lot owner.\nC. The buyer should have had constructive notice of the restriction against mobile homes.\nD. All subsequent grantees of the builder would be in privity of estate.\n"

                    "text": "The statement that is LEAST accurate with respect to the buyer's deed is:\n\nD. All subsequent grantees of the builder would be in privity of estate.\n\nExplanation:\nPrivity of estate refers to the direct relationship between parties who have an interest in the same real estate, typically established through a chain of title. Privity of estate does not automatically exist between the builder and all subsequent grantees. Only those who have a direct contractual relationship with the builder (i.e., those who directly purchased from the builder) would be in privity of estate with the builder. Subsequent buyers who purchase from the original grantees of the builder do not have privity of estate with the builder unless they are part of a continuing chain of title where each deed includes a clause that maintains privity.\n\nRegarding the other statements:\n\nA. The covenant prohibiting mobile homes ran with the land as far as the builder, but not as far as the buyer. - This statement may not be entirely accurate because if the covenant was properly recorded and runs with the land, it would bind all subsequent owners, including the buyer, regardless of whether the covenant was explicitly included in their deed.\n\nB. The covenant prohibiting mobile homes could be enforced by any subdivision lot owner. - This statement is accurate because covenants running with the land can be enforced by all parties who have an interest in the property affected by the covenant, including all lot owners within the subdivision.\n\nC. The buyer should have had constructive notice of the restriction against mobile homes. - This statement is accurate because the covenant was recorded with the county recorder's office, which means that anyone purchasing property in the area has a duty to investigate public records and is considered to have constructive notice of any recorded restrictions."
