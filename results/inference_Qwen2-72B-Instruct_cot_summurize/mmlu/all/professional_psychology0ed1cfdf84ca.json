If an infant's crying is followed by attention (a positive reinforcer), then the crying behavior may increase in frequency and duration. Conversely, if crying is not followed by attention, the behavior may decrease.\n\nGiven this context:\n\n- **Family A's infant**, who does not receive immediate attention when crying, might learn that crying does not result in a desired outcome (attention). This could lead to shorter crying episodes during the day as the infant learns that crying is not an effective way to gain attention. However, since there is no difference in response between day and night, this pattern may not necessarily extend to nighttime crying.\n  \n- **Family B's infant**, who receives immediate attention when crying, might learn that crying results in a desired outcome (attention). This could lead to longer or more frequent crying episodes during the day as the infant learns that crying is an effective way to gain attention. However, at night, when attention is not given, the reinforcement for crying is removed, which might limit the extension of this learned behavior to nighttime.\n\nBased on these principles, it would be anticipated that:\n\n**B. Family A\u2019s infant will cry for longer periods of time at night** is not the most likely scenario according to traditional learning theories, because during the day, the infant learns that crying does not result in attention, which should theoretically reduce crying behavior rather than increase it.\n\n**C. Family B\u2019s infant will cry for longer periods of time at night** could potentially be true based on the principle of extinction bursts. When a previously reinforced behavior (crying) is no longer reinforced (no attention at night), the behavior can temporarily increase in intensity and frequency as the infant attempts to regain the reinforcement. However, without further information about how quickly the infant might adapt to the lack of nighttime attention, this prediction remains speculative.\n\n**D. Neither infant will tend to cry more than the other at any time** seems unlikely given the differential reinforcement histories during the day.\n\nThus, while none of the options perfectly aligns with traditional learning theory predictions, **C** is the closest match because it suggests that the infant who has been consistently reinforced for crying during the day might show increased crying at night when the reinforcement is suddenly withdrawn. However, it's important to note that real-world infant behavior is influenced by many factors beyond simple learning theories, including physiological needs, temperament, and developmental stages."
