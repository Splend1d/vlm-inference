This can be expressed as:\n\n\\[ F = kx \\]\n\nwhere \\(k\\) is the spring constant, and \\(x\\) is the displacement from the equilibrium position.\n\nThe work done in stretching a spring can be found by integrating the force over the distance it is stretched:\n\n\\[ W = \\int_0^x F\\,dx = \\int_0^x kx\\,dx = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2 \\]\n\nFor the first spring, let's say it is stretched by a distance \\(x\\). The work done, \\(W_1\\), will be:\n\n\\[ W_1 = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2 \\]\n\nFor the second spring, it is stretched by half the distance of the first spring, so \\(x/2\\). Let \\(k'\\) be the spring constant of the second spring. The work done, \\(W_2\\), will be:\n\n\\[ W_2 = \\frac{1}{2}k'(\\frac{x}{2})^2 = \\frac{1}{2}k'\\frac{x^2}{4} = \\frac{1}{8}k'x^2 \\]\n\nAccording to the problem statement, it takes twice as much work to stretch the second spring by half this distance compared to the first spring:\n\n\\[ W_2 = 2W_1 \\]\n\nSubstituting the expressions for \\(W_1\\) and \\(W_2\\) we get:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{8}k'x^2 = 2(\\frac{1}{2}kx^2) \\]\n\nSimplifying this equation:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{8}k'x^2 = kx^2 \\]\n\n\\[ k' = 8k \\]\n\nTherefore, the force constant of the second spring is 8 times that of the first spring, making the answer:\n\nD. 8k"
