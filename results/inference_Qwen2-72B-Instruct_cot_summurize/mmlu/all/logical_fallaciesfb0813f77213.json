A formally valid syllogism must be materially true\n\nFormal validity refers to the structure of an argument, meaning that if the premises are true, then the conclusion necessarily follows. Material truth, on the other hand, refers to the actual truth of the premises and the conclusion in the real world. A syllogism can be formally valid (meaning its form is correct) but still be materially false if one or more of its premises are factually incorrect.\n\nFor example, consider this syllogism:\n\nPremise 1: All mammals are reptiles.\nPremise 2: All dogs are mammals.\nConclusion: Therefore, all dogs are reptiles.\n\nThis syllogism is formally valid because the conclusion logically follows from the premises. However, it is materially false because premise 1 is not true. All mammals are not reptiles. Thus, while the syllogism's form is correct, its content is incorrect, demonstrating that formal validity does not ensure material truth."
