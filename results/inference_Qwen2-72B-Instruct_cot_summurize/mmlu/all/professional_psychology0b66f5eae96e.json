This is the primary distinction between the two types of design. In a true experiment, participants are randomly assigned to either the treatment group (which receives the intervention) or the control group (which does not receive the intervention), allowing for causal inferences to be made. In quasi-experiments, this random assignment is absent, often due to practical or ethical constraints, leading to potential confounding variables that may affect the outcomes."
