ALDH2\n\nFacial flushing, often referred to as \"Asian flush,\" is commonly seen in about 50% of East Asians due to a genetic deficiency of the enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2). This enzyme is responsible for breaking down acetaldehyde, a toxic byproduct of alcohol metabolism. When ALDH2 is deficient or less active, acetaldehyde accumulates, leading to symptoms such as facial flushing, nausea, and palpitations after consuming alcohol."
