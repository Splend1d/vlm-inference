This can be calculated using the rules of probability for independent events.\n\nFor each gene pair, the probability of an offspring inheriting the dominant allele (A, B, C) from both parents is \\(\\frac{1}{2} * \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}\\), since each parent has one dominant and one recessive allele.\n\nGiven three gene pairs, the probability of an offspring inheriting the dominant allele for all three pairs is:\n\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{1}{4} \\right)^3 = \\frac{1}{4} * \\frac{1}{4} * \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{64}\n\\]\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\nA. 1.0/64"
