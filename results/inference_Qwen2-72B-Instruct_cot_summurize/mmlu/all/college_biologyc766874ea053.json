Replicate its genetic material and synthesize viral proteins.\n\nWhen an influenza virus enters a host cell, it does not incorporate its DNA into the host cell's chromosome because influenza viruses have RNA genomes, not DNA. They also do not use reverse transcriptase since they are not retroviruses that need to convert RNA into DNA. Instead, the influenza virus uses the host cell's machinery to replicate its RNA genome and to synthesize viral proteins. This process leads to the production of new viral particles that can then go on to infect other cells."
