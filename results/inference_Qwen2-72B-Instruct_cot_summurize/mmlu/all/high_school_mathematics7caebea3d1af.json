The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse ($c^2$) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides ($6^2 + b^2$).\n\nThus, we have:\n\\[c^2 = 6^2 + b^2\\]\n\\[c^2 = 36 + b^2\\]\n\nWe are also given that the perimeter of the triangle is $18$. The perimeter is the sum of all the sides of the triangle, so:\n\\[6 + b + c = 18\\]\n\nWe need to solve this system of equations for $c$. First, let's isolate $b$ from the perimeter equation:\n\\[b = 18 - 6 - c\\]\n\\[b = 12 - c\\]\n\nSubstitute $b$ into the Pythagorean theorem:\n\\[c^2 = 36 + (12 - c)^2\\]\n\\[c^2 = 36 + 144 - 24c + c^2\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\\[0 = 180 - 24c\\]\n\\[24c = 180\\]\n\\[c = \\frac{180}{24}\\]\n\\[c = \\frac{15}{2}\\]\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. $\\frac{15}{2}$."
