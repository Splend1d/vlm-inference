Frankfurt's analysis in \"On Bullshit,\" bullshit is not necessarily intended to deceive but rather to manipulate social relationships by presenting an appearance of knowledge or understanding without regard for truth or falsity. This can lead to a breakdown of communication and trust in society.\n\nHowever, regarding your question about justifications of speech codes, according to Andrew Altman, a political philosopher who has written extensively on hate speech and free speech issues, speech codes that aim to prevent both causal and expressive harm have the best prospects for success. Causal harm refers to direct physical or psychological damage caused by speech, while expressive harm refers to the ways in which speech can degrade or marginalize individuals or groups. Therefore, the answer would be:\n\nC. both causal and expressive harm\n\nAltman argues that speech codes should be designed to protect individuals from harm while still allowing for robust debate and the free exchange of ideas. By addressing both causal and expressive harm, such codes can strike a balance between protecting individuals from harm and upholding the values of free speech and open inquiry."
