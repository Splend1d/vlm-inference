Essential amino acids are crucial for various bodily functions, including protein synthesis, tissue repair, and enzyme and hormone production. Proline, tyrosine, serine, glycine, and arginine are not considered strictly essential as the body can produce them under normal circumstances, although their availability can still impact health and performance. Cysteine can also be synthesized from methionine, so it is not always considered essential unless dietary methionine levels are low."
