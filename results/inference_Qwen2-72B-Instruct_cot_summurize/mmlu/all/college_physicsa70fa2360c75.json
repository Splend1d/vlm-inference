For totally reflecting surfaces, the radiation pressure is doubled due to the reflection.\n\nSo the radiation pressure is: P = 2I/c = 2*1000/(3*10^8) = 6.67 * 10^-6 Pa\n\nThe force can then be found by multiplying this pressure by the area it acts upon: F = PA = 6.67 * 10^-6 * 3 = 2 * 10^-5 N\n\nSo the answer is C. 2 x 10^-5 N."
