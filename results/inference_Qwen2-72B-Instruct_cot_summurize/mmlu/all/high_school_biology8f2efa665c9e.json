NAD+ + H+ + 2e- \u2192 NADH\n\nDuring glycolysis, NAD+ is reduced to NADH as electrons (2e-) and a proton (H+) are added. However, during fermentation, this process is reversed in order to regenerate NAD+ so that glycolysis can continue in the absence of oxygen. The NADH donates its electrons and protons back to an intermediate in the glycolytic pathway or to a different compound depending on the type of fermentation (lactic acid fermentation, alcoholic fermentation, etc.). This regeneration of NAD+ is crucial for the continuation of glycolysis under anaerobic conditions."
