(i), (ii), and (iii) only.\n\nExplanation:\n\n(i) True: The standardised residuals in a GARCH model are assumed to follow a particular distribution, often a normal or a Student's t-distribution, although other distributions can also be used depending on the application. This assumption is crucial for estimating the parameters of the GARCH model using maximum likelihood methods.\n\n(ii) True: One of the key features of GARCH models is that the variance of the error term is allowed to change over time, and this change is modeled as a function of past squared errors. Therefore, if the GARCH model is appropriate, the squares of the standardised residuals should be related to their lagged squared values. This property is checked during the diagnostic testing of a fitted GARCH model.\n\n(iii) True: In practice, financial returns often exhibit \"fat tails,\" meaning that extreme events occur more frequently than would be expected under a normal distribution. Standardised residuals from a GARCH model are likely to retain some of these characteristics, especially if the distributional assumptions of the model do not fully capture the leptokurtosis (fat tails) present in the data.\n\n(iv) False: The statement is incorrect because the standardised residuals are obtained by dividing the raw residuals by their respective conditional standard deviations. If the GARCH model is adequate, the standardised residuals will have a mean of zero and a constant variance equal to one, but they will not be identical to the raw residuals."
