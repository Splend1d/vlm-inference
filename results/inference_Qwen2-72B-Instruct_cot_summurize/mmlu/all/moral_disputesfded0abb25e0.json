Therefore, the correct answer is A. He argues that while it is true that some innocent people may be punished, the overall benefits of having a system of justice that punishes the guilty outweigh the costs of punishing the innocent. He also claims that the risk of punishing the innocent can be minimized through careful procedures and safeguards in the legal system. However, he acknowledges that the possibility of miscarriages of justice cannot be completely eliminated."
