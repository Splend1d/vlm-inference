In abstract algebra, a ring homomorphism \\(f: R \\to S\\) between two rings \\(R\\) and \\(S\\) is a function that preserves the ring operations. The kernel of this homomorphism, denoted as \\(\\ker(f)\\), is defined as the set of all elements in \\(R\\) that map to the zero element of \\(S\\). If the kernel is trivial (i.e., contains only the zero element of \\(R\\)), then the homomorphism is injective (one-to-one). This is because different elements in \\(R\\) cannot be mapped to the same element in \\(S\\) except for the zero element, which ensures that each element in \\(R\\) maps to a unique element in \\(S\\).\n\n### Statement 2\n\n\"Q is an ideal in R.\"\n\nThis statement cannot be evaluated without context, as it depends on what specific rings \\(Q\\) and \\(R\\) represent. However, considering the standard meaning of \"Q\" as the set of rational numbers and \"R\" as the set of real numbers in mathematics, we can analyze this statement.\n\nIn the context of rings, an ideal is a subset of a ring that is closed under addition and multiplication by any element of the ring. The set of rational numbers (\\(Q\\)) is not an ideal within the set of real numbers (\\(R\\)). This is because while \\(Q\\) is indeed a subring of \\(R\\), it does not satisfy the condition of being an ideal because multiplying a rational number by an irrational number (which is part of \\(R\\) but not part of \\(Q\\)) will result in an irrational number, thus not contained within \\(Q\\). Therefore, in this specific interpretation, the statement is **False**.\n\nHowever, without specific definitions for \\(Q\\) and \\(R\\), we cannot categorically state that the statement is false in every possible scenario. Still, based on common mathematical usage, we can say that the statement is typically false when \\(Q\\) represents the rationals and \\(R\\) represents the reals.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\nC. True, False"
