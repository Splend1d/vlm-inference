It is calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\beta = \\frac{\\text{Covariance}(r_a, r_m)}{\\text{Variance}(r_m)}\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\(r_a\\) is the return on the stock,\n- \\(r_m\\) is the return on the market,\n- \\(\\text{Covariance}(r_a, r_m)\\) is the covariance between the stock's returns and the market's returns, and\n- \\(\\text{Variance}(r_m)\\) is the variance of the market's returns.\n\nGiven that the covariance between Stock A and the market index is 88 (assuming this is given in percentage points squared, which is not standard but let's assume for calculation purposes), and the standard deviation of the market index is 14%, we can calculate the variance of the market index as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Variance} = (\\text{Standard Deviation})^2 = (14\\%)^2 = 196\\%\n\\]\n\nThus, the beta (\\(\\beta\\)) of Stock A can be calculated as:\n\n\\[\n\\beta = \\frac{88}{196} = 0.45\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. 0.45. However, it's important to note that typically covariance would be measured in units that reflect the underlying data (e.g., squared returns or squared percentage points), not just percentage points squared without context, so ensure the interpretation of the covariance value aligns with the standard deviation values given."
