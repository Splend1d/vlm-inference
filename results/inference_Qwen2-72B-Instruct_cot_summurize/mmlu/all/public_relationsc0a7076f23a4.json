While the other options describe situations that could lead to crises or issues within an organization, they do not necessarily indicate a crisis on their own. For example, option B might be part of a crisis scenario if the interruption is significant and unexpected, but it could also refer to a less severe disruption in operations. Option D, however, implies a sudden and potentially critical event."
