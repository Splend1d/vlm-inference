This is because merge sort divides the input into smaller subarrays until each subarray contains a single element, and then repeatedly merges subarrays to produce new sorted subarrays until there is only one subarray remaining. The algorithm does not depend on the initial order of elements, as it will always perform the same number of comparisons and swaps to sort the array.\n\nInsertion sort (A) and selection sort (D) have running times that are highly dependent on the initial ordering of the input. If the input is already sorted or nearly sorted, insertion sort can be very fast (O(n)), but if the input is in reverse order, it becomes very slow (O(n^2)). Selection sort always performs the same number of comparisons, but the number of swaps it makes depends on the initial ordering of the input.\n\nQuicksort (B) also has a running time that can be heavily influenced by the initial ordering of the input. In the worst case (when the input is already sorted or nearly sorted), quicksort can degrade to O(n^2). However, with good pivot selection strategies, quicksort can achieve an average-case running time of O(n log n), making it less dependent on the initial ordering than insertion or selection sort, but still more so than merge sort."
