Allan Hobson and Robert McCarley in 1977, suggests that dreams are the brain's attempt to make coherent experiences out of random neural activity that occurs during REM (Rapid Eye Movement) sleep. According to this theory, the brainstem generates random neural signals during REM sleep, which the higher cognitive functions of the forebrain then attempt to interpret and synthesize into a meaningful narrative or dream."
