Maternal serum \u03b1-fetoprotein (MSAFP) concentration is increased to 3 multiples of the median. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?\n\nA. Repeat measurement of MSAFP concentration\nB. Triple screening for MSAFP, serum \u03b2-hCG, and serum estriol concentrations\nC. Ultrasonography\nD.

Given that this patient has an uncertain last menstrual period and an elevated MSAFP, the most appropriate next step would be:\n\nC. Ultrasonography\n\nUltrasonography will help confirm the gestational age, check for multiple gestations, assess fetal anatomy for potential defects, and evaluate placental location and condition. It is a non-invasive test that can provide crucial information to guide further management.\n\nIf ultrasonography reveals no abnormalities, then repeating the MSAFP may be considered, especially if there is still uncertainty about gestational age. If ultrasound findings are concerning, amniocentesis might be indicated for further evaluation, but it is generally not the first-line response due to its invasive nature and associated risks. Triple screening (option B) could also be considered as part of a more comprehensive evaluation, but ultrasonography should precede it to inform whether additional testing is necessary."
