According to Milton Friedman, a leading proponent of monetarism, changes in the money supply primarily affect the overall price level and economic activity through multiple channels:\n\n1. Interest Rates: An increase in the money supply can lead to lower interest rates as banks have more funds to lend out, making borrowing cheaper for businesses and consumers. This can stimulate investment and consumption, thus boosting economic activity.\n\n2. Velocity of Money: The velocity of money refers to how quickly money circulates in the economy. If people expect prices to rise, they might spend money faster, increasing its velocity and contributing to inflation.\n\n3. Inflation: A sustained increase in the money supply beyond the growth rate of real output can lead to inflation, as too much money chases too few goods. This can erode purchasing power and affect economic planning and stability.\n\n4. Aggregate Demand: Changes in the money supply can shift aggregate demand, impacting employment and output levels. Higher money supply can lead to higher aggregate demand, which can boost economic growth if there is unused capacity in the economy.\n\n5. Exchange Rates: The money supply can also influence exchange rates. An increase in the money supply can lead to currency depreciation if it is not matched by an increase in demand for that currency.\n\n6. Asset Prices: Changes in the money supply can affect asset prices, such as stocks and real estate. More money in circulation can lead to higher asset prices as investors seek returns in assets.\n\nThus, according to monetarist theory, changes in the money supply affect the economy in several ways, not just through interest rates."
