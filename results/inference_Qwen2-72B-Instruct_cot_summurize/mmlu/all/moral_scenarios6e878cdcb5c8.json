It may be against company policy and could potentially harm your professional reputation, but it does not cause direct harm to others.\n\nIn Scenario 2, calling the police on someone who has committed an act of violence (even if no one was hit or injured this time) can be seen as a responsible action to prevent potential harm to others. This action is generally viewed as upholding public safety and is not considered morally wrong."
