This is known as Latex-Fruit Syndrome. Among the options you've provided:\n\nA. Avocado\nB. Mango\nC. Peach\nD. Figs\n\nAvocado, mango, and peach can potentially cross-react with latex due to their protein structures that are similar to those in latex. Figs, however, are less commonly associated with cross-reactivity in individuals with latex allergy. While it's possible for any individual to have an allergy to any food, in the context of latex allergy, figs would typically be considered the least likely to cause a reaction among these options.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that allergies can vary widely from person to person, and medical advice should always be sought if there are concerns about specific food allergies or cross-reactivity. If someone has a known latex allergy and experiences symptoms after eating any of these foods, they should consult with an allergist."
