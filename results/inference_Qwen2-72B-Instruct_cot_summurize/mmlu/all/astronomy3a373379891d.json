These gaps occur at distances from the Sun where the orbital periods of potential asteroids would be simple fractions (like 1/2, 2/3, 3/4, etc.) of Jupiter's orbital period. This is because the gravitational influence of Jupiter disrupts the orbits of asteroids in these regions, leading to instability and clearing out of asteroids over time.\n\nGiven the options provided:\n\nA. Asteroids would orbit with a period half that of Jupiter.\nB. Asteroids would orbit with a period twice that of Jupiter.\n\nBoth A and B describe situations where Kirkwood gaps would be expected to occur due to orbital resonances with Jupiter. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. A and B"
