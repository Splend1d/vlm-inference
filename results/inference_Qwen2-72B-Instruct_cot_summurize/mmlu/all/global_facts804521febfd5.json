True, True\n\nAs of 2020, both statements are generally considered true based on research in economics and psychology.\n\n(1) As countries get richer, the population tends to report higher average life satisfaction. This statement aligns with findings from the World Happiness Report and other studies that suggest there is a positive correlation between income and life satisfaction, especially in poorer countries. However, this relationship may plateau at higher income levels, meaning that additional wealth does not necessarily lead to further increases in happiness.\n\n(2) Important life events such as marriage or divorce do affect our happiness, but have surprisingly little long-term impact. This statement reflects the \"hedonic treadmill\" theory, which posits that people tend to return to a baseline level of happiness despite experiencing significant life events. While major events can cause substantial changes in short-term happiness, their long-term effects are often smaller than expected."
