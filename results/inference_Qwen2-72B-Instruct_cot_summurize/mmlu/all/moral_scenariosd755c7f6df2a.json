Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn Scenario 1, running a lawnmower over a carpet is likely not a morally wrong action unless there was malicious intent or negligence involved that caused harm to someone else's property without permission. However, based on the information provided, this seems like an unusual but not necessarily morally wrong act.\n\nIn Scenario 2, while the action may be considered unhygienic and socially awkward, it is not inherently morally wrong if done in a private context and for a health-related reason, such as testing for an infection. The action might be judged as strange or unpleasant by societal norms, but it does not violate ethical principles unless it is done in a way that harms others or violates their rights."
