One afternoon, the woman was in the kitchen of her home preparing a snack when she glanced out the window and saw a horrible crime being committed. The woman watched in horror as a local gang member pulled out a handgun and used it to shoot the victim, a member of a rival gang. The gang member did not know anyone was witnessing his act of shooting the victim. The woman watched as the victim collapsed and fell dead on her neighbor's front lawn. As a result of her shock from viewing this horrible incident, the woman suffered a miscarriage. If the woman asserts a claim against the local gang member who shot the victim, the woman will\n\nA. recover, because she suffered a physical injury, rather than just emotional harm.\nB. recover, because the gang member acted intentionally in shooting the victim.\nC. not recover, because the woman was not within the zone of danger.\nD. not recover, because the gang member was unaware that the woman was watching.\n"

This means that the plaintiff must have been at risk of physical harm themselves. In this case, the woman was not in any physical danger and was not within the zone of danger of the gang member's actions. However, some jurisdictions allow for recovery of damages for emotional distress even if the plaintiff was not within the zone of danger, so the answer may vary depending on the jurisdiction. It's also possible that the woman could assert other claims against the gang member, such as negligent infliction of emotional distress or intentional infliction of emotional distress, but these claims would depend on the specific facts of the case and the laws of the jurisdiction."
