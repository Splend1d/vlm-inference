Psychological support is also crucial, as pain can have significant emotional and mental impacts, leading to conditions such as anxiety and depression. Regular reassessment is necessary to ensure that the treatment plan remains effective and that any changes in the patient's condition are addressed promptly. Limiting drug side effects is important but not at the expense of adequately managing pain and addressing the patient's overall well-being."
