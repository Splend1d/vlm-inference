The first principle guarantees the basic liberties for all individuals, and the second principle addresses inequalities in distribution, stating that they should benefit the least advantaged members of society (the difference principle) and that social and economic inequalities should be arranged so that they are to the greatest benefit of the least advantaged (the principle of fair equality of opportunity). Accepting one principle without the other would not fully capture Rawls' vision of a just society."
