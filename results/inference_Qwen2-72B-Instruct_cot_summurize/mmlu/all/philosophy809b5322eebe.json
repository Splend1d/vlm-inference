This is because people from different cultures often have unique perspectives, values, and beliefs that shape their understanding of the world. When they engage in communication, they may interpret the interaction through the lens of their own cultural background, which can lead to misunderstandings or conflicts if they assume their perspective is the only valid one. Relativism acknowledges the diversity of cultural perspectives and encourages individuals to be open-minded and respectful of other viewpoints.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that Nussbaum herself does not explicitly categorize this as simply relativist versus absolutist, Kantian, or Aristotelian. Her work often focuses on the importance of empathy, understanding, and respect for human dignity across cultural differences, which could be seen as a more nuanced approach than strict relativism. But among the options provided, relativism best fits the description of how different cultural perspectives might view cross-cultural interactions."
