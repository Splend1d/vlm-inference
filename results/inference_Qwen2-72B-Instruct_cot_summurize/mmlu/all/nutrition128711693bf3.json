The embryonic period, which lasts from conception until around week 8 of pregnancy, is a critical time when major organs and structures develop. The embryo is particularly sensitive to environmental influences, including maternal nutrition.\n\nB. Many women do not realize they are pregnant until several weeks after conception, making it difficult to implement beneficial changes retroactively. By focusing on pre-conception health, women can ensure they have a good nutritional foundation before they know they are expecting.\n\nC. While nutrition remains important throughout pregnancy, interventions later in pregnancy may not reverse or mitigate some conditions or developmental issues that could have been prevented with earlier attention to diet and lifestyle. Early intervention can optimize outcomes for both mother and baby."
