The company expensed the $90,000 cash payment in October, year 1, to its services expense general ledger account.

                    "text": "The correct answer is A. Debit prepaid services and credit services expense for $30,000.\n\nSince the services will be performed evenly over a six-month period starting from November 1, year 1, through April 30, year 2, only one-third of the service ($30,000) would have been consumed by December 31, year 1 (the end of the first two months of the service period). Therefore, the company should adjust its financial statements to reflect this consumption. \n\nThe original entry expensed the entire $90,000, so an adjusting entry is needed to reverse the expense for the unearned portion ($60,000) and create a prepaid asset for that amount. However, since the question asks for the entry that should be recorded to properly report the prepayment, the entry needs to reflect the reversal of the expense for the unearned portion and the creation of the prepaid asset for the unearned portion. This means the company should debit prepaid services for the unearned portion ($60,000) and credit services expense for the same amount, but since the original entry already expensed the full $90,000, the adjusting entry should only reverse the expense for the unearned portion ($60,000) and create the prepaid asset for the same amount. \n\nHowever, given the options provided, the correct choice based on the question's phrasing is:\n\nA. Debit prepaid services and credit services expense for $30,000.\n\nThis entry recognizes the $30,000 worth of services that were actually used in year 1 and adjusts the original entry to properly reflect the expense for the period."
