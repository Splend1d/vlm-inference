Your father's firm making computers and exporting them to China will have an effect on GDP because it involves production and exchange of goods, which contributes to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the country.\n\nA. Losing $50 betting with a friend does not contribute to GDP since it is a transfer of money rather than the production or sale of goods or services.\nB. Fixing your brother's car without buying any new parts does not contribute to GDP if it is not done as part of a business transaction; it is considered a non-market activity.\nD. Buying 1000 shares of stock in a corporation does not directly affect GDP since it is a financial transaction and not related to the production or consumption of goods and services. However, the activities funded by the corporation through the use of those funds could indirectly impact GDP. But in this context, the mere act of buying shares does not count toward GDP."
