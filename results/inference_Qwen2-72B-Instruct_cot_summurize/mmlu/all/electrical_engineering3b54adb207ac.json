Inductance). This is because both mass and inductance store energy in their respective systems (mechanical and electrical) when subjected to a force or voltage, respectively. Just as the velocity of a mass is proportional to the integral of the force applied to it, the current through an inductor is proportional to the integral of the voltage across it. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Inductance."
