If Wayne's partner poses a serious threat, it is important for Dr. Pannick to take steps to protect himself and others. However, he should do so while respecting Wayne's autonomy and privacy by obtaining his permission before contacting the police. Terminating therapy without proper pre-termination counseling and referrals would not be ethical in this situation. Option D seems to mention \"Raymond\" instead of \"Wayne,\" which is likely a typo and not a valid choice given the context provided."
