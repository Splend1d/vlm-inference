Since each plane section perpendicular to the y-axis is a square, the side length of each square is equal to the distance between the two points where the curve \\(x^2 = 4y\\) intersects with that plane section.\n\nFirst, let's find the range of \\(y\\). The region is bounded below by \\(x^2 = 4y\\) and above by \\(y = 2\\). Setting these equations equal to each other gives:\n\\[x^2 = 4(2)\\]\n\\[x^2 = 8\\]\n\nSolving for \\(x\\) yields \\(x = \\pm 2\\sqrt{2}\\), which means that the solid extends from \\(x = -2\\sqrt{2}\\) to \\(x = 2\\sqrt{2}\\) along the x-axis, but we need the range in terms of \\(y\\). Given \\(y = 2\\) as an upper bound and \\(y = 0\\) (since \\(x^2 = 4y\\) implies \\(y \\geq 0\\)) as a lower bound, our range of integration will be from \\(y = 0\\) to \\(y = 2\\).\n\nFor a given \\(y\\), the length of the side of the square is twice the positive value of \\(x\\) since the square spans from one side of the parabola to the other. From \\(x^2 = 4y\\), we have \\(x = \\pm 2\\sqrt{y}\\). Thus, the length of the side of the square is \\(2*2\\sqrt{y} = 4\\sqrt{y}\\).\n\nThe area of each square slice is then \\((4\\sqrt{y})^2 = 16y\\).\n\nTo find the volume, integrate this area function over the range of \\(y\\):\n\\[V = \\int_{0}^{2} 16y dy = 16 \\left[ \\frac{y^2}{2} \\right]_0^2 = 16 \\left(\\frac{2^2}{2} - \\frac{0^2}{2}\\right) = 16 \\cdot 2 = 32\\]\n\nTherefore, the volume of the solid is \\(32\\), which corresponds to choice D."
