There is no good reason to think that doing one action will inevitably lead to another undesirable action.\n\nThe slippery slope fallacy occurs when someone asserts that a relatively small first step inevitably leads to a chain of related events culminating in some significant effect, often negative, without sufficient evidence for such an inevitability. If there are good reasons to believe that the chain of events could happen, then it's not necessarily a fallacy but rather a valid concern or prediction based on available evidence or historical precedent. However, if the connection between the initial action and the subsequent events is not well-supported by evidence, it becomes a fallacious argument."
