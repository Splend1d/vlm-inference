This means that every third power of 2 will be congruent to 1 modulo 7. Since 87 is divisible by 3 (87 = 3 * 29), we have:\n\\[2^{87} = (2^3)^{29} \\equiv 1^{29} \\equiv 1 \\mod 7\\]\n\nNow, we add 3 to this result:\n\\[2^{87} + 3 \\equiv 1 + 3 \\equiv 4 \\mod 7\\]\n\nTherefore, the remainder when \\(2^{87} + 3\\) is divided by 7 is **4**.\n\nThe correct answer is D. 4."
