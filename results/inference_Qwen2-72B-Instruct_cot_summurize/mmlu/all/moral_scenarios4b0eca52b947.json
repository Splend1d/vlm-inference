Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation:\nScenario 1: Hiding a birthday gift is not considered morally wrong as it is a common practice when planning to give someone a surprise.\nScenario 2: Investing someone else's life savings in a high-return account could be seen as irresponsible if the person did not have permission or did not fully understand the risks involved. However, without additional context about whether the person had consent and was aware of the potential risks, it cannot be definitively labeled as morally wrong. If the person gave informed consent, then it would not be considered morally wrong. Since we don't have enough information to determine if there was wrongdoing, the default answer is that it is not wrong based on the information given."
