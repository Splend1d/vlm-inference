All patients enrolled in the study are informed that they would be treated with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor. They are assigned to successive dose cohorts of 300 to 1000 mg/day of the drug. Six to eight patients are assigned to each dose. Treatment efficacy is determined based on the results of complete blood counts and bone marrow assessments conducted regularly throughout the study. This study is best described as which of the following?\n\nA. Case-control study\nB. Crossover study\nC. Open-labeled clinical trial\nD. Randomized clinical trial\n"

Open-labeled clinical trial\n\nThis study design involves administering different doses of a new drug to successive groups of patients without using a placebo or blinding the patients or the researchers to the treatment being given. The efficacy is assessed through regular monitoring of blood counts and bone marrow assessments. This is characteristic of an open-labeled clinical trial where the effects of the drug at various doses are being evaluated."
