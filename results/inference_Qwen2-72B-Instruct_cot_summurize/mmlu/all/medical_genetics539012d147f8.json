Monozygotic twinning occurs when a single fertilized egg (ovum) splits and develops into two babies with exactly the same genetic information. However, it's worth noting that complications can occur in any pregnancy, including those involving monozygotic twins, but their mere existence is not indicative of chromosomal abnormalities.\n\nIn contrast:\n\nA. Duodenal atresia is often associated with Down syndrome (Trisomy 21).\n\nB. Holoprosencephaly is frequently linked to chromosomal abnormalities, including Trisomy 13 and Trisomy 18.\n\nC. Hydrops fetalis can be caused by various factors, including chromosomal abnormalities such as Turner syndrome or other aneuploidies."
