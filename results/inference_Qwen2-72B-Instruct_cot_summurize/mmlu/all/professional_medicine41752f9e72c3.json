It's non-invasive, readily available, and does not expose the patient to ionizing radiation.\n\nWhile fine-needle aspiration (C) is a common next step if ultrasonography suggests the nodule has features concerning for malignancy, it is typically not the initial test performed. Nuclear thyroid scans (A) and Iodine-131 scans (B) may be used to assess the function of the nodule (hot, cold, warm) but are less commonly used as initial tests for evaluating a newly discovered thyroid nodule."
