Therefore, option A is the most appropriate answer. However, some environmental philosophers argue that even non-conscious entities such as ecosystems or species have moral standing because they contribute to the overall health and well-being of the environment. So, option C could also be considered a valid answer depending on one's philosophical perspective. Option D represents a position that denies any nonhuman or nonconscious beings have direct moral standing, which is not necessarily consistent with an environmental ethic."
