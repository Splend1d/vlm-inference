To claim that one has a prima facie duty to obey the law is to assert that the obligation arises independently of the precise legal provisions involved - unless there are grounds to justify a specific exception. This means that generally, one should obey the law, but there may be circumstances where breaking the law can be justified, such as in cases of civil disobedience or when the law itself is unjust. Options A, B, and C do not accurately represent the concept of a prima facie duty to obey the law."
