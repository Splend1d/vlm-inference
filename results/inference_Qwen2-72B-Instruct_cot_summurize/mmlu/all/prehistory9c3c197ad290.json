Burials with exotic grave goods also contain bones indicating that they engaged in less strenuous labor.\n\nThis answer suggests a clear distinction between different members of the society based on the presence of exotic grave goods and the physical condition of the remains, which implies a division of labor and access to resources that could indicate social stratification and inequality. In ancient societies, the presence of valuable items in burials often signifies higher status or wealth, while the condition of the bones can give clues about the type of work or lifestyle the individual had. Less strenuous labor could be associated with a higher social class that did not have to engage in physically demanding tasks for survival."
