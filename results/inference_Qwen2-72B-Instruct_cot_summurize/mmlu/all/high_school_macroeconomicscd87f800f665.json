The most direct effect is that it reduces the amount of debt that needs to be serviced, potentially freeing up resources for other uses and decreasing the amount of borrowing needed from capital markets. This reduction in demand for loanable funds can lead to lower interest rates as there is less competition for available capital.\n\nLower interest rates could stimulate economic activity by making it cheaper for businesses and consumers to borrow money, which can lead to increased investment and consumption. However, if the economy is already at or near full capacity, lower interest rates might indeed risk an inflationary period because of increased spending outpacing production capabilities.\n\nTherefore, the answer that best fits the scenario described would be:\n\nC. Decrease interest rates and risk an inflationary period. \n\nHowever, it's important to note that whether an inflationary period actually occurs depends on various factors, including the state of the economy, monetary policy, and external economic conditions. A well-managed economy may not necessarily experience high inflation even with lower interest rates."
