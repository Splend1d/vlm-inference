                    "text": "When an object moves at speeds close to the speed of light, its relativistic mass increases according to the theory of relativity. This increase in mass is due to the object's increased energy of motion, which contributes to its total mass-energy. However, this effect is not noticeable for everyday speeds and becomes significant only at velocities very close to the speed of light.\n\nRegarding the pulse, it would appear to decrease from the perspective of an observer who is stationary relative to the traveler. This is because time dilation occurs as one approaches the speed of light. Time dilation means that time appears to pass more slowly for the moving object (in this case, the traveler) compared to a stationary observer. Thus, processes like the beating of the heart (pulse) would seem slower to the stationary observer.\n\nHowever, from the traveler's own frame of reference, they would not experience any change in their pulse rate or any other biological process. All these effects are relative and depend on the frame of reference from which observations are made.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\nC. Both of these. (But with the clarification that the effects are observed from different frames of reference.)"
