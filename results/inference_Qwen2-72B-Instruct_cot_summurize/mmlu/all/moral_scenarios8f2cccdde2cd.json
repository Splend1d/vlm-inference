Not wrong, Wrong.\nScenario 1: Chopping down trees that were intended for lumber may not necessarily be considered morally wrong if the individual had permission or ownership rights over the trees. However, if the trees were on protected land or belonged to someone else, then it could be considered morally and legally wrong.\nScenario 2: Touching paintings at the Louvre is clearly against the rules and can cause damage to the artwork. It is also considered disrespectful and morally wrong to touch art that is not meant to be touched."
