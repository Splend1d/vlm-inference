It provides insights into why certain species have evolved specific traits in different regions due to environmental factors and historical events. In this case, biogeography would help explain why monkeys in South and Central America developed prehensile tails while those in Africa and Asia did not, based on the ecological differences and evolutionary pressures present in these regions."
