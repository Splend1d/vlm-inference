In this case, the baby duck initially responds to the object being tossed over its head by running for cover (a response likely triggered due to potential danger). However, after experiencing the event multiple times without any negative consequences, the duck learns that the object does not pose a threat and thus stops reacting to it. This cessation of response is an example of habituation."
