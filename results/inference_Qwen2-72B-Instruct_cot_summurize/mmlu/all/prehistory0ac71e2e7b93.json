The majority of the crops that were important during the European Neolithic period were not native to Europe and were instead introduced through trade or migration from other regions, particularly from the Fertile Crescent in the Middle East where agriculture first developed. These crops included wheat, barley, peas, lentils, and flax.\n\nOptions A, B, and C are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nA. Domestication did not occur simultaneously at communal farms. Domestication was a gradual process that took place over thousands of years in different parts of the world.\n\nB. While some domestication may have occurred before groups became sedentary, it is not true for all crops, and this statement does not specifically address the crops important in the European Neolithic.\n\nC. Most of the crops important in the European Neolithic were not independently domesticated in Europe but rather brought there from other regions where they had been domesticated earlier."
