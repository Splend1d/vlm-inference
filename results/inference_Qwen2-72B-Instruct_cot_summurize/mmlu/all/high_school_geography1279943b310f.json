Deep dissection and erosion\n\nAlluvial landscapes are typically formed by the deposition of sediment by rivers or floods, which leads to the creation of features such as floodplains, deltas, and river terraces. These landscapes are characterized by a deep cover of loose materials (A) that have been deposited over time, predominance of gentle slopes (B) due to the relatively flat areas where sediments accumulate, and frequent flooding (C) which helps in the redistribution and deposition of sediments.\n\nDeep dissection and erosion (D), however, are more commonly associated with landscapes like canyons, valleys, and gorges, which are formed through the erosive power of water cutting down into the bedrock, rather than through the depositional processes typical of alluvial landscapes."
