On one hand, sexuality is often portrayed as a positive and sacred aspect of human life within the context of marriage (as seen in the Song of Songs). On the other hand, it is also presented as something that must be considered in light of its social consequences, with strict rules governing sexual behavior, particularly regarding adultery, incest, and other forms of sexual misconduct. Therefore, the answer is D. a and b."
