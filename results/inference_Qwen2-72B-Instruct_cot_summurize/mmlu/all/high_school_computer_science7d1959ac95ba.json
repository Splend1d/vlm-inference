Then it checks if the number is exactly 0, if so it returns true, otherwise it returns false.\n\nLet's analyze the behavior of the procedure for different initial values of number:\n\n1. If the initial value of number is an even positive integer, then after decrementing by 2 multiple times, it will eventually reach 0, and the procedure will return true.\n2. If the initial value of number is an odd positive integer, then after decrementing by 2 multiple times, it will eventually reach 1, and then become -1 after one more iteration, at which point the loop will stop and the procedure will return false because number is not equal to 0.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. The procedure returns true when the initial value of number is even, and it otherwise returns false."
