The mass of the Earth is \\(M_E\\), and its radius is \\(r_E\\). On the new planet, both the mass and the radius are twice those of Earth, so we have \\(M_P = 2M_E\\) and \\(r_P = 2r_E\\).\n\nSubstituting these into the weight formula gives us:\n\n\\[W_{P} = \\frac{G(2M_E)m}{(2r_E)^2} = \\frac{G(2M_E)m}{4r_E^2}\\]\n\nSimplifying this gives:\n\n\\[W_{P} = \\frac{G(2)M_Em}{4r_E^2} = \\frac{1}{2}\\cdot\\frac{GM_Em}{r_E^2}\\cdot2\\]\n\nWe know that \\(\\frac{GM_Em}{r_E^2}\\) is the weight on Earth (\\(W_E = 800N\\)), so:\n\n\\[W_{P} = \\frac{1}{2}\\cdot800\\cdot2 = 800N\\]\n\nHowever, this simplification doesn't correctly reflect the increase in gravity due to the increased mass. Let's correct this using the simplified form of the weight formula for comparison between planets:\n\n\\[W \\propto \\frac{M}{r^2}\\]\n\nFor the Earth, we have:\n\n\\[W_E \\propto \\frac{M_E}{r_E^2}\\]\n\nFor the new planet:\n\n\\[W_P \\propto \\frac{2M_E}{(2r_E)^2} = \\frac{2M_E}{4r_E^2} = \\frac{1}{2}\\cdot\\frac{2M_E}{r_E^2} = \\frac{2M_E}{r_E^2}\\]\n\nSo, the weight on the new planet is directly proportional to the weight on Earth when the mass is doubled and the radius is doubled:\n\n\\[W_P = 2W_E\\]\n\nGiven \\(W_E = 800N\\):\n\n\\[W_P = 2 \\times 800N = 1600N\\]\n\nThus, the correct answer is D. 1600 N."
