This process helps to warm a planet's surface. However, the Martian atmosphere is about 100 times thinner than Earth's, meaning it contains far fewer molecules per unit volume to absorb and re-emit the heat. As a result, despite being composed mostly of carbon dioxide (a potent greenhouse gas), Mars cannot retain enough heat to maintain a warmer temperature."
