She says the urinary symptoms typically begin a few days before she is going to fly and they stop the day after she arrives at her destination. She says she is anxious about flying and even slightly \"panicky.\" She reports having had similar but milder symptoms prior to examinations before graduating. Medical history is otherwise unremarkable. Her only medication is an oral contraceptive. Vital signs are normal. Physical examination discloses no abnormalities. Urinalysis and urine culture are normal. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?\n\nA. Recommend behavioral therapy\nB. Recommend psychoanalytic psychotherapy\nC. Recommend that the patient avoid any stressful activities that cause the problem\nD. Review the patient's sexual history\n"

Behavioral therapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), can help patients identify and change negative thought patterns and behaviors, which may alleviate her anxiety and consequently improve her urinary symptoms. This approach is often effective for anxiety disorders and stress-related health issues."
