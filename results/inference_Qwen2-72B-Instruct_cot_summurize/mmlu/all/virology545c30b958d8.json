Contingency management is a behavioral therapy approach that uses positive reinforcement to encourage and maintain desired behaviors. It has been used in various settings, including substance use disorder treatment, to reinforce abstinence or other positive health behaviors. Option B comes closest to describing one specific application of contingency management, but it does not encompass the full scope of the approach. Therefore, the answer is not listed among the options provided. \n\nTo clarify further:\nA. Contingency management is not necessarily a strategy of last resort, but rather an evidence-based approach that can be used as part of a comprehensive treatment plan.\nB. Paying drug users for negative urine specimens is one specific application of contingency management, but it is not the only one.\nC. Paying sex workers to use condoms is not typically considered a form of contingency management, although it could potentially be used as part of a larger intervention.\nD. Paying drug users to use condoms is also not typically considered a form of contingency management, although it could potentially be used as part of a larger intervention."
