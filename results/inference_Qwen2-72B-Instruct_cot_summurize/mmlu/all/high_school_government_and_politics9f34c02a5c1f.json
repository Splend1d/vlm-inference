Fiscal federalism\n\nFiscal federalism is the division of functions, powers, and responsibilities, as well as the sharing of revenue between the central government and the subnational governments (such as states or provinces). When the federal government provides most of the funding for a project that involves multiple levels of government working together, it is an example of fiscal federalism in action. This often occurs through grants or other forms of financial assistance provided by the federal government to state and local governments for specific projects or programs."
