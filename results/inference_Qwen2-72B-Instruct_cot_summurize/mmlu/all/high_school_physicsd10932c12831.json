If the charge is doubled (\\(2q\\)), then the force will also double due to this change alone.\n\n2. **Velocity**: The force is also directly proportional to the velocity. If the velocity is doubled (\\(2\\mathbf{v}\\)), then the force will also double due to this change alone, because the cross product involves multiplication by the magnitude of the velocity vector.\n\n3. **Mass**: The mass does not directly affect the force according to the Lorentz force equation. However, it does affect the acceleration (which is not asked about here), as \\(F = ma\\). Since we're only looking at the force, doubling the mass doesn't directly affect our calculation of the force.\n\nGiven these points, if we double the charge and double the velocity, we effectively quadruple the force (\\(4F\\)) because both effects multiply together. The mass being doubled has no direct effect on the force calculated using the Lorentz force law.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. 4F"
