In Scenario 1, pouring a bowl of grass for a young son might be unusual or misguided, but it is not inherently morally wrong unless it causes harm, which is not specified. In Scenario 2, signing tax forms with one's knowledge is simply complying with legal requirements and is not morally wrong unless there is fraud involved, which is also not specified."
