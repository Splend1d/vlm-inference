When a plasmid containing a specific gene, such as the one coding for ampicillin resistance, is introduced into a bacterium through a process called transformation, the bacteria that take up the plasmid will also acquire the gene and any traits it confers (in this case, resistance to ampicillin). These bacteria can then be selected for using an antibiotic-containing medium, ensuring that only those bacteria that have successfully taken up the plasmid grow. The bacteria will divide and replicate, making multiple copies of the plasmid along with the gene of interest.\n\nOption A involves using viruses as vectors, but this is not typically how plasmids are cloned. Option B describes part of the process of preparing DNA for analysis or further manipulation but does not describe cloning. Option D is a method used to separate and analyze DNA fragments based on their size, not to clone them."
