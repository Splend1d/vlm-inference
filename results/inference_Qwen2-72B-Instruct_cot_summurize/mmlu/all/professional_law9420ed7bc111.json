                    "text": "A landowner was the record owner of a 30-acre orchard outside the city. The landowner lived in a farmhouse on the orchard and used the property to raise produce. Adjoining the orchard directly to the west was a 10-acre vineyard that was owned in fee simple by a farmer. A four-lane highway adjoined the orchard directly to the east. The farmer discovered that the southern portion of the orchard was rarely used by the landowner for any of the landowner's farming activities and found a convenient gravel road leading from the vineyard across the orchard all the way to the four- lane highway. The farmer used this road adversely and openly for the entire 20-year prescriptive period, and in doing so, the farmer has acquired a prescriptive easement over the roadway across the orchard. Thereafter, the farmer conveys the vineyard to a buyer in fee simple. The deed recited that \"the grantor hereby conveys the vineyard, together with an easement for the right of way across the orcharX, to the grantee. \"After the buyer took possession of the vineyard, the landowner brought an appropriate action to prevent him from using the roadway across the orchard. The issue that will determine the outcome of this suit is whether\n\nA. the description in the farmer's deed to the buyer was adequate to identify the portion of the orchard that the farmer used as a roadway.\nB. the buyer will make excessive use of the roadway.\nC. easements can be reserved to third parties.\nD. the easement was appurtenant.\n"

                    "text": "The issue that will determine the outcome of this suit is D. whether the easement was appurtenant.\n\nAn easement can be either appurtenant or in gross. An appurtenant easement benefits a particular piece of land (the dominant tenement) and burdens another piece of land (the servient tenement). If the easement acquired by prescription by the farmer was appurtenant to the vineyard, it would transfer with the vineyard when the farmer conveyed the property to the buyer. In other words, if the easement was appurtenant, the buyer would have the right to continue using the roadway across the orchard as long as the vineyard exists and continues to benefit from the easement.\n\nIf the easement was not appurtenant but rather in gross (meaning it was personal to the farmer and did not necessarily attach to the land), then it would not have transferred automatically to the buyer when the farmer sold the vineyard. In this case, the farmer would need to have explicitly granted the easement to the buyer in the deed for the buyer to have the right to use the roadway.\n\nGiven the language in the deed (\"together with an easement for the right of way across the orcharX\"), it appears that the farmer intended to convey the easement along with the vineyard, which suggests that the easement was appurtenant. However, the court will need to determine whether the easement was indeed appurtenant based on the facts of the case, including the manner in which the farmer used the roadway and the relationship between the easement and the vineyard."
