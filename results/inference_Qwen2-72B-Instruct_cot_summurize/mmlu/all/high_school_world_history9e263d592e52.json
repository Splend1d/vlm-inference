These organizations were designed to represent the interests of workers and advocate for better treatment, pay, and working conditions. While guilds had played a role in earlier periods in protecting the interests of skilled workers, and joint-stock companies were a form of business organization, it was labor unions that emerged during the Industrial Revolution to address the issues faced by workers like Joshua Drake. Zaibatsu groups are large Japanese conglomerates that emerged in the late 19th century and are not related to labor conditions or unionization."
