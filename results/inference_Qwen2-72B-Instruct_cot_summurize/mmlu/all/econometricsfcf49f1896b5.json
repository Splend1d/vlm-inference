While it might seem that ARCH(q) could be more parsimonious because it has fewer parameters if q is small, GARCH(1,1) often requires fewer parameters to capture long-term dependencies in volatility. Thus, GARCH(1,1) is generally considered more parsimonious.\n\nii) This statement is true. In an ARCH(q) model, non-negative constraints on the parameters are necessary to ensure that the conditional variance is positive. With many parameters (large q), it becomes harder to satisfy these constraints, particularly when using maximum likelihood estimation methods.\n\niii) This statement is false. An ARCH(q) model can only account for the impact of up to q lags of squared returns on the current conditional variance. It cannot accommodate an infinite number of lags.\n\niv) This statement is true. A GARCH(1,1) model can often capture most of the dependence in the conditional variance due to its structure, which allows for both short-term and long-term volatility clustering effects with just two parameters plus an intercept term.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: (ii) and (iv) only."
