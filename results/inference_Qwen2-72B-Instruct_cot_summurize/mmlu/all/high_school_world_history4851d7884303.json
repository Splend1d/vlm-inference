                    "text": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"The spontaneous forces of capitalism have been steadily growing in the countryside in recent years, with new rich peasants springing up everywhere and many well-to-do middle peasants striving to become rich peasants. On the other hand, many poor peasants are still living in poverty for lack of sufficient means of production, with some in debt and others selling or renting out their land. If this tendency goes unchecked, the polarization in the countryside will inevitably be aggravated day by day. Those peasants who lose their land and those who remain in poverty will complain that we are doing nothing to save them from ruin or to help them overcome their difficulties. Nor will the well-to-do middle peasants who are heading in the capitalist direction be pleased with us, for we shall never be able to satisfy their demands unless we intend to take the capitalist road. Can the worker-peasant alliance continue to stand in these circumstances? Obviously not! There is no solution to this problem except on a new basis. And that means to bring about, step by step, the socialist transformation of the whole of agriculture simultaneously with the gradual realization of socialist industrialization and the socialist transformation of handicrafts and capitalist industry and commerce; in other words, it means to carry out co-operation and eliminate the rich-peasant economy and the individual economy in the countryside so that all the rural people will become increasingly well off together. We maintain that this is the only way to consolidate the worker-peasant alliance.\"\nMao Zedong, On the Question of Agricultural Co-operation, 1955\nWhich of the following best explains Mao's concept of the \"socialist transformation of the whole of agriculture\" in China?\n\nA. Agriculture fueled industrialization in cities as excess labor flowed from the countryside to urban centers.\nB. Agricultural surpluses allowed the state to invest more heavily in modernizing agricultural production.\nC. Agricultural efficiency reduced prices of basic commodities, raising the standard of living across the whole of China.\nD. Agriculture was collectivized, with the result that entire communities shared fields instead of individuals owning the land as private property.\n"

Agriculture was collectivized, with the result that entire communities shared fields instead of individuals owning the land as private property.\n\nMao's concept of the \"socialist transformation of the whole of agriculture\" involved the collectivization of agriculture where land ownership was transformed from individual or family-based to community-owned and managed cooperatives. This was part of a broader strategy to consolidate the worker-peasant alliance and ensure that all rural people would become increasingly well off together, eliminating the disparities between rich and poor peasants."
