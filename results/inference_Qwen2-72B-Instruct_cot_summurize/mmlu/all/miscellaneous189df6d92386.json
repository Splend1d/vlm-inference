Placing celery stalks in water colored with a dye and observing the results\n\nThis activity is the most effective for introducing kindergartners to the concept of how plants transport water because it provides a clear visual demonstration of water moving through the plant's xylem (the vascular tissue that transports water and nutrients from the roots to the leaves). When the celery is placed in colored water, the dye moves up the stalk, making the process of water transport visible to young children. This hands-on experiment helps them understand the basic principle of capillary action and transpiration in an engaging and age-appropriate way."
