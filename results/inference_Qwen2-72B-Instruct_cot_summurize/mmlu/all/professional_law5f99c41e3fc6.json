On numerous occasions the collector had rejected offers to sell his prized collection. Finally, on December 1, the collector sent his cousin, who was also a stamp collector, the following letter:\"I've decided to part with my stamp collection. Since I want to keep it in the family, I'll sell you my entire collection for $75,000. \"The collector had dictated this letter to his secretary, who mistakenly typed \"$75,000,\" instead of $78,000 that the collector had specified. After typing the letter, the secretary gave it to the collector, who hastily signed it without noticing the mistaken price. The cousin received this letter on December 3. On December 5, the cousin sent a letter accepting the collector's offer. Which of the following correctly states the agreement's price term and its legal effect?\n\nA. The price term is $75,000, and it is enforceable.\nB. The price term is $78,000, and it is enforceable.\nC. The price term is $75,000, but the court will reform the price to $78,000 in order to correct a mistake in integration.\nD. The price term is $75,000, but either party can rescind the contract, because there was a mutual mistake as to a basic assumption of fact.\n"

                    "text": "A. The price term is $75,000, and it is enforceable.\n\nExplanation: The collector's letter constitutes an offer to sell the stamp collection at a specific price, which is $75,000 as mistakenly typed by the secretary. The cousin accepted the offer by sending a letter on December 5th. At the moment the acceptance was made, a binding contract was formed between the two parties at the price stated in the offer, which is $75,000.\n\nAlthough there was a unilateral mistake (made by the collector's secretary) regarding the price, the cousin did not know about this mistake and accepted the offer as presented. Under common law principles, a unilateral mistake does not generally render a contract void or voidable unless the non-mistaken party knew or should have known of the mistake. In this case, there is no indication that the cousin knew of the mistake, so the contract is enforceable at the $75,000 price term.\n\nOption C suggests reformation of the contract, which could be possible if both parties were aware of the mistake and agreed to the correction. However, since the cousin accepted the offer as it was presented, reformation would require a court order, which might not be granted if the cousin was unaware of the mistake and acted in good faith.\n\nOption D suggests that either party can rescind the contract due to a mutual mistake. This is incorrect because there was no mutual mistake; only the collector made a mistake, and the cousin was unaware of it when they accepted the offer. Therefore, the contract is enforceable at the $75,000 price term."
