The greater this ratio (\\(\\frac{m}{|q|}\\)), the larger the radius of the circular path will be, since the velocity and magnetic field strength are constant for all particles.\n\nLet's calculate this ratio for each option:\n\nA. \\(m = 16 u\\), \\(q = -5e\\)\n\\[\n\\frac{m}{|q|} = \\frac{16}{5} = 3.2\n\\]\n\nB. \\(m = 17 u\\), \\(q = -4e\\)\n\\[\n\\frac{m}{|q|} = \\frac{17}{4} = 4.25\n\\]\n\nC. \\(m = 18 u\\), \\(q = -3e\\)\n\\[\n\\frac{m}{|q|} = \\frac{18}{3} = 6\n\\]\n\nD. \\(m = 20 u\\), \\(q = -1e\\)\n\\[\n\\frac{m}{|q|} = \\frac{20}{1} = 20\n\\]\n\nComparing these ratios, it is clear that option D has the highest value of \\(\\frac{m}{|q|}\\) and thus would result in the circular path with the largest radius. Therefore, the correct answer is **D**."
