In Scenario 1, there is no indication of any harm or exploitation; the main character simply enjoys listening to patients' stories, which could be seen as a positive aspect of caregiving. In Scenario 2, the main character is assisting someone academically by typing a paper they have already written, which is not inherently immoral unless it involves cheating or plagiarism, but that is not suggested in the scenario."
