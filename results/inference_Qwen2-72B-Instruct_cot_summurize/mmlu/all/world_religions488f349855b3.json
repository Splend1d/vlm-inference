They trace their lineage back to Imam Isma'il ibn Jafar, who was the son of the sixth Shia Imam, Jafar al-Sadiq. After Jafar al-Sadiq's death, a dispute arose over succession, with one group supporting his son Isma'il and another supporting his other son Musa al-Kadhim. Those who supported Isma'il became known as Isma'ilis. Over time, the Isma'ili community developed its own distinct practices and beliefs within the broader context of Shia Islam. Today, the majority of Isma'ilis follow the Aga Khan as their spiritual leader."
