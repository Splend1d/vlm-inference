The least common multiple of 9 and 12 is 36, so we convert both fractions to have this common denominator:\n\n\\( \\frac{7}{9} = \\frac{7 \\times 4}{9 \\times 4} = \\frac{28}{36} \\)\n\n\\( \\frac{5}{12} = \\frac{5 \\times 3}{12 \\times 3} = \\frac{15}{36} \\)\n\nNow we can subtract them:\n\n\\( \\frac{28}{36} - \\frac{15}{36} = \\frac{28-15}{36} = \\frac{13}{36} \\)\n\nSo the answer is A. \\( \\frac{13}{36} \\)."
