In this scenario, the man made a clear offer (to pay $25 if the lawn was mowed by Saturday) and the neighbor accepted the offer by performing the requested action (mowing the lawn on Friday). A unilateral contract is formed when one party promises to do something in exchange for an act by another party. The promise becomes binding when the act is performed."
