The patterns of trait inheritance observed in pea plants were repeatedly demonstrated in other eukaryotes.\n\nMendel's principles, including the principle of segregation, were initially based on his experiments with pea plants. However, these principles were later confirmed through repeated experiments in various other organisms, demonstrating that they were not specific to pea plants but applied universally across different species. This reproducibility and universality led to Mendel's principles being accepted as fundamental laws of genetics."
