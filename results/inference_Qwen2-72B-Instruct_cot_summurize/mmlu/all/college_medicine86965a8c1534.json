This leads to an increased breakdown of ATP (adenosine triphosphate) to ADP (adenosine diphosphate) and then further to AMP (adenosine monophosphate). The degradation of AMP produces inosine monophosphate (IMP), which can be converted to hypoxanthine. Hypoxanthine is then converted to uric acid in the liver. Additionally, the degradation of amino acids during intense exercise can lead to the production of ammonia. Therefore, ammonia, hypoxanthine, and uric acid concentrations in the blood are likely to increase during multiple sprint sports."
