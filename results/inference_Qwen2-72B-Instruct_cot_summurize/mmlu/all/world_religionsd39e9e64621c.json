The Ka'ba is a significant site in Islam and is believed to have been built by Abraham and his son Ishmael. It is a cube-shaped building located in Mecca, Saudi Arabia, and is considered the most sacred site in Islam. It is also a haram, which means it is a sanctuary where violence and hunting are prohibited."
