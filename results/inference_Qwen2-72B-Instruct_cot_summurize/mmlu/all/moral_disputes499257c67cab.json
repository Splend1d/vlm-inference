However, based on his critique of the death penalty, Reiman suggests that the refusal to execute criminals teaches that the state should not take human life as it violates the moral principle of the sanctity of human life. He argues that the death penalty does not serve as an effective deterrent and that life imprisonment without parole is a more humane and just punishment for serious crimes. Therefore, option B is not correct, and options C and D are not directly related to Reiman's argument. Option A may be partially correct, but it does not capture the full scope of Reiman's argument."
