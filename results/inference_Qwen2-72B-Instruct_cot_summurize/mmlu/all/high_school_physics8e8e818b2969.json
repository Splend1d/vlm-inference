However, they do not form an action-reaction pair because they act on the same object (the person). An action-reaction pair involves two forces that are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction but act on different objects. In this case, the action-reaction pair would be the normal force exerted by the person on the floor (downward) and the normal force exerted by the floor on the person (upward)."
