The formula for the circumference of a circle is given by $C = 2\\pi r$, where $C$ is the circumference and $r$ is the radius.\n\nGiven that $C = 12\\pi$, we can set up the equation:\n\n\\[12\\pi = 2\\pi r\\]\n\nSolving for $r$, we divide both sides by $2\\pi$:\n\n\\[r = \\frac{12\\pi}{2\\pi} = 6\\]\n\nSo, the radius of the circle is $6$ units.\n\nSince the sides of the square are the same length as the radius of the circle, each side of the square is also $6$ units long.\n\nThe area of a square is found using the formula $A = s^2$, where $s$ is the length of a side of the square.\n\nSubstituting $s = 6$ into the formula gives us:\n\n\\[A = (6)^2 = 36\\]\n\nTherefore, the area of the square is $36$ square units, which corresponds to choice D."
