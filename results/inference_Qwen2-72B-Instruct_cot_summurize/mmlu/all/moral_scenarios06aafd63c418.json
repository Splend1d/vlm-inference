In fact, it could be seen as considerate.\n\nIn Scenario 2, you are merely observing an action; you did not participate in or facilitate the theft of medication. However, if you were aware that the nurse was stealing medication and did nothing about it, that could be considered morally wrong due to omission. Since the question specifically asks about actions done by \"I/me/my,\" and not what one fails to do, watching without participating is not inherently wrong. But it's important to note that reporting such behavior might be a moral obligation depending on the circumstances."
