                    "text": "This question refers to the following information.\nQuestions to the passage below, an account given to a French officer in Algeria in the 1830s by a member of an Arab slave trade caravan.\nThe Slave Trade\nAll of you [soldiers], are summoned . . . to hunt the idolatrous Koholanes [a pejorative word for \"black Africans\"]. . . . The soldiery divided themselves into two companies . . . with orders to attack places without defenses and to carry off the inhabitants as well as seizing all peasants busy cultivating their fields. . . . Whilst waiting for the return of the companies despatched to hunt Negroes, we went every day to the slave market where we bought at the following prices:\nA Negro with beard\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u202610 or 15,000 cowries.\nThey are not considered as merchandise since one has little chance of preventing them from escaping.\nAn adult Negress\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..10 or 15,000 cowries for the same reasons\nAn adolescent Negro\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.30,000 cowries\nA young Negress \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u202650\u201360,000 cowries\nThe price varies according to whether she is more or less beautiful.\nA male Negro child\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..45,000 cowries\nA female Negro child \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.35\u201340,000 cowries\nFinally, our caravan which had set out from Algeria with sixty-four camels and only sixteen persons, was now augmented by four hundred slaves, of whom three hundred were women. . . . It was at this point that suddenly a confused noise of cries and sobs passed from one group of slaves to another and reached our own. . . . Some rolled on the ground, clung to bushes and absolutely refused to walk. . . . They could only be got up with mighty lashes of the whip and by rendering them completely bloody.\nWhich conclusion is supported by the passage?\n\nA. Africans passively accepted their capture and subsequent enslavement.\nB. North Africans were primarily captured and enslaved by rival African tribes.\nC. Population changes from slavery resulted in North African tribes having more men than women.\nD. Adult male slaves were most highly valued due to their physical strength.\n"

                    "text": "The conclusion that is supported by the passage is:\n\nC. Population changes from slavery resulted in North African tribes having more men than women.\n\nThe passage mentions that out of the four hundred slaves acquired by the caravan, three hundred were women. This suggests a gender imbalance resulting from the slave trade, with more women being taken as slaves than men. While option D might seem plausible based on general knowledge of the slave trade valuing physical strength, the passage specifically states that adolescent and young female slaves were more valuable than adult males, contradicting this option. Options A and B are not supported by the information provided in the passage."
