The [Muslims] are exceedingly numerous here. This whole city is surrounded by a wall: each of the six [districts of Hangzhou] is also surrounded by a wall.

However, it does provide evidence to support option C, as it describes the King of China being a descendant of Genghis Khan, indicating the influence of steppe nomads in the region. Additionally, it mentions the presence of Muslims, Jews, Christians, and others in the city, suggesting that trade links were active and that the empire of the steppe nomads had helped to unite these connections across Eurasia. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. The empires of steppe nomads united trade links across Eurasia."
