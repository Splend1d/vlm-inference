Genetic modification can be used to create crops that are more resistant to pests, diseases, and extreme weather conditions, which can help increase yields and reduce food waste. Additionally, GM foods can be engineered to have higher nutritional value, which can help address malnutrition in certain populations. However, it is important to note that the safety and efficacy of GM foods should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis and that there are also concerns about the potential environmental impacts of GM crops. Option A is not supported by scientific evidence, option C is not necessarily true as the cost of GM foods can vary depending on various factors, and option D is not accurate as GM crops can be designed to adapt to changing environmental conditions."
