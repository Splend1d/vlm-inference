The detective, who questioned the defendant at the station house after his arrest, testified that the defendant initially declared his innocence. The detective further testified that when given the opportunity to take a lie detector test, the defendant refused. The defendant's attorney did not object to the detective's testimony. The defendant was convicted and sentenced to prison. The defendant, who is now represented by a new attorney, appeals, claiming that it was error to admit the detective's testimony. The appellate court should find\n\nA. plain error, because the trial court should have acted on its own motion to order reference to the lie detector test stricken.\nB. plain error, because admission of the detective's testimony violated the defendant's privilege against self-incrimination.\nC. harmless error, because the defendant's trial attorney failed to preserve the argument by timely objection.\nD. harmless error, because the defendant's statements were admissions.\n"

It can also be seen as an infringement on the defendant's Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination. Since the defendant's trial attorney did not object to this testimony, the appellate court may still consider it an error if it affected the defendant's substantial rights, even though no objection was made at trial. This type of error is referred to as \"plain error.\" However, the specific rule on whether this constitutes plain error would depend on the jurisdiction's rules of evidence and case law."
