Fibre sources, such as hemicelluloses, pectins and inulin are rapidly fermented to short chain fatty acids, which have trophic effects on the colon.\n\nThis statement correctly identifies that certain types of dietary fiber can be fermented by gut bacteria into short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), which have beneficial effects on the colon, including providing energy for colon cells and supporting overall gut health.\n\nStatement A is incorrect because the primary end products of fiber fermentation are acetic, propionic, and butyric acids, not malic and succinic acids.\nStatement B is partially correct but may not be entirely accurate, as the rate of fermentation can vary between different types of fiber and different individuals.\nStatement D is also correct, but it is not the most comprehensive or informative statement among the options provided. Insoluble fibers like cellulose do indeed contribute to stool bulk, but this statement does not address the broader benefits of fiber fermentation."
