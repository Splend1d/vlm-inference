Achievement tests are typically used to assess educational progress and mastery of material covered in a course or curriculum. Aptitude tests predict potential for future learning, projective tests are used to uncover hidden emotions and conflicts through ambiguous stimuli, and intelligence tests measure cognitive abilities such as reasoning, problem-solving, and abstract thinking."
