This is because the afferent (incoming) limb of the reflex is carried in the optic nerve (CN II), and the efferent (outgoing) limb is carried in the oculomotor nerve (CN III). However, options A and D are incorrect because they confuse the roles of the optic nerve and the oculomotor nerve in this reflex. Option B is also incorrect because the pupillary light reflex is mediated by the pretectal nucleus in the midbrain, not the inferior colliculi."
