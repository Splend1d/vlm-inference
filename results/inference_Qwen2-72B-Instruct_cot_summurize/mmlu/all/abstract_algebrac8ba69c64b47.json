However, let's interpret this as a typo or misprint and assume what was intended is to compare dimensions without considering the second inequality. The statement then becomes about comparing \\(\\dim(V)\\) with \\(\\dim(W)\\).\n\nIf \\(\\dim(V) < \\dim(W)\\), it does not automatically imply that \\(T\\) is injective. Injectivity of \\(T\\) means that for every \\(v_1, v_2 \\in V\\) where \\(v_1 \\neq v_2\\), we have \\(T(v_1) \\neq T(v_2)\\). This is not guaranteed just because \\(V\\) has fewer dimensions than \\(W\\). For instance, if \\(T\\) maps all vectors in \\(V\\) to the zero vector in \\(W\\), then \\(T\\) is not injective even though \\(\\dim(V) < \\dim(W)\\).\n\n### Statement 2\n\n\"Let \\(\\dim(V) = n\\) and suppose that \\(T: V \\rightarrow V\\) is linear. If \\(T\\) is injective, then it is a bijection.\"\n\nA linear transformation \\(T: V \\rightarrow V\\) being injective means that each element in \\(V\\) maps to a unique element in \\(V\\). For \\(T\\) to be a bijection, it must also be surjective, meaning every element in \\(V\\) is the image of some element in \\(V\\) under \\(T\\). \n\nIn finite-dimensional vector spaces, if a linear transformation is injective, it is also surjective (and vice versa) when the domain and codomain have the same dimension. This follows from the Rank-Nullity Theorem, which states that for a linear transformation \\(T: V \\rightarrow W\\) between finite-dimensional vector spaces,\n\\[\n\\dim(V) = \\dim(\\ker(T)) + \\dim(\\text{im}(T)).\n\\]\n\nIf \\(T\\) is injective, then \\(\\ker(T) = \\{0\\}\\), so \\(\\dim(\\ker(T)) = 0\\). Thus, \n\\[\n\\dim(V) = 0 + \\dim(\\text{im}(T)),\n\\]\nwhich implies that \\(\\dim(\\text{im}(T)) = \\dim(V)\\). Since \\(\\dim(\\text{im}(T))\\) is the dimension of the range of \\(T\\), which is a subspace of \\(V\\), and since this dimension equals \\(\\dim(V)\\), it follows that the range of \\(T\\) is \\(V\\) itself. Therefore, \\(T\\) is surjective.\n\nThus, Statement 2 is true.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGiven the analysis, the correct answer is **D. False, True**."
