Avoiding the mother upon return.\n\nThis behavior could indicate an insecure or disorganized attachment style, which can be a cause for concern as it may suggest problems in the child's relationship with their caregiver. Typically, in a secure attachment, a child might show distress when the mother leaves but will seek comfort from her upon her return. Avoidance could suggest that the child does not feel safe or comforted by the mother, which is something a psychologist would want to investigate further."
