He enfolds the whole universe and in silence is loving to all. This is the Spirit that is in my heart, this is Brahman. To him I shall come when I go beyond this life, and to him will come he who has faith and doubts not.\n\u2014The Upanishads, India, c. 1000 BCE\nBased on the quotation, what is true of Brahman?\n\nA. He is found everywhere and contained in everything.\nB. He resides in a form of paradise, like Heaven.\nC. He is found only inside the hearts of the faithful.\nD. He is a vengeful God, punishing those who sin.\n"

There is no mention of Brahman residing in a form of paradise or being a vengeful God."
