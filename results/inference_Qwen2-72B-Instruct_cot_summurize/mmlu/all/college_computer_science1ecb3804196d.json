Finding a shortest cycle in G\n\nThis can be solved using breadth-first search (BFS) or other similar algorithms, which run in polynomial time.\n\nHere's a brief explanation of why the other problems are not known to be solvable in polynomial time:\n\nA. Finding a longest simple cycle in G: This is equivalent to finding a Hamiltonian cycle, which is an NP-complete problem and not known to have a polynomial-time algorithm.\n\nC. Finding ALL spanning trees of G: While finding a single spanning tree can be done in polynomial time (e.g., using Kruskal's or Prim's algorithm), listing all possible spanning trees of a graph is not a polynomial-time task, as the number of spanning trees can be exponential in the size of the graph.\n\nD. Finding a largest clique in G: This is the maximum clique problem, which is also an NP-complete problem and not known to have a polynomial-time algorithm."
