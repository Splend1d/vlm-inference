In order to do this, the atom must have an available space in its valence shell for six electrons beyond those already present as valence electrons.\n\nLet's consider each of the options:\n\nA. Carbon has 4 valence electrons and can form up to 4 covalent bonds. It does not have enough valence electrons to form six bonds.\n\nB. Nitrogen has 5 valence electrons and typically forms three bonds, sometimes four (as in some nitrogen compounds like NH4+). It cannot form six bonds due to its electron configuration.\n\nC. Neon is a noble gas with a full valence shell (8 valence electrons), making it extremely unlikely to form any covalent bonds under normal conditions, let alone six.\n\nD. Sulfur has 6 valence electrons and can expand its octet to accommodate more than eight electrons in its valence shell under certain circumstances, allowing it to form six covalent bonds.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Sulfur.\n\nSulfur hexafluoride (SF6) is a real compound that illustrates this possibility."
