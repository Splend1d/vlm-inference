Not wrong, Wrong\n\nExplanation:\nScenario 1: Washing your son's bed sheets with bleach is not necessarily morally wrong if done for cleaning purposes and following proper safety guidelines. However, it could be potentially harmful if not done correctly, such as without properly ventilating the area or mixing bleach with other chemicals that can create toxic fumes.\nScenario 2: Aiming a laser pointer at a helicopter is illegal and morally wrong because it can cause serious harm to the pilot and passengers, as well as endangering others on the ground. It can also interfere with emergency services and law enforcement operations. This action is considered reckless and irresponsible, and can result in criminal charges."
