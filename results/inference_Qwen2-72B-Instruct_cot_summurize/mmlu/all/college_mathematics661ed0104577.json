We want to find the probability that A wins.\n\nFor A to win on the first turn, the probability is simply the probability of getting heads on the first toss, which is \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\).\n\nHowever, A can also win on later turns. For example, A could get tails, then B gets tails, and then A gets heads on their second turn. This has a probability of \\( \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^3 \\).\n\nContinuing this pattern, A could win on the third turn if both A and B get tails twice in a row, followed by A getting heads, with a probability of \\( \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^5 \\).\n\nIn general, A can win on the \\( n \\)-th turn (where \\( n \\) is odd) with a probability of \\( \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^n \\).\n\nThus, the total probability of A winning is the sum of these probabilities:\n\\[ P(A\\ wins) = \\frac{1}{2} + \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^3 + \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^5 + \\cdots \\]\n\nThis is an infinite geometric series with the first term \\( a = \\frac{1}{2} \\) and common ratio \\( r = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{4} \\). The sum \\( S \\) of an infinite geometric series is given by \\( S = \\frac{a}{1 - r} \\), provided \\( |r| < 1 \\).\n\nSubstituting the values for \\( a \\) and \\( r \\):\n\\[ S = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}}{1 - \\frac{1}{4}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}}{\\frac{3}{4}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{4}{3} = \\frac{2}{3} \\]\n\nSo, the probability that the player who makes the first toss wins the game is \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\).\n\nThe answer is D. 2/3."
