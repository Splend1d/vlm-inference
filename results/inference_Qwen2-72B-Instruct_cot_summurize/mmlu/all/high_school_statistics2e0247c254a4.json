The airport authorities decide to increase the rent charged for a kiosk by 5 percent. To make up for the increased rent, the kiosk owner decides to increase the prices of all items by 50 cents. As a result, which of the following will happen?\n\nA. The mean price and the range of prices will increase by 50 cents.\nB. The mean price will remain the same, but the range of prices will increase by 50 cents.\nC. The mean price and the standard deviation of prices will increase by 50 cents.\nD.

The mean price will indeed increase by 50 cents because the price of every item is increased by that amount. However, the range (the difference between the highest and lowest values) will not change because both the lowest and highest prices are increased by the same amount.\n\nB. This option is incorrect because the mean price will also increase by 50 cents as mentioned in A.\n\nC. The mean price will increase by 50 cents, but the standard deviation, which measures the dispersion or spread of data points from the mean, will not be affected by this uniform increase. The reason is that each price point is moved up by the same amount, so their relative dispersion remains unchanged.\n\nD. This is the correct answer. The mean price increases by 50 cents due to the price hike on all items. The standard deviation, which is a measure of how spread out the numbers are, remains the same since the distance between each price point does not change.\n\nSo, the correct choice is D. The mean price will increase by 50 cents, but the standard deviation of prices will remain the same."
