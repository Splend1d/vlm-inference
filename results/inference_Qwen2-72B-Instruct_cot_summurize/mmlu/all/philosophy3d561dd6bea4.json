                    "text": "G. E. Moore, a prominent British philosopher, is well known for his work in ethics and philosophy of language, particularly his \"Principia Ethica\" where he introduced the idea of \"good\" as a simple, indefinable quality. According to Moore's ethical philosophy, \"good\" cannot be defined because it is a simple, non-natural property that we intuitively recognize but cannot break down into more basic components without committing what he called the \"naturalistic fallacy.\" This fallacy occurs when one tries to define \"good\" in terms of natural properties like pleasure or desire.\n\nRegarding \"yellow\" and \"horse,\" these are concepts that can be defined because they are not considered simple qualities in the same sense that \"good\" is in Moore's ethical philosophy. \"Yellow\" can be defined by its wavelength on the visible spectrum, and \"horse\" can be defined by biological characteristics and taxonomic classification.\n\nSo, based on Moore's philosophical stance, only option A (\"good\") cannot be defined, while options B (\"yellow\") and C (\"horse\") can be defined. However, since the question asks which concept(s) can be defined according to Moore, the correct answer would be:\n\nD. all of the above\n\nBut with the clarification that Moore would argue that \"good\" cannot be defined, while \"yellow\" and \"horse\" can be defined. The question seems to assume a perspective that contradicts Moore's views on \"good,\" so the answer provided here includes an explanation to resolve this discrepancy."
