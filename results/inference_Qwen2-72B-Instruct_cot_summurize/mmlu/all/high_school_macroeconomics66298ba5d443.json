This is often accompanied by a rightward shift in the long-run aggregate supply curve, reflecting an increase in potential output due to factors such as technological advancement, increases in labor productivity, capital accumulation, or improvements in resource allocation. Economic growth does not necessarily lead to an increase in the natural rate of unemployment; in fact, it can sometimes reduce it by creating more job opportunities."
