                    "text": "According to attachment theory, the quality and consistency of early relationships with caregivers significantly influence how infants form attachments. Children tend to form primary attachments with those who provide consistent care and meet their needs. In a situation where a child is neglected, they may be more likely to seek out and form an attachment with someone new who provides them with attention and care.\n\nGiven the options:\n\nA. A two-month-old female infant raised in a safe, stable environment is unlikely to form an attachment to a new person because at this age, infants do not typically discriminate between familiar and unfamiliar people.\n\nB. A five-month-old male infant raised in a safe, stable environment may begin to show preference for familiar caregivers but is still in the process of developing specific attachments.\n\nC. An eight-month-old male infant raised by a single caregiver who frequently neglects the child may be more likely to form an attachment to a new caregiver (in this case, the male psychologist) if that person provides consistent care and attention, as the child has not formed a strong attachment to the neglectful caregiver.\n\nD. A thirteen-month-old female infant raised by two caregivers who occasionally neglect the child may have formed some attachment to her caregivers but could also potentially form an attachment to a new person if that person meets her needs and provides care consistently.\n\nOf these options, **C** seems the most likely to form an attachment to the male psychologist, given the circumstances described. However, it's important to note that individual differences and specific experiences can greatly impact attachment formation, so this is a generalization based on attachment theory principles."
