In this case, the severely disturbed patients who showed considerable improvement might have improved simply because their condition was so extreme initially, not necessarily due to the effectiveness of the treatment itself. Therefore, concluding that the treatment is effective based solely on observing improvement in the most severely disturbed patients without considering regression toward the mean could lead to an incorrect inference about the treatment's efficacy."
