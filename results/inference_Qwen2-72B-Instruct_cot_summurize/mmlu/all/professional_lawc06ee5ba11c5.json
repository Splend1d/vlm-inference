False pretenses.\n\nFalse pretenses is the crime of intentionally deceiving another person by making a false statement or representation in order to obtain property or money from that person. In this case, the defendant intentionally deceived the partygoer into believing that he was purchasing marijuana when, in fact, the defendant knew that the bag contained only oregano. The defendant obtained $200 from the partygoer through this deception, satisfying the elements of the crime of false pretenses.\n\nThe defendant cannot be charged with solicitation or attempted sale of narcotics because no actual narcotics were involved in the transaction. Solicitation involves urging or requesting someone else to commit a crime, while an attempt requires taking a substantial step toward the commission of a crime with the intent to complete it. Since the substance sold was not actually marijuana, there was no genuine attempt to sell narcotics, and therefore no solicitation or attempt to commit such a crime occurred."
