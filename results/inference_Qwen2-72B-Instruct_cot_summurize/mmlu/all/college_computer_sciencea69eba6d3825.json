A hash function has been applied to each word in the dictionary, and the appropriate entry in the hash table has been set to true. To check the spelling in a document, the hash function is applied to every word in the document, and the appropriate entry in the hash table is examined.

I and II only\n\nExplanation: In this scenario, when the hash function is applied to a word from the document and the corresponding entry in the hash table is true, it indicates that the word was found in the dictionary during the initial population of the hash table (I is correct). Conversely, if the entry is false, it could mean one of two things: either the word is not in the dictionary, or there was a collision during the hash function application that was not resolved (II can be considered correct in the context of this simplified scenario, although in practice, a false negative could also occur due to collisions).\n\nRegarding statement III, the size of the hash table does not necessarily need to increase with the document size. The hash table's size is typically determined by the number of unique words expected in the dictionary, not by the number of words in any particular document. A larger document might have more unique words, but if those words are already in the dictionary, the size of the hash table would not change. Therefore, statement III is incorrect."
