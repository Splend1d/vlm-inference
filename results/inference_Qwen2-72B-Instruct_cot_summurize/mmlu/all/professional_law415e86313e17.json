The United States sued a state in federal court for injunctive relief, arguing that the state's child welfare programs, which were funded in part by federal funds disbursed under this statute, failed to comply with federal standards. The state has moved to dismiss the action. Is the court likely to dismiss the action?\n\nA. No, because Congress can place any condition on the receipt of federal funds.\nB. No, because the Eleventh Amendment does not bar actions brought by the United States.\nC. Yes, because the Eleventh Amendment bars actions against a state in federal court.\nD. Yes, because the protection of child welfare is reserved to the states.\n"

No, because the Eleventh Amendment does not bar actions brought by the United States.\n\nThe Eleventh Amendment generally bars suits against a state by citizens of another state or by citizens of a foreign country. However, it does not prevent the United States government from suing a state. Therefore, the court is unlikely to dismiss the action based on the Eleventh Amendment. Additionally, Congress has the authority to place conditions on the receipt of federal funds, and if the state accepted those funds, it agreed to comply with the associated federal standards."
