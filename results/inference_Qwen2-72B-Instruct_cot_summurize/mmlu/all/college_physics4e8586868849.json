                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum radius at which the coin can stay on the turntable without sliding off due to the force of friction. We'll start by converting the rotation speed from revolutions per minute (rpm) to radians per second (\\(\\omega\\)) because it's easier to work with in physics equations.\n\nGiven:\n- Coefficient of static friction \\(\\mu_s = 0.30\\)\n- Rotation speed \\(= 33.3\\) rpm\n\nFirst, convert \\(33.3\\) rpm to radians per second:\n\n\\[33.3 \\text{ rpm} = 33.3 \\times \\frac{2\\pi}{60} \\text{ rad/s}\\]\n\n\\[= \\frac{33.3 \\times 2\\pi}{60} \\approx 3.49 \\text{ rad/s}\\]\n\nThe centripetal acceleration \\(a_c\\) is given by \\(a_c = \\omega^2 r\\), where \\(r\\) is the radius of the circular path. The force of static friction that keeps the coin stationary on the turntable is given by \\(F_f = \\mu_s mg\\), where \\(m\\) is the mass of the coin, and \\(g\\) is the gravitational acceleration (\\(9.81 \\text{ m/s}^2\\)). This force must equal the centripetal force, so we have:\n\n\\[\\mu_s mg = m\\omega^2 r\\]\n\nSolving for \\(r\\):\n\n\\[r = \\frac{\\mu_s g}{\\omega^2}\\]\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\n\\[r = \\frac{0.30 \\times 9.81}{(3.49)^2}\\]\n\n\\[r \\approx \\frac{2.943}{12.1801}\\]\n\n\\[r \\approx 0.242 \\text{ m}\\]\n\nThus, the maximum distance from the center of the turntable at which the coin will not slide is approximately \\(0.242\\) m, which corresponds to option D."
