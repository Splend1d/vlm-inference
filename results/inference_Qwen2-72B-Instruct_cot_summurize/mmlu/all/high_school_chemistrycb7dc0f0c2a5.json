                    "text": "The Gibbs free energy change (\\(\\Delta G\\)) of a reaction determines its spontaneity. A reaction is spontaneous when \\(\\Delta G < 0\\), nonspontaneous when \\(\\Delta G > 0\\), and at equilibrium when \\(\\Delta G = 0\\). The relationship between \\(\\Delta G\\), enthalpy change (\\(\\Delta H\\)), entropy change (\\(\\Delta S\\)), and temperature (T) is given by the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta G = \\Delta H - T\\Delta S\n\\]\n\nGiven that the reaction is nonspontaneous under standard conditions (298 K), we have \\(\\Delta G > 0\\) at this temperature. It's also stated that the reaction becomes spontaneous at higher temperatures, meaning that increasing \\(T\\) will result in \\(\\Delta G < 0\\).\n\nFor an increase in temperature to make the reaction spontaneous from being nonspontaneous, the term \\(T\\Delta S\\) must significantly contribute to making \\(\\Delta G\\) negative. This suggests that \\(\\Delta S > 0\\) (positive entropy change), as increasing \\(T\\) would further increase the magnitude of \\(T\\Delta S\\), helping to overcome the positive \\(\\Delta H\\) (endothermic reaction) and making \\(\\Delta G\\) negative.\n\nThus, for the reaction to become spontaneous at higher temperatures after being nonspontaneous under standard conditions, it must have a positive enthalpy change (\\(\\Delta H > 0\\)) and a positive entropy change (\\(\\Delta S > 0\\)). Therefore, under standard conditions where the reaction is nonspontaneous, we can conclude:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta H > 0, \\Delta S > 0, \\text{and } \\Delta G > 0\n\\]\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nD. \u0394H > 0, \u0394S > 0 and \u0394G > 0"
