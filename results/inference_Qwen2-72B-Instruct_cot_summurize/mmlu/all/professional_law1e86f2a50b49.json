This is an exception to the general rule that prohibits leading questions during direct examination. Additionally, a party may also introduce evidence to impeach the credibility of an adverse witness. Therefore, in this scenario where the plaintiff calls the managing agent of the defendant corporation, who is considered an adverse witness, the plaintiff is entitled to ask leading questions and to impeach the witness if necessary."
