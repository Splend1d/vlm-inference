Therefore, the correct answer would be:\n\nB. deliberative justification.\n\nGauthier argues that practical rationality is about what one has reason to do in light of one's desires and beliefs. This involves a process of deliberation where one weighs the various options available and selects the course of action that best satisfies one's preferences given one's beliefs about the world. In this sense, practical rationality is not just about moral justification or epistemic justification, but rather about making decisions that are justified by one's own desires and beliefs through a process of deliberation."
