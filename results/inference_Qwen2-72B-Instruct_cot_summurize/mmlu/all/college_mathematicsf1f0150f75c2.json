We need to find two points where \\(f(x)\\) changes sign, indicating that it must cross the x-axis (and thus have a root) between those points.\n\nLet's evaluate \\(f(x)\\) at some values:\n\n1. At \\(x = 0\\), \\(f(0) = -7\\).\n2. As \\(x\\) approaches \\(\\infty\\), \\(f(x)\\) also approaches \\(\\infty\\) because the leading term \\(2x^5\\) dominates.\n3. As \\(x\\) approaches \\(-\\infty\\), \\(f(x)\\) approaches \\(-\\infty\\).\n\nSince \\(f(0) < 0\\) and \\(f(x)\\) goes to \\(\\infty\\) as \\(x\\) goes to \\(\\infty\\), by the Intermediate Value Theorem, there exists at least one value of \\(x > 0\\) where \\(f(x) = 0\\). This confirms that there is at least one positive real root.\n\nGiven that there are no negative real roots, and knowing that there's at least one positive real root, and considering that the degree of the polynomial is odd (5), which means it must have at least one real root, we can conclude that this polynomial has exactly one real root.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nB.
