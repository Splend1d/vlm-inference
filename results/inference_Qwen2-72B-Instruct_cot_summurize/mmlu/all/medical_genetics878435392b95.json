The specific type of mutation can vary, but common mechanisms include deletions and point mutations. Therefore, both options A (a deletion) and D (a point mutation) could be correct depending on the specific mutation causing the \u03b4\u03b2-thalassaemia in question.\n\nHowever, since the question asks for a single answer, it's important to note that deletions are more commonly associated with this type of thalassaemia, particularly large deletions that affect multiple genes including the delta and beta globin genes. Point mutations can also cause \u03b4\u03b2-thalassaemia, often resulting in altered or reduced function of the affected genes.\n\nGiven the options provided and the prevalence of deletion mutations in \u03b4\u03b2-thalassaemia, the most accurate answer would be:\n\nA. a deletion."
