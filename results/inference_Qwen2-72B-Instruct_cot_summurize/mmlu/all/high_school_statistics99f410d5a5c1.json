This is a statement about the reliability of the method used to estimate the population proportion based on the sample data.\n\nOptions A and B are incorrect because they misunderstand the meaning of confidence intervals and confidence levels. Option C is related but not entirely accurate; it should refer to the sample proportion falling within the interval around the true population proportion, not around the observed sample proportion."
