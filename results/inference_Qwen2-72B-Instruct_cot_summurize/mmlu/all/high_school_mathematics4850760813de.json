The general form of a line is given by $Ax + By + C = 0$, where $A$ and $B$ determine the slope of the line.\n\nFor the first equation:\n\\[x + 2y + 3 = 0\\]\n\nWe can rewrite it in slope-intercept form ($y = mx + b$) to find its slope. To do this, solve for $y$:\n\n\\[2y = -x - 3\\]\n\\[y = -\\frac{1}{2}x - \\frac{3}{2}\\]\n\nThus, the slope of the first line is $-\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nFor the second equation:\n\\[ax + 2y + 3 = 0\\]\n\nAgain, solving for $y$ gives us:\n\\[2y = -ax - 3\\]\n\\[y = -\\frac{a}{2}x - \\frac{3}{2}\\]\n\nSo, the slope of the second line is $-\\frac{a}{2}$.\n\nSince the two lines are perpendicular, the product of their slopes should be -1. Therefore,\n\n\\[-\\frac{1}{2} * -\\frac{a}{2} = -1\\]\n\nSolving for $a$:\n\n\\[\\frac{a}{4} = -1\\]\n\\[a = -4\\]\n\nTherefore, the value of $a$ is $\\boxed{-4}$, which corresponds to option A."
