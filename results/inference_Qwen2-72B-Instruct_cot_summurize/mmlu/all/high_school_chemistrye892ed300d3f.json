Since there are four oxygen atoms in ClO4-, their total contribution to the oxidation state is -8.\n\nThe overall charge of the perchlorate ion is -1. This means that the sum of the oxidation numbers of all the atoms in the ion must equal -1.\n\nLet x represent the oxidation number of chlorine (Cl). The equation for the oxidation states can be written as:\n\nx + 4(-2) = -1\n\nSolving for x:\n\nx - 8 = -1\nx = 7\n\nTherefore, the oxidation number of chlorine in the perchlorate ion is +7.\n\nThe correct answer is D. 7."
