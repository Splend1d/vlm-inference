However, oxygen is crucial for the final stage of cellular respiration, which occurs after some of these processes. Specifically, oxygen acts as the final electron acceptor in the electron transport chain, which is part of the process that generates ATP from the products of glycolysis, the Krebs' cycle, and fatty acid oxidation. Without oxygen, this process would halt, and the cell would have to rely on anaerobic pathways for energy production."
