Moore's ethical philosophy, specifically his argument against \"naturalistic fallacy\" in \"Principia Ethica,\" he would likely argue that \"pleasure is good\" does not mean the same thing as any of the options provided. Moore was an advocate for ethical non-naturalism and believed that \"good\" is a simple, indefinable quality that cannot be reduced to natural properties like \"desirable\" or \"pleasant.\"\n\nHowever, among the given options, the closest in meaning to \"pleasure is good\" might be B. \"pleasure is pleasant.\" This is because if something is pleasant, it might be considered good in some contexts. But according to Moore, this still wouldn't capture the full meaning of \"good,\" which he saw as a sui generis (unique) property that cannot be equated with any descriptive terms.\n\nSo, the answer would be D. None of the above, as Moore would argue that \"pleasure is good\" has a distinct meaning that cannot be captured by describing pleasure as something desired, pleasant, or an object of desire for desire."
