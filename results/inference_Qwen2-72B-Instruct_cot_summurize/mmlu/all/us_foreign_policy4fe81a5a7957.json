In the domestic system, there is a central authority (such as a government) that enforces rules and resolves conflicts, whereas in the international system, there is no overarching authority to enforce cooperation or prevent conflict among states. This absence of a higher authority creates a self-help environment where states must rely on their own resources for security, leading to a competitive and often conflict-prone international system."
