A hooded sweatshirt and bandana concealed the rest of his face. A few days later, while the victim waited to be interviewed, she observed the defendant being escorted through the courthouse, in jail clothing, and restrained by handcuffs and leg irons. She identified him as the perpetrator shortly thereafter. Will the court allow that identification into evidence?\n\nA. No, because it is not reliable enough and there was too much suggestion to make a reasonably accurate identification.\nB. No, because prior statements of identification are considered hearsay and never allowed into evidence.\nC. Yes, if the witness perceived the perpetrator by seeing his eyes, and made the identification on that basis it was reliable enough to be admitted.\nD. Yes, because the witness' recognition of someone is all that is needed; the reliability or credibility of it is subject to cross examination.\n"

No, because it is not reliable enough and there was too much suggestion to make a reasonably accurate identification.\n\nCourts have established standards for the admissibility of eyewitness identifications based on factors such as the opportunity of the witness to view the criminal at the time of the crime, the witness's degree of attention, the accuracy of the witness's prior description of the criminal, the level of certainty demonstrated by the witness at the confrontation, and the time between the crime and the confrontation. In this case, the witness only saw the perpetrator's eyes, which is a very limited amount of information to base an identification on. Additionally, the fact that the witness saw the defendant in jail clothing and restraints before making the identification could have been highly suggestive and influenced her memory.\n\nFurthermore, courts also consider whether the police used unnecessarily suggestive procedures that could lead to misidentification. The fact that the witness saw the defendant in custody and in restraints before making the identification could be seen as an unnecessarily suggestive procedure that could have influenced the witness's memory and led to a misidentification.\n\nTherefore, the court would likely exclude the identification from evidence as unreliable due to the suggestiveness of the circumstances under which it was made."
