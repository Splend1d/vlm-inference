When done correctly, a stratified random sample is less biased than a simple random sample.\n\nThis statement is not necessarily true because both simple random sampling and stratified random sampling can be unbiased if conducted properly. The primary purpose of stratification is to reduce sampling error by ensuring that key subgroups of the population are represented proportionally in the sample, which can lead to less variability and more precise estimates (options B and C). However, this does not inherently mean that it reduces bias compared to simple random sampling; rather, it aims to improve precision and efficiency. Bias can still occur in stratified random sampling if the strata are not defined appropriately or if there is non-response bias within strata."
