The Inca Empire was vast and complex, but it had been built through conquest and coercion, and many of the subject peoples were resentful of Inca rule. When Pizarro arrived in the region, he was able to exploit this discontent and forge alliances with some of these groups, who saw him as a potential liberator from Inca domination. This allowed him to build a coalition that was able to defeat the Inca army despite being vastly outnumbered. While Pizarro's use of horses and guns did give him a technological advantage over the Incas, it was his ability to take advantage of existing divisions within the empire that ultimately allowed him to conquer it. Answer D is incorrect because Pizarro actually arrived with only about 168 men, not 80,000 soldiers. Answer B may have some truth to it, but it does not fully explain why Pizarro was able to conquer such a large and powerful empire."
