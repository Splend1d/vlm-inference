He argues that if we can prevent something bad without sacrificing anything of comparable moral importance, we ought to do it. This perspective blurs the line between what we consider our moral duties (obligations we have to act in certain ways) and acts of charity (voluntary actions beyond what is considered obligatory). According to Singer, helping others should not merely be seen as an act of charity but as a moral duty."
