The total number of possible outcomes when having five children, where each child can be either a boy or a girl, is \\(2^5 = 32\\).\n\nNow, we need to find the number of ways to have exactly 3, 4, or 5 girls.\n\n- For exactly 3 girls: This can happen in \\(\\binom{5}{3}\\) ways, which equals \\(10\\) (since there are 5 slots and we need to choose 3 of them for girls).\n- For exactly 4 girls: This can happen in \\(\\binom{5}{4}\\) ways, which equals \\(5\\) (since there are 5 slots and we need to choose 4 of them for girls).\n- For exactly 5 girls: This can happen in \\(\\binom{5}{5}\\) ways, which equals \\(1\\) (since all 5 slots are chosen for girls).\n\nAdding these up, we get \\(10 + 5 + 1 = 16\\) ways to have at least three girls.\n\nThe probability of having at least three girls is therefore \\(\\frac{16}{32} = \\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\nThus, the correct answer is A. \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)."
