Examination of the tongue reveals wasting and fasciculation. Decreased deep tendon reflexes and fasciculation are noted in the left lower extremity. The deep tendon reflexes of the left upper extremity are hyperactive. The most likely diagnosis is\n\nA. amyotrophic lateral sclerosis\nB. Friedreich ataxia\nC.

This neurodegenerative disorder affects nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord, leading to muscle weakness, difficulty swallowing, slurred speech, tongue wasting and fasciculations, and both decreased and increased reflexes in different parts of the body.\n\nFriedreich ataxia typically presents with gait problems, speech difficulties, and cardiac issues but not usually with asymmetric reflex changes or bulbar symptoms like difficulty swallowing saliva.\n\nPick disease is a type of frontotemporal dementia that primarily affects behavior, language, and personality rather than motor function.\n\nProgressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) usually presents with cognitive decline, vision problems, and motor or sensory deficits but does not typically manifest with the specific combination of symptoms described in this case."
