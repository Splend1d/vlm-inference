Hart's concept of law, the internal point of view is crucial for understanding how social rules gain acceptance and become part of a legal system. It refers to the perspective of those who follow the rules because they recognize them as valid, not merely out of habit or fear of sanctions. This recognition is what transforms mere group habits into rules that have a normative character, which is essential for a rule-based legal system."
