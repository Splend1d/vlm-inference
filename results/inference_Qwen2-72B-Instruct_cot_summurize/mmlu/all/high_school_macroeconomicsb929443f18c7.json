Net exports fall and there is no change in GDP.\n\nWhen an American buys an entertainment system manufactured in China, it counts as an import for the U.S., which decreases net exports (since net exports = exports - imports). However, since the purchase contributes to the consumption component of GDP within the U.S., it does not decrease overall GDP. Instead, it shifts the composition of GDP away from domestic production towards foreign production, but the total GDP remains unchanged because the transaction is recorded as both a debit (import) and a credit (expenditure) in the national accounts."
