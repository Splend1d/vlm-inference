It also innervates the lacrimal glands, the nasal mucosa, and the submandibular and sublingual salivary glands. However, among the options given, the parotid salivary gland is correctly supplied by the seventh cranial nerve via the greater auricular nerve and the auriculotemporal nerve. \n\nOptions A, B, and C are incorrect for the following reasons:\nA. Taste buds on the posterior third of the tongue are innervated by the glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX).\nB. Muscles of the soft palate are innervated by the pharyngeal plexus which includes branches from the vagus nerve (CN X) and the accessory nerve (CN XI).\nC. Muscles of the lower lip are innervated by the mandibular branch of the trigeminal nerve (CN V3)."
