Adams in 1963, suggests that people evaluate their relationships based on a perceived balance between inputs (contributions) and outputs (rewards). In the context of close personal relationships, equity theory would predict that an individual's satisfaction is related to:\n\nA. perceptions of his/her own contribution/reward ratio and the ratio of his/her partner.\n\nThis means that individuals assess their level of satisfaction based on whether they feel they are receiving rewards commensurate with their contributions in comparison to what their partner contributes and receives. If one perceives an imbalance, this can lead to feelings of dissatisfaction and may result in efforts to restore equity or potentially disengage from the relationship."
