The doubly labeled water technique does indeed use a sophisticated analytical technique, which can make it expensive and difficult to implement in large-scale studies.\nB. The doubly labeled water technique provides a marker for total energy expenditure, but it does not provide information on the specific types or quantities of food consumed, which limits its ability to identify under-reporting of specific low energy content foods.\nC. Mis-reporting of low energy content foods would not be identified by the doubly labeled water technique because it measures total energy expenditure rather than specific food intakes. Therefore, if someone under-reports their consumption of low-energy foods, this would not necessarily affect their measured energy expenditure. However, under-reporting of high-energy foods would likely result in an underestimate of total energy intake, which could be detected by comparing the measured energy expenditure with reported energy intake. \n\nOverall, while the doubly labeled water technique is a useful tool for measuring energy expenditure and detecting under-reporting of total energy intake, it has limitations when it comes to identifying under-reporting of specific types of foods."
