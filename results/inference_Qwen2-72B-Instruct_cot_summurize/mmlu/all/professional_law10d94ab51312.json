This could include showing that the witness cannot be located, is physically unable to attend due to illness or disability, or is otherwise genuinely unable to testify despite diligent efforts to make them available. Simply not being present in court (option A) or being insane (option D) without further evidence of efforts to secure their testimony would not typically suffice. Similarly, proving death (option B) while conclusive, is not the only way to establish unavailability."
