                    "text": "The strength of binary acids can be predicted based on the electronegativity of the central atom and the bond strength between the hydrogen and the central atom. Generally, the stronger the H-X bond (where X is the central atom), the weaker the acid because it's harder for the hydrogen ion to dissociate. However, when comparing elements in the same group, as we have here with oxygen, sulfur, and selenium, the trend reverses due to the increasing atomic radius.\n\nAs you move down a group in the periodic table, the atomic radius increases, which leads to a longer and weaker H-X bond. This makes it easier for the hydrogen ion to dissociate, resulting in a stronger acid. Therefore, the order of the acids from strongest to weakest should reflect the decreasing electronegativity and increasing atomic radius of the central atoms.\n\nGiven that:\n- Oxygen is more electronegative than sulfur, which is more electronegative than selenium.\n- Selenium has a larger atomic radius than sulfur, which has a larger atomic radius than oxygen.\n\nThe correct order from strongest to weakest acid is:\n\nH2Se (weakest H-X bond due to largest atomic radius) > H2S (weaker H-X bond due to larger atomic radius compared to oxygen) > H2O (strongest H-X bond due to smallest atomic radius).\n\nThus, the correct answer is **D. H2Se > H2S > H2O**."
