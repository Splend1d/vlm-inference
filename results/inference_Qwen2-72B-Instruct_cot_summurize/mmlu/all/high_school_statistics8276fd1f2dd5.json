                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to use the Central Limit Theorem which states that the distribution of sample means approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases, regardless of the shape of the population distribution.\n\nGiven:\n- Variance (\\(\\sigma^2\\)) = 386\n- Sample size (n) = 40\n- Sample mean (\\(\\bar{x}\\)) = 83 days\n\nFirst, we find the standard deviation (\\(\\sigma\\)) by taking the square root of the variance:\n\n\\[\n\\sigma = \\sqrt{386} \\approx 19.65\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the standard error (SE), which is the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the sample mean:\n\n\\[\nSE = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}} = \\frac{19.65}{\\sqrt{40}} \\approx 3.14\n\\]\n\nWe want to know the probability that the true population mean lies within 80 and 90 days based on our sample. This corresponds to finding the z-scores for both bounds and then calculating the area under the standard normal curve between those z-scores.\n\nFirst, calculate the z-score for each bound:\n\nFor the lower bound (80 days):\n\n\\[\nz_{lower} = \\frac{80 - \\bar{x}}{SE} = \\frac{80 - 83}{3.14} \\approx -0.96\n\\]\n\nFor the upper bound (90 days):\n\n\\[\nz_{upper} = \\frac{90 - \\bar{x}}{SE} = \\frac{90 - 83}{3.14} \\approx 2.23\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that the z-score falls between -0.96 and 2.23. We look up these values in a standard normal table or use a calculator to find the area under the curve from -0.96 to 2.23.\n\nUsing a standard normal table or calculator:\n\n\\[\nP(-0.96 < Z < 2.23) \\approx P(Z < 2.23) - P(Z < -0.96)\n\\]\n\nFrom a standard normal table or calculator, we get:\n\n\\[\nP(Z < 2.23) \\approx 0.9875\n\\]\n\\[\nP(Z < -0.96) \\approx 0.1685\n\\]\n\nTherefore,\n\n\\[\nP(-0.96 < Z < 2.23) \\approx 0.9875 - 0.1685 = 0.8190\n\\]\n\nThis means that with approximately 81.9% confidence, we can assert that the average building time for a new house is between 80 and 90 days.\n\nThe closest answer choice to 81.9% is D. 82.1%."
