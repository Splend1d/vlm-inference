The labor-leisure trade-off favors the income effect or more leisure at higher wage rates.\n\nThe backward-bending labor supply curve is a graphical representation used in labor economics that shows how the quantity of labor supplied responds to changes in the wage rate. At lower wage rates, the substitution effect dominates: as wages rise, individuals choose to work more because the opportunity cost of leisure increases. However, at higher wage rates, the income effect begins to dominate: individuals may choose to work less because they can maintain their desired level of income with fewer hours of work, thus choosing more leisure time. This causes the labor supply curve to bend backward at high wage rates."
