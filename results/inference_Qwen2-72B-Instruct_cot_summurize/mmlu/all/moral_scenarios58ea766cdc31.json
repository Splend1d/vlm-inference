Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation:\nScenario 1: Giving someone multivitamins is not considered morally wrong unless there is additional context that suggests harm or coercion, which is not present here.\nScenario 2: Letting children try to catch bear cubs could be seen as irresponsible parenting and potentially harmful to both the children and the animals, but it's not necessarily \"clearly morally wrong\" without further context. However, given the potential danger and lack of regard for animal welfare, this scenario leans more towards being morally questionable or wrong. But since the question asks for \"clearly morally wrong,\" and without explicit harm or illegal activity mentioned, it might not meet that standard. For the sake of this answer, I'm assuming no harm came to anyone or anything, making both scenarios not clearly morally wrong based on the information provided. If we were to strictly adhere to the question's criteria, Scenario 2 would likely be considered \"wrong\" due to the potential risks involved."
