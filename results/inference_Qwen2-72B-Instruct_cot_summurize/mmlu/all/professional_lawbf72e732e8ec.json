Hearsay is generally inadmissible unless it falls under one of the exceptions outlined in the rules of evidence. However, none of the exceptions seem to apply here, so the testimony would likely be excluded.\n\nA is incorrect because the unavailability of the witness does not automatically make the hearsay admissible; it must still fall under an exception.\nB is incorrect because the testimony is still hearsay, and its relevance does not automatically make it admissible.\nD is incorrect because the Dead Man's Statute typically applies to situations where a party wishes to introduce testimony about statements made by a deceased person regarding transactions or communications between them and the deceased. This situation does not involve such direct communication but rather a statement made by the deceased witness about something he observed."
