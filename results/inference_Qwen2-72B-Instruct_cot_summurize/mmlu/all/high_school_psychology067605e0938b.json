This is an example of positive punishment, where an aversive stimulus is added to decrease the likelihood of a behavior occurring in the future. Positive punishment is different from positive reinforcement, which involves adding a desirable stimulus to increase the likelihood of a behavior occurring in the future. Negative reinforcement involves removing an aversive stimulus to increase the likelihood of a behavior occurring in the future, while omission training involves withholding reinforcement for a behavior to decrease its occurrence."
