The contractor dies before the home owner accepts but the contractor's son intends to continue the business.\n\nWhen a party to a contract dies, their obligations under any existing contracts typically pass to their estate or to someone who takes over their business, such as a family member. In this case, since the contractor's son intends to continue the business, it can be argued that the offer may still be valid, especially if the son is willing to honor his father's commitments. However, this would depend on the specific laws governing contracts in the relevant jurisdiction and whether the offer was explicitly stated to be irrevocable for a certain period of time. \n\nOption A (the homeowner asking for a lower price) and Option D (the homeowner accepting with a different price) are considered counter-offers, which terminate the original offer. Option B (the contractor withdrawing the offer) also terminates the offer."
