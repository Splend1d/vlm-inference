By grouping similar subjects or conditions together, variation within treatments can be reduced, which increases the sensitivity of the experiment to detect differences between treatments. However, it's also worth noting that blocking can help in reducing confounding to some extent as well, by ensuring that known sources of variability are evenly distributed across treatment groups. But primarily, its aim is to reduce variation within treatments to make the comparison between different treatments more precise."
