H+ would increase inside the intermembrane space (the compartment between inner and outer membranes).\n\nOligomycin inhibits ATP synthase, which normally pumps protons (H+) from the matrix into the intermembrane space as part of the process of oxidative phosphorylation. When oligomycin binds to ATP synthase, it prevents the enzyme from functioning properly, blocking the flow of protons back into the matrix through the synthase complex. This results in a buildup of protons in the intermembrane space."
