This reflects their primary contribution to the research. Faculty advisors often contribute to the conceptualization of the project, provide resources, and offer guidance, but unless they have contributed significantly to the data collection, analysis, and writing of the paper, they are not usually listed as the first author. It is important to acknowledge the contributions of all parties involved, but authorship order should reflect the level of contribution to the research and writing process."
