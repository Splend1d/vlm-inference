This would shift the demand curve to the left.\n\nIf the price of seed corn and fertilizer falls, it becomes cheaper for producers to produce corn, which could lead to an increase in supply as the cost of production decreases. This would shift the supply curve to the right.\n\nThe combination of a leftward shift in the demand curve and a rightward shift in the supply curve creates an indeterminate effect on the equilibrium price because these two shifts pull the price in opposite directions. However, the equilibrium quantity is likely to rise because both shifts move in the direction of increasing quantity.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. The equilibrium price is indeterminate while the equilibrium quantity will rise."
