                    "text": "The correct answer is C. The secondarily altricial condition of modern human babies refers to their relative helplessness and immaturity at birth compared to other mammals. This is thought to be an evolutionary adaptation that allowed for the subsequent growth of the brain, as bipedalism (walking on two legs) had resulted in a narrowing of the birth canal in the female pelvis. This narrowing made it difficult for larger-brained babies to pass through during childbirth, so the trade-off was that humans evolved to give birth to relatively undeveloped infants whose brains could continue to grow outside the womb."
