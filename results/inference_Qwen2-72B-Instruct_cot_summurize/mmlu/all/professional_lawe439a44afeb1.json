During a holiday weekend, the woman and the victim arranged to go camping in a federal park. The defendant and his friend decided to beat up the victim while he and the woman were on their camping trip. They went to the campsite where the woman and the victim were staying, but they couldn't find the couple, who were hiking in the woods. Subsequently, the defendant was arrested and charged with conspiracy to commit an assault in a federal park. At trial, the defendant testified that he didn't know he was in a federal park. Moreover, he stated that if he had known, he would never have agreed to the crime. If the jury believes the defendant, he should be found\n\nA. guilty, because federal conspiracy laws do not require the mental retainment ofjurisdictional requirements.\nB. guilty, because federal conspiracy laws require only an intent to commit a prohibited act, but do not require a knowledge of the surrounding circumstances.\nC. not guilty, because he didn't have the specific intent to commit the crime of assault in a federal park.\nD. not guilty, because he did not agree to commit a crime in a federal park.\n"

In this case, the defendant's lack of knowledge about the location being a federal park could potentially negate the specific intent required to commit the crime of assault in a federal park. If the defendant genuinely did not know that the park was federal property and would not have proceeded with the plan if he had known, then he may lack the necessary mens rea for the specific charge of conspiracy to commit an assault in a federal park. However, it's important to note that this defense would likely depend on the specifics of the jurisdiction's laws and the evidence presented at trial."
