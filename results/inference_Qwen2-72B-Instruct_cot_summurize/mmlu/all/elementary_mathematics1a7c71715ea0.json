The product of two odd numbers is indeed odd, but the statement \"because both of the factors are odd\" does not apply to any of the options A through C. Let's analyze each option:\n\nA. The product of 5 x 2 is even because one of the factors is even (2). This statement is true regarding the outcome, but the reasoning is flawed since it mentions that both factors are even, which is not the case.\n\nB. The product of 4 x 4 is even, not odd, because both factors are even. This statement is false.\n\nC. The product of 2 x 7 is even because one of the factors is even (2). This statement is true regarding the outcome, but the reasoning is flawed since it mentions that both factors are odd, which is not the case.\n\nD. The product of 5 x 3 is indeed odd because both factors are odd. This statement is true and the reasoning is correct. However, the correct answer based on the options given and their respective justifications should be:\n\nA corrected version of D: \"The product of 5 x 3 is odd because both of the factors are odd,\" with the understanding that the correct reasoning for an odd product is that both factors must be odd."
