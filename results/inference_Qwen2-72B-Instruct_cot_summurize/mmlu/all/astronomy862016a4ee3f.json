Points farther from the axis have greater tangential velocities than points closer to the axis.\n- B. and D. The period (the time it takes for one complete rotation) does not depend on the distance from the axis. All points on the disk take the same amount of time to complete one full rotation around the axis.\n- C. This statement is true. The period of rotation, which is the time it takes for any point on the disk to complete one full circle around the axis, is the same everywhere on the disk."
