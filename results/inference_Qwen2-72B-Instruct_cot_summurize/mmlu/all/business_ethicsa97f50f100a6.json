Without knowing what those options are, I can't give you an accurate answer. However, I can provide some context on the Anglo-American model and its performance during the financial crisis.\n\nThe Anglo-American model refers to the economic and business practices predominant in the United States and the United Kingdom. It is characterized by:\n\n1. A strong emphasis on shareholder value and short-term profitability.\n2. Relatively weak labor protections compared to other developed countries.\n3. A high degree of market liberalization and deregulation.\n4. A focus on financial markets as the primary means of allocating capital.\n\nDuring the late 2000s recession (also known as the Great Recession), this model was heavily criticized for contributing to the crisis. Some key issues included:\n\n1. Excessive risk-taking by financial institutions due to the emphasis on short-term profits.\n2. Weak regulation and oversight, which allowed the development of complex financial instruments and shadow banking systems that contributed to the crisis.\n3. The housing bubble and subprime mortgage crisis, which were fueled by lax lending standards and speculative behavior.\n\nGiven these factors, it would be difficult to argue that the Anglo-American model was the \"best\" during the late 2000s recession. Instead, many economists and policymakers have suggested that the model needs significant reforms to prevent future crises.\n\nIf your question's options relate to these points, please provide them so I can offer a more specific response."
