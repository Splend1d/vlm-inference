The probability of getting a test statistic at least as extreme as the observed test statistic, if the null hypothesis is true.\n\nThis definition correctly describes what a P-value is in the context of hypothesis testing. It quantifies the strength of evidence against the null hypothesis by measuring the probability of observing the data (or more extreme data) under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true. A small P-value suggests that the observed data are unlikely under the null hypothesis, leading to potential rejection of the null hypothesis."
