To be palpable intraorally: The submandibular gland extends into the oral cavity through its duct (the Wharton duct), which opens near the second molar on the floor of the mouth. By gently palpating the area under the tongue, you may feel the enlargement.\n\nB. To be palpable extraorally: The main portion of the submandibular gland is located in the neck, just below the lower border of the mandible. By palpating this area, you should be able to feel any enlargement of the gland.\n\nC. To be palpable both intra- and extraorally: This is the most accurate answer as the gland can be felt from both inside the mouth and outside on the neck.\n\nD. Only to be detectable by radiographical examination: While radiographic examinations like ultrasound, CT scans, or MRI can provide detailed images of the gland and confirm the diagnosis, palpation is often sufficient for initial detection of an enlarged gland.\n\nSo, the correct answer would be C. to be palpable both intra- and extraorally."
