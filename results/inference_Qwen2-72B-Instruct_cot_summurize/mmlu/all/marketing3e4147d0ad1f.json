By turnover.\n\nTurnover can be a volatile metric, particularly for smaller organizations or those experiencing significant growth or decline. It may not always provide a stable or meaningful basis for segmentation, especially when compared to other more stable characteristics like organizational size, geographical location, or industry type. Nevertheless, turnover can still be a relevant factor in certain analyses, such as market segmentation for B2B sales or financial benchmarking."
