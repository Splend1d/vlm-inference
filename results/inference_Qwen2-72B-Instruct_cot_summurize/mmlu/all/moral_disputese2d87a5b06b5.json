According to Ashford, a structural human rights violation refers to ongoing patterns of behavior by a large number of agents which predictably result in many others coming to be deprived of the object of a fundamental human right: the means of subsistence. This definition emphasizes the role of systemic and institutional factors in perpetuating human rights abuses, rather than individual actions or decisions. However, it is worth noting that some scholars may use the term \"structural human rights violation\" more broadly to encompass other types of violations related to political structures or social agency, so option D could also be considered correct depending on the context."
