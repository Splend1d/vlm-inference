On June 1, 2007, two tenants took possession of a three- bedroom apartment in the landlord's building under a three-year lease at a rental of $1,200 per month. Their lease (as all other leases given by the landlord) contained the following provisions:\"The term of this lease shall be three years from the date hereof as long as all the agreements herein shall be faithfully performed. \"The two tenants lived in the apartment for two years. On June 10, 2009, however, a fire destroyed the apartment building. As a result, all the apartments in the building were rendered uninhabitable. After the two tenants were dispossessed from their apartment, the landlord brought suit against them to recover the rent due for the balance of the lease. The two tenants claim that they are no longer liable for rent or any other obligations under the lease. The landlord \u0080\u0094 tenants leasehold contract contained no provision regarding liability for fire. If the decision is in favor of the two tenants, it will most likely be because\n\nA. there was nothing in the lease regarding liability for fire.\nB. the two tenants did not own an interest in the property.\nC. the jurisdiction has rejected the common law view on the tenant's duty to pay rent.\nD. the landlord did not contract to convey the property to the two tenants.\n"

Under these principles, if the premises are destroyed or rendered uninhabitable through no fault of the tenant, the tenant is generally released from the obligation to pay rent. This is known as the doctrine of frustration of purpose or the implied covenant of habitability. Since the purpose of the lease (to provide inhabitable space) can no longer be fulfilled, the tenants' obligation to pay rent is typically extinguished."
