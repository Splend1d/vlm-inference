When an organism undergoes meiosis, its cells go through two rounds of division, resulting in four haploid cells, each with half the number of chromosomes as the original cell.\n\nIn this case, the organism has a diploid number of 96 (2n = 96), meaning it has 96 chromosomes in its somatic (non-reproductive) cells. During meiosis, these cells divide to form gametes (reproductive cells) that have half the number of chromosomes, or n. Therefore, after meiosis, the cells would have 96 / 2 = 48 chromosomes.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\nC. 48"
