The Z-score formula is:\n\n\\[Z = \\frac{X - \\mu}{\\sigma}\\]\n\nwhere \\(X\\) is the value of interest (in this case, 75 years), \\(\\mu\\) is the mean, and \\(\\sigma\\) is the standard deviation (14 years). We want to find the mean (\\(\\mu\\)) given that 30% of the population lives longer than 75 years.\n\nSince 30% of the population lives longer than 75 years, it means that 70% of the population lives less than or equal to 75 years. In terms of a standard normal distribution, this corresponds to finding the Z-score associated with the 70th percentile.\n\nUsing a standard normal distribution table or calculator, we can find that the Z-score corresponding to the 70th percentile is approximately 0.5244. This is because at a Z-score of about 0.5244, the cumulative probability under the standard normal curve is about 0.70 (or 70%).\n\nSubstituting the values into the Z-score formula gives us:\n\n\\[0.5244 = \\frac{75 - \\mu}{14}\\]\n\nSolving for \\(\\mu\\):\n\n\\[0.5244 \\times 14 = 75 - \\mu\\]\n\n\\[7.3416 = 75 - \\mu\\]\n\n\\[\\mu = 75 - 7.3416\\]\n\n\\[\\mu = 67.6584\\]\n\nThus, the closest answer is:\n\nC. 75 - 0.4756(14) \n\nHowever, this is not exactly correct as presented because the actual calculation should be closer to 75 - 0.5244(14) to match our derivation. The provided options seem to have minor rounding differences, but based on our calculation, the closest option would indeed be:\n\nD. 75 - 0.5244(14)\n\nThis choice aligns with the calculated mean longevity of approximately 67.6584 years when using the properties of the normal distribution."
