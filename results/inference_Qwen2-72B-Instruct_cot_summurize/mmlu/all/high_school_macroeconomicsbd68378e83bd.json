The multiplier (k) is calculated as:\n\n\\[ k = \\frac{1}{1 - MPC} \\]\n\nwhere MPC is the marginal propensity to consume.\n\nGiven that the MPC is 0.8, we can calculate the multiplier as follows:\n\n\\[ k = \\frac{1}{1 - 0.8} = \\frac{1}{0.2} = 5 \\]\n\nThis means that each dollar spent initially will lead to $5 of total economic activity due to the multiplier effect.\n\nGiven that the initial spending is $500, the total increase in GDP would be:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total Increase in GDP} = 500 \\times k = 500 \\times 5 = 2500 \\]\n\nSo the answer is D. $2,500."
