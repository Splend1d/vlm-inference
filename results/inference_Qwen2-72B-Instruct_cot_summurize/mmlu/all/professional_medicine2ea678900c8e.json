Physical examination reveals tenderness at the greater tubercle of the humerus and painful abduction of the right upper extremity. The cause of this patient's condition is most likely a somatic dysfunction of which of the following muscles?\n\nA. anterior scalene\nB. latissimus dorsi\nC. pectoralis minor\nD. supraspinatus\n"

Among the options given, the supraspinatus muscle (option D) is particularly important in the early stages of abduction and is commonly involved in rotator cuff injuries due to its location and function.\n\nThe supraspinatus muscle originates from the supraspinous fossa of the scapula and inserts on the greater tubercle of the humerus. Its primary function is to assist in the abduction of the arm and to stabilize the head of the humerus within the glenoid fossa of the scapula during this movement. An injury or dysfunction of this muscle can lead to pain during abduction and tenderness over the insertion site at the greater tubercle.\n\nTherefore, the most likely answer is:\n\nD. supraspinatus"
