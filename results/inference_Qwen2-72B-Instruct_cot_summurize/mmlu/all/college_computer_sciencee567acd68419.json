According to Amdahl's Law, which describes the theoretical speedup in latency of the execution of a task at fixed workload that can be expected of a system whose resources are improved, the maximum speedup achievable by adding more processors is limited by the portion of the program that cannot be parallelized.\n\nAmdahl's Law can be expressed as:\n\\[ S_p = \\frac{1}{(1 - p) + \\frac{p}{n}} \\]\nwhere:\n- \\(S_p\\) is the theoretical speedup of the execution of the entire task,\n- \\(p\\) is the proportion of the task that benefits from increased resources,\n- \\(n\\) is the number of processors.\n\nGiven that 40% of the computation is inherently sequential, we have \\(p = 0.6\\) (the parallelizable portion). The original computation time is 100 seconds. Let's calculate the theoretically best possible elapsed time for 2 and 4 processors.\n\nFor 2 processors (\\(n=2\\)):\n\\[ S_p = \\frac{1}{(1 - 0.6) + \\frac{0.6}{2}} = \\frac{1}{0.4 + 0.3} = \\frac{1}{0.7} \\approx 1.43 \\]\n\nThis means the computation should take about \\(\\frac{100}{1.43} \\approx 70\\) seconds.\n\nFor 4 processors (\\(n=4\\)):\n\\[ S_p = \\frac{1}{(1 - 0.6) + \\frac{0.6}{4}} = \\frac{1}{0.4 + 0.15} = \\frac{1}{0.55} \\approx 1.82 \\]\n\nThis means the computation should take about \\(\\frac{100}{1.82} \\approx 55\\) seconds.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. 70 and 55 seconds."
