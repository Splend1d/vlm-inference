In Tina's case, seeing the space shuttle in two different contexts (ready to launch and flying) presented two very different perspectives of the same object. The shuttle on the launchpad appears tall and stationary, while the flying shuttle may appear smaller and more horizontal due to its orientation and distance from the viewer. This change in perspective made it difficult for Tina to recognize that both images were of the same object, illustrating a challenge with shape constancy."
