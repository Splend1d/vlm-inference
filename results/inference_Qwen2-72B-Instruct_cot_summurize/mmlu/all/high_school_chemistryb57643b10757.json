Making the reaction vessel smaller.\n\nTo understand why, let's consider the reaction:\n\n\\[ 2NO_2(g) \\rightleftharpoons N_2O_4(g) \\]\n\nThis is an endothermic process, meaning it absorbs heat from its surroundings. According to Le Ch\u00e2telier's principle, if a dynamic equilibrium is disturbed by changing the conditions, the position of equilibrium moves to counteract the change.\n\nA. Decreasing the temperature would shift the equilibrium to the exothermic side (which is the reverse reaction in this case), reducing the amount of \\(N_2O_4\\).\n\nB. Increasing the size of the reaction vessel would decrease the pressure, which for a reaction with fewer moles of gas on one side (in this case, the right side) would shift the equilibrium towards the side with more moles of gas (the left side), decreasing \\(N_2O_4\\).\n\nC. Adding a selective catalyst does not shift the equilibrium but increases the rate at which equilibrium is achieved. It does not favor either side of the reaction over the other in terms of product formation.\n\nD. Making the reaction vessel smaller increases the pressure. For reactions involving gases, increasing the pressure shifts the equilibrium toward the side with fewer moles of gas. In this case, that's the right side where there is only one mole of gas (\\(N_2O_4\\)) compared to two moles of \\(NO_2\\) on the left side. This would lead to an increase in the amount of \\(N_2O_4\\)."
