People who score high on neuroticism tend to experience negative emotions more frequently and intensely, including anxiety about aging and its associated losses. They may worry about their health, appearance, and mortality as they get older.\n\nWhile mid-life crisis (option D) can also be related to fears of aging, it is not a personality trait but rather a specific phase or phenomenon that some people experience during middle age. It often involves a reevaluation of one's life and accomplishments, sometimes leading to significant changes in behavior or lifestyle. However, the question seems to ask for a personality trait associated with fear of aging, making neuroticism the most appropriate answer among the options provided."
