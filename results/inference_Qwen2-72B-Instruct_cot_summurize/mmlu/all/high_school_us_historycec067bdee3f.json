They ascribe to the men of the preceding age a wisdom more than human, and suppose what they did to be beyond amendment\u2026.But I know also, that laws and institutions must go hand in hand with the progress of the human mind. As that becomes more developed, more enlightened, as new discoveries are made, new truths disclosed, and manners and opinions change with the change of circumstances, institutions must advance also, and keep pace with the times.\"\nThomas Jefferson, 1816\nWhich of the following best describes a contributing factor in the crafting of the United States Constitution?\n\nA. Individual state constitutions written at the time of the Revolution tended to cede too much power to the federal government, leading to a call for reform on the part of Anti-Federalists.\nB. The weaknesses of the Articles of Confederation led James Madison to question their efficacy and prompted a formation of the Constitutional Congress in 1787\nC. Difficulties over trade and foreign relations led to a repeal of overly restrictive tariffs required by the Articles of Confederation.\nD. Washington's embarrassing failure at the Whiskey Rebellion led to Federalist demands for a new framework for federal power.\n"

The weaknesses of the Articles of Confederation led James Madison to question their efficacy and prompted a formation of the Constitutional Congress in 1787\n\nThe quote from Thomas Jefferson speaks to the idea that laws and institutions should evolve with society, which aligns with the need for a new constitution to address the inadequacies of the Articles of Confederation. The Articles of Confederation provided a weak central government that lacked the power to effectively manage the country's affairs, including issues related to commerce, taxation, and defense. This weakness was a significant factor in the call for a stronger federal government, which ultimately led to the Constitutional Convention in 1787 and the drafting of the U.S. Constitution."
