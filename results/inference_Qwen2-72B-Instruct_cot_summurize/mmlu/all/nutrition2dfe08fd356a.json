An increase in basal metabolic rate that is not fully explained by a change in body composition during chronic overfeeding\n\nAdaptive thermogenesis refers to the changes in energy expenditure that occur as a result of alterations in nutritional status, such as overfeeding or underfeeding. It is an adjustment in the basal metabolic rate (BMR) that cannot be accounted for solely by changes in body weight or body composition. This process can play a role in the development of obesity or weight loss, depending on whether the adaptive thermogenesis leads to an increase or decrease in energy expenditure relative to energy intake."
