On the woman's first day at work, she noticed a sign in the kitchen area that read:\"IMPORTANT NOTICE TO ALL EMPLOYEESEmployees are not permitted to smoke during working hours. Any employee who is found to be in violation of this policy will be fined $50 for the first offense; $100 for the second offense; and fired for the third violation. \"The woman, who was a smoker, read the notice, but did not object or make any comment regarding the restaurant's nonsmoking policy. For six months, the woman worked at the restaurant and never smoked during business hours. One afternoon, the woman was working when an armed robber stormed into the restaurant. He pointed a pistol at the woman and demanded all the money from the cash register. Frightened and panic stricken, the woman handed over the money and then collapsed. Moments later, she regained consciousness and then smoked a cigarette while she regained her composure. Thereafter, the woman resumed her duties for the rest of the day. The next week, however, when the woman received her pay check, she noticed that the restaurant had deducted $50 from her check. A note was attached indicating that the woman was being fined for smoking during business hours. Although the woman protested, the restaurant refused to make any waiver and stood by its policy. In an action by the woman against the restaurant to recover the $50, which of the following is the best argument in the woman's favor?\n\nA. The restaurant's nonsmoking policy concerned a collateral matter that was not incorporated within the terms of their employment contract.\nB. The restaurant impliedly waived the nonsmoking provision by permitting the woman to continue working for the rest of the day.\nC. The nonsmoking provision constituted a constructive condition subsequent that was excused because of temporary impracticability.\nD. The nonsmoking provision concerning disciplinary action is unenforceable, because it attempts to impose a penalty instead of reasonably liquidating the damages, if any, sustained by the restaurant.\n"

The nonsmoking provision constituted a constructive condition subsequent that was excused because of temporary impracticability.\n\nThis argument acknowledges that there was a nonsmoking policy in place, but it also recognizes that the circumstances surrounding the incident were extraordinary and beyond the woman's control. The armed robbery created a situation where the woman was frightened and panicked, leading her to smoke as a means of regaining her composure. This argument suggests that under such extreme conditions, the enforcement of the nonsmoking policy becomes temporarily impracticable, and therefore, the policy should not be enforced against her in this instance. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the notice posted in the kitchen area could be considered part of the employment terms, even if not explicitly stated in the employment contract. Option B is not a strong argument because continuing to allow the woman to work does not necessarily imply a waiver of the policy. Option D is also not a strong argument because the policy may be intended to maintain a smoke-free environment and not necessarily to penalize employees in the traditional sense."
