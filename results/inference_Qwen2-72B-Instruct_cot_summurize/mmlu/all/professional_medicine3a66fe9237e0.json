His temperature is 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F). Physical examination shows enlarged, 3-cm, erythematous axillary lymph nodes bilaterally. On palpation, the nodes are tender, fluctuant, and movable. Examination of a fine-needle aspirate from one of the nodes shows gram-positive cocci in clusters. Cultures of the aspirate grow yellow, \u03b2hemolytic colonies that are catalase and coagulase positive. A polymerase chain reaction test shows mecA-positive organisms. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient?\n\nA. Ciprofloxacin\nB. Penicillin G\nC. Rifampin\nD. Vancomycin\n"

Vancomycin.\n\nGiven the information provided, the patient has an infection caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), as indicated by the presence of gram-positive cocci in clusters, the culture characteristics, and the mecA gene positivity. MRSA is resistant to many common antibiotics, including penicillins. Therefore, vancomycin is the most appropriate choice for treating this infection, as it is effective against MRSA and can be used to treat serious infections caused by this organism. Ciprofloxacin, penicillin G, and rifampin may not be effective against MRSA."
