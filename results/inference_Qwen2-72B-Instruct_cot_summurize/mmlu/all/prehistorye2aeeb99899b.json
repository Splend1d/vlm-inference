These images were typically carved into stone stelae, painted on pottery, or depicted in murals and codices, and served as records of historical events, religious beliefs, and political power. While Mayan art also includes depictions of other themes such as mythology, daily life, and the natural world, the representation of violence is particularly prominent and distinctive."
