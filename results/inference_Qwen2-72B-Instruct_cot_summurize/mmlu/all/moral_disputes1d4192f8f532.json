However, he believes that our actions towards animals can reveal bad qualities of character in us, such as cruelty or callousness, which are morally relevant and subject to criticism. Therefore, according to Carruthers, it is not the animals' own moral status that justifies moral criticism, but rather the moral implications of our own behavior towards them."
