The probability of the union of two events can be calculated using the formula P(A \u222a B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \u2229 B). Independence of events A and B is defined by P(A \u2229 B) = P(A) * P(B), which is not related to P(A \u222a B).\n\nB. P(A \u222a B) = 1 does not imply that events A and B are mutually exclusive. If two events are mutually exclusive, then P(A \u2229 B) = 0. However, P(A \u222a B) = 1 only means that at least one of the events will definitely occur, but they may or may not be mutually exclusive.\n\nC. P(A \u2229 B) = 0 does not imply that events A and B are independent. In fact, if P(A \u2229 B) = 0, it means that events A and B cannot occur simultaneously, which is the definition of mutually exclusive events, not independent events.\n\nD. P(A \u2229 B) = 0 implies that events A and B are mutually exclusive. This is because if the intersection of two events has a probability of zero, it means that there is no overlap between the two events, and they cannot both occur at the same time."
