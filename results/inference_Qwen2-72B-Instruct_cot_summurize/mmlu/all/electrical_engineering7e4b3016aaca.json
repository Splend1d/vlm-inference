This results in a higher response time\u2014the time it takes for the instrument to react to a change\u2014and a larger time constant, which is a measure of how quickly the instrument can reach a new steady state after a change. These factors make purely mechanical instruments less suitable for dynamic measurements where quick and accurate responses are necessary."
