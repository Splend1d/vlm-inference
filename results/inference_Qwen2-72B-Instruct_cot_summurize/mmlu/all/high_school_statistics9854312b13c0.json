Mathematically, this means \\(P(E \\cap F) = 0\\).\n\nIndependent: Two events are independent if the occurrence of one does not affect the probability of the other occurring. Mathematically, this means \\(P(E \\cap F) = P(E) \\times P(F)\\).\n\nLet's check the conditions:\n\n1. **Mutual Exclusivity:** Since \\(P(E \\cap F) = 0.048\\) is not equal to 0, the events E and F are not mutually exclusive.\n\n2. **Independence:** To check if E and F are independent, we need to see if \\(P(E \\cap F) = P(E) \\times P(F)\\). Let's calculate:\n   - \\(P(E) \\times P(F) = 0.32 \\times 0.15 = 0.048\\)\n   - Given \\(P(E \\cap F) = 0.048\\)\n\nSince \\(P(E \\cap F) = P(E) \\times P(F)\\), the events E and F are independent.\n\nThus, the correct conclusion is:\n\n**D. The events E and F are independent but not mutually exclusive.**"
