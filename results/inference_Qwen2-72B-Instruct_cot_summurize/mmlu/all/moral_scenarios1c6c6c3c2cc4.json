However, it could be considered reckless or irresponsible if it posed a risk to the safety of the dog, the individual, or others. Since the question asks for \"clearly morally wrong,\" and without knowing the full context, it's not clear that this action meets that standard. Therefore, it's not wrong according to ordinary moral standards unless additional information indicates otherwise."
