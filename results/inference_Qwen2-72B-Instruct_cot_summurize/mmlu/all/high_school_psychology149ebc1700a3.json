According to this theory, non-painful stimuli (like scratching) can close these gates, blocking the transmission of pain signals and providing temporary relief. When the scratching stops, the gates reopen, and the pain signals can again reach the brain. This theory was proposed by Ronald Melzack and Patrick Wall in 1965."
