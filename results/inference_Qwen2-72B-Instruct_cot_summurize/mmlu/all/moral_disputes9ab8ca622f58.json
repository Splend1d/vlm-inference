Dershowitz has argued that in certain extreme cases, such as a \"ticking time bomb\" scenario where a terrorist has information about an imminent attack that could save many lives, the use of torture might be morally justified. However, he does not endorse any specific methods of torture and has stated that any decision to use torture should be subject to strict legal and ethical guidelines. In fact, he has proposed the use of \"torture warrants\" that would require a judge to approve any use of torture in advance, based on evidence that it is necessary to prevent an imminent threat."
