This can be due to various reasons such as wanting to maintain their independence, not wanting to burden their children, or simply being accustomed to living by themselves after the loss of their spouse. However, this doesn't mean that all older widows live alone, and many may choose other living arrangements based on their personal circumstances and preferences."
