Collateral matters: The best evidence rule does not apply to collateral matters because the rule is meant to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the contents of a writing when those contents are directly at issue. If the matter is collateral, meaning it is not central to the case, the rule may not be invoked.\n\nB. Public records: While public records can fall under the best evidence rule if their contents are at issue, there are exceptions that allow secondary evidence or summaries of such records to be admitted without producing the original, especially when the record is voluminous or inconvenient to produce.\n\nC. When it's not offered to prove the contents of the document: The best evidence rule applies when the contents of a writing are being offered as proof in a legal proceeding. If the document is introduced for some other purpose, such as to show ownership by possession or to establish the fact that the document exists, then the rule does not apply.\n\nTherefore, depending on the context, all of these situations could be instances where the best evidence rule would not apply. However, the most accurate answer given the options provided is D. All of the above, as each scenario can represent circumstances where the best evidence rule might not be applicable."
