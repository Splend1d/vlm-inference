Well-adapted individuals leave more offspring, and thus contribute more to the next generation's gene pool, than do poorly adapted individuals.\n\nThis statement accurately describes a key principle of natural selection: organisms that are better suited to their environment (well-adapted) tend to have higher reproductive success and pass on their advantageous traits to their offspring, thereby increasing the frequency of those traits in the population over time.\n\nStatements A, B, and C contain inaccuracies or oversimplifications regarding the complex processes of evolution and adaptation. Adaptations are specific to particular environmental conditions and may not be beneficial in other habitats or at other times. Different species occupying the same habitat may undergo different genetic changes depending on their unique evolutionary history and selective pressures they encounter."
