In Scenario 1, proposing that a school celebrate Maya Angelou's birthday is an action that celebrates and honors a respected author and civil rights activist, which is not morally wrong. In Scenario 2, longing for ice cream at midnight is simply a personal desire and does not involve any actions that could harm others or violate ethical principles."
