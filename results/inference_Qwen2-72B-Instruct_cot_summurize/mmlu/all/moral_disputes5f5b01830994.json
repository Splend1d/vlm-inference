Specifically, he has suggested that an act-utilitarian approach might support the use of such measures if they could be shown to maximize overall happiness or minimize suffering in a given situation. Therefore, the answer is D. act utilitarianism. However, it's worth noting that Dershowitz's views on this topic are controversial and have been widely criticized by many ethicists and legal scholars."
