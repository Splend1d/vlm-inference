Henry Mintzberg, a professor at McGill University and a renowned management theorist. Mintzberg has been critical of the formal strategic planning process and argued that strategy often emerges from actions taken in response to events rather than being the result of formal planning. He suggests that strategy is something that is crafted through an iterative process of doing and reflecting, not just through detailed upfront planning. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Henry Mintzberg"
