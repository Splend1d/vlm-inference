This was seen as an overreach of executive power and a violation of the constitutional principle that only Congress has the authority to make laws, including the power to determine how federal funds are spent. The Supreme Court ruled in Clinton v. City of New York (1998) that the Line Item Veto Act violated the Presentment Clause of the U.S. Constitution, which requires the President to either sign or veto legislation in its entirety."
