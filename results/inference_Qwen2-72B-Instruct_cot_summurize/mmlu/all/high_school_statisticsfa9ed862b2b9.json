                    "text": "The correct answer is D. 81% of the variation in GPAs can be explained by variation in number of study hours per day.\n\nExplanation: The correlation coefficient (r) measures the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two variables. In this case, r = 0.9 indicates a strong positive correlation between the number of hours per day students study and their GPAs.\n\nHowever, the correlation coefficient does not tell us anything about causality or the percentage of students who study or receive high grades. Instead, it tells us how much of the variation in one variable (GPAs) can be explained by the variation in the other variable (number of study hours per day).\n\nTo find out how much of the variation in GPAs can be explained by the variation in number of study hours per day, we need to square the correlation coefficient (r^2), which is called the coefficient of determination. In this case, r^2 = 0.9^2 = 0.81, or 81%. This means that 81% of the variation in GPAs can be explained by variation in number of study hours per day."
