The main character might not know for sure that the illness was caused by the restaurant and could be unaware of any recent changes in hygiene or management.\n\nIn Scenario 2, firing a gun at a bull's eye at a shooting range is typically considered a safe and legal activity, provided all safety rules are followed. This action does not inherently violate ordinary moral standards unless additional context suggests otherwise, such as if the main character was intentionally endangering others or breaking laws. Assuming standard safety protocols were observed, this scenario is not morally wrong."
