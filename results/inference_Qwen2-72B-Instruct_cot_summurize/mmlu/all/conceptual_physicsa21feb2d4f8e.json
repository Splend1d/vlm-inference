This means that the clockwise torque produced by one person is equal to the counterclockwise torque produced by the other person, allowing the seesaw to remain balanced. The torque is calculated as the product of the force applied and the distance from the pivot point (also known as the lever arm). Therefore, even if the big brother and little sister have different weights (forces), they can still balance each other out if their distances from the pivot point compensate for the difference in weight."
