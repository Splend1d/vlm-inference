All charges in nature are integral multiples of this elementary charge because charges can only exist in whole numbers of electrons or protons.\n\nGiven this information, let's examine each option:\n\nA. 6.4 \u00d7 10^-19 C = 4 * (1.6 \u00d7 10^-19 C) - This is possible.\nB. 8.0 \u00d7 10^-19 C = 5 * (1.6 \u00d7 10^-19 C) - This is also possible.\nC. 4.8 \u00d7 10^-19 C = 3 * (1.6 \u00d7 10^-19 C) - This is possible.\nD. 2.4 \u00d7 10^-19 C = 1.5 * (1.6 \u00d7 10^-19 C) - This is NOT possible since you cannot have half an electron or proton.\n\nTherefore, the measurement that should be rejected as highly unlikely to be correct is **D. 2.4 \u00d7 10^-19 C**."
