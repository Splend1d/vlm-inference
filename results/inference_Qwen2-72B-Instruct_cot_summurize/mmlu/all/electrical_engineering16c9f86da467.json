This is because the circuit consists of two sections in series: one section made up of a resistor and a capacitor, and the other section made up of a resistor and a capacitor in reverse order. Each section provides a phase shift of 90 degrees at the oscillation frequency, resulting in a total phase shift of 180 degrees which, combined with the inversion from the Op-Amp, results in the necessary 360-degree phase shift for sustained oscillations.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. 1/3"
