However, it's important to note that this choice is somewhat broad, and other choices also relate to the functions of such boards. For example, they do provide sanctions for unethical and illegal behavior (choice B), which is a way they protect the public. They don't develop laws (choice A) but they enforce them, and they don't accredit graduate programs (choice D), although some licensing boards may require that applicants have graduated from an accredited program."
