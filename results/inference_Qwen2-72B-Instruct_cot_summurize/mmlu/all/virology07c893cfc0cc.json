The virus was first identified during an outbreak among pig farmers and people with close contact with pigs in Malaysia and Singapore in 1998-1999. The bats infected pigs, which then spread the virus to humans. Since then, outbreaks have occurred periodically in South and Southeast Asia, primarily due to human exposure to infected bats or their secretions."
