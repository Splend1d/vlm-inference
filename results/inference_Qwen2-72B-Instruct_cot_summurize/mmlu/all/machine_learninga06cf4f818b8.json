While options A and B do not necessarily represent disadvantages of grid search (it can be applied to both differentiable and non-differentiable, continuous and non-continuous functions), and option C is generally not true as grid search is relatively straightforward to implement, the most accurate answer from the given choices would be:\n\nD. It runs reasonably slow for multiple linear regression.\n\nHowever, this answer could be misleading because grid search isn't typically used for parameter estimation in multiple linear regression problems; instead, it's more commonly used for hyperparameter tuning in machine learning models. The real disadvantage of grid search is that it becomes computationally very expensive as the number of dimensions (hyperparameters) increases, due to the curse of dimensionality. This makes it run extremely slow when dealing with a large number of hyperparameters, not specifically in the context of multiple linear regression. Therefore, a more accurate statement would be that grid search runs reasonably slow in high-dimensional spaces or for models with many hyperparameters."
