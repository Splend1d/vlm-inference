It does not load the circuit at all.\n\nWhen you measure voltage with a voltmeter, the voltmeter has some internal resistance. This resistance is connected in parallel with the circuit component whose voltage you're measuring. If the voltmeter's resistance is not much higher than the resistance of the circuit element, it will draw current and thus affect the voltage drop across that element, leading to measurement errors. This effect is known as \"loading\" the circuit.\n\nIn contrast, a potentiometer is a high-precision device used for measuring voltages without drawing any current from the circuit under test. It achieves this by balancing the unknown voltage against a known reference voltage, usually provided by a precision voltage source. When the two voltages are balanced, there is no current flowing through the galvanometer (which is essentially a very sensitive ammeter), meaning the circuit being measured is not loaded. This makes the potentiometer method highly accurate for voltage measurements."
