Three days after the contract was formed, but prior to delivery of the casebooks, the publisher called the owner of the law bookstore and informed him that, because of a calculation error, the price for the casebooks should have been $11 per book, and the shipment could not be delivered unless the owner promised to pay that amount. The owner reluctantly agreed. The owner's agreement to pay $11 per book is\n\nA. enforceable, because it was not supported by any new consideration.\nB. enforceable, under the principle of promissory estoppel.\nC. unenforceable, because it is violative of the statute of frauds.\nD. unenforceable, because the error resulted from the publisher's computational error.\n"

In this case, the owner of the law bookstore relied on the publisher's promise to deliver the books at the originally agreed-upon price of $10 per book. When the publisher reneged on this promise due to their own calculation error and demanded an additional $1 per book, the owner reluctantly agreed. If the owner had already taken action in reliance on the original contract (such as advertising the books at a certain price or making arrangements for storage), they may have incurred costs or made commitments based on the expectation that the books would be delivered at the agreed-upon price. Under these circumstances, the owner's agreement to pay the higher price could be enforced through the doctrine of promissory estoppel to prevent the publisher from being unjustly enriched at the expense of the bookstore owner.\n\nIt's worth noting that promissory estoppel is generally an exception to the traditional requirement of consideration for a contract modification. However, the specifics of whether promissory estoppel applies in this situation would depend on the details of the case and the laws of the jurisdiction in question."
