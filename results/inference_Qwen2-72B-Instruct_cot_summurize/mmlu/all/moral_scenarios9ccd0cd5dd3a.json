Wiping up water from a stage before a performance could be seen as a responsible and considerate action to prevent accidents or injuries.\n\nScenario 2, however, describes a situation that is clearly morally wrong. Providing food for one's children only once a week is neglectful and does not meet their basic needs for sustenance, which is considered a fundamental parental responsibility."
