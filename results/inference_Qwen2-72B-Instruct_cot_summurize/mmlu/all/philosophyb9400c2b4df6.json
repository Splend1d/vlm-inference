This means that option D is the correct answer: the only way to be a good or worthwhile person is to know how human beings should behave based on universal norms or values. By examining our beliefs and actions, we can come to understand what is truly good and just, and thus live a life that is both virtuous and fulfilling. Options A, B, and C are all related to Socratic philosophy, but they do not directly address the relationship between virtue and knowledge."
