This results in one large chromosome instead of two smaller ones. Acrocentric chromosomes are chromosomes that have their centromeres very close to one end, giving them an \"L\" shape, and humans have five such chromosomes: 13, 14, 15, 21, and 22. Robertsonian translocations can lead to genetic disorders if they involve genes essential for normal development or function."
