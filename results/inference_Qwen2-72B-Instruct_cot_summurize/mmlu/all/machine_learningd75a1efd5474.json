True, True\n\nStatement 1 is true because the softmax function is indeed used in multiclass logistic regression to convert the output scores into probabilities that sum up to one. This allows for the interpretation of these scores as class probabilities and facilitates the selection of the class with the highest probability as the prediction.\n\nStatement 2 is also true. In a nonuniform softmax distribution, the temperature parameter can affect the entropy of the distribution. A higher temperature leads to a more uniform distribution (higher entropy), while a lower temperature results in a more peaked distribution (lower entropy). This property is often used in various applications, such as in the Gumbel-softmax trick or in reinforcement learning to control the exploration-exploitation trade-off."
