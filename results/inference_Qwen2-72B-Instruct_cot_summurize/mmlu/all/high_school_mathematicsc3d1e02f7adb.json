This theorem states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the remaining side.\n\nGiven the longest side is 10, let's check each option:\n\nA. 4, 7\n\nSum of these two sides = 4 + 7 = 11 > 10. So, this can form a triangle with the longest side being 10.\n\nB. 5, 5\n\nSum of these two sides = 5 + 5 = 10. According to the Triangle Inequality Theorem, the sum should be strictly greater than the length of the third side (which is 10). However, in this case, it equals 10, which violates the strict inequality required by the theorem. But more importantly, for any triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be strictly greater than the length of the remaining side, so 5+5=10 does not satisfy this condition.\n\nC. 3, 9\n\nSum of these two sides = 3 + 9 = 12 > 10. So, this can form a triangle with the longest side being 10.\n\nD. 9, 8\n\nSum of these two sides = 9 + 8 = 17 > 10. So, this can form a triangle with the longest side being 10.\n\nThus, the correct answer is **B. 5, 5**, because the sum of these two sides is not strictly greater than the longest side, violating the Triangle Inequality Theorem. However, I want to clarify that technically, the sum equaling the length of the third side doesn't form a triangle but a straight line (degenerate triangle), and in the context of forming a proper triangle, the sum must be strictly greater than the third side. Therefore, based on the given options and criteria, B is the only one that cannot form a triangle where 10 is the longest side."
