Preload, contractility, and afterload.\n\nStroke volume is regulated by three primary factors: preload (end-diastolic volume), which is influenced by venous return and ventricular compliance; contractility, which is affected by the concentration of intracellular calcium and the sensitivity of the myocardium to that calcium; and afterload (vascular resistance), which is influenced by arterial blood pressure and the tone of the arterial vasculature."
