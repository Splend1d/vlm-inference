The amount of the illuminated side of the Moon that can be seen from Earth.\n\nThe phases of the Moon occur because of the changing angles between the Sun, Earth, and Moon as the Moon orbits around the Earth. When the Moon is between the Earth and the Sun (new moon), we see no illuminated portion of the Moon. As it moves along its orbit, more of the sunlit side becomes visible from Earth, leading to the waxing crescent, first quarter, waxing gibbous, full moon, waning gibbous, third quarter, and waning crescent phases. This cycle repeats every 29.5 days."
