Then, we evaluate the truth values of the compound propositions based on these.\n\nHere's the truth table:\n\n|   C    |   D    |  ~C   | ~C \u2283 D | D \u2283 C | Conclusion |\n|--------|--------|-------|--------|-------|------------|\n|  True  |  True  | False |  True  |  True |   True     |\n|  True  | False  | False |  True  | False |  False     |\n| False  |  True  |  True |  True  |  True |  False     |\n| False  | False  |  True | False  |  True |  False     |\n\nThe argument given is:\n\n~C \u2283 D\nD \u2283 C / C\n\nWe need to check if whenever both premises (~C \u2283 D) and (D \u2283 C) are true, the conclusion (C) is also true. From the truth table, we can see that:\n\n1. In row 1, both premises are true, and the conclusion (C) is true.\n2. In row 2, one premise (D \u2283 C) is false, so we don't consider this row for validity because if a premise is false, the argument cannot be considered invalid based on this row alone.\n3. In row 3, both premises are true, but the conclusion (C) is false.\n4. Row 4 doesn't matter since one of the premises (~C \u2283 D) is false.\n\nSince there is at least one row (row 3) where the premises are true but the conclusion is false, the argument is invalid.\n\nLooking at the options for the counterexample:\n- B. Invalid. Counterexample when C and D are true: This is not correct because when C and D are true, the argument holds true (as seen in row 1).\n- C. Invalid. Counterexample when C is true and D is false: This is not correct because when C is true and D is false, the argument does not hold due to the second premise being false, but it's not a counterexample to the argument's validity.\n- D. Invalid. Counterexample when D is true and C is false: This is correct because it matches the conditions of row 3 in the truth table, where both premises are true and the conclusion is false.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **D. Invalid. Counterexample when D is true and C is false**."
