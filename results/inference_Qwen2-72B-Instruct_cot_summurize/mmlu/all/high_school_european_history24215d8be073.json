This view was characterized by skepticism towards traditional religious beliefs and institutions, and a preference for reason and empirical evidence. In this quote, Gibbon suggests that the different religions practiced in ancient Rome were seen as equally true by the people, equally false by philosophers, and equally useful by magistrates. This implies a level of religious skepticism, particularly on the part of the philosophers, who saw through the supposed truths of these religions. Therefore, this statement could be used as evidence for the spread of religious skepticism among the educated elite in eighteenth-century Britain."
