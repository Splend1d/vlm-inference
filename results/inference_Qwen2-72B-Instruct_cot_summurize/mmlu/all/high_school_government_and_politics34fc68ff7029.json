Checks and balances\n\nThe Constitution, as written in 1787, established a system of checks and balances among the three branches of the federal government (the legislative, executive, and judicial branches) to ensure that no single branch would become too powerful. This is one of the core principles that helped define the structure and function of the U.S. government. \n\nA. Direct democracy is not a core principle of the Constitution; the U.S. is a representative democracy, where citizens elect representatives to make decisions on their behalf.\nC. Equal representation is not entirely accurate as the Constitution initially provided for unequal representation between the states in Congress (with the Senate having equal representation per state and the House having proportional representation based on population).\nD. Unitary government is not a principle of the Constitution; the Constitution establishes a federal system with shared powers between the national government and the states."
