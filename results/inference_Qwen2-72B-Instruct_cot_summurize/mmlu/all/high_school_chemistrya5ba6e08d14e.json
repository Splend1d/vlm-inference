This is a reduction reaction.\n\n2. \\(Cu^+ + e^- \\rightarrow Cu^0\\)\n   - Copper(I) ions are being reduced to copper metal (Cu^0) because they are also gaining an electron (\\(e^-\\)). This is also a reduction reaction.\n\n3. \\(Fe^{2+} \\rightarrow Fe^{3+} + e^-\\)\n   - Iron(II) ions are being oxidized to iron(III) ions because they are losing an electron (\\(e^-\\)). This is an oxidation reaction, not a reduction reaction.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nC. 1 and 2 because they both reduce copper ions."
