Using water for bladder washout may cause electrolyte imbalance.\n\nUsing water for bladder washout can lead to osmotic demyelination, also known as central pontine myelinolysis, due to rapid shifts in electrolyte concentrations. This can happen when the concentration of electrolytes in the washout solution differs significantly from that of the body's fluids. Water has no electrolytes, so using it for bladder washout can potentially lead to an electrolyte imbalance and subsequent complications. The other options do not directly address the risks associated with using water for bladder washout."
