Expectation Maximization\n\nExpectation Maximization (EM) is an iterative method used for clustering and is often applied in scenarios where data is incomplete or has hidden variables. It is particularly useful in estimating the parameters of a statistical model with unobserved latent variables.\n\nB. CART (Classification and Regression Trees) is not a clustering algorithm; it is a decision tree algorithm used for classification and regression tasks.\n\nC. Gaussian Na\u00efve Bayes is a probabilistic classifier based on applying Bayes' theorem with strong independence assumptions between the features, not a clustering algorithm.\n\nD. Apriori is an algorithm used for frequent itemset mining and association rule learning in transactional databases, not for clustering."
