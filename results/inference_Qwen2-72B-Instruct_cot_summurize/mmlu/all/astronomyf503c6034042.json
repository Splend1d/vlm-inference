Mathematically, this is represented as T^2 \u221d a^3.\n\nIf the Earth's orbit were instantly moved to a distance three times further away from the Sun, then the semi-major axis of its orbit would be multiplied by 3. Let's represent the original semi-major axis as \"a\" and the new semi-major axis as \"3a\". According to Kepler's third law:\n\n(T_new)^2 / (T_old)^2 = (3a)^3 / a^3\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n(T_new)^2 / (T_old)^2 = 27\n\nTaking the square root of both sides, we find:\n\nT_new / T_old = sqrt(27) \u2248 5.196\n\nThus, the new orbital period would be approximately 5.2 times longer than the old one. Therefore, the correct answer is B. about 5.2 times longer."
