Policies that align with this perspective typically aim to increase the supply of goods and services by reducing barriers to production and investment. Among the options provided, the policy most consistent with supply-side economics would be:\n\nB. lower tax rates on interest earned from savings.\n\nLowering taxes on interest earned from savings incentivizes individuals to save more, which can lead to greater capital accumulation and potentially more investment in the economy. This is in line with supply-side thinking, as it encourages the factors of production (in this case, capital) to contribute more to economic activity."
