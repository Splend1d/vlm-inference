The government decreases spending with no change in taxes.\n\nWhen the government decreases its spending without changing taxes, it directly reduces aggregate demand in the economy. This reduction in demand can lead to a decrease in production and potentially a decrease in real GDP if other components of aggregate demand (such as consumer spending, investment, or net exports) do not compensate for the decline.\n\nIn contrast:\n- A. If the government decreases spending but also decreases taxes, this might offset some of the negative impact on aggregate demand, depending on how consumers respond to the tax cut.\n- B. Increasing government spending without raising taxes would typically stimulate the economy by increasing aggregate demand, which could lead to an increase in real GDP.\n- D. Increasing taxes while keeping spending constant would reduce disposable income for households, which could decrease consumption and potentially lower real GDP, but the direct impact on aggregate demand may be less than when spending is cut without changing taxes."
