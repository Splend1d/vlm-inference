Investment tax credits.\n\nInvestment tax credits encourage businesses to invest in new equipment, technology, and facilities by reducing the amount of taxes they owe on these investments. This can lead to increased productivity, innovation, and job creation, all of which can contribute to stronger economic growth over time.\n\nIn contrast, more rapid consumption of natural resources (Option A) can lead to depletion of those resources and long-term economic harm, higher adult illiteracy rates (Option B) can reduce the skill level of the workforce and limit economic potential, and a falling stock of capital goods (Option C) can decrease productivity and economic output."
