The current account includes the balance of trade (exports minus imports), net income from abroad, and net current transfers. When a country has a current account deficit, it means that it is receiving less income from exports and investments than it is paying out for imports and investments in other countries. This often leads to an outflow of the domestic currency (in this case, U.S. dollars) to pay for those imports and investments."
