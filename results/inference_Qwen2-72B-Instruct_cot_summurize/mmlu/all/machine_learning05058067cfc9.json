CNNs are designed to process data with a grid-like topology, such as images, and they excel at recognizing patterns in visual data by using filters that slide across the image. This makes them highly effective for tasks like image classification, object detection, and segmentation.\n\nWhile other architectures like Graph Networks, Fully Connected Networks, and RBF Networks have their own strengths and applications, they are not specifically tailored for image processing tasks and typically do not perform as well as CNNs on high-resolution image classification."
