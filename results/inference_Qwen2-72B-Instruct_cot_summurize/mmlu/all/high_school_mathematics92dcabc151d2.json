Then,\n\n\\[b = a \\cdot 2^{11} + (2^{11}-1)\\]\n\nFrom this, it's clear that any common divisor of $a$ and $b$ must also divide $(2^{11}-1)$, since if there exists a number $d$ that divides both $a$ and $b$, then $d$ must divide the difference between $b$ and $a \\cdot 2^{11}$, which is $(2^{11}-1)$.\n\nThus, the GCD of $a$ and $b$ is at most $2^{11}-1$.\n\nNow, we need to determine if $2^{11}-1$ actually divides both $a$ and $b$. \n\nSince $2^{11}-1$ divides $b$ by our previous manipulation, we only need to check if it divides $a$.\n\nNotice that $2^{11}-1$ divides $2^{11k}-1$ for any positive integer $k$, because $2^{11k}-1 = (2^{11})^k-1 = (2^{11}-1)((2^{11})^{k-1}+(2^{11})^{k-2}+\\ldots+1)$.\n\nGiven that $1001 = 11 \\times 91$, it follows that $2^{11}-1$ divides $2^{1001}-1$.\n\nTherefore, the GCD of $2^{1001}-1$ and $2^{1012}-1$ is indeed $2^{11}-1 = 2048 - 1 = 2047$.\n\nThe answer is D. 2047."
