It has to lower its price on all units to sell more output.\n\nIn a monopolistic market, a single seller dominates the market and faces a downward-sloping demand curve. To sell additional units, the monopolist must lower the price on all units sold, not just the incremental units. This contrasts with a perfectly competitive market where individual firms can sell any quantity at the prevailing market price without affecting that price. \n\nA is incorrect because a monopoly does not compete with other firms selling the same product; it is the sole supplier.\nC is incorrect because the marginal revenue for a monopolist decreases as output sold increases due to the need to lower prices to sell additional units.\nD is incorrect because while a firm might engage in predatory pricing (setting prices below average variable cost) to drive competitors out of the market, this strategy is not inherently characteristic of all monopolies and may be illegal under antitrust laws. Moreover, if a monopoly is already established, it does not have competitors to drive out."
