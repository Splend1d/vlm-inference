Supervised learning\n\nPredicting the amount of rainfall in a region based on various cues, such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and other meteorological data, is a supervised learning problem. In supervised learning, the model is trained on a labeled dataset where the input features (cues) are provided along with the corresponding output labels (rainfall amounts). The goal is to learn a mapping from the input features to the output labels so that the model can make accurate predictions for new, unseen data."
