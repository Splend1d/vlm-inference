Two days after his funeral, the boy's mother saw a television program about gang violence and was shocked to see video of herself weeping over the boy's body. The video had been shot by the television reporting team while the boy's body was still lying on a public street. The mother suffered severe emotional distress as a result of seeing the video. If the mother sues the television station for invasion of her privacy and that of her son, will the mother be likely to prevail?\n\nA. No, because a person has no right to privacy after his or her death.\nB. No, because the street was open to the public and the subject was newsworthy.\nC. Yes, because the mother did not give permission to have the video used in the program.\nD. Yes, because the mother suffered severe emotional distress as a result of viewing the video.\n"

In cases of invasion of privacy, it is essential that consent is obtained from the individuals involved, especially when they are in a vulnerable state such as mourning. The fact that the street was public and the subject was newsworthy does not automatically override the need for consent, particularly when dealing with sensitive footage like someone grieving over a loved one's body. The use of the video without the mother's permission could be seen as an intrusion into her personal grief and a violation of her privacy rights. Additionally, the severe emotional distress she experienced as a result of viewing the video could support her claim for damages. However, the specific outcome would depend on the jurisdiction's laws regarding privacy and media rights."
