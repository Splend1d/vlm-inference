This neurological disorder is characterized by a progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra region of the brain, leading to motor symptoms such as tremors, rigidity, and bradykinesia.\n\nWhile dopamine dysregulation may also play a role in other conditions like major depressive disorder and schizophrenia, and while some forms of autism have been associated with altered dopamine function, these disorders are not primarily caused by a simple deficit of dopamine as in Parkinson's disease. Alzheimer's disease is mainly associated with deficits in acetylcholine rather than dopamine."
