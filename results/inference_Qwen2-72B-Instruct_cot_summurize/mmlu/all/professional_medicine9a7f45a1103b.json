The patient's symptoms and physical exam findings are consistent with a Bartholin gland abscess, which is a common cause of acute vulvar swelling and pain. This condition typically requires surgical intervention for adequate treatment. Incision and drainage would allow for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes, providing relief of symptoms and an opportunity to send purulent material for culture and sensitivity testing to guide further antibiotic therapy if necessary."
