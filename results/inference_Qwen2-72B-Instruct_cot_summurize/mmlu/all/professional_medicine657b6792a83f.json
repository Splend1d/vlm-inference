On examination, there is bruising of the perineum and pain is elicited with motion of his pelvis. Blood is noted at the urethral meatus. There is no other penile trauma. A plain x-ray shows a fracture of the superior pubic ramus and retrograde urethrography is done to evaluate for a urethral disruption. Which of the following portions of the urethra would be at greatest risk for injury in this patient?\n\nA. Intramural (pre-prostatic)\nB. Membranous\nC. Prostatic\nD. Spongy\n"

Membranous.\n\nInjuries to the male urethra often occur as a result of blunt perineal trauma, which can happen in cases such as motorcycle accidents where the perineum is compressed between the seat and a hard object during impact. The membranous urethra is the most susceptible to injury due to its location and mobility. It is the narrowest part of the urethra and is surrounded by the pelvic diaphragm, which fixes it in place. During a pelvic fracture, the relatively immobile membranous urethra can be disrupted as the pelvic bones move against each other, causing shearing forces on the urethra. This type of injury can lead to a disruption or tear of the urethra, which can manifest as blood at the urethral meatus, difficulty urinating, and pelvic pain."
