Authoritative parents are warm and nurturing, but also set clear expectations and boundaries for their children. They encourage open communication and provide guidance while respecting their child's autonomy. This parenting style has been linked to positive outcomes in children, such as better social skills, self-regulation, and academic performance.\n\nWell-adjusted, socially competent adolescents like Carlotta often come from families with an authoritative parenting style. These parents balance discipline with support, which helps their children develop into confident, responsible, and capable individuals."
