This is because Carens acknowledges that sudden and uncontrolled border openings can cause disruptions and negative consequences for both the migrants and the host society in the short term. However, he argues that gradual and managed migration policies can lead to greater benefits for everyone involved in the long run, including increased economic growth, cultural exchange, and social integration. Therefore, from a liberal egalitarian perspective, the potential harms of open borders should be weighed against their potential long-term benefits. Option A is incorrect because Carens recognizes that there may be some costs to current citizens, although he argues that these can be mitigated through appropriate policy measures. Option B is incorrect because Carens does not reject liberal egalitarianism but rather seeks to reconcile it with the principles of open borders. Option D is also incorrect because only option C accurately reflects Carens' position."
