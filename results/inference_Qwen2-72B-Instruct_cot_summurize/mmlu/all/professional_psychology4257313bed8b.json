The chief investigator (who is a licensed psychologist) stresses to the student the importance of the student\u2019s data to the study, but he insists that his data be withdrawn. The investigator should:\n\nA. warn the student that withdrawal from the study will affect his course grade.\nB. remind the student that he signed an informed consent and cannot now request that his data be withdrawn.\nC. tell the student that his name will be removed from all data and include his data in the study.\nD. allow the student to withdraw from the study.\n"

Participants have the right to withdraw from a study at any time without penalty or loss of benefits to which they are otherwise entitled. This includes the right to request that their data not be used in the analysis. Therefore, the investigator should honor the student's request to withdraw and remove his data from the study."
