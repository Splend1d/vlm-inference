Towards the consumer\n\nVertical integration forward occurs when a company integrates itself closer to the end-user or consumer by acquiring or merging with companies that are further down the supply chain. This can include distributors, retailers, or even the end-user in some cases. The purpose of this strategy is often to gain more control over the distribution process, reduce costs, ensure consistent supply, and potentially increase profits by capturing more of the value chain."
