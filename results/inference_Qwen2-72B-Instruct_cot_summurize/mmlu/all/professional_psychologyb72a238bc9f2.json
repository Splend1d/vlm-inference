A cohort effect refers to differences between groups that result from the groups having grown up during different time periods and being exposed to different experiences or environmental factors. In this case, the difference in computer experience between older and younger participants is likely due to the fact that they grew up in different eras with varying levels of access to and familiarity with computers."
