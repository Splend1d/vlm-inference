He argued that society is characterized by a conflict between those who have power (the rulers) and those who do not (the ruled). J\u00fcrgen Habermas, a German philosopher and sociologist, developed the concept of communicative action and critical theory, which focuses on the potential for emancipation from oppressive structures of power. While Habermas's work is more nuanced than Dahrendorf's, both theorists have contributed significantly to the understanding of power dynamics in society.\n\nAlthough Habermas did engage with themes of social solidarity and cohesion through his concept of the public sphere and communicative rationality, the primary focus of Dahrendorf and Habermas's work is on power, domination, and conflict."
