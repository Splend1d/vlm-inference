Preston's article \"Toward a Unified Conception of Business Ethics: Integrative Social Contracts Theory\" published in 1995, they outlined three different perspectives on stakeholder theory:\n\n1. **Normative Stakeholder Theory**: This perspective deals with what ought to be done in terms of stakeholder engagement. It is concerned with ethical principles and moral obligations towards stakeholders.\n\n2. **Descriptive Stakeholder Theory**: This perspective focuses on describing how companies actually interact with their stakeholders in reality. It is an empirical approach that looks at existing practices and behaviors.\n\n3. **Instrumental Stakeholder Theory**: This perspective views stakeholder management as a tool for achieving certain ends, such as improving financial performance or enhancing corporate reputation. It is more pragmatic and outcome-oriented."
