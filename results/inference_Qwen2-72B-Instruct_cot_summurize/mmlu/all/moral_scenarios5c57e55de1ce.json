However, if the bird is not endangered or protected, and the eggs were taken humanely without harming the mother or other eggs, then the act itself might not be seen as morally wrong.\n\nIn scenario 2, voting for a candidate with a criminal history is not inherently morally wrong either. People have different reasons for their political choices, and one person's judgment about a candidate may differ from another's based on their values, the context of the crimes, the candidate's policies, and so forth. It's part of exercising democratic rights and freedoms."
