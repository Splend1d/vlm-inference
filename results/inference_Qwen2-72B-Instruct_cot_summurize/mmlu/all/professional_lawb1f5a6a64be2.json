The boy was mostly a benchwarmer who played only an inning or two during the game. One night, the father hid behind some shrubbery in front of the coach's home. Armed with a baseball bat, the father intended to break the coach's kneecaps when he came home from work. A man, who resembled the coach, was walking down the street. The father mistakenly believed that this man was the coach. The father jumped out of the bushes and hit the man in the kneecaps with the baseball bat. The man, who was a hemophiliac, died as a result of the injuries suffered in the beating. The father is\n\nA. guilty of attempted murder of the coach and the murder of the man.\nB. guilty of attempted murder of both the coach and the man.\nC. guilty of attempted manslaughter of the coach and murder of the man.\nD. guilty of attempted battery of the coach and murder of the man.\n"

However, due to a mistake of fact, he ended up assaulting and inadvertently killing another individual who was not the coach. The death of the man, who was a hemophiliac and died as a result of the beating, would constitute murder since the father's actions were reckless and resulted in the man's death, even though the father did not intend to kill the man. The father's actions also meet the criteria for an attempted battery of the coach, as he intended to commit this act but was mistaken about the identity of his target."
