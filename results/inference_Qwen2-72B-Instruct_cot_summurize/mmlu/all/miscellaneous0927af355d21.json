Reservoir\n\nBoth types of systems require a reservoir to store the working fluid (air in pneumatic systems and oil in hydraulic systems) when it's not being used and to allow for expansion or contraction of the fluid. \n\nA. Exhaust - This is typically associated with pneumatic systems where air needs to be expelled after use.\nC. Compressor - This is specific to pneumatic systems as it's used to compress air.\nD. Control valve - Although control valves can be found in both systems, the question asks for a component that is \"present\" in both, and the reservoir is the only option that is essential and present in both pneumatic and hydraulic systems. Control valves may vary greatly between the two systems due to the different properties of air and oil."
