The rate of increase in the median age of populations is greater in developing countries than wealthy countries.\n\nLet's clarify why the other options are incorrect:\n\nA. It is an exaggeration. While the proportion of people aged 65 years and over is increasing globally, it is not expected to reach over 25% of the world's population by 2040. According to the United Nations, it is projected to be around 16% by 2050.\n\nC. This statement is generally false. In older age groups, women tend to outnumber men due to differences in life expectancy. Women typically live longer than men, so there are more women than men in the oldest age groups.\n\nD. This statement is false. Women generally have a lower mortality rate than men over the life course. On average, women live longer than men, which implies that they have a lower mortality rate."
