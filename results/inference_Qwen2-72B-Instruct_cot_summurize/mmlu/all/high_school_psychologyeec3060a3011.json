So if Jonathan's IQ score is in the 97th percentile, it means his score is higher than 97% of other scores.\n\nIQ scores are typically distributed around a mean of 100 with a standard deviation of 15. This distribution follows a normal curve, also known as a bell curve. The 97th percentile would be quite far above the mean, since only 3% of scores are higher than this point.\n\nUsing the empirical rule (also known as the 68-95-99.7 rule), we can estimate that:\n\n- About 68% of scores fall within one standard deviation of the mean (between 85 and 115).\n- About 95% of scores fall within two standard deviations of the mean (between 70 and 130).\n- About 99.7% of scores fall within three standard deviations of the mean (between 55 and 145).\n\nGiven these guidelines, the score that falls closest to the 97th percentile would be 130, which is just above two standard deviations from the mean.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\nC. 130"
