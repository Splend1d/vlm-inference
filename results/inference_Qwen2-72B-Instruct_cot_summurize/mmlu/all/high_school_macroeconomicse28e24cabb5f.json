This, in turn, can lead to increased economic output and potentially higher rates of growth. Additionally, focusing on investment rather than consumption can lead to higher savings rates, which can provide more funds for businesses to borrow and invest, further stimulating economic growth.\n\nOption A, higher tariffs on imported goods, might protect domestic industries from foreign competition but can also result in higher prices for consumers and retaliatory tariffs from other countries, which could harm U.S. exports and overall economic activity.\n\nOption C, eliminating mandatory school attendance laws, would likely have a negative impact on economic growth. Education is crucial for developing a skilled workforce that can drive innovation and productivity, which are key drivers of economic growth.\n\nOption D, annual limits on immigration, could restrict the availability of labor, particularly in sectors that rely heavily on immigrant workers. Limiting immigration could reduce the size of the workforce and potentially slow economic growth, especially if the demand for labor outstrips the supply of native-born workers.\n\nIt's important to note that economic growth is complex and influenced by many factors, and policy decisions often have unintended consequences. The effectiveness of any policy will depend on various economic conditions and other policy measures in place."
