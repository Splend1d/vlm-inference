Upon entering the apartment, he violently assaulted her. Although she tried to resist, he overpowered and raped her. The man testified that during dinner, he and the victim drank two bottles of Champagne. When they returned to his apartment, he was so intoxicated that he honestly believed that she consented to the intercourse. The jury determined that the victim did not consent to the intercourse. The jury also found that the man, as a result of his intoxication, honestly but unreasonably believed that she was consenting. As a consequence, the defendant should be found\n\nA. not guilty, because he honestly believed that the victim consented.\nB. not guilty, because his intoxication negated his criminal intent.\nC. guilty, because rape is a general intent crime.\nD. guilty, because she did not consent, and his belief that she was consenting was unreasonable.\n"

The key element in determining guilt in cases of sexual assault or rape is whether the act was consensual. If the victim did not consent, then the act is considered non-consensual, regardless of the perpetrator's belief.\n\nIn this case, the jury found that the victim did not consent to the intercourse. The man's claim of intoxication leading to an honest but unreasonable belief that she was consenting does not absolve him of responsibility. His belief must be both honest and reasonable for it to potentially negate the lack of consent element. Since the jury found his belief to be unreasonable, this defense fails, and he should be found guilty of rape."
