Increased ketogenesis\n\nInsulin deficiency, as seen in type 1 diabetes mellitus, leads to increased ketogenesis due to the lack of insulin's inhibitory effect on fat metabolism. When insulin levels are low, lipolysis (the breakdown of stored fats) increases, releasing free fatty acids into the bloodstream. These fatty acids are then converted into ketone bodies by the liver, leading to a state known as ketosis or, in severe cases, ketoacidosis. This occurs because the body starts using fat as an alternative energy source when glucose utilization is impaired due to the lack of insulin."
