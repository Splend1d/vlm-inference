                    "text": "Daylight Corp. manufactured, assembled, and marketed a steel cutting press designed to cut aluminum sheets into can covers. In 2002, Goodboy Beverages purchased Daylight's deluxe cutting press model for $20,000. In 2002 and 2003, Daylight received a few complaints that other cutting press customers had experienced hazardous malfunctions. In response, Daylight created a safety device and offered it for $5,000 in a brochure sent to all their customers that mentioned that a few users had been injured in using the cutting press model. Goodboy received the brochure, but did not buy a $5,000 safety device. In 2004, a Goodboy worker was injured by the press. At trial, Daylight argued that if Goodboy had purchased the safety device the injury would not have occurred, and moved for a directed verdict. The court should\n\nA. Grant Daystar's motion, because Goodboy's refusal to purchase the safety device was an effective assumption of risk.\nB. Deny the motion, because Goodboy's negligence in failing to purchase the safety device was less than Daylight's negligence in manufacturing the unsafe press initially.\nC. Deny the motion, because a jury could find that Daylight could reasonably foresee that Goodboy would be unwilling to pay $5,000 for a safety device.\nD. Deny the motion, because since the press was inherently dangerous, Daylight was strictly liable.\n"

Deny the motion, because a jury could find that Daylight could reasonably foresee that Goodboy would be unwilling to pay $5,000 for a safety device.\n\nIn this scenario, Daylight Corp. had knowledge of potential hazards associated with its cutting press, as evidenced by customer complaints and subsequent injuries. They took steps to address these issues by creating a safety device and offering it to customers at a cost of $5,000. However, the fact that they offered the safety device does not necessarily absolve them of liability, especially if the cost of the device was prohibitive enough to deter customers from purchasing it.\n\nGoodboy Beverages' decision not to purchase the safety device could be seen as an assumption of risk, but Daylight's argument for a directed verdict based on this assumption would likely fail if a reasonable jury could find that Daylight could have foreseen that customers might not purchase the safety device due to its cost. This would mean that Daylight had a duty to ensure the safety of its product and could be held liable for any foreseeable harm resulting from its failure to do so adequately.\n\nOption A is incorrect because assumption of risk requires a clear understanding and acceptance of the risk involved, which may not have been clearly communicated or understood by Goodboy. Option B involves a comparative negligence analysis that cannot be conclusively determined without further evidence regarding the extent of negligence on both sides. Option D is incorrect because strict liability applies to inherently dangerous products, but the existence of a safety device suggests that the danger was not inherent and could be mitigated, thus negating strict liability."
