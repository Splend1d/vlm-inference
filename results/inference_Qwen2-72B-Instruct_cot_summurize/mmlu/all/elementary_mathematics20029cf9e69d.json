A sphere has no vertices and can roll, and while it doesn't have \"faces\" in the traditional sense that a polyhedron would, it could be argued to have two \"faces\" if you consider its two hemispheres as such. However, it's important to note that in geometry, a sphere is typically described as having 1 surface (not face) and 0 vertices or edges. The concept of \"two faces\" in this riddle is more poetic than mathematically precise."
