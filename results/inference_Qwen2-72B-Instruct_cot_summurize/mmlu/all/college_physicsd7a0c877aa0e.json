In water, with an index of refraction of \\(4/3\\), the speed of light is thus:\n\n\\[v_{light\\_in\\_water} = \\frac{c}{4/3} = \\frac{3c}{4}\\]\n\nThis is the speed of light in water relative to the water itself. However, we're asked for the speed of light in water relative to the lab frame.\n\nTo find this, we need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula, since the speeds involved are a significant fraction of the speed of light. The formula is:\n\n\\[v_{total} = \\frac{v_1 + v_2}{1 + \\frac{v_1v_2}{c^2}}\\]\n\nwhere \\(v_1\\) is the speed of light in water relative to the water (\\(3c/4\\)) and \\(v_2\\) is the speed of the water relative to the lab frame (\\(c/2\\)).\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula gives:\n\n\\[v_{total} = \\frac{\\frac{3c}{4} + \\frac{c}{2}}{1 + \\frac{\\frac{3c}{4} \\cdot \\frac{c}{2}}{c^2}} = \\frac{\\frac{3c}{4} + \\frac{2c}{4}}{1 + \\frac{3c^2}{8c^2}} = \\frac{\\frac{5c}{4}}{1 + \\frac{3}{8}} = \\frac{\\frac{5c}{4}}{\\frac{11}{8}} = \\frac{5c \\cdot 8}{4 \\cdot 11} = \\frac{10c}{11}\\]\n\nThus, the speed of light in the water relative to the lab frame is \\(10c/11\\).\n\nThe answer is D. 10/11 c."
