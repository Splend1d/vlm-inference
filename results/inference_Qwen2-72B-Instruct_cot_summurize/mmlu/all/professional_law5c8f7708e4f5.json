Over the course of time, the land development company developed two residential subdivisions of the land, an eastern development and a western development, each of which contained 150 acres. These subdivisions were created by separate plats that made no reference to each other. The restrictions in the plats were, however, substantially identical. The plats and each deed provided that \"the use of the land herein conveyed is restricted to single- family dwellings only, and this covenant is intended to apply to each and every lot in the subdivision and runs with the land, binding every lot owner, his heirs, and assigns. \"After all but four lots in each subdivision had been sold by the land development company, it sold 50 acres of the remaining 100 acres of land to a country club by a deed containing the following provisions:\"This deed is executed and accepted with the understanding that the property above described is hereby restricted so that(1) said property may be used as a country club, with a golf course, pool, tennis courts, club house, eating facilities, and other improvements appropriate to a country club. (2) said property may also be subdivided and platted as a residential subdivision similar to the eastern development and the property shall thereafter be used in accordance with and conveyed subject to residential restrictions that shall conform with those restrictions in force against the eastern development. (3) the restrictions herein contained shall be deemed covenants running with the land, and for breach of any covenant herein, grantor \u0080\u0094 land development company, its successors and assigns may, at its option, re-enter and terminate the estate conveyed hereby. \"At the time of this conveyance, the land development company retained title to the remaining 50 acres in the original 400-acre tract. Which of the following would best describe the country club's interest in the SO-acre tract that it purchased from the land development company?\n\nA. Fee simple determinable.\nB. Fee simple subject to condition subsequent.\nC. Determinable fee subject to an executory interest.\nD. Easement appurtenant.\n"

Fee simple subject to condition subsequent**.\n\nA fee simple subject to condition subsequent is an estate in land that remains in full force until there is a violation of a condition set forth in the deed. In this case, the deed contains specific restrictions on how the property may be used (as a country club or residential subdivision under certain conditions) and provides that the land development company, its successors and assigns, may re-enter and terminate the estate if there is a breach of any covenant. This right of re-entry is characteristic of a fee simple subject to condition subsequent, where the grantor retains a power to terminate the estate upon the occurrence of a specified event.\n\nThe other options do not fit the description given:\n\n- A fee simple determinable would automatically end upon the happening of a certain event, without the need for the grantor to take any action to terminate the estate. This is not the case here, as the deed requires the grantor to take action to re-enter and terminate the estate.\n- A determinable fee subject to an executory interest would involve the automatic transfer of the estate to a third party upon the occurrence of a specified event, which is not described in the deed.\n- An easement appurtenant is a right to use the land of another for a specific purpose, which is not relevant to the ownership interest described in the deed."
