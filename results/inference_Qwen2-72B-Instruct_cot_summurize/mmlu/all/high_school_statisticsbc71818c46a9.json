However, since it costs $2.00 to play the game, your net gain in this scenario would be \\(20 - 2 = 18\\).\n\nThe probability of any other outcome is \\(1 - \\frac{1}{36} = \\frac{35}{36}\\). In these cases, you lose the game and the cost of playing ($2), so your net gain in this scenario is \\(-2\\).\n\nThus, the expected value (EV) of playing the game is:\n\\[ EV = \\left(\\frac{1}{36} \\times 18\\right) + \\left(\\frac{35}{36} \\times -2\\right) \\]\n\n\\[ EV = \\left(\\frac{18}{36}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{70}{36}\\right) \\]\n\n\\[ EV = \\frac{18 - 70}{36} \\]\n\n\\[ EV = \\frac{-52}{36} \\]\n\n\\[ EV = -\\frac{13}{9} \\approx -1.44 \\]\n\nSo, the expected gain or loss per game is approximately \\(-\\$1.44\\), which means the player will lose about $1.44 per game on average.\n\nThe correct answer is D. The player will lose about $1.44."
