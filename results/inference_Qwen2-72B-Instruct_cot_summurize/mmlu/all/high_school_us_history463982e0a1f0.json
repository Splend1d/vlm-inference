The First Great Awakening\n\nPhillis Wheatley's poem reflects the religious themes and the emphasis on personal salvation and divine grace that were central to the First Great Awakening, a religious revival movement that swept through the American colonies in the mid-18th century. The poem expresses her gratitude for being introduced to Christianity and her belief in the potential for spiritual transformation and redemption, even for those who were previously \"benighted\" or in darkness. This sentiment aligns with the ideas promoted during the Great Awakening, which stressed individual conversion and the possibility of salvation for all, regardless of social status or background."
