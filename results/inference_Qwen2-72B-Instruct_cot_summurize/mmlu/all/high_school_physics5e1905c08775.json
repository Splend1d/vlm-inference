I and II only.\n\nFor an object to be in static equilibrium, the vector sum of all forces acting on it must be zero (this is Newton's first law of motion for translational equilibrium), and the vector sum of all torques about any point must also be zero (this is rotational equilibrium). The sum of an object's potential and kinetic energies being zero has no direct bearing on whether the object is in static equilibrium or not. Therefore, condition III is not necessary for static equilibrium."
