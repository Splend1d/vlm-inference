You should only disclose the patient's diagnosis with his explicit consent or if required by law. In this case, there is no indication that disclosure is required by law, so you should respect the patient's wishes and keep his diagnosis confidential. However, you may want to discuss the potential consequences of his legal situation with him and encourage him to seek legal advice."
