However, the question seems to be asking for the amount that would be recognized if it were to be reported in the income statement, which is not standard accounting practice for available-for-sale securities under U.S. GAAP.\n\nGiven the cost basis of $24,000 and the fair value of $30,000, there is an unrealized gain of $6,000 ($30,000 - $24,000). This gain is not taxed as it is not realized, so the full amount of the gain would be reported. Under normal circumstances, this gain would be reported in OCI, not the income statement. But since the question asks for what amount would be recognized in the income statement, assuming an unusual scenario where it is reported there, the answer would be the full gain amount of $6,000."
