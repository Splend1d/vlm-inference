According to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 48, \"Trials in civil actions shall be conducted with a jury consisting of 6 or more persons.\" In this case, after one of the original jurors became ill and was excused after the alternates had already been seated, the parties agreed to proceed with a five-person jury. However, such a stipulation does not override the requirement for a minimum of six jurors. Therefore, the court should grant the motion for a new trial based on the insufficient number of jurors."
