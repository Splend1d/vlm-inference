These include ensuring that bartering is not clinically contraindicated, the arrangement is not exploitative, and informed consent is obtained. Additionally, the value of the services or goods exchanged should be reasonable and comparable to the fee for the psychological services. However, the acceptability of bartering may also depend on local laws and regulations, as well as professional guidelines specific to a psychologist's location and practice setting."
