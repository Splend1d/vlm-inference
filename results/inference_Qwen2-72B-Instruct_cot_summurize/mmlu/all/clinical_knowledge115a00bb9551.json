Muscle ATP and phosphocreatine content.\n\nWhile muscle ATP and phosphocreatine are important for short bursts of high-intensity exercise, they are not as critical for success in endurance events like the marathon. Endurance events rely more heavily on the aerobic energy system, which uses carbohydrates, fats, and proteins as fuel sources over a longer period of time. The other options listed (body temperature regulation, oxygen supply to muscles, and carbohydrate stores) are crucial for maintaining performance during endurance activities."
