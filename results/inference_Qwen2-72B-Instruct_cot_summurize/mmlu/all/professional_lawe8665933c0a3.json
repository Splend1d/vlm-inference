The head of the department has promulgated the following hiring rule: \"Because the rich are the source of all problems of society and cannot understand the plight of the poor, anyone who has a net worth over $10,000.00 is ineligible for employment with this department.\" Immediately, 25 employees in the department are fired due to their net worth above the designated level. They sue the state. Which of the following is the correct analysis and conclusion?\n\nA. The action is arbitrary and capricious, so it is unconstitutional under the strict scrutiny standard.\nB. The action is not deemed done by a state actor because wealth redistribution is not an essential government function.\nC. The right to public employment is a protected property interest and the employees would likely prevail because of lack of procedural due process.\nD. Wealth is a quasi-suspect class, so the rule must promulgate an important governmental purpose. Eliminating poverty is important, so the rule meets this level of scrutiny.\n"

The right to public employment is a protected property interest and the employees would likely prevail because of lack of procedural due process.\n\nExplanation:\nA. Strict scrutiny is applied to laws that discriminate based on suspect classifications such as race or national origin. Wealth is not considered a suspect classification, so strict scrutiny would not apply.\nB. This answer is incorrect because the action was taken by a state agency, which is considered a state actor.\nD. While wealth could be considered a quasi-suspect classification, the rule must still meet intermediate scrutiny, which requires that the rule be substantially related to an important governmental objective. It's debatable whether the rule is substantially related to eliminating poverty, but even if it were, the employees' lack of procedural due process would likely prevail in court.\nC. The employees have a protected property interest in their employment with the state, and they did not receive proper notice or an opportunity to be heard before being terminated. Therefore, they would likely prevail on a claim of lack of procedural due process."
