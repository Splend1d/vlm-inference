An integer $n$ is said to be congruent to $5 \\pmod{13}$ if $n = 13k + 5$ for some integer $k$. \n\nLet's start by finding the smallest and largest numbers in our range that satisfy this condition.\n\n### Finding the smallest number:\n\nFor $n = -200$, we need to find the smallest value of $k$ such that $13k + 5 \\geq -200$. We can rearrange this inequality to solve for $k$:\n\\[13k \\geq -205\\]\n\\[k \\geq \\frac{-205}{13}\\]\n\nThe smallest integer $k$ that satisfies this inequality is $k = \\lceil\\frac{-205}{13}\\rceil = -16$. Thus, the smallest number in our range that is congruent to $5 \\pmod{13}$ is $13(-16) + 5 = -203$.\n\n### Finding the largest number:\n\nSimilarly, for $n = 200$, we need to find the largest value of $k$ such that $13k + 5 \\leq 200$. Solving this inequality for $k$ gives us:\n\\[13k \\leq 195\\]\n\\[k \\leq \\frac{195}{13}\\]\n\nThe largest integer $k$ that satisfies this inequality is $k = \\lfloor\\frac{195}{13}\\rfloor = 15$. Thus, the largest number in our range that is congruent to $5 \\pmod{13}$ is $13(15) + 5 = 200$.\n\n### Counting the numbers:\n\nWe've found that the sequence of numbers that are congruent to $5 \\pmod{13}$ within our range starts at $-203$ and ends at $200$. To count these numbers, we notice that they form an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of $13$.\n\nGiven the formula for the $n$th term of an arithmetic sequence, $a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d$, where $a_1$ is the first term, $d$ is the common difference, and $a_n$ is the $n$th term, we can set up the equation $-203 + 13(n-1) = 200$ and solve for $n$.\n\nSimplifying this equation gives us:\n\\[-203 + 13n - 13 = 200\\]\n\\[13n = 416\\]\n\\[n = 32\\]\n\nThus, there are $\\boxed{\\textbf{B. } 31}$ integers between $-200$ and $200$ (inclusive) that are congruent to $5 \\pmod{13}$. Note that the answer is 31 because we're counting the numbers themselves, not the intervals between them, so the range from $-203$ to $200$ includes both endpoints, giving us a total of 31 numbers."
