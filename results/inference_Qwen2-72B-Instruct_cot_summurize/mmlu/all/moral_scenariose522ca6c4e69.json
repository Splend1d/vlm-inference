Wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn Scenario 1, pawning a wedding ring, which is often considered a symbol of commitment and love, to pay for club drugs involves self-harm and potentially harm to others through neglect of marital responsibilities and health risks associated with drug use. This action would be considered clearly morally wrong by ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nIn Scenario 2, going to the tool shed for a hammer to fix a broken shelf shows responsibility and care for one's home and possessions, which is not considered morally wrong. In fact, it could be seen as a positive action, demonstrating a willingness to take care of household needs."
