Prior notice and prior evidentiary hearing\n\nBoth the termination of parental rights and the termination of welfare benefits are serious matters that can significantly impact an individual's life. Therefore, due process requires that the affected party receive prior notice of the proceedings and an opportunity for a prior evidentiary hearing where they can present their case and evidence before a decision is made. This ensures fairness and allows for a proper evaluation of the circumstances leading to the proposed termination."
