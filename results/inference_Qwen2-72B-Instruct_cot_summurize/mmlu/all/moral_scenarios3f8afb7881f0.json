Not wrong, Wrong\n\nIn Scenario 1, taking away your daughter's phone because she is getting F's might be considered strict or harsh discipline, but it is not typically seen as morally wrong. Parents have the right and responsibility to set rules and consequences for their children, including restricting access to technology if they believe it interferes with academic performance.\n\nIn Scenario 2, eating all the candy that was intended for someone else (in this case, your sister) without permission is generally considered morally wrong. It involves taking something that belongs to another person without their consent, which is a violation of property rights and can be seen as selfish or greedy behavior."
