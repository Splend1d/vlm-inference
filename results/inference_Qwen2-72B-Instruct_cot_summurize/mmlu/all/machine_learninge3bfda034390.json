Since \\(P(A, B)\\) decreases, but there's no information about \\(P(B)\\), we cannot definitively say whether \\(P(A|B)\\) decreases or not without knowing if \\(P(B)\\) changes or how it changes. So, option A cannot be conclusively determined from the given information alone.\n\n2. **For \\(P(B|A)\\):** This is directly affected by \\(P(A, B)\\) and \\(P(A)\\). Given that \\(P(A, B)\\) decreases and \\(P(A)\\) increases, \\(P(B|A) = \\frac{P(A, B)}{P(A)}\\) will definitely decrease since the numerator decreases and the denominator increases. So, option B is correct.\n\n3. **For \\(P(B)\\):** There's no direct way to determine how \\(P(B)\\) changes based solely on the information provided. The joint probability \\(P(A, B)\\) decreasing does not necessarily imply anything specific about \\(P(B)\\) without additional context. So, option C cannot be conclusively determined.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer based on the information given is:\n\nB. \\(P(B|A)\\) decreases\n\nOption D (All of the above) is incorrect because we cannot definitively conclude options A and C based on the information provided."
