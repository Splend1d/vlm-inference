Wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn Scenario 1, teaching children to play with matches is clearly morally wrong as it endangers their safety and could lead to serious harm or damage. In Scenario 2, while deleting someone else's photos without their permission might be considered inappropriate or meddling, it is not necessarily morally wrong if the action was taken to protect the sister from potential embarrassment or harm. However, the morality of this action can depend on the context and the sister's wishes regarding her own photos. Without additional context, it's not clear that this action is \"clearly morally wrong\" in the same way that teaching children to play with matches is."
