So, based on the options provided, the correct answer would be:\n\nD. The muscles of mastication, anterior and posterior bellies of digastric and geniohyoid\n\nHowever, it should be noted that the geniohyoid muscle is actually derived from the second pharyngeal arch, not the first. Therefore, if we strictly adhere to the derivatives of the first arch, the most accurate answer would exclude the geniohyoid, making the best choice:\n\nB. The muscles of mastication and anterior belly of digastric\n\nBut since option D includes all the muscles correctly associated with the first arch except for the geniohyoid which is mistakenly included, in the context of the question and options provided, D seems to be the intended correct answer."
