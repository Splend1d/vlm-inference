The employee determined that his boss was not breathing, immediately rendered CPR to his boss, and succeeded in reviving him. The employee then called the paramedics, who took the boss to the hospital. Two week later, the boss returned to work. Grateful for the employee's quick action in saving his life, the boss said to the employee, \"You'll have ajob with me for life. \"Which of the following best characterizes the legal relationship between the boss and the employee on that date?\n\nA. &s per the boss's oral promise, the employee had an enforceable lifetime employment contract.\nB. The boss had a duty to pay the employee reasonable compensation for saving his life, based upon a contract implied-in-fact.\nC. The employee's act of saving the boss's life was sufficient past consideration to render enforceable the boss's subsequent promise.\nD.

Since the employee gratuitously rendered assistance to the boss, there was insufficient consideration to support the boss's subsequent promise to provide the employee with lifetime employment.\n\nThe legal principle of consideration requires that each party to a contract must exchange something of value for the promise made by the other party. In this case, the employee's act of saving the boss's life was a voluntary act of assistance and not given in exchange for any promise of lifetime employment. Therefore, it cannot serve as consideration for the boss's subsequent promise of lifetime employment. Without new consideration from the employee, the boss's promise is not legally binding."
