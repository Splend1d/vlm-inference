The capsid is made up of 240 capsomeres, which are protein subunits that form the outer shell of the virus. The genome of the togavirus is a single-stranded positive-sense RNA molecule. The envelope is derived from the host cell membrane and contains viral glycoproteins that are involved in attachment and entry into host cells."
