The argument consists of two premises: ~G \u2283 H (If not G, then H) and ~H (Not H), and the conclusion is G.\n\nHere's the truth table:\n\n| G  | H  | ~G | ~H | ~G \u2283 H | ~H / G |\n|----|----|----|----|--------|--------|\n| T  | T  | F  | F  |  T     |  T     |\n| T  | F  | F  | T  |  T     |  F     |\n| F  | T  | T  | F  |  T     |  F     |\n| F  | F  | T  | T  |  F     |  F     |\n\nLet's analyze each row:\n1. When G is true and H is true, the first premise ~G \u2283 H is true because if the antecedent (~G) is false, the conditional statement is always true. The second premise ~H is false since H is true. In this case, the conclusion G is true.\n2. When G is true and H is false, the first premise ~G \u2283 H is true for the same reason as above. The second premise ~H is true since H is false. However, the conclusion G is true, which does not contradict the premises in this case.\n3. When G is false and H is true, the first premise ~G \u2283 H is true because the antecedent (~G) is true, and the consequent (H) is also true. The second premise ~H is false since H is true. The conclusion G is false, but it doesn't matter because the premises do not lead us to conclude that G must be true in this scenario.\n4. When G is false and H is false, the first premise ~G \u2283 H is false because the antecedent (~G) is true, but the consequent (H) is false. This means that the first premise is violated, and thus, the argument is invalid. We don't even need to consider the second premise or the conclusion in this case.\n\nSince there is a row where the premises are not all true (row 4), the argument is invalid. However, none of the provided counterexample options match the actual counterexample (when G and H are both false). The closest option is D, which presents a situation where the argument would still be invalid, but it is not the actual counterexample for this specific argument.\n\nAnswer: B. Invalid. None of the provided counterexample options accurately represents the counterexample for this argument, but the argument is indeed invalid."
