Because if someone did not know how to act virtuously, he or she would still be considered virtuous by others who also did not know the principles for good living.\nB. Because since Socrates was a philosopher, he of course thought that people who examined their lives philosophically were more virtuous than those who did not.\nC. Because without knowing the rationale for why one should act in a particular way, one does not know whether actions are justified and ought to be repeated.\nD. Because a virtuous life would be one in which someone does what the rest of the society says is right, and that means examining views other than one's own.\n"

Because without knowing the rationale for why one should act in a particular way, one does not know whether actions are justified and ought to be repeated.\n\nSocrates believed that true virtue comes from understanding and knowledge. An unexamined life lacks this understanding because it does not involve critical self-reflection on one's beliefs, values, and actions. Without such examination, a person cannot determine whether their actions are truly virtuous or simply a product of habit, ignorance, or societal pressure. Only by questioning and justifying one's actions can a person live a life that is genuinely virtuous, as they will be able to discern right from wrong based on reason rather than mere convention or tradition."
