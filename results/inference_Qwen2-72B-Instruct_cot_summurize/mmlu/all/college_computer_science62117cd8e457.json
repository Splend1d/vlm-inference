This allows for more flexibility in storing and accessing data compared to a direct-mapped cache, where each block from main memory can only be stored in one specific location in the cache.\n\nSo the correct answer is:\n\nA. one in which each main memory word can be stored at any of 3 cache locations\n\nHowever, it's important to note that this doesn't mean each individual word can be stored in any of the three locations; rather, each block (which consists of multiple words) can be stored in any of the three locations within a given set."
