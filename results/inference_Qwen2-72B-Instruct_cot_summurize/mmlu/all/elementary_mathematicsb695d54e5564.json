According to the problem, she saw \\(34\\) more birds in the morning than in the afternoon, so the number of birds she saw in the morning is \\(x + 34\\).\n\nThe total number of birds she counted throughout the day is given as \\(76\\), which includes both the morning and afternoon counts. Therefore, we can write an equation to represent this:\n\n\\[x + (x + 34) = 76\\]\n\nSolving for \\(x\\):\n\n\\[2x + 34 = 76\\]\n\nSubtract \\(34\\) from both sides:\n\n\\[2x = 42\\]\n\nDivide by \\(2\\):\n\n\\[x = 21\\]\n\nThus, Keiko counted \\(21\\) birds in the afternoon.\n\nThe correct answer is A. 21 birds."
