This would result in paralysis of the facial muscles. However, because the stylomastoid foramen is distal to the geniculate ganglion where the taste and parasympathetic secretomotor fibers separate from the motor fibers, damage here would not affect taste sensation or the parasympathetic functions that control lacrimation (tear production) and salivation. These functions would be affected by more proximal lesions of the facial nerve, before it branches out."
