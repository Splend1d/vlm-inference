However, this theory is criticized for not sufficiently addressing what it means for individuals to actually have the capability to use their liberties or resources effectively.\n\nThe capability approach, in contrast, emphasizes the importance of people's capabilities\u2014the substantive freedoms they have to lead lives they value. It argues that justice should be evaluated based on people's real opportunities to achieve valuable functionings (states of being and doing). This approach takes into account not just the distribution of resources or formal rights but also the social, economic, and political conditions that enable people to convert those resources into capabilities.\n\nThus, the capability approach critiques Rawls' theory for potentially overlooking how social structures and institutions might prevent certain individuals from effectively utilizing their liberties and resources due to factors like disability, discrimination, or lack of access to education and healthcare. It suggests that a just society must ensure not only fair distribution of resources but also the creation of conditions that allow all individuals to have the genuine freedom to pursue the lives they have reason to value."
