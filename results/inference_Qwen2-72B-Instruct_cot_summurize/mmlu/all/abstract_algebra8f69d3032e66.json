We have \\(159 = 3 \\times 53\\). Since both 3 and 53 are prime numbers, we see that 159 is a product of two distinct primes. According to the Sylow Theorems and the fact that if \\(n = p_1^{a_1}p_2^{a_2}\\ldots p_k^{a_k}\\) where \\(p_i\\) are distinct primes and \\(a_i\\) are positive integers, then any group of order \\(n\\) is cyclic if for every divisor \\(d\\) of \\(n\\), the equation \\(x^d = e\\) (where \\(e\\) is the identity element) has at most \\(d\\) solutions in the group.\n\nFor a group \\(G\\) of order 159, since 159 has no divisors other than 1, 3, 53, and itself, and given that the equation \\(x^d = e\\) can have at most \\(d\\) solutions by Lagrange's theorem, it follows that \\(G\\) must be cyclic. This is because there exists a unique Sylow 3-subgroup and a unique Sylow 53-subgroup due to the specific conditions on the indices of these subgroups (which must divide the order of the group and also satisfy certain congruence conditions). These unique subgroups generate the entire group, making \\(G\\) cyclic.\n\n**Conclusion for Statement 1:** True\n\n### Statement 2: Every group of order 102 has a nontrivial proper normal subgroup.\n\nThe order of the group is 102, which factors as \\(102 = 2 \\times 3 \\times 17\\). A group of order 102 will have Sylow \\(p\\)-subgroups for \\(p = 2, 3,\\) and \\(17\\).\n\n- For \\(p = 17\\), by Sylow's third theorem, the number of Sylow 17-subgroups, \\(n_{17}\\), satisfies:\n    - \\(n_{17}\\) divides 6 (since \\(102/17 = 6\\))\n    - \\(n_{17} \\equiv 1 \\mod 17\\)\n\nGiven these constraints, \\(n_{17}\\) can only be 1. This means there is a unique (and thus normal) Sylow 17-subgroup.\n\nThus, every group of order 102 does indeed have a nontrivial proper normal subgroup, specifically a Sylow 17-subgroup.\n\n**Conclusion for Statement 2:** True\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **A. True, True**."
