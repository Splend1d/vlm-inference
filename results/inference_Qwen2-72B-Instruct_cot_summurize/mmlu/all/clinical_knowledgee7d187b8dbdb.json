A positive Babinski reflex indicates an upper motor neuron lesion and involves dorsiflexion of the big toe and fanning out of the other toes.\nB. An extensor plantar response (positive Babinski sign) indicates an upper motor neuron lesion, not a lower motor neuron lesion.\nC. The ankle reflex (achilles reflex) has a root value of S1, which is correct.\nD. The knee reflex (patellar reflex) has a root value of L2-L4, not just L1 and L2.\n\nTherefore, the only true statement among the options given is that the root value of the ankle reflex is S1."
