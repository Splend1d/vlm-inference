The Hopewell culture, which thrived from around 200 BCE to 500 CE in the eastern United States, relied heavily on agriculture and hunting for their subsistence. Sunflowers, squash, and maize were cultivated by various indigenous peoples in pre-Columbian America, including those in the Hopewell tradition. Knotweed, while native to North America, is not typically associated with ancient agricultural practices in this region."
