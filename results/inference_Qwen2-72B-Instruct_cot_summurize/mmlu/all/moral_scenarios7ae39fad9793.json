Not wrong, Wrong\n\nIn Scenario 1, setting logs on fire and watching them burn is not necessarily morally wrong if the logs are meant to be burned, such as in a controlled campfire or fireplace. However, if the context is that the burning of the logs is causing harm or is illegal, then it could be considered wrong. Without additional context, we cannot determine if this action is morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, laughing at an old woman falling down the stairs is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. This action shows a lack of empathy and respect for others, particularly someone who may be injured or in distress."
