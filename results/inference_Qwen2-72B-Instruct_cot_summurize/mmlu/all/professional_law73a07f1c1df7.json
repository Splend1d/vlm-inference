The tenant was later robbed and beaten by an intruder. She sued the landlord for negligence in causing her injuries. The landlord relied on an exculpatory clause in the lease. The clause, set in fine print on the reverse side of the multi-paged, mass-printed, form lease, was a comprehensive, legalistic waiver in which the tenant gave up virtually all of her rights and remedies against the landlord. She responded that the clause was unconscionable and should not be enforced. What will the court most likely rule with respect to the exculpatory clause?\n\nA. This is not a contract for the sale of goods \u0080\u0093 unconscionability is not available with respect to an agreement not covered by the UCC.\nB. The exculpatory clause must be enforced because the tenant voluntarily signed the lease and agreed to its terms instead of choosing another place to live.\nC. The clause is unenforceable because it discriminates against women who are unable to provide their own security.\nD. The clause is unenforceable because the tenant was burdened by a lack of bargaining power and the provision was obscure and oppressive.\n"

The clause is unenforceable because the tenant was burdened by a lack of bargaining power and the provision was obscure and oppressive.\n\nCourts generally do not enforce exculpatory clauses that are found to be unconscionable. Unconscionability can be present when there is an imbalance of bargaining power between the parties and the terms of the contract are overly one-sided or oppressive. In this case, the clause was buried in fine print on the reverse side of a multi-paged, mass-printed, form lease, indicating that it may have been obscure and not adequately brought to the tenant's attention. Additionally, the tenant's lack of bargaining power, as she had no real choice but to agree to the terms if she wanted to rent the property, further supports a finding of unconscionability."
