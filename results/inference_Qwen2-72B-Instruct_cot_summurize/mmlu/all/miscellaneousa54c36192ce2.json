Last year, the total amount of tobacco sold by American tobacco farmers increased significantly, but the number of smokers in the country continued to decline. If the following are true, they can be the reason for the above phenomenon, except:\n\nA. More women start smoking this year than men who have quit.\nB. People who continue to smoke consume more tobacco than in previous years.\nC. The number of people who started smoking grass or taking snuff this year is more than the number who have given up smoking.\nD. More cigarettes produced in the U.S. are exported to other countries this year than last year.\n"

More women start smoking this year than men who have quit.\n\nThis statement implies that there is an overall increase in the number of new smokers, which contradicts the information that the number of smokers in the country continues to decline. Therefore, option A cannot be a reason for the increase in tobacco sales. The other options (B, C, and D) can all contribute to an increase in tobacco sales even if the number of smokers is declining."
