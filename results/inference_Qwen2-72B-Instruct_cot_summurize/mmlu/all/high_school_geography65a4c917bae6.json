This curve is often used to describe phenomena that have limits or carrying capacities.\n\nOf the options given, the statement that best describes an application of the S-curve is:\n\nD. A model showing the decrease in population growth for several countries after they industrialize\n\nThis is because the S-curve can be used to model population growth, particularly in scenarios where growth slows down due to factors such as resource limitations, disease, or behavioral changes (such as family planning). In the context of industrialization, as countries develop economically, they often experience demographic transitions that lead to lower birth rates and eventually slower population growth, which can be depicted by an S-curve."
