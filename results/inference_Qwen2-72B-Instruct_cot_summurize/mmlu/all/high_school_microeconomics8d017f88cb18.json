                    "text": "The use of more pesticides by apple growers would likely lead to an increase in apple production, shifting the supply curve to the right. This shift would put downward pressure on the price of apples, all else being equal. However, if the price of pears (a substitute for apples) is rising, this could lead consumers to switch from pears to apples, increasing the demand for apples and shifting the demand curve to the right. This increase in demand would put upward pressure on the price of apples.\n\nGiven these two opposing forces \u2013 an increase in supply putting downward pressure on price and an increase in demand putting upward pressure on price \u2013 it's not clear which force will dominate. Therefore, the new price of apples is ambiguous.\n\nHowever, since both an increase in supply and an increase in demand tend to increase quantity, it is reasonable to predict that the new quantity of apples sold will rise.\n\nSo the correct answer is:\n\nC. Price is ambiguous, but quantity rises."
