National income includes income earned by the factors of production, which can be thought of as wages for labor, profits for entrepreneurship, rent for land, and interest for capital. It also includes GDP minus depreciation and indirect business taxes. Therefore, options B, C, and D are all correct, making D the best answer. However, it's important to note that national income does not necessarily measure household income in the nation, so option A is incorrect."
