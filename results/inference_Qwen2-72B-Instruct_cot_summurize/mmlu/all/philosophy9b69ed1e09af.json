The moral law, for Kant, is expressed in the categorical imperative, which requires that we act only according to maxims that could be willed to become universal laws. However, it is important to note that Kant does consider the moral character of the agent (A) as it relates to their ability to act from duty, but he does not base the moral worth of an action primarily on the consequences (B) of the action. Therefore, the most accurate answer based on Kant's philosophy would be C, though elements of A are also relevant in understanding Kant's view on morality."
