Historical materialism as a paradigm is opposed to the broad goals of the global justice movement, which advocates an expansion of neo-liberalism in the aftermath of the global financial crisis.\nB. Historical materialism has an established history of supporting global justice and opposing inequality; during the Cold War it was the basis of opposition to repressive communist states.\nC. Historical materialism does not provide any unique perspective on capitalism, and is more concerned with the history of capitalist trade than with exploitation or alienation of populations in the system.\nD. Historical materialism can concern both human rights and economic rights. It has been an important part of anti-globalisation and alternative-globalisation movements, including the Occupy protests.\n"

It has been an important part of anti-globalisation and alternative-globalisation movements, including the Occupy protests.\n\nHistorical materialism, a theory associated with Karl Marx, views the history of societies through the lens of their material conditions and economic structures. It posits that the mode of production of material life determines the social, political, and intellectual life processes in general. This theory has often been used to critique the inequalities and injustices inherent in capitalist systems.\n\nThe global justice movement, also known as the alter-globalization movement, seeks to address the negative impacts of globalization, particularly those resulting from neoliberal policies that have exacerbated economic disparities and undermined workers' rights and environmental protections. The movement aims to promote a more equitable distribution of resources and power on a global scale.\n\nGiven these objectives, historical materialism aligns with the global justice movement by providing a framework for understanding how capitalist economic systems contribute to global inequality and exploitation. It supports calls for systemic change to address these issues, making it a significant influence on various social and political movements advocating for global justice, including the Occupy protests."
