Let's consider each case:\n\n1. **Both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are positive:**\n\n   - For \\(a\\), it must be in the range where it is positive. Given \\(a\\) can range from \\(-3\\) to \\(1\\), the positive range for \\(a\\) is from \\(0\\) to \\(1\\). This gives us a length of \\(1 - 0 = 1\\) on the number line.\n   \n   - For \\(b\\), it must also be positive. Given \\(b\\) can range from \\(-2\\) to \\(4\\), the positive range for \\(b\\) is from \\(0\\) to \\(4\\). This gives us a length of \\(4 - 0 = 4\\) on the number line.\n\n2. **Both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are negative:**\n\n   - For \\(a\\), it must be in the range where it is negative. Given \\(a\\) can range from \\(-3\\) to \\(1\\), the negative range for \\(a\\) is from \\(-3\\) to \\(0\\). This gives us a length of \\(0 - (-3) = 3\\) on the number line.\n   \n   - For \\(b\\), it must also be negative. Given \\(b\\) can range from \\(-2\\) to \\(4\\), the negative range for \\(b\\) is from \\(-2\\) to \\(0\\). This gives us a length of \\(0 - (-2) = 2\\) on the number line.\n\nNow, let's calculate the area (in a geometric sense) that represents the conditions under which \\(ab\\) is positive:\n\n- The area representing both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) being positive is \\(1 \\times 4 = 4\\).\n- The area representing both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) being negative is \\(3 \\times 2 = 6\\).\n\nSo, the total area where \\(ab\\) is positive is \\(4 + 6 = 10\\).\n\nThe total possible area (given all combinations of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)) is the product of the entire ranges of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), which is \\((-3 - 1) \\times (-2 - 4) = 4 \\times 6 = 24\\).\n\nThus, the probability that \\(ab\\) is positive is the ratio of the area where \\(ab\\) is positive to the total possible area, which is \\(\\frac{10}{24} = \\frac{5}{12}\\).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **A. \\(\\frac{5}{12}\\)**."
