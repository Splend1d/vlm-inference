However, from the options provided, choice C most closely aligns with addressing a recessionary gap:\n\nC. Tax cut Demand rises Rising Demand rises\n\nHere's why:\n\n- **Fiscal Policy**: A tax cut would increase disposable income for households and businesses, leading to higher consumption and investment, thus stimulating aggregate demand.\n  \n- **Loanable Funds Market**: The increased demand for goods and services could lead to higher borrowing by businesses for investment and by consumers for purchases, increasing the demand for loanable funds. This increased demand can put upward pressure on interest rates if the supply of loanable funds does not increase at the same rate.\n\n- **Interest Rate**: As the demand for loanable funds increases without a corresponding increase in the supply, interest rates will tend to rise. Higher interest rates make borrowing more expensive, which can dampen some of the demand created by the tax cut over time.\n\n- **Market for the U.S. Dollar**: An increase in demand for U.S. dollars could occur as foreign investors might be attracted to the higher interest rates offered in the U.S., leading to an appreciation of the U.S. dollar. However, this effect may be offset by other factors such as the overall economic health and expectations about future monetary policy.\n\nIt's important to note that while a tax cut can help close a recessionary gap by stimulating demand, it can also exacerbate a budget deficit in the short term. To truly address both issues simultaneously, the government would likely need to implement a combination of policies, including spending cuts or future tax increases, to ensure long-term fiscal sustainability."
