The place and date of trial is unknown.\nThe Begum Saheba and Mr. Hayat were permitted to see him after arrest.\nHe and I were going to address a meeting outside the station. He was arrested. I continued going to the meeting and addressed them. There is no cause for sorrow, but every cause for congratulation. There should be no hartal. Perfect peace and calmness should be observed. I regard the arrest as a prelude to Swaraj and the redress of the Khilafat and the Punjab wrongs, if we can remain non-violent. Retain Hindu-Muslim Unity despite the madness of some Moplahs, and fulfil the Swadeshi programme.\nI hope every Indian, man or woman, will completely boycott foreign cloth and take up spinning or weaving during every spare minute.\nBy striving like the Maulana, be insistent on religious and national rights.\nLet us earn imprisonment. I am conscious of the Maulana's innocence and I am sure the imprisonment of the innocent will enable the nation to reach the cherished goal.\"\nMohandas Gandhi, The Pilgrims' March, 1921\nWhich of the following historical developments most assisted the ultimate success of the boycott mentioned in the fifth paragraph?\n\nA. Pressure on colonial powers by the Soviet Union to retreat from their colonies\nB. The Great Depression that started in 1929\nC. The decolonization process already underway in Africa\nD. World War II\n"

                    "text": "None of the options A, B, C, or D directly relate to the success of the boycott mentioned in the fifth paragraph of the information provided. However, considering the context of the time period and the impact of global events on colonial policies, option D, World War II, could be argued to have indirectly assisted the success of such boycotts and movements for independence in India.\n\nDuring World War II (1939-1945), the British Empire was heavily engaged in the war effort against the Axis powers. This diverted significant resources, including military and economic, away from its colonies. The strain on Britain's resources weakened its ability to maintain control over its colonies, including India, which had been a major source of raw materials and troops for the British Empire.\n\nMoreover, the war led to shortages of imported goods in India, including textiles. This created an opportunity for the promotion of indigenous industries, such as spinning and weaving of cotton, which Gandhi advocated for in his message. The scarcity of foreign cloth made it more practical and necessary for Indians to rely on locally produced alternatives, thus indirectly supporting the boycott of foreign cloth and the promotion of Swadeshi (self-reliance).\n\nAdditionally, the war created political opportunities for nationalist leaders like Gandhi and others to push for greater autonomy and eventual independence. The post-war period saw a wave of decolonization across the world, as weakened colonial powers were less able to resist demands for independence and self-governance.\n\nTherefore, while none of the options provided is a perfect match, World War II (option D) can be seen as having indirectly facilitated the success of the boycott and other non-violent resistance efforts advocated by Gandhi by weakening British colonial control and creating favorable conditions for the promotion of local industries and nationalist movements."
