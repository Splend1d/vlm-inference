This type of training leads to an increase in the number and size of mitochondria in muscle cells, as well as an increase in the activity of enzymes involved in aerobic metabolism. As a result, muscles can more efficiently oxidize fats and carbohydrates to produce ATP (adenosine triphosphate), the energy currency of the cell, during aerobic exercise."
