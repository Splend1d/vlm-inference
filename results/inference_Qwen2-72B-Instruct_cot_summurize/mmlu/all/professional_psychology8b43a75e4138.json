Include indigenous paraprofessionals, including traditional healers, who will facilitate acceptance and effectiveness of the program.\n\nIncorporating indigenous paraprofessionals and traditional healers into the mental health care model can be highly beneficial in a culturally sensitive approach. This not only respects and acknowledges the cultural practices and beliefs of the community but also helps in building trust and rapport with the patients. Traditional healers often have a deep understanding of the community's values, language, and worldview, which can enhance the effectiveness of the mental health interventions.\n\nWhile it is important to employ licensed and competent providers (option D), the inclusion of traditional healers adds an essential layer of cultural relevance and sensitivity. Ensuring that mental health care is provided on-site (option B) may not necessarily contribute to cultural sensitivity; in fact, it might hinder access for some individuals if the location is not considered culturally safe or appropriate. Modeling mainstream medicine (option C) without incorporating cultural considerations risks perpetuating a one-size-fits-all approach that may not address the unique needs of the community.\n\nTherefore, option A is the most appropriate choice for a culturally sensitive model of mental health care within a North American Indian reservation setting."
