Succinylcholine\n\nPseudocholinesterase deficiency, also known as butyrylcholinesterase deficiency, is associated with an increased sensitivity to certain muscle relaxants used in anesthesia, particularly succinylcholine (also spelled suxamethonium chloride). This drug is broken down by the enzyme pseudocholinesterase, and in individuals with this deficiency, the drug's effects can last much longer than normal, leading to prolonged muscle paralysis."
