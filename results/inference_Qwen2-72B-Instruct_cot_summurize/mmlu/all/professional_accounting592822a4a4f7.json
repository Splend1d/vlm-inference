Boca Co. has four employees:\n\nTotal eligible gross wages = 4 employees * $15,000/employee = $60,000\n\nSince Boca Co. expects actual unemployment claims to be 2% of eligible gross wages:\n\nAccrued liability for unemployment claims = 2% * $60,000 = 0.02 * $60,000 = $1,200\n\nSo, the correct answer is A. $1,200."
