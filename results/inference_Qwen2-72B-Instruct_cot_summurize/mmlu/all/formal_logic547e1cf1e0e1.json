Therefore, the answer is:\n\nA. Logically equivalent\n\nThe reason is that two propositions are logically equivalent if their truth values match in every row of the truth table. In this case, the truth values of (G \u2228 ~H) \u2283 G and ~G \u2261 (~H \u00b7 G) match in all four rows of the truth table, indicating that they are logically equivalent.\n\nNote: The symbol \"\u00b7\" represents the conjunction operator, which means \"and\". The symbol \"\u2228\" represents the disjunction operator, which means \"or\". The symbol \"\u2283\" represents the implication operator, which means \"if...then\". The symbol \"\u2261\" represents the biconditional operator, which means \"if and only if\". The symbol \"~\" represents the negation operator, which means \"not\"."
