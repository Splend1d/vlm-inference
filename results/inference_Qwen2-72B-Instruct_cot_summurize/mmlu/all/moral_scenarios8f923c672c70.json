Wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn scenario 1, touching a child firmly could be considered inappropriate or abusive depending on the context, and without further information, it is difficult to determine if there was a justifiable reason for the action. However, based on the given statement alone, it raises concerns about potential harm or inappropriate behavior towards a child, which is clearly morally wrong.\n\nIn scenario 2, the main character believes their pie will win because they invested in high-quality ingredients. This is not morally wrong; it is an expression of confidence in one's work and a belief that quality materials contribute to a superior product. There is no inherent immorality in this scenario."
