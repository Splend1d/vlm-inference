They would fly from their home to the city and spend the week at a hotel in the most luxurious suite. On March 1, the husband mailed a letter to the hotel, reserving the suite for the first week in July. The hotel then sent back a confirmation notice stating that it was reserving the suite for the husband and wife for the first week in July \"for the weekly rental of $25,000. \"When the husband and wife arrived at the hotel on July 1, the hotel, without legal excuse, informed the man and his wife that the hotel had rented the suite to another couple for the first week in July. Quite apologetic, the manager of the hotel offered the husband and wife the hotel's next best accommodation at a weekly rental of $20,000. The manager informed the husband and wife that the other suite was beautifully furnished, \"but not quite as luxurious as the suite they reserved. \" Visibly upset, the husband and wife rejected the manager's offer and relocated to another hotel, where they rented the other hotel's most luxurious suite for the first week in July at a cost of $25,000. If the husband and wife now sue the first hotel for breach of contract, they will most likely\n\nA. prevail, because the hotel knew that for the past 20 years the husband and wife always stayed in the most luxurious suite.\nB. prevail, because the substitute accommodations offered by the hotel were not comparable to the suite they reserved.\nC. not prevail, because the hotel did offer substitute accommodations at a $5,000 savings.\nD. not prevail, because the husband and wife sustained no legal damages in renting a comparable suite at another hotel for the same rental.\n"

The correct answer is B: prevail, because the substitute accommodations offered by the hotel were not comparable to the suite they reserved.\n\nWhen the husband reserved the suite and received a confirmation, a binding contract was formed between the husband and the hotel. By renting out the reserved suite to another couple, the hotel breached this contract. The fact that the hotel offered a $5,000 discount on an alternative suite does not absolve them of their contractual obligations, especially if the substitute accommodations were not equivalent in quality to what was originally agreed upon. The husband and wife are entitled to receive what they contracted for or compensation for the loss incurred due to the breach.\n\nMoreover, the fact that the couple had to pay the same amount ($25,000) for a comparable suite at another hotel does not mean they sustained no legal damages. They may have incurred additional costs (e.g., transportation to the new hotel, inconvenience, stress, etc.) and lost the opportunity to stay at their preferred hotel with which they had a 20-year tradition. These non-economic damages can also be considered when assessing the impact of the hotel's breach of contract."
