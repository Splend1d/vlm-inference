Smith, Glass, and Miller\u2019s (1980) meta-analysis of the psychotherapy outcome research found that people receiving therapy are \"better off\" than about 80% of people who need treatment but do not receive it. This finding has been widely cited as evidence for the effectiveness of psychotherapy. However, it's important to note that the specific percentage may vary depending on the type of therapy, the population being studied, and other factors."
