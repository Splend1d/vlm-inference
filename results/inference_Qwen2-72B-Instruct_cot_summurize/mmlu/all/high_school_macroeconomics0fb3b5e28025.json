Discouraged workers are counted as \"out of the labor force\" thus the unemployment rate is understated making the economy look stronger than it is.\n\nThe official unemployment rate is calculated based on the number of unemployed individuals actively seeking work divided by the total labor force (which includes both employed and unemployed individuals). Discouraged workers, who have stopped looking for work due to the belief that no jobs are available for them, are not considered part of the labor force because they are not actively seeking employment. As a result, their numbers are not included in the calculation of the unemployment rate, which can lead to an understatement of the true level of joblessness and make the economy appear healthier than it actually is."
