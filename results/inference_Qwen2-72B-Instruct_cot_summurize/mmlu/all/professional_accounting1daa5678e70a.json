In such cases, gains and losses are recognized.\n\nThe gain or loss on an exchange is determined by comparing the fair value of the asset given up (or the fair value of the asset received if it's more clearly evident) with the carrying amount of the asset given up.\n\nIn this case:\n- The land was originally purchased for $20,000.\n- The land's appraised value (which can be considered its fair value in this context) is $50,000.\n- The machinery received has a fair value of $55,000.\n\nSince the fair value of the machinery received is greater than the fair value of the land given up, but the difference ($5,000) is not relevant to calculating the gain on the exchange, we look at the fair value of the land given up compared to its book value.\n\nThe gain on the exchange is calculated as follows:\n\nGain = Fair Value of Asset Given Up - Carrying Amount of Asset Given Up\nGain = $50,000 - $20,000\nGain = $30,000\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. $30,000"
