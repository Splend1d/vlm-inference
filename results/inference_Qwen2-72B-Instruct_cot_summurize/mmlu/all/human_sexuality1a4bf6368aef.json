The risk of getting gonorrhea from a single sexual encounter with an infected partner is significant, though it may not be as high as 100%, the exact risk varies depending on the type of contact and other factors.\n\nStatement C is incorrect because gonorrhea is actually asymptomatic in a substantial number of infected individuals, particularly women. It's estimated that around 50% of men and 80% of women with gonorrhea do not show any symptoms.\n\nStatement D is also incorrect because while gonorrhea primarily affects the genital areas, it can also infect the throat, eyes, and rectum. In rare cases, it can spread into the bloodstream and cause disseminated gonococcal infection (DGI), affecting joints, skin, and other organs."
