An effective price ceiling must be at a price below the equilibrium price.\n\nThis statement is accurate because a price ceiling, which is a legal maximum price that can be charged for a good or service, only has an effect when it is set below the equilibrium price. At this lower price, the quantity demanded exceeds the quantity supplied, leading to a shortage. The other statements are incorrect:\n\nB. A price ceiling does not increase the quantity of the good supplied; it actually decreases it as suppliers are willing to supply less at a lower price.\nC. A price ceiling does not cause a shift in the demand curve; it simply holds the price below what it would otherwise be, affecting the quantity demanded and supplied at that price.\nD. A price ceiling does affect the quantity of the good supplied, typically reducing it as suppliers may find it unprofitable to produce at the lower price."
