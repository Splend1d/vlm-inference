This information helps policymakers understand global events and trends, anticipate potential threats, and make informed decisions regarding national security and foreign policy.\n\nWhile the FBI does have a role in intelligence gathering, particularly concerning domestic threats and counterintelligence, it is not the primary agency responsible for foreign intelligence. The National Security Council (NSC) advises the President on national security and foreign policy matters but does not gather intelligence itself. Therefore, option D is incorrect."
