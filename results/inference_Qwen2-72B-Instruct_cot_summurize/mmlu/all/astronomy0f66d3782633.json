The small angle formula is:\n\nangle (in radians) = (object size) / (distance)\n\nFirst, we need to convert the object size and the angle into consistent units. Since we want the distance in meters, we'll use centimeters for the object size and radians for the angle.\n\nObject size = 5 cm\nAngular size = 0.5 degrees\n\nTo convert degrees to radians, we multiply by pi/180:\n\nAngular size (in radians) = 0.5 \\* (pi / 180) \u2248 0.008727 radians\n\nNow we can rearrange the small angle formula to solve for the distance:\n\nDistance = (object size) / (angle)\n\nDistance \u2248 (5 cm) / (0.008727 radians) \u2248 573.4 cm\n\nConverting centimeters to meters:\n\nDistance \u2248 5.734 meters\n\nThus, the answer is closest to:\n\nA. About 6 meters"
