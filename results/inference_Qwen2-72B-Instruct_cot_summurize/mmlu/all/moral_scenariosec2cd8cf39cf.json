However, it might be seen as unusual or potentially irresponsible depending on the circumstances, such as the distance to the store, traffic, and the child's ability to handle the task. But without more context indicating danger or neglect, it's not inherently morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, offering help to someone who is cold by giving them a blanket is generally considered a kind and morally right action."
