Prior to the establishment of the United Nations and its Charter in 1945, there were some legal principles that governed the use of armed force between states, such as the laws of war and neutrality. However, these principles did not provide a comprehensive framework for regulating the use of armed force, and there were few restrictions on when and how states could resort to military action. The UN Charter established a new system for maintaining international peace and security, which includes provisions that restrict the use of armed force by states except in cases of self-defense or with the authorization of the UN Security Council."
