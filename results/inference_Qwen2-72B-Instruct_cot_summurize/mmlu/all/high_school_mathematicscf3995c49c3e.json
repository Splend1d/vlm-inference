This statement is false because continuity does not guarantee differentiability. A function can be continuous at a point but not differentiable there. For example, the absolute value function |x| is continuous everywhere, but it is not differentiable at x = 0.\n\nB. This statement is false because if f\u2032(c) = 0, it means that the slope of the tangent line to the curve at x = c is zero, but this does not necessarily mean that f has a local maximum or minimum at (c, f(c)). It could also be a point of inflection where the concavity changes.\n\nC. This statement is false because if f\u2032\u2032(c) = 0, it means that the second derivative of the function is zero at x = c, which does not necessarily imply that the graph of f has an inflection point at (c, f(c)). The second derivative being zero at a point does not automatically indicate an inflection point; the concavity must change for it to be an inflection point.\n\nD. This statement is true because differentiability implies continuity. If a function is differentiable at a point, it must be continuous there. This is a consequence of the definition of the derivative, which involves taking the limit of the difference quotient as h approaches zero. For this limit to exist, the function must be continuous at the point in question."
