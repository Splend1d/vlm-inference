The official encouragement of Buddhist edicts.\n\nAshoka, the Mauryan emperor, converted to Buddhism after the Kalinga War and made it the state religion. He promoted the spread of Buddhism throughout his empire and beyond, erecting pillars and rocks inscribed with edicts that preached Buddhist principles and encouraged moral conduct. This was a significant change in Indian religious practice as it marked the first time a major Indian ruler had officially endorsed a specific religion. \n\nOption A is incorrect because Sikhism emerged much later, in the 15th century CE. Option B is incorrect because Islam arrived in India through invasions starting in the 8th century CE, long after Ashoka's reign. Option C is incorrect because there is no historical evidence to suggest that Ashoka or any other Mauryan emperor attempted to eradicate traditional Hinduism by armed force."
