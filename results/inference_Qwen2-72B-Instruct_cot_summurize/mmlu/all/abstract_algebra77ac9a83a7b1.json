Since \\(\\sqrt{3}\\) does not satisfy any linear polynomial over \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})\\) (as it is not in the base field), we check if \\(x^2 - 3\\) is irreducible over \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})\\). Indeed, this polynomial cannot be factored further in \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})\\), so it is the minimal polynomial for \\(\\sqrt{3}\\) over \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})\\). Therefore, \\([\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}):\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})] = 2\\).\n\nUsing the Tower Law, we have:\n\n\\[\n[\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}):\\mathbb{Q}] = [\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}):\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})] \\cdot [\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}):\\mathbb{Q}] = 2 \\cdot 2 = 4.\n\\]\n\nThus, the degree of the field extension \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}, \\sqrt{18})\\) over \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) is **B. 4**."
