Since the gas is expanding against a constant external pressure, we can use Boyle's Law (assuming temperature remains constant), which states that the product of the pressure and volume for a fixed amount of an ideal gas stays constant when the temperature is held constant:\n\n\\[ P_1V_1 = P_2V_2 \\]\n\nHowever, since the gas is expanding against an external pressure, \\(P_2\\) here would actually be equal to \\(P_{\\text{ext}}\\). But, for the purpose of finding the work done, we don't need to solve for \\(V_2\\) explicitly; we only need to know the change in volume (\\(\\Delta V\\)) and the external pressure (\\(P_{\\text{ext}}\\)).\n\nSince the initial conditions and the final external pressure are given, but not the final volume or the change in volume directly, we will proceed with calculating work based on the information provided.\n\nWhen a gas expands, its volume increases, so \\(\\Delta V = V_2 - V_1 > 0\\). However, without knowing the exact final volume or the extent of the expansion, we cannot calculate \\(\\Delta V\\) directly from the information given. Instead, let's consider the concept of work done.\n\nIf the gas expands against an external pressure of 0.80 atm, the work done by the gas will be negative (since work is done by the system on the surroundings), and the magnitude of the work will depend on the increase in volume.\n\nLet's assume the gas expands to some final volume \\(V_2\\). The change in volume would then be \\(V_2 - 2.0\\). Without knowing \\(V_2\\), we cannot compute the exact work, but we can determine the sign and understand that the magnitude of the work depends on how much the gas expands.\n\nSince the question does not provide enough information to calculate \\(\\Delta V\\) directly, we have to look at the options and consider what would be reasonable given the context. The options are all negative values, indicating that the work done by the gas on the surroundings is indeed negative (as expected).\n\nWithout more specific information about the final state, we cannot definitively choose between A, B, or C. However, the question seems to be testing the understanding that work done by the gas when it expands against an external pressure will be negative.\n\nGiven the nature of the question and the options, the correct answer must be one of the negative values: A, B, or C. Without further context or information to calculate \\(\\Delta V\\), none of the options can be conclusively selected based solely on the information given. In an exam setting, this might indicate either a need for additional information or a test of conceptual understanding rather than calculation ability."
