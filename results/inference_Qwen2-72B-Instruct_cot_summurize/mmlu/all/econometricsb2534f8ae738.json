(i) and (iii) only.\n\nA standard GARCH(1,1) model can capture fat tails in the return distribution (feature i) because it allows for the volatility to change over time in response to past squared returns, which can result in more extreme values than would be expected under a normal distribution. It also captures volatility clustering (feature iii) as it models how periods of high volatility tend to be followed by other periods of high volatility, and similarly for low volatility periods.\n\nHowever, a standard GARCH(1,1) model does not explicitly account for leverage effects (feature ii), which refer to the tendency for volatility to increase more after negative returns than after positive returns of the same size. For that, an asymmetric version of the GARCH model such as EGARCH or GJR-GARCH would be needed.\n\nAdditionally, while GARCH models can explain how volatility is affected by past squared returns, they do not typically model volatility affecting returns directly (feature iv). In a GARCH framework, the conditional mean equation (which relates to returns) and the conditional variance equation (related to volatility) are separate, with the latter influencing the former indirectly through the error term's variance."
