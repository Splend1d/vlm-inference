Butler sees conscience as the fundamental guide for moral action, which aligns with the natural order of things. He posits that humans have an innate moral sense that guides them to act virtuously and justly, and that this moral sense is part of human nature. Thus, to follow nature, for Butler, is to heed one's conscience when making decisions and acting upon them."
