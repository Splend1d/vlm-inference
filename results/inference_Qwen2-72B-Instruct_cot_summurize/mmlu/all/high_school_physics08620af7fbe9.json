                    "text": "The correct answer is D. The block, because it does not gain rotational kinetic energy, but the sphere does.\n\nWhen both objects are released from rest at the top of the inclined plane, they both start with the same gravitational potential energy. As they descend, this potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. However, the way this conversion happens differs between the two objects.\n\nFor the block, which slides without friction, all of its potential energy is converted directly into translational kinetic energy (KE = 0.5mv^2). There's no loss of energy to friction or any other form of energy.\n\nFor the sphere, as it rolls without slipping, part of its potential energy is converted into rotational kinetic energy (KE_rot = 0.5I\u03c9^2), where I is the moment of inertia and \u03c9 is the angular velocity. The moment of inertia for a solid sphere is (2/5)mr^2, meaning that some of the energy that would otherwise go into increasing the linear velocity of the sphere goes into spinning it instead. This results in the sphere having less translational kinetic energy than the block when they reach the bottom.\n\nThus, even though both the sphere and the block have the same total kinetic energy at the bottom (assuming no energy is lost to friction or air resistance for the sphere), the block has more of this energy in the form of translational kinetic energy, which makes it move faster down the incline and reach the bottom first."
