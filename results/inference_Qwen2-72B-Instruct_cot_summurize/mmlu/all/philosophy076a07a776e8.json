In his work \"Utilitarianism,\" Mill argues that happiness is the ultimate end of human action and that the quality of pleasures should be taken into account when considering what constitutes a happy life. He suggests that higher pleasures, which are often associated with the mind and intellect, can lead to a deeper sense of happiness than mere physical gratification. Therefore, the answer would be:\n\nC. both a and b."
