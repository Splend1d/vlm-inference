                    "text": "A temporary expansionary supply shock, such as a decrease in input prices or an increase in productivity, leads to a situation where firms can produce more at every price level. This results in a rightward shift of the Aggregate Supply (AS) curve in the AS-AD model, which corresponds to a downward shift of the Short-Run Phillips Curve (SRPC). The SRPC shows the relationship between the inflation rate and the unemployment rate in the short run.\n\nWhen the SRPC shifts down due to the supply shock:\n1. Inflation decreases because the cost of production is lower, leading to lower prices.\n2. Unemployment falls because the lower costs allow firms to produce more output and potentially hire more workers.\n\nIn the long run, however, if the economy returns to its potential output level (which is determined by factors like technology, capital, and labor), the long-run unemployment rate should not be affected by this type of supply shock. Long-run unemployment is considered to be at the natural rate, which is determined by structural factors unrelated to short-term economic fluctuations.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer would be:\n\nC. Shifts down Falls Falls\n\nHowever, the last option \"Falls\" refers to the short-run unemployment rate, not the long-run unemployment rate, which remains unchanged in this scenario. So, the most accurate description for the long-run unemployment rate would be that it stays the same, but since that option isn't provided, the closest choice given the options is C, with the understanding that the long-run unemployment rate does not change."
