                    "text": "Nozick's response to this criticism is encapsulated in option B: \"If each person's holdings are just, then the total distribution of holdings is just.\" This is a core principle of his entitlement theory, which holds that a distribution of goods is just if every individual's holdings can be traced back to a legitimate acquisition or transfer, regardless of the overall distribution.\n\nNozick argues that justice in holdings (or distributions) should be understood through three principles:\n\n1. **Justice in Acquisition**: The initial acquisition of holdings is just if it does not violate anyone's rights.\n2. **Justice in Transfer**: Transfers of holdings from one person to another are just if they are done voluntarily and without violating anyone's rights.\n3. **Rectification of Injustice**: If an injustice has occurred in either acquisition or transfer, it must be rectified.\n\nAccording to Nozick, as long as these principles are followed, the distribution of goods in society is just, even if some people end up with much less than others. He famously used the example of Wilt Chamberlain (a famous basketball player) to illustrate how even a seemingly unequal distribution can result from a series of voluntary transactions that are just in themselves.\n\nNozick's position is often contrasted with distributive justice theories that focus on the pattern or end-state of distribution, such as those proposed by John Rawls. Unlike Rawls, who advocates for principles that aim to ensure fairness in the distribution of resources, Nozick emphasizes the importance of respecting individual rights and the processes by which individuals come to hold property."
