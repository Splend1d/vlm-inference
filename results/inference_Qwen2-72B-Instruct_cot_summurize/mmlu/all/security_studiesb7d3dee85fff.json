Non-state actors, including illegal groups, are also key players.\n\nWhile states and their military organizations are primary actors in the defence trade, non-state actors such as private defense contractors, arms dealers, and even illegal groups like terrorist organizations can be involved. The defence trade encompasses a wide range of activities including the manufacture, sale, transfer, and brokering of military equipment, technology, and services. It involves both legal transactions conducted under international law and illicit trades that violate arms embargoes or other regulations."
