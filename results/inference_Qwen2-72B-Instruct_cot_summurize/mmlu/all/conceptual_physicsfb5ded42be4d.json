Therefore, the correct answer is B.\n\nAn alpha particle consists of two protons and two neutrons, which together have a mass number of 4. When an alpha particle is ejected from an atom's nucleus in a process called alpha decay, the parent nucleus loses these two protons and two neutrons, resulting in a daughter nucleus with a mass number that is 4 units less than that of the parent nucleus."
