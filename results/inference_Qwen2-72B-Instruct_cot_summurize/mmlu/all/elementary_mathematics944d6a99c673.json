This year, she plans to make twice as much. So, she will make:\n\\[32 \\times 2 = 64\\] one-cup servings of soup.\n\nHowever, the question asks for the answer in gallons, not in cups. We need to convert the number of cups to gallons. There are 16 cups in a gallon.\n\nSo, if she makes 64 cups of soup, it converts to:\n\\[\\frac{64}{16} = 4\\] gallons.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. 4 gallons."
