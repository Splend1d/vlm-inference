C3 plants, such as trees and shrubs, are typically associated with forests and woodland environments, while C4 plants, such as grasses, are adapted to open, sunny environments like savannas and grasslands.\n\nBased on this information, the correct answer would be:\n\nD. nuts and fruits to species more focused on grasses.\n\nThis transition is believed to have occurred during the Plio-Pleistocene epoch when hominids began to incorporate more C4 plant material (like grasses and sedges) into their diets, likely due to environmental changes that led to the expansion of grassland habitats. This dietary shift is thought to have played a role in the evolution of certain hominid species, including aspects of our own lineage, Homo."
