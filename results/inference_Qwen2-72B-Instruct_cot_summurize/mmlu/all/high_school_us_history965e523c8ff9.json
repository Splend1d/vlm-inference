In fact, it was often used as a justification for opposing civil rights legislation and maintaining segregation. The other three options\u2014women's rights, gay and lesbian rights, and Native American rights\u2014are all examples of social movements that were inspired, at least in part, by the Civil Rights movement. These movements sought to extend the principles of equality and justice to other marginalized groups in society."
