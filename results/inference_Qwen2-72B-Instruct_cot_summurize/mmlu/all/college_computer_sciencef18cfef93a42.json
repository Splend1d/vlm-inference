Without the NOT operator, you cannot create expressions that involve negation. The other sets listed (A, B, and D) are all functionally complete, meaning they can represent any Boolean function.\n\n- A. {AND, NOT} is complete because with AND and NOT, you can express OR using De Morgan's laws.\n- B. {NOT, OR} is complete for the same reason as A; you can express AND using De Morgan's laws.\n- D. {NAND} is also complete because NAND alone can be used to express AND, OR, and NOT functions."
