It suggests that schools prepare children for their future roles in the workforce by socializing them into accepting the existing power structures and norms of society. Therefore, the closest answer to this principle would be:\n\nA. schools prepare children for work by teaching them to be obedient\n\nThis aligns with the broader argument made by Bowles and Gintis that schools function as an ideological state apparatus, reproducing the conditions necessary for capitalist economies to continue functioning by instilling values such as punctuality, discipline, and obedience, which are deemed important for maintaining an efficient labor force."
