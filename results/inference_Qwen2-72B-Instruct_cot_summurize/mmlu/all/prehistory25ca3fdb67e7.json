Our early ancestors were nomadic hunter-gatherers who roamed the land in search of food, water, and shelter. They would hunt animals, gather fruits, nuts, and vegetables, and fish in bodies of water to sustain themselves. Agriculture only began around 10,000 years ago during the Neolithic Revolution, which is a very recent development in the grand scheme of human history."
