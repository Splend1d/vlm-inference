According to research on mood-congruent memory, people are more likely to remember information that matches their current emotional state at the time of encoding (when they first learn the information). Therefore, a participant who was in a positive mood when initially exposed to the list of positive words would be more likely to remember those words a week later compared to someone who was not in a positive mood at the time of encoding. The mood of the researcher or the participant's self-perception as a \"positive\" person does not have a significant effect on memory recall in this context. Similarly, whether the participant considers the initial testing experience positive or not is less important than the emotional state they were in during the encoding phase."
