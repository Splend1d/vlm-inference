The contractor, in turn, hired a subcontractor to dig the hole and plaster the pooi area. After the subcontractor completed his job, the contractor then hired an electrician to install the heater and wiring for the pool. While the electrician was performing his work, the wiring became disjointed and had to be replaced at a substantial expense to the homeowner. If the homeowner sues the electrician in tort to recover the damages she suffered because of this occurrence, will the homeowner prevail?\n\nA.

No, unless the electrical wiring that became disjointed was defective.\nC. No, if the electrician used his best professional judgment in performing the electrical work.\nD. No, unless the homeowner knew that the contractor had hired the electrician to perform the electrical work.\n"

Yes, if the wiring became disjointed because the electrician's plans departed from established standards in the electrical industry.\n\nIn this scenario, the homeowner has a case against the electrician if it can be shown that the electrician's work did not meet the established standards of the electrical industry, leading to the damage. This would fall under the concept of negligence, where the electrician failed to exercise the level of care expected of someone in their profession, resulting in harm to the homeowner. If the electrician's actions or omissions were the direct cause of the wiring becoming disjointed, and this was due to a deviation from standard practices, the homeowner may prevail in a lawsuit seeking to recover damages."
