Vapor pressure is the pressure exerted by a vapor in thermodynamic equilibrium with its condensed phases at a given temperature in a closed system. A substance with weak intermolecular forces will have a higher vapor pressure because its molecules are more likely to escape into the vapor phase. However, vapor pressure is influenced by other factors such as temperature and the nature of the liquid, so it's not as precise a measure as heat of fusion, boiling points, or heat of vaporization, which are more directly related to the energy required to overcome intermolecular forces."
