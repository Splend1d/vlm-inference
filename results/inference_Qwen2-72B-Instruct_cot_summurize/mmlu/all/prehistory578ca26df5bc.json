Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. 60,000 B.P.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that this date is subject to change as new archaeological discoveries and research methods continue to refine our understanding of human history. Recent findings have suggested even earlier dates, pushing the timeline back further, but as of the knowledge cutoff in 2023, the most widely accepted date is around 60,000 B.P."
