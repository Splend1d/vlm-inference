For a linear, symmetric molecule like carbon dioxide (CO2), the normal modes can be categorized into three types: two bending modes and two stretching modes (one symmetric and one asymmetric). The symmetric stretching mode does not result in a change in the dipole moment because the molecule remains symmetric throughout the vibration; thus, it is not infrared-active.\n\nOn the other hand, both the bending mode and the asymmetric stretching mode result in changes in the molecule's dipole moment as they distort the molecule's symmetry, making them infrared-active. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. I and III only"
