This magnetic field induces eddy currents in the conductive material placed within it. If the material is also magnetic, these eddy currents will interact with the magnetic field to produce heat through hysteresis losses and eddy current losses. Therefore, for induction heating to be effective, the material must be both conductive and magnetic (or at least ferromagnetic). However, it can work on non-magnetic conductors as well, but the efficiency might be lower. So, option B is also correct in a broader sense since it includes both magnetic and non-magnetic conducting materials. But the most efficient materials for induction heating are indeed those that are both conducting and magnetic, making D the best answer choice."
