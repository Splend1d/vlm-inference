A conditional syllogism is based on an \"if-then\" statement, which is the case here with \"If the sky is blue, there won't be rain.\" \n\nTo determine if the syllogism is formally valid, we need to check whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In this case:\n\nPremise 1: If the sky is blue, there won't be rain.\nPremise 2: The sky is blue today.\nConclusion: Therefore, there won't be rain.\n\nThis argument form is known as modus ponens, which is a valid form of reasoning. Modus ponens states that if a conditional statement (an \"if-then\" statement) is true and its antecedent (the \"if\" part) is true, then the consequent (the \"then\" part) must also be true.\n\nGiven that the argument follows the structure of modus ponens and that modus ponens is a valid form of inference, the argument is formally valid.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. It is a formally valid conditional syllogism."
