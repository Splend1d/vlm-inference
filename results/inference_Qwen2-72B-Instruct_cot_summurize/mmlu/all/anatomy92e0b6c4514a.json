The ribs, sternum, clavicle, and vertebrae\n\nEndochondral ossification is the process by which most bones in the human body form, including long bones (such as those in the arms and legs), flat bones (like the ribs and sternum), and irregular bones (such as the vertebrae). The clavicle (collarbone) is somewhat unique in that it begins to ossify directly from cartilage (intramembranous ossification) but also undergoes endochondral ossification at its ends where it articulates with other bones. Therefore, all the bones listed in option D do indeed develop through endochondral ossification. However, it's important to note that the clavicle primarily develops via intramembranous ossification, making this answer slightly complex. But for the purpose of your question, D is the correct choice."
