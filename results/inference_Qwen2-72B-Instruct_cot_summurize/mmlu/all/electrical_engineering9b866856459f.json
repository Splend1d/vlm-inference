The loop gain must be exactly 1 (or 0 dB) at the desired frequency of oscillation.\n2. The total phase shift around the loop must be 0 degrees or an integer multiple of 360 degrees at the desired frequency of oscillation.\n\nThese conditions ensure that the output signal is reinforced by the feedback, allowing the oscillations to continue indefinitely. If the loop gain is less than unity, the amplitude of the oscillations will decay over time, while if it is more than unity, the amplitude will grow without bound until limited by non-linearities in the system."
