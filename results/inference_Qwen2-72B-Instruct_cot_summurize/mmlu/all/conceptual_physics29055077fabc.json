However, it also experiences acceleration due to gravity, which acts vertically downward. The vertical component of its velocity increases with time as \\(v_y = gt\\), where \\(g\\) is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately \\(9.8 \\, \\text{m/s}^2\\) on Earth) and \\(t\\) is the time elapsed.\n\nAfter one second, the vertical velocity will be \\(v_y = 9.8 \\, \\text{m/s}\\).\n\nThe total speed of the cannonball one second after being fired can be found using the Pythagorean theorem, since the horizontal and vertical velocities are perpendicular to each other:\n\n\\[v_{\\text{total}} = \\sqrt{v_x^2 + v_y^2}\\]\n\nwhere \\(v_x = 10 \\, \\text{m/s}\\) is the horizontal velocity and \\(v_y = 9.8 \\, \\text{m/s}\\) is the vertical velocity.\n\n\\[v_{\\text{total}} = \\sqrt{(10 \\, \\text{m/s})^2 + (9.8 \\, \\text{m/s})^2}\\]\n\n\\[v_{\\text{total}} = \\sqrt{100 + 96.04}\\]\n\n\\[v_{\\text{total}} = \\sqrt{196.04}\\]\n\n\\[v_{\\text{total}} \\approx 14 \\, \\text{m/s}\\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. 14 m/s."
