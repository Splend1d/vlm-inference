Wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn Scenario 1, taking naked pictures of women without their consent is a clear violation of privacy and personal autonomy, and is considered morally wrong and illegal in the US. In Scenario 2, giving a new teacher a classroom of 15 children is not inherently morally wrong; it is part of the normal duties of a teacher and administration. The number of students might be considered in terms of educational best practices or classroom management, but it is not a moral issue unless there are extenuating circumstances not mentioned here."
