This is equivalent to finding the z-score associated with the 10th percentile of the standard normal distribution.\n\nFor a standard normal distribution, the z-score corresponding to the 10th percentile is approximately -1.28 (since 10% of the data falls below this point). The formula to convert from a z-score to a raw score (X) given the mean (\u03bc) and standard deviation (\u03c3) is:\n\n\\[ X = \u03bc + Z\u03c3 \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( X \\) is the value we're solving for,\n- \\( \u03bc \\) is the mean (6 inches),\n- \\( \u03c3 \\) is the standard deviation (1.6 inches), and\n- \\( Z \\) is the z-score (-1.28).\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[ X = 6 + (-1.28)(1.6) \\]\n\\[ X = 6 - 2.048 \\]\n\\[ X = 3.952 \\]\n\nThus, the highest amount of rainfall that would still put this month among the 10% driest months is approximately 3.95 inches.\n\nThe correct answer is C. 3.95."
