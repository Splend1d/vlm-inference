Since work is defined as the dot product of force and displacement, and the angle between the normal force and the displacement vector is 90 degrees, the work done by the normal force is zero.\n\nSo the answer is D. No. The normal force does no work on the man while the elevator ascends because the force and the displacement are perpendicular to each other."
