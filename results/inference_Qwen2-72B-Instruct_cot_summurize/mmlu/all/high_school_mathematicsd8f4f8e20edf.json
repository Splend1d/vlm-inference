Since both \\(2^2\\) and \\(7^2\\) are factors of 392, it is indeed a powerful number.\n\nNow, let's move on to option B: 336\n\n- Factorization of 336: \\(336 = 2^4 \\times 3^1 \\times 7^1\\). Here, \\(2^2\\) and \\(7^2\\) are factors, but \\(3^2\\) is not. Therefore, 336 is not a powerful number.\n\nNext, option C: 300\n\n- Factorization of 300: \\(300 = 2^2 \\times 3^1 \\times 5^2\\). Here, \\(2^2\\) and \\(5^2\\) are factors, but \\(3^2\\) is not. Therefore, 300 is not a powerful number.\n\nFinally, option D: 297\n\n- Factorization of 297: \\(297 = 3^3 \\times 11^1\\). Here, \\(3^2\\) is a factor, but \\(11^2\\) is not. Therefore, 297 is not a powerful number.\n\nThus, the only powerful number among the given options is:\n\nA. 392"
