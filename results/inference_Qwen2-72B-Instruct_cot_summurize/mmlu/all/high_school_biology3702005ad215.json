The adaptive immune response refers to adaptive immunity, which involves T and B lymphocytes that can recognize and respond to specific antigens. Innate immunity is the body's first line of defense and includes barriers like skin and mucous membranes, as well as phagocytic cells like macrophages and neutrophils."
