In scenario 2, the main character has committed an act of violence, which is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. It's important to note that context could change the interpretation of scenario 2; for example, if the action was taken in self-defense, it might be viewed differently, but without additional context, the scenario implies a morally wrong action."
