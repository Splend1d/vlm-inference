The economic necessity which has forced women out of the home and into the world of business has completely annihilated the old idea that a woman should eat only in the privacy of her household or in the homes of her friends, has created the absolutely new social phenomenon of women eating in public, unescorted by men, by the tens of thousands, and has given rise to a wholly new phase of the restaurant business.\"\n\u2014The New York Times, October 15, 1905\nThe scenario described in the passage above is most directly reflected in the ideas of which of the following?\n\nA. Civil Rights Act of 1964.\nB. Equal Rights Amendment.\nC. Pure Food and Drug Act.\nD. Interstate Commerce Act.\n"

However, if we must choose from the options, the closest in relation to issues of equality and rights would be:\n\nA. Civil Rights Act of 1964.\n\nAlthough the Civil Rights Act of 1964 primarily addresses discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin in employment and public accommodations, it does touch upon gender equality in the workplace, which is somewhat related to the scenario described. However, it's important to note that the Act was passed almost 60 years after the passage was written and addressed a broader set of issues than just women working outside the home."
