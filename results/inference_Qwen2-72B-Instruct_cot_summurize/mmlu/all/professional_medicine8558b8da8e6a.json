She has had one previous pregnancy resulting in a spontaneous abortion at 12 weeks' gestation. Today, her vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows a uterus consistent in size with a 28-week gestation. Fetal ultrasonography shows a male fetus with no abnormalities. Her blood group is O, Rh-negative. The father's blood group is B, Rh-positive. The physician recommends administration of Rho\n\nA. immune globulin to the patient. This treatment is most likely to prevent which of the following in this mother?\nB. Development of natural killer cells\nC. Development of polycythemia\nD. Formation of antibodies to RhD\n"

Formation of antibodies to RhD.\n\nRho(D) immune globulin (RhIg or RhoGAM) is administered to Rh-negative mothers who are carrying an Rh-positive fetus or have recently given birth to an Rh-positive baby. Its purpose is to prevent the mother from forming antibodies against the Rh factor, which can lead to hemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN) in future pregnancies if the mother is exposed again to Rh-positive fetal red blood cells. By preventing the formation of these antibodies, RhIg helps protect future pregnancies from complications related to Rh incompatibility."
