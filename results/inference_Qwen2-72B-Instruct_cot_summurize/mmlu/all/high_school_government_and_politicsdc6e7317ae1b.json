Congress to nullify resolutions approved by the executive branch.\n\nThe legislative veto was a mechanism that allowed one or both houses of Congress to disapprove and nullify actions taken by the executive branch, including certain regulations and decisions made by administrative agencies. This mechanism was used as a way for Congress to maintain oversight and control over the executive branch's implementation of laws. However, in 1983, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Immigration and Naturalization Service v. Chadha that the legislative veto was unconstitutional because it violated the bicameralism and presentment requirements of the Constitution, which require all legislation to be passed by both houses of Congress and presented to the President for approval or veto."
