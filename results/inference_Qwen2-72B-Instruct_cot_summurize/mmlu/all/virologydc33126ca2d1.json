They can recognize and kill virus-infected cells without prior sensitization, making them an important early defense against viral infections like HIV.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the initial response to HIV involves various components of the innate immune system, including macrophages and dendritic cells, before adaptive immune responses involving CD4+ and CD8+ T cells take over. But among the options provided, NK cells would be the correct choice as they are part of the innate immune system and respond quickly to viral infections."
