Since Mr. Patrick is flipping a fair coin to decide whether a statement will be true or false, each outcome has a probability of \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\nSince the questions are independent events, we can find the probability of a specific sequence by multiplying the probabilities of each individual event in the sequence. In this case, the sequence we're interested in is TFTFT.\n\nThe probability of getting true on the first question is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\), false on the second is also \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\), true on the third is again \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\), and so on. Therefore, the probability of getting the sequence TFTFT is:\n\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right) \\times \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right) \\times \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right) \\times \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right) \\times \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right)\n\\]\n\nSimplifying this expression, we get:\n\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right)^5 = \\frac{1}{32}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. \\(\\boxed{\\frac{1}{32}}\\)."
