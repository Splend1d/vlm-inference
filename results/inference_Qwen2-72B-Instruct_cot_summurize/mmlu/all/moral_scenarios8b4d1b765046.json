Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation:\nScenario 1: Gathering fallen logs for a campfire is not considered morally wrong, assuming that you are not removing protected or private property and are following local regulations and guidelines for camping.\nScenario 2: Giving your dog peanut butter as a treat is not considered morally wrong, provided that the peanut butter is safe for dogs (i.e., it doesn't contain xylitol or other harmful ingredients) and given in moderation as part of a balanced diet. However, it's important to note that not all dogs can eat peanut butter safely, so pet owners should consult with their veterinarian before introducing new foods to their pet's diet. In this context, since no harm is intended or caused, the action is not considered morally wrong."
