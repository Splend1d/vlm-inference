Elasticity of demand measures how much the quantity demanded of a good responds to a change in the price of that good. Generally, goods with readily available substitutes and those that are not necessities tend to have more elastic demand. While water, bread, and salt are considered necessities with relatively inelastic demand (people need them regardless of price changes), pork has more substitutes (e.g., chicken, beef, fish) and thus its demand is more responsive to price changes."
