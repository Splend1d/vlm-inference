In order to legitimise the inter-state interventions required by R2P, Westphalian notions of sovereignty are invoked, specifically the idea that intervention is required to assure international security. \n\nR2P actually challenges the traditional Westphalian notion of sovereignty, which holds that states have an absolute right to govern themselves without external interference. Instead, R2P argues that sovereignty comes with responsibilities, including the responsibility to protect one's own population from mass atrocities. When a state fails to meet these responsibilities, the international community has a duty to intervene, even if it means overriding the principle of non-interference in a state's internal affairs. Therefore, R2P does not invoke Westphalian notions of sovereignty to justify intervention, but rather redefines sovereignty as a responsibility to protect."
