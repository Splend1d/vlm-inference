The uncle knew that the teen had five license suspensions, several negligence lawsuits against him, multiple DUIs, and that he was an inveterate alcoholic. The teenager got into an accident while driving the car and was seriously injured. He filed a negligent entrustment claim against the uncle, claiming he owed him a duty not to give control of the vehicle to him. The uncle filed a motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim, asserting that there was no tort for first-party negligent entrustment. The trial court granted the motion to dismiss. On appeal, will the court likely affirm the lower court decision?\n\nA. Yes, because public policy generally forbids the collection of damages by the person to whom the entrustment is made.\nB. Yes, because the comparative negligence of the entrustee will always defeat liability against the entrustor.\nC. No, because public policy demands that the entrustor is strictly liable to all who are injured, including the incompetent entrustee.\nD. No, because a first-party negligent entrustment claim is generally allowed when the entrustor knows that he is loaning the vehicle to an incompetent operator.\n"

No, because a first-party negligent entrustment claim is generally allowed when the entrustor knows that he is loaning the vehicle to an incompetent operator.\n\nIn cases of negligent entrustment, the plaintiff must typically show that the defendant entrusted a dangerous instrumentality (in this case, a car) to someone whom they knew or should have known was incompetent or unfit to use it safely. Given the facts presented, where the uncle was aware of the teenager's history of license suspensions, negligence lawsuits, DUIs, and alcoholism, it could be argued that the uncle acted negligently in entrusting the car to the teenager. This knowledge on the part of the uncle supports a claim of negligent entrustment. Therefore, the appellate court is likely to reverse the lower court's decision to dismiss the complaint if the jurisdiction recognizes a first-party negligent entrustment claim under these circumstances."
