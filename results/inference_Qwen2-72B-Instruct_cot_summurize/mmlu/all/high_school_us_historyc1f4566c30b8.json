But we do not have the right to resort to violence\u2014or the threat of violence\u2014when we don't get our way. Our founders constructed a system of government so that reason could prevail over fear. Oklahoma City proved once again that without the law there is no freedom. Criticism is part of the lifeblood of democracy. No one is right all the time. But we should remember that there is a big difference between criticizing a policy or a politician and demonizing the government that guarantees our freedoms and the public servants who enforce our laws.\"\nPresident Bill Clinton, \"What We Learned in Oklahoma City,\" 2010\n(Written on the 15th anniversary of the Oklahoma City bombing)\n\"If there would not have been a Waco, I would have put down roots somewhere and not been so unsettled with the fact that my government\u2026was a threat to me. Everything that Waco implies was on the forefront of my thoughts. That sort of guided my path for the next couple of years.\"\nTimothy McVeigh, Oklahoma City bomber, 2001\nU.S. Representative John Conyers, Events Surrounding the Branch Davidian Cult Standoff in Waco, Texas: Hearing Before the Committee on the Judiciary, House of Representatives, 1993\nThe above excerpts most closely support which of the following inferences?\n\nA. In the 1990s, anti-government sentiment, in response to excessive uses of federal power to resolve domestic conflicts, inspired militia groups and lone vigilantes, such as Timothy McVeigh.\nB. In 1993 Attorney General Janet Reno launched an offensive against the Branch Davidian cult led by Timothy McVeigh, later drawing criticism from Congress for her heavy-handed approach.\nC. Fearing a rise in anti-government sentiment after the Oklahoma City bombing, Attorney General Janet Reno sent troops to quell the Branch Davidian Cult Standoff, and later faced congressional criticism.\nD. Attorney General Janet Reno resigned from office in part due to Congressional pressure put on President Clinton by Representative John Conyers.\n"

Timothy McVeigh's quote indicates that his actions were influenced by his perception of government overreach, specifically referencing the Waco siege, which was a significant event in the development of anti-government sentiments among some militia groups and individuals in the 1990s.\n\nThe excerpt from U.S. Representative John Conyers refers to the hearings concerning the events surrounding the Branch Davidian standoff in Waco, Texas, which was a highly controversial incident involving the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The Waco siege did contribute to the growth of anti-government sentiment among certain groups, which is consistent with inference A.\n\nThe other options (B, C, and D) either misrepresent the facts or make assertions not supported by the provided information. There is no mention of Attorney General Janet Reno launching an offensive against the Branch Davidian cult led by Timothy McVeigh, sending troops to quell the Branch Davidian Cult Standoff, or resigning from office due to congressional pressure. Additionally, Timothy McVeigh was not involved in the leadership of the Branch Davidian cult; he was inspired by the events at Waco but acted independently in carrying out the Oklahoma City bombing."
