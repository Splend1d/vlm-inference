Work a high stress job while their children are at home are both examples of work-family conflict for middle-aged adults. Caring for an ailing parent or dealing with the responsibilities of being an executor of an estate while trying to maintain a career can create significant stress and strain on an individual's personal and professional life. Similarly, working a high-stress job while also managing the demands of parenting can lead to feelings of burnout and difficulty balancing work and family responsibilities. Option C is not necessarily a direct example of work-family conflict, although it could certainly contribute to financial stress and potentially impact an individual's ability to provide for themselves and their family. Option D could also contribute to work-family conflict if the responsibilities of serving as an executor significantly impact an individual's ability to perform their job duties."
