Thrust\n\nThrust is the force generated by the engine(s) that propels the aircraft in the direction of motion. Lift is the force that acts perpendicular to the direction of motion and keeps the aircraft airborne, drag opposes the motion of the aircraft through the air, and weight is the force due to gravity acting downwards on the aircraft."
