The manufacturer answered, denying all liability and stating that it had never supplied its insulation to the worker's employer. The worker's attorney deposed the manufacturer's president, and the manufacturer's attorney deposed the worker. Immediately thereafter, the manufacturer moved for summary judgment on the ground that the worker had no evidence showing that the insulation had ever been used by the worker's employer. What would be the worker's best response to the motion for summary judgment?\n\nA. Argue that more time is needed for additional discovery to show the manufacturer's liability, and attach a declaration describing the desired discovery.\nB. Argue that the motion should be denied, because a central issue in the case will be the manufacturer's credibility on the question of its distribution of the insulation, and only a jury can decide questions of credibility.\nC. Argue that the motion should be denied, because the manufacturer failed to attach any evidence to its motion to show that the insulation was not used by the worker's employer.\nD. Make a cross-motion for summary judgment arguing that the manufacturer has introduced no evidence to show that its insulation did not harm the worker.\n"

In this case, the worker could argue that there is a genuine dispute as to whether the manufacturer's insulation was used by the worker's employer, which is a material fact in the case. This dispute involves issues of credibility, which are typically reserved for the jury to decide. By arguing that the motion should be denied on these grounds, the worker's attorney can preserve the opportunity for a jury to hear the case and make a determination based on the evidence presented at trial. Additionally, if the worker's attorney believes that further discovery may uncover evidence supporting the worker's claim, they could also request additional time for discovery under option A. However, option B is likely the stronger argument in response to the motion for summary judgment."
