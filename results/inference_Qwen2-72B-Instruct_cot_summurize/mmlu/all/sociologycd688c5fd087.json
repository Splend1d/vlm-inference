Warner and Myrdal argued that despite the legal end of slavery and the theoretical promise of citizenship and equal rights, African Americans continued to face systemic discrimination in housing, employment, education, and other areas of life in the North American cities. This discrimination made it difficult for them to fully integrate into the 'ethnic melting pot' of these cities."
