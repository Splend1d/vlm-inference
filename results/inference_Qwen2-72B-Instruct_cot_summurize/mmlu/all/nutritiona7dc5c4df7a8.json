Because some metabolic pathways are altered in sick people, which changes their micronutrient requirements.\nD.

                    "text": "The correct answer is D. An acute phase reaction results in changes in inter-tissue distributions of certain micronutrients.\n\nDuring infections or inflammatory states, the body undergoes an acute phase response, which can affect the levels of various proteins and nutrients in the blood. This response includes changes in the distribution and metabolism of micronutrients. For instance, some micronutrients may be sequestered into the liver or other tissues where they are needed for the immune response or to fight infection, leading to lower concentrations in the plasma or serum. This can result in biochemical indices that suggest a deficiency when, in fact, the micronutrients are being utilized differently due to the body's response to illness. Therefore, interpreting micronutrient status based on plasma or serum levels during these conditions can be misleading."
