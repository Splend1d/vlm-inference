In traditional CRT (Cathode Ray Tube) TVs, the screen is coated with phosphors that emit red, green, and blue light when struck by electrons. These three primary colors can be combined in various intensities to produce all other colors. To create the color yellow, the red and green phosphors are activated simultaneously at high intensity while the blue phosphor is not activated or is activated at a very low intensity."
