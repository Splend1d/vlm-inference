Ankara became the capital of Turkey in 1923, replacing Istanbul (then known as Constantinople), while Islamabad was built in the 1960s to replace Karachi as the capital of Pakistan. Both cities were chosen for their strategic locations and potential for development rather than any pre-existing status or infrastructure."
