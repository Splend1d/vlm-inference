It limits the dangers of factionalism by diluting political power.\n\nThe Federalist Papers, particularly Federalist No. 10 written by James Madison, discuss the problem of factions and how a representative republican form of government can mitigate their negative impacts. Madison argues that under a federal system, with power divided between national and state governments, no single faction can easily gain control over the entire government. This dispersion of power makes it more difficult for factions to impose their will on others or to threaten the stability of the government. By having a large republic, many competing interests and factions exist, which prevents any one group from becoming too dominant."
