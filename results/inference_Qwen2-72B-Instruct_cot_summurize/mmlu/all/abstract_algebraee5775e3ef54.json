A permutation of a set is a rearrangement of its elements into a sequence or linear order. In other words, a permutation is a bijection (one-to-one correspondence) from the set onto itself. Since a permutation maps each element of the set to exactly one other element in the set without any duplicates, it is indeed a one-to-one function.\n\nStatement 2: \"Every function is a permutation if and only if it is one to one.\"\n\nThis statement is false. For a function to be a permutation, it must not only be one-to-one but also map the domain onto itself (i.e., it must be both one-to-one and onto, making it a bijection). There are many one-to-one functions that are not permutations because their codomain is not the same as their domain or they do not cover every element of the codomain. For example, the function f(x) = x^3 from real numbers to real numbers is one-to-one, but it is not a permutation unless you restrict the domain and codomain to the same finite set.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. True, False."
