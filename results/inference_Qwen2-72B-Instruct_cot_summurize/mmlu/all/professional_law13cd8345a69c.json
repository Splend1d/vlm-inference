In general, there are three levels of scrutiny that courts may apply when reviewing laws: strict scrutiny, intermediate scrutiny, and rational basis review.\n\nIf the court applies strict scrutiny, then option A must be true: the law must be necessary to achieve a compelling government purpose. This standard is applied in cases involving fundamental rights or suspect classifications, such as race or national origin.\n\nIf the court applies intermediate scrutiny, then option B must be true: the law must be substantially related to an important government purpose. This standard is applied in cases involving quasi-suspect classifications, such as gender or legitimacy.\n\nIf the court applies rational basis review, then option C must be true: the law must be rationally related to a legitimate government purpose. This standard is applied in most other cases where no fundamental right or suspect classification is involved.\n\nTherefore, without knowing which level of scrutiny the court will apply, it is impossible to determine which option must be true. However, if we assume that the court will apply rational basis review (which is the most common level of scrutiny), then option C would be the correct answer. If we assume that the court will apply intermediate scrutiny, then option B would be the correct answer. And if we assume that the court will apply strict scrutiny, then option A would be the correct answer."
