Shortly thereafter, the woman's financial condition worsened significantly, but she failed to disclose this fact to the bank. Unaware of the woman's changed financial condition, the bank then agreed to lend money to the woman. The bank later learned of the woman's true financial condition. The bank refused to honor its promise to lend money to the woman, contending that the parties' contract was voidable at the bank's option because of the woman's misrepresentation. If the woman sues the bank for breach of contract, will the bank's misrepresentation defense likely succeed?\n\nA. No, because the woman did not make any subsequent affirmative misrepresentations about her financial condition.\nB. No, because the woman's representations were accurate at the time she submitted the loan application to the bank.\nC. Yes, because the woman had an obligation to correct her previous representations about her financial condition in order to prevent them from being fraudulent.\nD. Yes, because the woman had an obligation to tell the bank about her changed financial condition due to the longstanding relationship of trust and confidence between them.\n"

Yes, because the woman had an obligation to correct her previous representations about her financial condition in order to prevent them from being fraudulent.\n\nIn this scenario, the woman's failure to update her financial information after a significant change could be seen as a form of fraud by omission. When there is a duty to disclose information, failing to do so can be just as deceptive as making a false statement. This duty often arises when there is a material change in circumstances that would affect the decision-making process of the other party, especially if the relationship involves trust and confidence, as suggested by the long-standing relationship between the woman and the bank. Therefore, the bank's misrepresentation defense is likely to succeed based on the principle that the woman should have updated her financial information to reflect her current status."
