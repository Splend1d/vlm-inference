May lead to intestinal obstruction\n\nCrohn's disease can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract from mouth to anus, but it commonly involves the ileum (end of the small intestine) and/or colon. It is characterized by inflammation that extends through all layers of the bowel wall. This chronic inflammation can lead to strictures (narrowing of the intestine), which may result in an intestinal obstruction.\n\nWhile surgery may be necessary in some cases to manage complications such as severe inflammation, fistulas, or obstructions, it is not always the best treatment option for Crohn's disease. Medications such as immunosuppressants, biologics, and corticosteroids are often used to induce and maintain remission.\n\nA gluten-free diet is not typically required for the management of Crohn's disease unless the patient also has celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. Dietary modifications can help manage symptoms, but there is no one-size-fits-all diet for Crohn's disease patients."
