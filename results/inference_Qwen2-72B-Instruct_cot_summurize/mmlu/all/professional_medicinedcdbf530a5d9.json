She had been having regular contractions every 4\u00a0minutes, but is now having only a few intermittent, weak contractions. She has received medication for pain twice in the past 6\u00a0hours. Examination shows no reason for obstructed labor. The fetal head is engaged, the membranes are intact, the fetal heart tones are normal, and the cervix is 100%\u00a0effaced and 7\u00a0cm dilated. The most appropriate management is to\n\nA. administer an epidural anesthetic\nB. administer tocolytic therapy\nC. apply cervical topical corticosteroids\nD. augment the labor with oxytocin\n"

Oxytocin is commonly used in such situations to help speed up the process of labor when contractions are not strong enough or frequent enough to progress labor effectively."
