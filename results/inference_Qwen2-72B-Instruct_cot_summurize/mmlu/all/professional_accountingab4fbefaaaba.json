This statement is incorrect because in periods of rising prices, the LIFO method results in a higher cost of sales and lower taxable income, not the opposite.\n\nB. This statement is incorrect because once approved by the IRS to use the LIFO method, a taxpayer does not need to seek permission each year to continue using it. Approval is generally permanent.\n\nD. This statement is incorrect because under the LIFO method, the inventory on hand at the end of the year is treated as being composed of the most recently acquired goods, not the earliest.\n\nRegarding option C, while a company must use the same inventory accounting method for both tax and financial reporting purposes under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) in the U.S., there is an exception for companies that have received IRS approval to use LIFO for tax purposes. These companies may use FIFO or another method for financial reporting purposes. However, it should be noted that this exception applies only to public companies and certain large private companies. Smaller private companies are required to use the same inventory method for both tax and financial reporting."
