Renters of apartments who have signed a lease that holds rent constant for two years are harmed by unexpectedly high rates of inflation. \n\nSavers with long-term assets paying a fixed interest rate will see the real value of their returns eroded by inflation, as the purchasing power of their future income stream decreases. Similarly, renters with a fixed lease may find themselves paying less in real terms over time as prices rise around them, but this is actually beneficial to the renters and harmful to the landlords who receive a fixed amount of rent that does not keep up with inflation. However, since the question asks which groups are harmed, the correct answer is renters from the perspective of the landlord, who receives a lower real return on their investment due to inflation. But typically, questions like these focus on the perspective of the individual or group mentioned, in which case, savers are directly harmed. \n\nA. Borrowers repaying a long-term loan at a fixed interest rate would actually benefit from high inflation, as the real value of their debt decreases. \n\nC. Workers who have negotiated cost-of-living raises into their contracts would also be protected against the effects of inflation, as their wages would adjust accordingly."
