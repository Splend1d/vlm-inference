(i), (ii), and (iii)\n\nThe use of panel data, which combines cross-sectional and time-series data, offers several advantages over pure cross-sectional or pure time-series modelling:\n\n(i) Panel data can increase the number of degrees of freedom because it typically includes more observations than either a pure cross-sectional or time-series dataset would have on its own. This larger sample size can enhance the statistical power of tests.\n\n(ii) With panel data, it is possible to allow the average value of the dependent variable to vary across different entities (cross-sectionally) and/or over time. This variation can provide insights into how the dependent variable changes under different conditions or periods.\n\n(iii) Panel data also allows researchers to estimate relationships that may vary either cross-sectionally or over time. For example, the effect of an independent variable on a dependent variable might differ for different entities or at different times. This feature can lead to more nuanced and accurate models.\n\nTherefore, all three statements (i), (ii), and (iii) are correct advantages of using panel data."
