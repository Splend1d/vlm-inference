Your liver cells contain the same DNA as your white blood cells.\n\nExplanation: All somatic (non-reproductive) cells in your body have the same DNA, which includes liver cells and white blood cells. This means that option A is correct. \n\nOption B is incorrect because most of the DNA in your liver cells will not be transcribed at all. Only a small portion of the genome is actively transcribed at any given time, depending on the cell type and its current needs.\n\nOption C is partially correct but not the best answer since it implies that \"most\" of the DNA is transcribed, which is not true. Some portions of the DNA are transcribed and then translated into proteins in the cytoplasm, but this does not apply to most of the DNA.\n\nOption D is incorrect because while liver cells do have specific functions such as storing glycogen, they do not contain genes that are not present in other cells. The genes that are responsible for the specific functions of liver cells are simply expressed in liver cells and not in other types of cells."
