When drugs are withdrawn from a sealed vial, fragments of the rubber bung can be cut out by the needle.\n\n'Coring' refers to the process where a piece of the rubber stopper or septum of a medication vial becomes dislodged and enters the syringe when a healthcare provider draws up medication. This can contaminate the medication and potentially cause harm to the patient if the rubber fragment is injected. To prevent coring, proper technique should be used when inserting the needle into the vial, such as using a sharp needle and ensuring it does not touch the inside of the vial's rubber stopper."
