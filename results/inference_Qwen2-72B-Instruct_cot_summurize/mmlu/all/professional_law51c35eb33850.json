At the time that the crime occurred, this jurisdiction required a unanimous verdict of all 12 jury members for a conviction on a capital offense. On November 1, the state legislature enacted a new law requiring a majority vote of seven of 12 jurors to convict on a capital offense. The defendant's trial began on December 1. He was subsequently convicted of murder by an eight- to-four vote. Following the trial, the defendant's attorney filed a motion to set aside the verdict. Which of the following would provide the strongest constitutional grounds to overturn the verdict?\n\nA. The ex post facto clause.\nB. The contracts clause.\nC. The due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nD. The Sixth Amendment right to a fair trial.\n"

                    "text": "The strongest constitutional grounds to overturn the verdict in this case would be the ex post facto clause of the United States Constitution. The ex post facto clause is found in Article I, Section 10 of the Constitution and it prohibits states from passing any law that has a retroactive effect, which would include changing the rules of evidence or the degree of proof necessary to convict someone of a crime after the crime has been committed.\n\nIn this case, the defendant was charged with murder before the new law reducing the number of jurors needed for a conviction on a capital offense was passed. Therefore, applying the new law to the defendant's case would violate the ex post facto clause because it would have a retroactive effect, changing the legal consequences of actions that were taken before the enactment of the law. The defendant should have been tried under the laws that were in effect at the time the crime was committed, which required a unanimous verdict for a conviction on a capital offense.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\nA. The ex post facto clause."
