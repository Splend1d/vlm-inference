On the one hand, naturalism is based on a set of rules that are of universal and objective scope and on the other hand, positivism is based on a structured and coherent legal system that is created by States in light of their interests and desires\nB. While naturalism serves only the theory human rights law, positivism has a wider and more general scope\nC. Naturalism concerns the underpinning values of the international society, while positivism the international rules as such\nD. Naturalism is a school of thought advocated outside of Europe, while positivism is Euro-centric theory\n"

Naturalism concerns the underpinning values of the international society, while positivism the international rules as such.\n\nNaturalism holds that there are certain fundamental moral principles or values that are inherent in human nature or the natural order of things, which should guide the creation and interpretation of laws. These principles are often associated with concepts like justice, equality, and human dignity.\n\nPositivism, on the other hand, asserts that the validity of a law is not dependent on its moral content but rather on its source and the fact that it has been enacted by a recognized authority. According to positivists, a rule becomes a law when it is established through the proper channels of a sovereign state or an international organization, regardless of whether it conforms to any supposed higher moral order.\n\nOptions A, B, and D do not accurately capture the core distinction between naturalism and positivism. Option A conflates positivism with a specific type of legal system (created by states) and option B incorrectly suggests that positivism has a broader scope than naturalism. Option D introduces a geographical bias that does not reflect the philosophical underpinnings of either theory."
