His pulse is 72/min, and blood pressure is 104/68 mm Hg. He is sitting upright and appears catatonic. Physical examination shows rigidity. During the examination, he becomes hostile and attempts to assault the physician. This patient most likely ingested which of the following drugs?\n\nA. Diazepam\nB. Methamphetamine\nC. Oxycodone\nD.

PCP can cause dissociative effects, leading to a disconnect from reality, as well as muscle rigidity and, in some cases, violent or erratic behavior.\n\nA. Diazepam typically causes sedation, not aggression or rigidity.\nB. Methamphetamine could potentially cause agitation, but it does not typically result in the catatonic state described.\nC. Oxycodone would likely cause sedation and respiratory depression, not the symptoms described.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. PCP (phencyclidine)"
