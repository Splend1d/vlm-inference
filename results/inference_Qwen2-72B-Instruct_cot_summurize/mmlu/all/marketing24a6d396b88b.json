Causal\n\nCausal research is designed to understand cause-and-effect relationships, which makes it ideal for determining how changes in one variable (price) affect another (sales volume or revenue). By manipulating the price of the product and observing the outcomes in terms of sales, the company can identify the optimal price point for maximizing profits or achieving other objectives. This type of research often involves experiments or quasi-experiments to control for other variables and isolate the effect of the independent variable (price) on the dependent variable (sales)."
