This is not necessarily a fallacy in itself, but it can lead to logical fallacies if the components of the compound proposition are not properly analyzed or if they are presented in such a way as to obscure the complexity of the issue. For instance, a complex question (also known as a many questions fallacy) might result if someone asks a question that assumes several things at once without giving the respondent a chance to address each assumption separately. However, the direct answer to your question is that including multiple claims leads to a compound proposition."
