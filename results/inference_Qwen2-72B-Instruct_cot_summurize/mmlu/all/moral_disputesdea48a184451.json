It also involves the idea of alternative actions open to the agent, as the agent must consider the potential outcomes of different actions in order to determine which one will produce the best overall outcome. Additionally, consequentialism is often considered a strongly impartialist moral theory, as it requires agents to consider the interests of all affected parties equally when making moral decisions, rather than giving priority to the interests of any particular individual or group."
