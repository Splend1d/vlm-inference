Bias increase ; Variance decrease\n\nAdding $\\ell_2$ regularization (also known as Ridge Regression) to a linear regression model increases the bias of the model because it restricts the magnitude of the coefficients. This restriction causes the model to be less sensitive to the specific data points, leading to a higher bias. However, this regularization also decreases the variance of the model because it reduces the impact of individual data points on the model's predictions, making the model more robust to fluctuations in the training data. Therefore, as you increase the $\\ell_2$ regularization coefficient, the bias of the model will increase while the variance will decrease."
