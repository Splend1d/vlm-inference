The population variances from the two groups are equal.\n\nWhen conducting an independent samples t-test, one of the assumptions is that the variances of the populations from which the two samples are drawn are equal (this is also known as the assumption of homogeneity of variance). This assumption is important because it affects the calculation of the test statistic and the validity of the results. If the variances are significantly different, then a different version of the t-test should be used, such as Welch's t-test, which does not assume equal variances.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that while C is a common assumption for a standard independent samples t-test, D (that the populations of SAT scores from each group are normally distributed) is also an important assumption. Violations of this assumption can also affect the validity of the t-test results. In practice, both C and D are often assumed or checked before conducting a t-test."
