Shunt capacitors are used to provide reactive power locally, which can help maintain voltage levels.\n\nB. Series capacitors are used to increase the voltage drop across the transmission line, effectively increasing the power transfer capability and improving voltage stability.\n\nC. Generation excitation control is used to regulate the voltage output of generators, which can help maintain system voltage levels.\n\nThese methods are commonly used in power systems to improve power quality and system stability."
