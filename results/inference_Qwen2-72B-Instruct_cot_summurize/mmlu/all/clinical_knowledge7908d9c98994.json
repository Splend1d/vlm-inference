An accumulation of inorganic phosphate.\n\nDuring high-intensity, short-duration exercises such as multiple sprint activities, phosphocreatine (PCr) breakdown provides energy rapidly for ATP resynthesis. This process results in the accumulation of inorganic phosphate (Pi), which can lead to a decrease in intracellular pH and contribute to peripheral muscle fatigue. The other options listed do not directly relate to the development of peripheral muscle fatigue during multiple sprint activities:\n\nB. Hyperosmolality in the muscles is not a common factor in causing peripheral muscle fatigue during these types of activities.\n\nC. An excess of antioxidants would actually help protect against oxidative stress and may potentially aid in reducing muscle damage and fatigue.\n\nD. A lack of potassium could cause muscle weakness or cramps, but it is not the primary factor in the development of peripheral muscle fatigue during multiple sprint activities."
