This includes obtaining a current letter of representation from management, which confirms that management is aware of their responsibilities and acknowledges that they have provided all relevant information to the auditor. This helps to ensure that the financial statements are still accurate and that the auditor's report can be appropriately reissued. The other options may be relevant in certain circumstances but are not the primary consideration when reissuing an auditor's report."
