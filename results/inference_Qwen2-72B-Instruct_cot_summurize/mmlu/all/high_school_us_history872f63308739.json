We charge that the controlling influences dominating both these parties have permitted the existing dreadful conditions to develop without serious effort to prevent or restrain them. Neither do they now promise us any substantial reform. They have agreed together to ignore, in the coming campaign, every issue but one. They propose to drown the outcries of a plundered people with the uproar of a sham battle over the tariff, so that capitalists, corporations, national banks, rings, trusts, watered stock, the demonetization of silver and the oppressions of the usurers may all be lost sight of. They propose to sacrifice our homes, lives, and children on the altar of mammon; to destroy the multitude in order to secure corruption funds from the millionaires.\n\"Assembled on the anniversary of the birthday of the nation, and filled with the spirit of the grand general and chief who established our independence, we seek to restore the government of the Republic to the hands of 'the plain people,' with which class it originated. We assert our purposes to be identical with the purposes of the National Constitution; to form a more perfect union and establish justice, insure domestic tranquillity, provide for the common defence, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty for ourselves and our posterity.\"\nPopulist Party Platform, 1892\nThe sentiments expressed in the excerpt above about political parties are most similar to those expressed by\n\nA. George McGovern, Democratic Party, 1972\nB. Theodore Roosevelt, Progressive Party, 1912\nC. Andrew Jackson, Democratic Party, 1829\nD. H. Ross Perot, Reform Party, 1996\n"

                    "text": "The sentiments expressed in the excerpt are most similar to those expressed by B. Theodore Roosevelt, Progressive Party, 1912. The Populist Party Platform of 1892 and Theodore Roosevelt's platform as the leader of the Progressive Party (also known as the Bull Moose Party) in 1912 share a critique of the two major political parties of their times (Democratic and Republican) for being controlled by special interests and failing to address the needs of the common people. Both advocate for reforms aimed at increasing democracy and reducing the influence of corporate and financial interests in politics.\n\nWhile the other figures mentioned also had critiques of the political system, Theodore Roosevelt's platform was particularly aligned with the Populist sentiment in terms of its anti-corporate stance and call for progressive reforms. Roosevelt's campaign in 1912 was notable for its emphasis on breaking up monopolies, regulating big business, and promoting social welfare policies, echoing the Populists' concerns about the concentration of wealth and power in the hands of a few."
