He was a successful and celebrated author, had a large family, and enjoyed wealth and social status. However, despite these outward signs of happiness, Tolstoy experienced a profound spiritual crisis in the 1870s, leading him to question the meaning of life and the nature of faith. This crisis ultimately led to his conversion and a significant shift in his philosophical and religious views."
