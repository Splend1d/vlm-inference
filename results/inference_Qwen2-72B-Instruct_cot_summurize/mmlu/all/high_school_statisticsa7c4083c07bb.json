They found that patients who drank at least three cups of green tea per day had a much lower incidence of depression. In an American newspaper article about this study, which of the following statements should not be made?\n\nA. It is possible that people who drink green tea also tend to have healthier lifestyles than those who don't.\nB. It is possible that people who drink green tea also tend to have a more positive outlook on life than those who don't.\nC. Because this is observational data, the association between drinking green tea and a lower incidence of depression is not an indication of a causal relationship.\nD. People who want to avoid depression should consider drinking green tea on a daily basis.\n"

People who want to avoid depression should consider drinking green tea on a daily basis.\n\nThis statement implies causation where there may only be correlation. The study observed an association between green tea consumption and a lower incidence of depression, but it did not establish that drinking green tea causes a reduction in depression. There could be other factors involved that contribute to both green tea consumption and lower rates of depression, or the relationship might be reversed (e.g., people with less depression might be more likely to engage in healthy behaviors like drinking green tea). Without further research, such as randomized controlled trials, it would be premature to recommend green tea as a strategy for avoiding depression."
