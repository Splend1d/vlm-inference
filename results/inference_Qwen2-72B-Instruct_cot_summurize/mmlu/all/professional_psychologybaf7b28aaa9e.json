This is analogous to the therapist-client relationship in individual therapy. The alliance includes factors such as trust, mutual understanding, and cooperation, which are essential for effective therapy. While the other options (universality, identification, and cohesiveness) are important aspects of group therapy, they do not specifically refer to the therapeutic relationship in the same way that \"alliance\" does."
