Alpha-thalassaemia - This could be correct, especially in cases of Hemoglobin H disease (a form of alpha-thalassaemia) and Hydrops fetalis due to alpha-thalassaemia major, which can lead to severe anemia even in utero.\n\nB. Beta-thalassaemia - Typically, beta-thalassaemia major (also known as Cooley's anemia) presents with severe anaemia around 6 months of age when the fetal hemoglobin levels drop and cannot compensate for the defective beta-globin chains. However, it does not usually present with severe anaemia at birth.\n\nC. Hereditary persistence of fetal haemoglobin - This condition is characterized by a higher than normal level of fetal hemoglobin into adulthood, which typically does not cause severe anemia at birth.\n\nD. Sickle cell disease - While sickle cell disease can cause severe anemia, it often doesn't present with such severity at birth. Symptoms may become more apparent later in infancy or early childhood.\n\nGiven these explanations, **A. Alpha-thalassaemia** is the most likely answer for severe anaemia at birth. However, the specific type of alpha-thalassaemia (such as Hydrops fetalis) would need to be specified for this to be absolutely accurate, as not all forms of alpha-thalassaemia present with severe anaemia at birth."
