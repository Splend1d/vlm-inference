This is a crucial step in preventing polyspermy, where an increase in intracellular free calcium triggers the release of proteolytic enzymes that alter the zona pellucida, making it impermeable to additional sperm. However, it's worth noting that the question might be slightly confusing as the term \"zona reaction\" isn't typically used in this context; the zona pellucida is involved, but the specific reaction being described is the cortical reaction."
