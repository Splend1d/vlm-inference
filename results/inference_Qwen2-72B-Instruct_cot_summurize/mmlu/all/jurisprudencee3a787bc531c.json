Principles describe rights, policies describe goals.\n\nDworkin argues that principles are standards that courts should apply when making decisions, particularly in cases involving fundamental rights and liberties. Policies, on the other hand, are more general goals or objectives that the government might pursue, such as promoting public health or safety. Principles are often linked to moral or ethical considerations, whereas policies may be driven by pragmatic concerns."
