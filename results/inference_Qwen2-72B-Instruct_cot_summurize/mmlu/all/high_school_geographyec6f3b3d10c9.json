Egypt is a sovereign state located in northeastern Africa. \n\nAntarctica is not considered a state as it is governed by international treaty and is not claimed by any single nation. American Samoa is an unincorporated territory of the United States, and while it has its own government, it is not a sovereign state. The Marshall Islands is a sovereign state, but it is not one of the options listed in your question. However, if the question was multiple choice and you had to pick all that apply, then both C (Egypt) and D (Marshall Islands) would be correct answers."
