Reading someone else's mail without their permission is not only morally wrong but also illegal under federal law in the United States.\n\nScenario 2 involves academic dishonesty, which is also considered morally wrong. Asking someone else to write your essay for you constitutes cheating and undermines the educational process. It violates principles of fairness and integrity in learning institutions."
