This is because the proposed increase in the gasoline tax would affect all residents of the county, not just those with school-aged children or those whose children attend county schools. The impact of the tax increase could potentially be felt by all residents through various means, including but not limited to, increased prices for goods and services due to higher transportation costs, changes in public spending priorities, or shifts in the local economy. Therefore, the entire population of county residents would have a stake in whether or not the gasoline tax is increased."
