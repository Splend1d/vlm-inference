Sally has an adult conviction for vehicular homicide. She was charged with driving a car in a reckless manner resulting in the death of her sister, a passenger in the car. Sally pleaded nolo contendere, was adjudicated guilty and received a suspended sentence although she could have received a sentence of state imprisonment up to 5 years. At trial, evidence of this conviction is\n\nA. admissible to impeach Sally because vehicular homicide carries a maximum penalty in excess of 1 year.\nB. inadmissible to impeach Sally because she never admitted her guilt since she entered a plea of nolo contendere.\nC. inadmissible to impeach Sally because she received a suspended sentence.\nD. inadmissible to impeach Sally because she is only a witness and not the criminal defendant.\n"

A plea of nolo contendere (no contest) results in a conviction for purposes of impeachment, even though it is not an admission of guilt. The fact that Sally received a suspended sentence does not affect the admissibility of the conviction for impeachment purposes. Furthermore, the rule applies equally to all witnesses, not just defendants."
