In its absence, these factors are not properly activated and remain in an inactive form leading to a condition known as hypoprothrombinemia. This results in prolonged clotting times, bleeding tendencies, and bruising easily. It does not affect the plasma concentration of calcitonin (option A) or cause hemolysis (option D). Prothrombin levels (option B) would actually decrease, not increase, in vitamin K deficiency."
