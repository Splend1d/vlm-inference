They ascribe to the men of the preceding age a wisdom more than human, and suppose what they did to be beyond amendment\u2026.But I know also, that laws and institutions must go hand in hand with the progress of the human mind. As that becomes more developed, more enlightened, as new discoveries are made, new truths disclosed, and manners and opinions change with the change of circumstances, institutions must advance also, and keep pace with the times.\"\nThomas Jefferson, 1816\nWhich of the following statements is most accurate regarding the existence of political parties in the early United States?\n\nA. After the drafting of the Constitution, continued debates about states' rights and competing economic interests led to the formation of political parties, such as the Federalists and the Democratic-Republicans.\nB. Although Washington warned against the influence of political parties, he reluctantly accepted the endorsement of the Federalist party.\nC. Political parties did not exist until the War of 1812, when Federalists asserted control over foreign policies with France and Britain.\nD.

The Federalists and Democratic-Republicans emerged from the differing views on the interpretation of the Constitution and the balance of power between state and federal governments. The Federalists, led by Alexander Hamilton, generally supported a strong central government and a broad interpretation of the Constitution, while the Democratic-Republicans, led by Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, favored a more limited federal government and stronger state sovereignty. These two parties dominated American politics during the early years of the nation's history."
