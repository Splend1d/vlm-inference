Medical history is remarkable for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. The patient is 180 cm (5 ft 11 in) tall and weighs 82 kg (180 lb); BMI is 25 kg/m2 . ECG obtained in the emergency department showed atrial fibrillation with narrow QRS complex. Pulse was 146/min. Physical examination was remarkable for rapid heart rate. The patient was given oxygen via nasal cannula and intravenous metoprolol 5 mg every 5 minutes for a total of 15 mg. His pulse slowed to 90/min. Two hours after admission, he is pain free but his pulse is now 160/min. Blood pressure is 122/78 mm Hg. In order to decrease the patient's pulse, which of the following should be administered intravenously?\n\nA. Digoxin\nB. Enalapril\nC. Lidocaine\nD. Metoprolol\n"

Digoxin.\n\nIn this case, the patient has a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and is experiencing a recurrence with a high heart rate despite initial treatment with metoprolol. Digoxin is a medication commonly used to control heart rate in patients with atrial fibrillation by slowing conduction through the AV node. It can be administered intravenously in acute situations like this one to help manage the tachycardia associated with atrial fibrillation.\n\nEnalapril is an ACE inhibitor used primarily for hypertension and heart failure, not for controlling heart rate in atrial fibrillation. Lidocaine is a local anesthetic and antiarrhythmic agent typically used for ventricular arrhythmias, not atrial fibrillation. Since the patient has already received metoprolol without adequate response, additional doses may not be effective and could potentially lead to hypotension."
