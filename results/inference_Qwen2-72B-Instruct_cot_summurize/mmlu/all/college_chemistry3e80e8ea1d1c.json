Nuclear binding energies have about the same magnitude as chemical bond energies.\n\nNuclear binding energies are actually much larger than chemical bond energies. The typical nuclear binding energy per nucleon is on the order of millions of electron volts (MeV), whereas chemical bond energies are typically a few electron volts (eV). This difference reflects the much stronger forces that hold the nucleus together compared to the forces between atoms in molecules."
