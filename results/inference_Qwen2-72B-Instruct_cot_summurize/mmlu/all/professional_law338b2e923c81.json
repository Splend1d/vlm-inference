As it turned out, the hospital had hired a 52-year-old man as the nurse\u00d5s replacement, a fact that rendered an age discrimination claim unavailable. The hospital responded tothe complaint by filing a motion for sanctions against thenurse\u00d5s attorney. Is the court likely to grant the hospital\u00d5s motion?\n\nA. No, because sanctions are not proper against the attorney of a represented party.\nB. No, because the hospital failed to give the attorney the chance to withdraw the complaint in advance of filing the motion with the court.\nC. Yes, because the nurse\u00d5s attorney failed to conduct areasonable pre-filing inquiry.\nD. Yes, because the nurse\u00d5s complaint contained legal contentions that were not warranted by existing lawbased on the facts in this case.\n"

Yes, because the nurse's attorney failed to conduct a reasonable pre-filing inquiry.\n\nThe attorney should have reasonably investigated the facts of the case before filing the complaint. Given that the replacement was older than the plaintiff, an age discrimination claim would not hold up under scrutiny. This suggests that the attorney did not adequately research or inquire into the facts of the case prior to filing, which could warrant sanctions for failing to meet the standards of due diligence required of attorneys. However, it is important to note that the court's decision would also depend on various other factors including the rules of the specific jurisdiction and any precedents set by previous cases."
