Teotihuac\u00e1n, an ancient Mesoamerican city located in modern-day Mexico, was indeed planned and constructed using a grid layout. This grid system allowed for organized streets, residential compounds, and monumental architecture, reflecting advanced urban planning skills. While some aspects of A (sophisticated plumbing) and C (agricultural hinterland) may also be true to some extent, the most distinctive feature among the options given is its grid pattern. There is no substantial evidence to support option B regarding constant outbreaks of plague and disease."
