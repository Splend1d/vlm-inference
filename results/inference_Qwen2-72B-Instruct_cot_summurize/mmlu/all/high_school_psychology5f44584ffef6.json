The study involved rearing baby rhesus monkeys with surrogate \"mothers\" made of wire and cloth to understand the importance of contact comfort versus feeding for attachment.\n\nThe implications of Harlow's study for humans are significant and include:\n\nI. **Emotional Development and Attachment**: Harlow's work highlighted the critical role of physical contact and emotional support in the development of healthy attachments. This has implications for human child-rearing practices, emphasizing the importance of nurturing and responsive care for infants' psychological well-being.\n\nII. **Impacts of Institutionalization**: The study also shed light on the negative effects of institutionalization or neglect on emotional development. Children who lack consistent, loving caregivers may suffer from attachment disorders and other psychological issues, similar to the monkeys in Harlow's study that exhibited abnormal behaviors when raised without proper maternal contact.\n\nIII. **Role of Surrogate Caregivers**: While not directly addressed in your question options, another implication is the role of surrogate caregivers or objects. Harlow's findings suggest that children might form attachments to objects or individuals that provide comfort and security, which can be beneficial in certain circumstances but can also indicate underlying issues if these attachments are overly strong or replace healthy relationships.\n\nGiven the options provided, the correct answer would be:\n\n**D. I and II only**\n\nThese two points cover the major implications of Harlow's study for human understanding of emotional development and the impacts of institutionalization or neglect."
