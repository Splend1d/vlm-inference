To convert this to U.S. dollars, we multiply by the exchange rate from pesos to dollars:\n\\[116.50 \\text{ pesos} \\times 0.1099 \\frac{\\text{USD}}{\\text{peso}} = 12.79315 \\text{ USD}\\]\n\nNext, we convert the sales price in euros to U.S. dollars:\n\\[20 \\text{ euros} \\times 0.8928 \\frac{\\text{USD}}{\\text{euro}} = 17.856 \\text{ USD}\\]\n\nFinally, we calculate the profit by subtracting the cost from the sales price (both in U.S. dollars):\n\\[17.856 \\text{ USD} - 12.79315 \\text{ USD} = 5.06285 \\text{ USD}\\]\n\nRounding to two decimal places gives us a profit of approximately $5.06.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. $5.06."
