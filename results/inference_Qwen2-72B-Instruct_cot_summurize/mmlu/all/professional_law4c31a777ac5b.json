It is unenforceable, because it was not supported by legally sufficient consideration.\n\nFor a contract to be enforceable, there must be consideration from both parties. Consideration refers to something of value that each party agrees to exchange. In this case, the employee's negotiation of the lucrative contract could be seen as consideration, but the employer's promise of a bonus lacks consideration if it was not conditioned upon the completion of additional work or performance beyond what the employee was already contractually obligated to do. Without new consideration from the employee, the employer's promise to pay the bonus is not legally binding. Additionally, while some contracts require written documentation to be enforceable (such as under the Statute of Frauds), the lack of a written agreement alone does not necessarily make an oral contract unenforceable; the absence of consideration is the more critical issue here."
