This gives you the most comprehensive information about the patient's respiratory status. Dentures do not need to be removed to assess breathing, and while an assessment can be made in less than 30 seconds, it should be done for at least 10 seconds to ensure accuracy. Using a mirror to check for exhaled air is not a standard practice in breathing assessments."
