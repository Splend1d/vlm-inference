RSV is a common respiratory virus that can cause serious infections in some people, including infants and young children. It is a member of the Paramyxoviridae family and is the most common cause of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in children under 1 year of age. While it can cause mild cold-like symptoms in older children and adults, in young children it can lead to severe respiratory illness, including croup."
