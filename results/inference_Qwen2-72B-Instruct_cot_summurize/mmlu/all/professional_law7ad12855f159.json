In order to facilitate the access to the cottage, the sculptor entered into an agreement with a neighbor, an adjoining land owner, whereby the neighbor, in writing, granted the sculptor a right-of-way over a strip of land 30 feet in width and a quarter of a mile in length along the eastern margin of the neighbor's property. After using the roadway for a year, the sculptor and his family moved to Europe for business reasons. The sculptor and his family have not used the cottage for 11 years because of his employment commitment in Europe. During the sculptor's absence, the neighbor constructed an access ramp to his dock, which obstructed the road to the sculptor's cottage. Upon the sculptor's return from Europe, he goes to his lakefront cottage and discovers the obstructing ramp. The sculptor initiates suit against the neighbor to compel him to remove the ramp. The court would most likely\n\nA. hold in the neighbor's favor, because the sculptor's absence for 11 years constituted an abandonment of the easement.\nB. hold in the neighbor's favor, because the dominant owner is under an affirmative duty to notifS' the servient tenement holder of non-use.\nC. hold in the sculptor's favor, because mere non- use, however long continued, will not as a rule effectuate an abandonment.\nD. hold in the sculptor's favor, because of the validity of the agreement for the express grant of the easement.\n"

                    "text": "The court would most likely hold in the sculptor's favor, because of the validity of the agreement for the express grant of the easement (Option D). An easement by express grant, such as the one described in the scenario, is created by a written agreement between two parties and is generally binding on both the grantor and the grantee, as well as their successors in interest. The easement continues to exist until it is legally extinguished, which typically requires either an express release or abandonment by the holder of the easement.\n\nIn this case, there is no evidence that the sculptor intended to abandon the easement; his absence was due to circumstances beyond his control (employment commitment in Europe) and not due to any intention to permanently forego the use of the easement. Mere non-use, without evidence of intent to abandon, does not terminate an easement. Therefore, the neighbor cannot obstruct the easement without the sculptor's consent or a legal determination that the easement has been abandoned or extinguished in some other way."
