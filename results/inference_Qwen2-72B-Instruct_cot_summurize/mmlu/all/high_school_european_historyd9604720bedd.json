I had the culprit burned, explaining that the cause was his having killed that Indian and eaten him[,] which was prohibited by Your Majesty, and by me in Your Royal name. I further made the chief understand that all the people . . . must abstain from this custom. . . . I came . . . to protect their lives as well as their property, and to teach them that they were to adore but one God[,] . . . that they must turn from their idols, and the rites they had practiced until then, for these were lies and deceptions which the devil . . . had invented. . . . I, likewise, had come to teach them that Your Majesty, by the will of Divine Providence, rules the universe, and that they also must submit themselves to the imperial yoke, and do all that we who are Your Majesty's ministers here might order them.\n\u2014Hernan Cortez, Fifth Letter to Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, 1521\nWhich of the following motivations for exploration is most evident from the document above?\n\nA.

European states sought direct access to gold and spices and luxury goods as a means to enhance personal wealth and state power.\nC. Individual captains sought great glory and wealth.\nD. Christianity served as a stimulus for exploration as governments and religious authorities sought to spread the faith and counter Islam, and as a justification for the physical and cultural subjugation of indigenous civilizations.\n"

Christianity served as a stimulus for exploration as governments and religious authorities sought to spread the faith and counter Islam, and as a justification for the physical and cultural subjugation of indigenous civilizations.\n\nIn the passage, Cortez mentions teaching the indigenous people to \"adore but one God\" and to \"turn from their idols,\" indicating a desire to spread Christianity. He also refers to the submission of the people to the imperial yoke of the monarch he serves, linking the spread of religion with political control over the indigenous population."
