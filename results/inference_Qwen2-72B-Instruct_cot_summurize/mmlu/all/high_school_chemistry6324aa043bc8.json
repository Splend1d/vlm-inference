Since the acid is monoprotic, the concentration of \\([A^-]\\) will also be \\(x\\) M. The concentration of the undissociated acid at equilibrium, \\([HA]\\), will be \\((0.060 - x)\\) M.\n\nWe know that:\n\\[\n[H^+] = 10^{-pH} = 10^{-2.0} = 0.010 M\n\\]\n\nSo, \\(x = 0.010\\) M.\n\nNow, since \\(x\\) is much smaller than the initial concentration of the acid (i.e., \\(0.010 << 0.060\\)), we can approximate \\([HA]\\) at equilibrium as \\([HA]_0\\), which means:\n\\[\n[HA] \\approx [HA]_0 = 0.060 M\n\\]\n\nThen, we can write the expression for \\(K_a\\) as follows:\n\\[\nK_a = \\frac{[H^+][A^-]}{[HA]} = \\frac{(0.010)(0.010)}{0.060} = \\frac{0.0001}{0.060} = \\frac{10^{-4}}{6 \\times 10^{-2}} = \\frac{1}{600} = 1.667 \\times 10^{-3}\n\\]\n\nRounding to significant figures, the closest match among the given options is:\n\nD. \\(5.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\)\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the precise calculation yields \\(1.667 \\times 10^{-3}\\), which is not exactly listed among the provided options. The answer closest to our calculation is D, but please consider that the exact value calculated does not perfectly match any of the options due to rounding or approximation in the options provided."
