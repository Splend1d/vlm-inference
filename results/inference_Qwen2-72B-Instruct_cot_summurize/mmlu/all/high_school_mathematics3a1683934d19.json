This means that we can express the dimensions of the TV in terms of these ratios:\n\nLet's assume the length of the TV is 5x and the height is 3x, where x is a common multiplier.\n\nAccording to the Pythagorean theorem, for any right-angled triangle (which in this case is formed by the length, height, and diagonal of the TV screen):\n\n\\[ \\text{Diagonal}^2 = \\text{Length}^2 + \\text{Height}^2 \\]\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\n\\[ (\\text{Diagonal})^2 = (5x)^2 + (3x)^2 \\]\n\\[ (\\text{Diagonal})^2 = 25x^2 + 9x^2 \\]\n\\[ (\\text{Diagonal})^2 = 34x^2 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Diagonal} = \\sqrt{34}x \\]\n\nWe know the diagonal is 48 inches, so:\n\n\\[ 48 = \\sqrt{34}x \\]\n\\[ x = \\frac{48}{\\sqrt{34}} \\]\n\nTo find the horizontal length, we calculate 5x:\n\n\\[ 5x = 5 \\times \\frac{48}{\\sqrt{34}} \\]\n\nSince we want to find out how much shorter the horizontal length would be if measured diagonally instead of horizontally, we need to compare the diagonal measurement to the horizontal measurement. However, since the diagonal cannot be shorter than the horizontal side, what we're actually calculating is the difference between the horizontal length and the diagonal when the diagonal is considered as the total length.\n\nThe question seems to ask for the difference between the actual horizontal length and the hypothetical horizontal length if it were assumed to be the diagonal. But given that the diagonal is 48 inches, we should actually compare the horizontal length to 48 inches to see how much shorter it is.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the actual horizontal length:\n\n\\[ 5x = 5 \\times \\frac{48}{\\sqrt{34}} \\approx 5 \\times \\frac{48}{5.83} \\approx 5 \\times 8.23 \\approx 41.15 \\]\n\nNow, let's find the difference between the diagonal and the horizontal length:\n\n\\[ 48 - 41.15 = 6.85 \\]\n\nRounded to the nearest inch, the horizontal length of the television screen will be approximately 7 inches shorter if the measure is made along the diagonal rather than along the horizontal length.\n\nSo, the answer is B. 7."
