However, in the long run, if the increase in the money supply outpaces the growth in real output, it will lead to higher prices (inflation) as there is more money chasing the same amount of goods and services. This is consistent with the equation of exchange: MV = PQ, where M is the money supply, V is the velocity of money, P is the price level, and Q is the real output. If Q remains constant and V is stable, then an increase in M must lead to an increase in P over time."
