                    "text": "Water potential is a measure of the potential energy in water, and it determines the direction of water movement. Water moves from areas of higher water potential to areas of lower water potential. In the context of plant cells (like those in a potato), water potential is influenced by factors such as solute concentration, pressure, and gravity.\n\nWhen a piece of potato is dropped into a beaker of pure water, we need to consider the solute concentration. Pure water has no solutes dissolved in it, so its water potential is considered to be at the maximum possible value, which is 0 (zero) because there are no solutes to lower the water potential.\n\nIn contrast, the cells of the potato contain various solutes and have a higher solute concentration than the pure water. This higher solute concentration results in a lower water potential within the potato cells compared to the pure water. Therefore, the water potential inside the potato cells is negative relative to the pure water.\n\nGiven these conditions:\n\n- A. The water potential of the pure water is not negative; it's 0.\n- B. The water potential of the pure water is not described as positive; it's 0.\n- C. The water potential of the potato is not positive; it's negative compared to the pure water.\n- D. The water potential of the potato is negative, which is correct in this context because it is less than that of the pure water.\n\nThus, the correct answer is **D. The water potential of the potato is negative**."
