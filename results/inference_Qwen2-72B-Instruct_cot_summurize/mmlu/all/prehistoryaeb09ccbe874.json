Aurignacian technology produced more usable blade surface.\n\nThe Aurignacian culture, which succeeded the Mousterian culture in Europe, is characterized by significant advancements in stone tool technology. One of the most notable differences between Aurignacian and Mousterian technologies is the production of blades, which are long, thin stone tools with at least one sharp edge. Aurignacian toolmakers were able to produce many more blades from a single core than their Mousterian predecessors, resulting in a greater amount of usable cutting edge per unit of raw material. This efficiency allowed for a wider variety of tools and the ability to create more specialized implements.\n\nMousterian technology, associated with Neanderthals and some early modern humans, primarily featured a flake-based industry that included points, scrapers, and hand axes. While Mousterian points could be used as projectiles or hafted onto handles, the Aurignacians' focus on blade production marked a significant technological leap forward."
