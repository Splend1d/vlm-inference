This is because such a pipe has only one displacement node (at the closed end) and so can only support standing waves with half wavelengths fitting into its length.\n\nThe fundamental frequency (\\(f_1\\)) is 131 Hz. The next higher harmonic would be the third harmonic (\\(f_3\\)), which is three times the fundamental frequency because the second harmonic is not present in this type of pipe.\n\nThus, the next higher harmonic frequency is:\n\\[ f_3 = 3 \\times f_1 = 3 \\times 131 \\text{ Hz} = 393 \\text{ Hz} \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. 393 Hz"
