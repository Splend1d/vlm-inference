One gram of palmitic acid\n\nFats, such as palmitic acid, release more energy per gram when oxidized compared to carbohydrates (like glucose) or proteins (like leucine). This is because fats have a higher proportion of carbon and hydrogen atoms relative to oxygen, which means they can store more energy. Alcohol can also provide a significant amount of energy, but palmitic acid provides more energy per gram. Typically, the energy yield is around 9 kcal/gram for fats, 4 kcal/gram for carbohydrates and proteins, and about 7 kcal/gram for alcohol."
