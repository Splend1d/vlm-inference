Children with an insecure avoidant attachment typically show little interest in exploring new environments when their caregiver is present, and they often avoid or resist contact with their caregiver when distressed, as if they do not expect their needs for comfort to be met. The child's pushing away and looking away from her mother, along with her mother's turning away, are behaviors consistent with an avoidant attachment pattern."
