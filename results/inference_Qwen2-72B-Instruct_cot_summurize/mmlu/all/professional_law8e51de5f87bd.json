Under the Federal Rules of Evidence (Rule 409) and similar state rules, offers to pay medical expenses are generally not admissible as evidence of liability or negligence. This rule exists to encourage people to make offers to help others without fear that such offers will be used against them in court. Therefore, the trial judge should rule the testimony inadmissible on these grounds."
