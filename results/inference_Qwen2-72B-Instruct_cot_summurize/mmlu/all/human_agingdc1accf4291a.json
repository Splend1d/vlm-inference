Maintaining strong relationships with family, friends, and community can provide emotional support, reduce feelings of loneliness and isolation, and encourage healthier behaviors, all of which can contribute to a longer and happier life. While the other options listed may also play roles in longevity under certain conditions, social support is widely recognized as an important element for long life."
