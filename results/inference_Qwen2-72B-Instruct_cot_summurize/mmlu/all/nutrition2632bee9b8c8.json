Fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), has been shown to be effective in reducing binge eating and purging behaviors in patients with bulimia nervosa.\n\nB. The first approach is to discuss body image: While discussing body image can be an important part of therapy for bulimia nervosa, it may not always be the first step. Treatment often begins by addressing the immediate health risks associated with the disorder, such as electrolyte imbalances from purging, and stabilizing the patient's physical health.\n\nC. It is not useful to discuss weight with patients: This statement is incorrect. Discussing weight and body mass index (BMI) can be crucial in the treatment of bulimia nervosa, especially when it comes to restoring healthy eating habits and normalizing weight if necessary. However, how this discussion is approached is critical, as it should be done in a sensitive and non-judgmental manner.\n\nD. Treatments should target exclusively on purging practices: This statement is incorrect. Effective treatment for bulimia nervosa should address multiple aspects of the disorder, including binge eating, purging, distorted body image, and any underlying psychological issues such as low self-esteem or anxiety. A holistic approach that includes cognitive-behavioral therapy, nutritional counseling, and sometimes medication like fluoxetine is generally recommended."
