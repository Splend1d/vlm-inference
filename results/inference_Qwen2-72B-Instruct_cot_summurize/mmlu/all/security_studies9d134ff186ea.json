All of these options.\n\nSince the publication of the Human Development Report in 1994, which introduced the concept of human security, all of the ideas listed have indeed been mainstreamed within the field of human security. The report argued that limiting security analysis to military engagement was too narrow and that security should be understood as a multidimensional concept encompassing various aspects of human life. It also highlighted that focusing security solely on violent conflicts was insufficient, as non-violent threats such as poverty, disease, and environmental degradation could also severely impact people's safety and well-being. The report emphasized that security is a contestable concept, meaning that its definition can vary depending on cultural, political, and social contexts."
