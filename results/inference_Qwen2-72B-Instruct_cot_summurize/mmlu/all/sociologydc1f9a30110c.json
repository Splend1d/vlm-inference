However, it's important to note that not all of them practice separation of church and state, exclude women as clergy, or are considered cultures as well as churches. For example, the Church of Norway and the Church of Greece are both established churches within their respective countries, meaning they have a special relationship with the state. The Church of England also has a historical connection to the state, although there is currently a debate about whether it should be disestablished. Islam does not have a central governing body like the other organizations mentioned, and its relationship with the state varies by country. Additionally, while some branches of these religions may exclude women from certain roles, others do not."
