An increase in labor productivity.\n\nThe production possibilities frontier (PPF) represents the maximum possible output for two goods that an economy can achieve when all resources are fully and efficiently utilized. An increase in labor productivity means that workers can produce more output per hour, which leads to an outward shift of the PPF as the economy's potential output increases.\n\nDecreases or increases in price levels, money supply, or changes in the unemployment rate do not necessarily lead to an outward shift of the PPF unless they affect the productive capacity of the economy in terms of technology, capital, labor, or natural resources. For example, decreasing unemployment might indicate full employment of labor, but it does not necessarily mean that labor productivity has increased. Similarly, changes in the money supply and price levels primarily affect the demand side of the economy rather than its productive capacity."
