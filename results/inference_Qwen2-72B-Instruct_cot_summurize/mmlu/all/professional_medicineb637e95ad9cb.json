You have been the patient's physician for the past 6 years and know she is prepubescent. It is most appropriate to counsel the patient that if she wishes to have a family she will need to do which of the following?\n\nA. Adopt\nB. Have amniocentesis if she gets pregnant\nC. Have an operation\nD. Receive genetic counseling\n"

Receive genetic counseling.\n\nTurner syndrome affects sexual development in females, often resulting in infertility due to ovarian insufficiency. However, it is important for the patient to receive genetic counseling to understand her options and potential risks associated with pregnancy, as some women with Turner syndrome may have the possibility of conceiving naturally or through assisted reproductive technologies. Genetic counseling can provide information on the risks of passing on the condition to offspring and help the patient make informed decisions regarding family planning. While adoption (option A) is certainly a viable option for building a family, it is not necessarily the only one, and the patient should be made aware of all her options. An amniocentesis (option B) would be relevant if the patient were pregnant and wanted to screen for genetic abnormalities in the fetus, but it does not address her ability to have children. An operation (option C) could refer to various surgical procedures, but none specifically address the issue of fertility in Turner syndrome."
