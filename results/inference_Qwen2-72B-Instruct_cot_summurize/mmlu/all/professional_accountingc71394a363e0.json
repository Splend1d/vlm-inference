Two employees, who work in different departments, are circumventing an internal control.\n\nThis situation would likely be the most difficult for an auditor to detect because it involves collusion between individuals from separate departments. Collusion can make control deficiencies harder to uncover as the involved parties may cover up their actions and any resulting discrepancies. The other situations involve errors or oversights that could potentially be identified through standard audit procedures, such as review of transaction logs, interviews with personnel, or testing of system configurations. However, when multiple people conspire to bypass controls, the auditor must rely on more sophisticated detection methods, such as looking for unusual patterns or anomalies in data, or conducting surprise audits."
