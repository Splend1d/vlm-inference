(i), (ii), and (iii) only.\n\n(i) is true because the autocorrelation function (acf) and partial autocorrelation function (pacf) can indeed be hard to interpret in practice due to the presence of noise, seasonality, or other complex patterns in the data.\n\n(ii) is also true because calculating the acf and pacf for some data sets can be computationally intensive or require certain assumptions about the data that may not hold, making the calculation difficult.\n\n(iii) is true as information criteria such as AIC (Akaike Information Criterion) and BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion) do represent an alternative approach to determining the order of a time series model, which can sometimes provide more straightforward model selection than relying solely on acf and pacf plots.\n\n(iv) is false because the acf and pacf do not always deliver unique model selections; they can sometimes suggest multiple possible models, especially when dealing with complex data structures or when there is uncertainty in the data."
