Earth was rotating so rapidly that the Moon split from it.\n\nWhile some early theories suggested that the Moon might have formed by fission, spinning off from a rapidly rotating Earth, this idea is not supported by modern scientific understanding and is not considered a main hypothesis. The most widely accepted theory today is the giant impact hypothesis, which suggests that the Moon formed from debris left over after a Mars-sized body collided with the Earth. This hypothesis is not listed among your options but is worth mentioning as the prevailing scientific consensus on the Moon's origin."
