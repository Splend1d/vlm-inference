However, it's important to note that this doesn't mean that these other conditions don't affect men as well. Men are also more likely to die from septicemia and certain types of strokes, but when comparing men and women, the rate of death by suicide is notably higher for men. Option D, influenza, does not show a significant difference in mortality rates between men and women."
