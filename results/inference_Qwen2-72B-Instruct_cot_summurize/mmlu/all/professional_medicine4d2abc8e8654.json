The pain extends from the epigastrium to the right upper quadrant and is sometimes felt in the right scapula; it lasts about 30 minutes and is not relieved by antacids. The last episode occurred after she ate a hamburger and french fries. She has not had vomiting. She is currently asymptomatic. She is 165 cm (5 ft 5 in) tall and weighs 104 kg (230 lb); BMI is 38 kg/m2 . Examination shows no other abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?\n\nA. Abdominal ultrasonography of the right upper quadrant\nB. Upper gastrointestinal series with small bowel follow-through\nC. CT scan of the abdomen\nD. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography\n"

This is because her symptoms of postprandial pain radiating to the right shoulder, especially after fatty meals, along with her obesity, suggest the possibility of gallbladder disease such as cholecystitis or cholelithiasis. Abdominal ultrasonography is a non-invasive, cost-effective initial imaging modality for evaluating the right upper quadrant pain and can detect gallstones or inflammation of the gallbladder."
