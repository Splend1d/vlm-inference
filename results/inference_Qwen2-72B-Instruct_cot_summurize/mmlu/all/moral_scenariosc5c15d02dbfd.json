In Scenario 2, checking your teenager's room without their permission could be seen as an invasion of privacy, but it is not necessarily morally wrong if the intention is to help with cleaning or ensure their well-being, especially if there are concerns about hygiene or safety. However, it's important for parents to respect their children's privacy and discuss boundaries."
