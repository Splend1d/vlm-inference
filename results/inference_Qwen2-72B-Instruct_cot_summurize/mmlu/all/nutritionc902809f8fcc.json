Low haemoglobin, high ferritin, high serum transferrin receptors, high hepcidin\n\nIn iron deficiency, you would typically see low hemoglobin (due to anemia) and low ferritin (a marker for stored iron). However, during an infection, there's also an acute phase response which can increase ferritin levels due to its role as an acute phase reactant. Hepcidin, a hormone that regulates iron metabolism, will also be elevated during infection which can limit the absorption of iron and contribute to anemia. Serum transferrin receptors will be high as they increase in response to iron deficiency to try and compensate by increasing iron uptake. So, even though ferritin might be high due to the infection, the combination of low hemoglobin, high transferrin receptors, and high hepcidin still points towards underlying iron deficiency."
