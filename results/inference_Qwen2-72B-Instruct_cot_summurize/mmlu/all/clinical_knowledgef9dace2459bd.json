Let's go over the others to clarify:\n\nA. The finding of a palpable median groove in the prostate is not necessarily an adverse finding. In fact, it is often considered a normal finding during a digital rectal examination (DRE). The median groove refers to the indentation on the posterior surface of the prostate gland where the ejaculatory ducts enter the gland. Its presence can help differentiate the prostate from other structures within the pelvis.\n\nC. A thrombosed hemorrhoid is typically painful. Thrombosed hemorrhoids occur when a blood clot forms in a hemorrhoidal vessel, leading to swelling and inflammation, which can cause significant discomfort or pain.\n\nD. Peri-anal warts (also known as anal warts or condyloma acuminata) can often be seen and diagnosed with a simple visual inspection without the need for proctoscopy, especially if they are external. Proctoscopy may be used to visualize internal lesions or to further investigate suspicious findings, but it is not the only method to demonstrate peri-anal warts."
