The ECHR applies extraterritorially in circumstances where a member State exercises effective control.\n\nThis principle was established by the European Court of Human Rights in cases such as Bankovic and Others v. Belgium and Others (2001) and Al-Skeini and Others v. the United Kingdom (2011). According to these judgments, the Convention may apply outside a state's own territory if that state exercises \"effective control\" over an area or individuals. This can happen in situations like military operations abroad or administration of a territory. However, this does not mean that the ECHR automatically applies everywhere a member state has influence or presence; there must be a situation of effective control for the Convention obligations to extend beyond the state's borders."
