Increasing government spending also directly adds to aggregate demand. Both of these actions can stimulate economic activity, leading to a rise in real GDP. Additionally, if the economy was initially below full employment, this stimulus could absorb some of the excess capacity and push the economy towards or above its potential output, potentially causing the price level to rise due to increased demand for goods and services outpacing supply."
