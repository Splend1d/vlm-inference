Let her not refuse to perform domestic duties whether easy or difficult. That which must be done, let her finish completely, tidily, and systematically, When a woman follows such rules as these, then she may be said to be industrious.\nLet a woman be correct in manner and upright in character in order to serve her husband. Let her live in purity and quietness of spirit, and attend to her own affairs. Let her love not gossip and silly laughter. Let her cleanse and purify and arrange in order the wine and the food for the offerings to the ancestors. When a woman observes such principles as these, then she may be said to continue ancestral worship.\nNo woman who observes these three fundamentals of life has ever had a bad reputation or has fallen into disgrace. If a woman fail to observe them, how can her name be honored; how can she but bring disgrace upon herself?\"\n\u00a9 The East Asian Library and the Gest Collection, Princeton University.\nBan Zhao, Lessons for a Woman, ca. 80 C.E.\nIn what way were women's lives in the period 600 B.C.E. to 600 C.E. generally more restricted than women's lives had been globally before the advent of sedentary societies?\n\nA.

                    "text": "The passage from Ban Zhao's \"Lessons for a Woman\" does not directly answer the question about how women's lives were more restricted during the period of 600 B.C.E. to 600 C.E. compared to earlier times. However, it does provide insight into the expectations placed on women during that time, particularly in terms of domestic duties, personal conduct, and their role in maintaining family honor.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the passage does not suggest that women were expected to be the primary earners for the family. Instead, it focuses on women's roles within the home and in serving their husbands.\n\nOption B is also incorrect because caring for children was likely always a significant responsibility for women, both before and after the advent of sedentary societies. The passage does not indicate any change in this regard.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the passage does not suggest that women's power increased in the public sphere. In fact, the emphasis on women's domestic duties and their need to maintain a certain demeanor suggests that their influence was largely confined to the private sphere.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nC. Women's power increasingly fell within the private sphere.\n\nAs societies became more sedentary and developed complex social structures, there was often a greater division between public and private spheres, with men typically occupying positions of power in the public domain and women being relegated to roles within the household. This trend is reflected in the passage, where women are instructed to focus on domestic duties and personal conduct rather than engaging in public affairs."
