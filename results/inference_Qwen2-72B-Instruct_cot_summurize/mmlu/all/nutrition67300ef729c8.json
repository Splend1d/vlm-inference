It does not distinguish between fat and fat-free mass.\n\nBMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight in kilograms by their height in meters squared, resulting in a number that can be used to categorize individuals as underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese. However, BMI does not take into account muscle mass or body composition. This means that a muscular athlete could have a high BMI but low body fat percentage, while a sedentary individual with a lower BMI could have a higher body fat percentage. Therefore, BMI is not always an accurate measure of body fatness or health risk."
