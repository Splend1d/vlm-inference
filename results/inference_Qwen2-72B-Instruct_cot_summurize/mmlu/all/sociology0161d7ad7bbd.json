However, it is important to note that Smart's work also touched on aspects of A and B, making D. all of the above, a comprehensive answer. Smart argued that women's criminal behavior was often related to their roles as mothers and caretakers, and that their crimes were often seen in a different light than those committed by men. She also highlighted how society tends to normalize certain forms of women's sexual delinquency while being harsher on men for similar behaviors. Nevertheless, her primary focus was on how women's criminality is shaped by and reinforces traditional gender roles."
