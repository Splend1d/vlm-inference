According to the Heine-Borel theorem in \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\), a set is compact if and only if it is closed and bounded. The image of a compact set under a continuous function is also compact, which implies that the function is bounded on that set (since compact subsets of \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) are closed and bounded). Therefore, every continuous real-valued function defined on a compact set K is bounded.\n\nII. This statement is false. The condition that every continuous real-valued function defined on K is bounded does not necessarily imply that K is compact. For example, consider the open interval (0, 1) in \\(\\mathbb{R}\\). Every continuous real-valued function defined on this interval is bounded, but the interval itself is not compact because it is not closed.\n\nIII. This statement is false. Compactness does not imply connectedness. For instance, consider the set K = {0} U {1} in \\(\\mathbb{R}\\). This set is compact (it is both closed and bounded), but it is not connected since it can be separated into two disjoint open sets.\n\nTherefore, the only true statement is I."
