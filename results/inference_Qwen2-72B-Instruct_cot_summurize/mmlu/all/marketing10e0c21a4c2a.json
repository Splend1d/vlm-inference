Customer's needs.\n\nThe marketing period from the 1950s to the 1980s was characterized by a shift in focus from the production-oriented approach of earlier decades to a more customer-centric perspective. This era is often referred to as the \"marketing department\" period, during which companies began to recognize the importance of understanding and meeting customer needs and preferences to gain a competitive advantage. This led to the development of marketing strategies that emphasized market research, product differentiation, and promotional activities tailored to target specific customer segments."
