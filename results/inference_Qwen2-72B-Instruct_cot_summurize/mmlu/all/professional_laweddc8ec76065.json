If the woman sues the man for breach of contract, which of the following defenses would be the man's best defense?\n\nA. Since the woman's purported acceptance was oral, it constituted a different mode of communication from the written offer.\nB. The contract was unenforceable under the statute of frauds, because the woman's purported acceptance was oral.\nC. The woman's counter offer terminated her power of acceptance.\nD. The man's rejection of the woman's counter offer terminated the woman's power of acceptance.\n"

The man's rejection of the woman's counter offer terminated the woman's power of acceptance.\n\nWhen the woman sent the fax offering $800 instead of the original $1,000, she made a counter offer, which effectively rejected the original offer. This means that the original offer was no longer valid and could not be accepted. When the man rejected the woman's counter offer, he confirmed that the original offer was indeed terminated. Therefore, when the woman later tried to accept the original offer by agreeing to pay $1,000, she was too late, as the original offer had already been terminated by her own counter offer.\n\nThus, the man did not breach any contract because there was no valid offer left for the woman to accept at the time she attempted to do so."
