The Thule culture emerged around 1000 AD in Alaska and spread eastward across Arctic Canada, reaching Greenland by about 1200 AD. They displaced the earlier Dorset culture, which was distinct and not directly ancestral to the modern Inuit. While the Paleo-Eskimos were an earlier group that inhabited the Arctic region, they are not the direct ancestors of today's Inuit. The Clovis culture refers to a prehistoric Native American culture found in North America, and it is not related to the Inuit.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Thule"
