It is surrounded by mountains and can be approached from one side only; it has no crops, trees, or water, but has reservoirs in which rainwater is collected. The Arabs often cut off the inhabitants from their supply of drinking-water until the they buy them off with money and pieces of cloth. It is an exceedingly hot place. It is the port of the Indians, and to it come large vessels from Kinbayat [Cambay], Kawlam [Quilon], Calicut and many other Malabar ports [on the south-west coast of India]. There are Indian merchants living there, as well as Egyptian merchants. Its inhabitants are all either merchants, porters, or fishermen. Some of the merchants are immensely rich, so rich that sometimes a single merchant is sole owner of a large ship with all it contains, and this is a subject of ostentation and rivalry amongst them. In spite of that they are pious, humble, upright, and generous in character, treat strangers well, give liberally to devotees, and pay in full the tithes due to God.\"\nIbn Battuta, ca. 1325\u20131354 C.E.\nThe tone of the journal best reflects which of the following developments in the Indian Ocean trade network?\n\nA. The ability of commerce to foster cultural diffusion\nB. The superiority of Arabian port cities\nC. The increasing difficulty caused by language barriers\nD. The overproduction of cash crops\n"

He describes 'Aden as a bustling port city that attracts merchants from various regions, including India and Egypt, indicating the extensive reach of the Indian Ocean trade network. The mention of Indian and Egyptian merchants residing in 'Aden suggests a mixing of cultures and peoples, which is a hallmark of cultural diffusion facilitated by trade.\n\nAdditionally, Ibn Battuta notes the religious piety and generosity of the inhabitants, who treat strangers well and support religious devotees, further highlighting the social and cultural exchanges that occur alongside commercial activities. The wealth of some merchants and their rivalry over ship ownership also point to the economic prosperity brought about by trade, which in turn supports the spread of ideas, customs, and religions among different societies."
