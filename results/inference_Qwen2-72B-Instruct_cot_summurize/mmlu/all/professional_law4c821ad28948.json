The contract provided that the closing would be 60 days after the contract was signed and that the seller would convey to the buyer a \"marketable title\" by a quitclaim deed at closing. The contract contained no other provisions regarding the title to be delivered to the buyer. A title search revealed that the land was subject to an unsatisfied $50,000 mortgage and a right-of-way easement over a portion of the land. The buyer now claims that the title is unmarketable and has refused to close. Is the buyer correct?\n\nA. No, because nothing under these facts renders title unmarketable.\nB. No, because the buyer agreed to accept a quitclaim deed. quitclaim deed.\nC. Yes, because the right-of-way easement makes the title unmarketable.\nD. Yes, because the unsatisfied mortgage makes the title unmarketable.\n"

Yes, because the unsatisfied mortgage makes the title unmarketable.\n\nIn real estate transactions, a marketable title is one that is free from significant defects or encumbrances that would prevent the buyer from taking full possession of the property or that would affect its value. An unsatisfied mortgage is a lien on the property, which means that the lender has a legal claim to the property until the debt is paid in full. This lien can prevent the buyer from obtaining clear ownership and may also affect their ability to secure financing for the purchase. Therefore, the presence of an unsatisfied mortgage generally renders a title unmarketable.\n\nWhile it is true that the seller agreed to convey the property via a quitclaim deed, this type of deed does not guarantee that the title is free from defects or encumbrances. The buyer is still entitled to receive a title that is marketable, as defined by the terms of the contract. The fact that the title is being conveyed via a quitclaim deed does not absolve the seller of the obligation to provide a marketable title."
