Adler\u2019s\n\nAlfred Adler's theory of personality emphasizes the role of social factors, such as feelings of inferiority and striving for superiority, in shaping an individual's personality. Adler believed that people develop their personalities based on their early experiences, particularly those involving feelings of inadequacy or inferiority. In response to these feelings, individuals strive to overcome them and achieve success, which can lead to the development of strong character traits like resilience and determination. Teddy Roosevelt's transformation from a weak and ill child to a robust and influential leader exemplifies this aspect of Adler's theory. The concept of \"rugged individualism\" and the slogan \"speak softly but carry a big stick\" align with Adler's idea of developing strength and assertiveness in the face of adversity."
