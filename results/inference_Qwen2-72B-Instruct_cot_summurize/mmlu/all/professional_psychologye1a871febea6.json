Asian and Asian-American clients may be more likely to present with physical complaints such as headaches, stomachaches, or other bodily symptoms that are not easily explained by medical conditions, when their underlying issue is actually an emotional or psychological concern (Takeuchi & Sue, 1993).\n\nHowever, it's important to note that these observations are generalizations and do not apply to every individual within these groups. Cultural background can influence how people experience and express distress, but each person's experiences are also shaped by their unique history, personality, and circumstances.\n\nReferences:\n- Takeuchi, D.
