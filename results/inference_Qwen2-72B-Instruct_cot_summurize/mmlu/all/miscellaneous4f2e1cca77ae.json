A chain of coastal volcanic mountains\n\nWhen a continental lithospheric plate collides with an oceanic lithospheric plate, the denser oceanic plate typically subducts or sinks beneath the less dense continental plate. This process can lead to the formation of a subduction zone, which often results in volcanic activity as the subducted material melts and rises back up to the surface. This can create a chain of coastal volcanic mountains, such as the Andes along the western edge of South America."
