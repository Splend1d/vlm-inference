A state law was subsequently passed requiring the city to prepare a general plan governing both land use and open-space development. The city's plan, with new density requirements, effectively limited development of the five-acre lot to a total of one to five single family residences. The partnership sued the city, asking for a declaratory judgment that the city had taken its property without just compensation in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. The partnership lost at the local and appellate levels. The United States Supreme Court agreed to hear the case \u0080\u0094 what did it decide?\n\nA.

                    "text": "The scenario described involves a legal challenge based on the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment, which is applicable to the states through the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The partnership argues that the city's actions have effectively taken their property without just compensation.\n\nGiven the options provided:\n\nA. This was illegal spot zoning that was unconstitutional.\nSpot zoning refers to a zoning decision that benefits a particular parcel of land or its owner while being detrimental to the surrounding area. However, the description does not suggest that this is a case of spot zoning, as the city's plan applies generally to land use and open-space development.\n\nB. This was an unlawful taking without prior notice and therefore unconstitutional.\nWhile this could be a valid argument if the partnership had no prior notice of the potential for such restrictions, the question does not provide enough information to determine whether there was prior notice.\n\nC. The ordinance allows for up to five residences and therefore it is constitutional.\nThis option suggests that because the land can still be developed with one to five single-family residences, the ordinance does not constitute an unconstitutional taking. This would be consistent with the \"Penn Central\" test, where courts consider whether the regulation has gone too far, effectively depriving the owner of all economically viable use of the land. If the ordinance does not prevent all economic use, it may not be considered a taking under the Fifth Amendment.\n\nD. The law was a violation of the ex post facto clause of the U.S. Constitution.\nThe Ex Post Facto Clause prohibits the application of laws retroactively to change the legal consequences (criminal or civil) of actions that were committed before the enactment of the laws. While the new law was passed after the purchase of the land, this option does not seem relevant since the Ex Post Facto Clause typically deals with criminal penalties, not civil regulations.\n\nGiven these options, the most likely answer based on the information provided is:\n\nC. The ordinance allows for up to five residences and therefore it is constitutional.\n\nHowever, without knowing the specific details of the case or the reasoning of the Supreme Court, this is an educated guess based on the principles of takings law. In real-world cases, the Supreme Court's decision would depend on the specific facts and legal arguments presented."
