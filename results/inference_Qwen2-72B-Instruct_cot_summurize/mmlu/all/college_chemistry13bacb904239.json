Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. \u0394J = 1; \u0394u = 0\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the question seems to be missing the \u0394v part which is crucial for identifying the R-branch. The \u0394u mentioned in the options might be a typographical error or a misrepresentation of \u0394v (the change in vibrational quantum number), as u is not typically used in this context. In the context of molecular spectroscopy, v represents the vibrational quantum number. Thus, for the R-branch, the correct description would be \u0394v = +1 and \u0394J = +1."
