Bayes' Theorem states:\n\n\\[P(D|TP) = \\frac{P(TP|D)P(D)}{P(TP)}\\]\n\nWe're given:\n- \\(P(D) = 0.05\\)\n- \\(P(TP|D) = 0.99\\) (probability of testing positive if you have the disease)\n- \\(P(\\neg TP|\\neg D) = 0.97\\) (probability of testing negative if you don't have the disease)\n\nFirst, we need to calculate \\(P(TP)\\), which is the total probability of testing positive. This can be calculated using the law of total probability as:\n\n\\[P(TP) = P(TP|D)P(D) + P(TP|\\neg D)P(\\neg D)\\]\n\nSince \\(P(\\neg D) = 1 - P(D) = 0.95\\) and \\(P(TP|\\neg D) = 1 - P(\\neg TP|\\neg D) = 0.03\\), we can substitute these values into our equation:\n\n\\[P(TP) = (0.99)(0.05) + (0.03)(0.95) = 0.0495 + 0.0285 = 0.078\\]\n\nNow we can calculate \\(P(D|TP)\\):\n\n\\[P(D|TP) = \\frac{(0.99)(0.05)}{0.078} = \\frac{0.0495}{0.078} \\approx 0.635\\]\n\nSo, the correct answer is C. 0.635."
