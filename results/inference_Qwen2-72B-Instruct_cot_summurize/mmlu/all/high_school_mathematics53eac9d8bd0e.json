Let's consider the time when he leaves to be \\(6\\text{:}h\\) PM (where \\(h\\) is the number of minutes past 6 PM).\n\nAt \\(6\\text{:}h\\) PM:\n- The hour hand has moved from the 6 position by \\(h \\times 0.5^\\circ\\).\n- The minute hand has moved from the 12 position by \\(h \\times 6^\\circ\\).\n\nSince the hands form an angle of \\(110^\\circ\\) when he leaves, we can set up the equation based on their positions:\n\\[|180 + h \\times 0.5 - h \\times 6| = 110\\]\n\nSimplifying,\n\\[|180 - 5.5h| = 110\\]\n\nThis gives us two possible equations:\n\\[180 - 5.5h = 110\\] or \\[180 - 5.5h = -110\\]\n\nFrom the first equation,\n\\[180 - 110 = 5.5h\\]\n\\[70 = 5.5h\\]\n\\[h = \\frac{70}{5.5}\\]\n\\[h \\approx 12.73\\]\n\nFrom the second equation,\n\\[180 + 110 = 5.5h\\]\n\\[290 = 5.5h\\]\n\\[h = \\frac{290}{5.5}\\]\n\\[h \\approx 52.73\\]\n\nSince John left after 6 PM and returned before 7 PM, both times are within this range.\n\nWhen John returns, the angle between the hands is again \\(110^\\circ\\), but since he left for more than 5 minutes, the time when he returns must be the solution that is greater than \\(12.73\\) minutes past 6 PM. This means the time when he returns is approximately \\(52.73\\) minutes past 6 PM.\n\nTo find out how long he was away, subtract the time he left from the time he returned:\n\\[52.73 - 12.73 = 40\\]\n\nTherefore, John was away for approximately 40 minutes.\n\nThe correct answer is B. 40."
