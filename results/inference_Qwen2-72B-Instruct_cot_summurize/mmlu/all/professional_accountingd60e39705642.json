Dividends paid to shareholders from a company's profits are typically paid out of after-tax income, whereas interest payments on bonds are usually tax-deductible expenses for the issuer and thus paid before taxes. This means that bondholders receive their interest payments before the issuer pays corporation tax, while equity holders receive dividends after the company has paid its taxes."
