As part of their agreement, a courier was hired to pick up the card from the dealer and transport it to the collector. The courier was then to get the purchase money from the collector and bring it back to the dealer. But rather than entrusting the genuine card to the courier, the dealer gave him a counterfeit replica that was valueless. After picking up the envelope containing the replica, the courier left the dealer's home and embarked on his trip. The police, however, received a tip concerning the scheme and intercepted the courier's car before he left the city limits. Thereafter, the dealer was arrested and charged with attempting to obtain property by false pretenses.

In this case, the dealer has already taken steps towards committing the crime of obtaining property by false pretenses by creating and giving the courier a counterfeit replica of the valuable card with the intent to deceive the collector. Whether the courier was an accomplice or an innocent agent does not change the fact that the dealer had already taken significant actions toward completing the fraudulent scheme. Thus, it would not be advantageous for the dealer to argue about the courier's knowledge or involvement in the scheme because the attempt charge hinges on the dealer's own actions and intent."
