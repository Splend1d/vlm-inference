One week before the start of the fall term, at a party to celebrate the law student's acceptance to the school, his father announced to the law student, in the presence of the partygoers, \"Son, it's your obligation to uphold the family tradition for excellence at the school. In this regard, if you promise to study a minimum of five hours a day, I shall pay you $1,000 for each \u0080\u0098A' you achieve during your first year; $2,500 for each \u0080\u0098A' you achieve during your second year; and $5,000 for each \u0080\u0098A' you achieve during your third year. \"The most accurate statement concerning the father's promise to reward the law student for achieving \"A's\" would be that\n\nA. the promise constituted an unenforceable, conditional gift.\nB. the promise would not be legally binding, since it was non-detrimental.\nC. the promise would be enforceable if a bargained-for exchange was so intended.\nD. the promise constituted a voidable proposal.\n"

The law student's promise to study a minimum of five hours a day can be seen as consideration for the father's promise to pay a certain amount for each \"A\" grade achieved. If both parties intended to enter into a bargained-for exchange, then the promise could be considered enforceable. However, the specific circumstances and intentions of the parties would need to be examined to determine if a contract was actually formed."
