This is because producing one more unit (where MR=MC) will not change the firm's profit, as the revenue from selling one more unit exactly matches the cost of producing it.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\n**None of the above**\n\nHowever, if we have to choose from the given options, the closest conceptually is:\n\n**B. total revenue is equal to total cost**\n\nBut this option does not directly state the condition for profit maximization. The correct interpretation would be that at the point where MR = MC, the firm is maximizing its profits, and this could occur at any level of output where MR = MC, not necessarily where total revenue equals total cost. In fact, total revenue can be greater than total cost when MR = MC, which would imply a profit. If total revenue were equal to total cost at the point where MR = MC, the firm would be breaking even, but this is not the general case for profit maximization."
