Shuffling of alleles is responsible for the greatest variation in humans.\n\nThe shuffling of alleles (gene variants) during sexual reproduction through the process of meiosis and recombination contributes significantly to genetic diversity in humans. This process ensures that each offspring receives a unique combination of genes from their parents, leading to genetic variation within populations. While mutations also contribute to genetic variation, the shuffling of existing alleles plays a more significant role in the day-to-day generation of genetic diversity in human populations. Genetic drift can affect allele frequencies over time, but it is not the primary source of genetic variation in humans. Environmental changes can influence the survival and reproductive success of individuals with certain traits, but they do not directly cause genetic variation."
