Secondary rules are the rules that govern the legal consequences arising from a breach of the primary rules, i.e., of the international obligations of the States.\n\nIn the context of the law of international responsibility, primary rules refer to the substantive obligations that states have towards each other and the international community. When a state breaches one of these primary rules, secondary rules come into play to determine the legal consequences of such a breach. These secondary rules include provisions on state responsibility, reparations, and other remedial measures. They also encompass rules regarding the attribution of conduct to a state and the permissibility of countermeasures. However, it's important to note that while some secondary rules may specifically address attribution or countermeasures, they are not limited to those concepts alone."
