The equation of this tangent line can be used to approximate values of the function near the point where the derivative was evaluated.\n\nThe equation of the tangent line at \\(x = 3\\) is given by:\n\n\\[y - F(3) = F'(3)(x - 3)\\]\n\nSubstituting the given values, we get:\n\n\\[y - 8 = -4(x - 3)\\]\n\nNow, let's find an approximation for \\(F(3.02)\\) using this tangent line. We substitute \\(x = 3.02\\) into the equation:\n\n\\[y - 8 = -4(3.02 - 3)\\]\n\n\\[y - 8 = -4(0.02)\\]\n\n\\[y - 8 = -0.08\\]\n\n\\[y = 8 - 0.08\\]\n\n\\[y = 7.92\\]\n\nTherefore, the answer is approximately \\(7.92\\), which corresponds to option (B)."
