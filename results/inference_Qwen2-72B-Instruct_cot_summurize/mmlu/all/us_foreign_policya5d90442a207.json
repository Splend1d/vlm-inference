The NATO intervention in Kosovo, also known as Operation Allied Force, which took place in 1999, was unique because it was the first war where victory was achieved primarily through airpower alone, without significant ground forces being deployed. This operation was conducted in response to ethnic cleansing and human rights abuses by Serbian forces against Kosovo's Albanian population. While smart weapons were indeed used during this conflict, their use was not unique to this intervention, as they had been employed previously in other conflicts such as the Gulf War. Similarly, while it was a significant U.S. involvement in the Balkans, the U.S. had already been engaged in peacekeeping efforts in Bosnia prior to the Kosovo intervention. And although it was a significant use of military force by NATO, it was not the first time NATO used military force, as the organization had conducted smaller-scale operations before, such as enforcing a no-fly zone over Bosnia in the early 1990s."
