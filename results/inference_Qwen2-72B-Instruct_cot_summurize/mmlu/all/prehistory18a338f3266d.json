This reliance on sea trade made the Minoan economy particularly susceptible to disruptions caused by natural disasters such as volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, and tsunamis, which could easily sever trade routes and devastate coastal infrastructure.\n\nWhile agriculture, metalworking, and possibly even slave labor were also important aspects of the Minoan economy, the civilization's prosperity and extensive cultural influence were largely predicated on its ability to maintain a robust trading network with other regions of the ancient world. The eruption of the Thera (Santorini) volcano around 1600 BCE is often cited as a significant factor contributing to the decline of the Minoan civilization, as it would have had severe consequences for their trade-dependent economy."
