Three translational degrees of freedom (each contributes \\(\\frac{1}{2}R\\))\n2. Two rotational degrees of freedom (each contributes \\(\\frac{1}{2}R\\))\n\nAt very high temperatures, the vibrational modes also become active, but for the purpose of this question and considering the classical approximation, we typically only consider the first three translational and two rotational degrees of freedom.\n\nThus, the calculation for \\(C_V\\) would be:\n\n\\[C_V = \\left(3 + 2\\right)\\times \\frac{1}{2}R = 2.5R\\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. 2.5R"
