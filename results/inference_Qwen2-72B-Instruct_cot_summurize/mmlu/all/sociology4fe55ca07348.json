He believed that under a socialist system, where the means of production are owned collectively and there is no exploitation, the conditions that give rise to religion would diminish, leading to its eventual decline or disappearance. However, it's important to note that Marx did not predict a precise event or threshold that would lead to the end of religion, but rather saw it as a process tied to broader social and economic changes."
