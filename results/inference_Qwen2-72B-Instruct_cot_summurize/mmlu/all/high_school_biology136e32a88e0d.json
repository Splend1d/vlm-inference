In fact, they discovered that humans have only about 24,000 genes. How can we exhibit so many different traits from so few genes?\n\nA. Modification of histone proteins usually increases the function of genes.\nB. Epigenetics enables one gene to produce many different traits.\nC. This is proof that pseudogenes and introns are expressed.\nD. A single gene can produce more than one trait because of alternative splicing\n"

A single gene can produce more than one trait because of alternative splicing.\n\nWhile all the options provided touch on aspects of gene regulation and expression, option D directly addresses how a relatively small number of genes can give rise to a vast array of traits. Alternative splicing is a process by which different combinations of exons (coding segments) within a gene can be joined together to form different mRNA molecules. This results in multiple protein variants from a single gene, increasing the diversity of traits that an organism can exhibit.\n\nOptions A and B also play roles in gene regulation and expression but do not specifically explain the diversity of traits from a limited number of genes as effectively as alternative splicing does. Option C is incorrect because it suggests that pseudogenes and introns are expressed, which is generally not the case; pseudogenes are non-functional remnants of once-functional genes, and introns are non-coding regions removed during mRNA processing."
