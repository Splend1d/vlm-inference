It contains 20 protons and 20 electrons\n\nCalcium has an atomic number of 20, which means it has 20 protons in its nucleus. Since it is neutral, it also has 20 electrons to balance out the charge. The number of neutrons can vary depending on the isotope of calcium, so we cannot say definitively that there are 20 neutrons. Also, not all atoms of calcium have a mass of exactly 40.078 u; this is the average atomic mass taking into account the natural abundance of different isotopes of calcium."
