As the friend was painting his house one afternoon, the defendant fired a shot from his gun at him. Although the shot missed the friend, the bullet struck and killed the friend's daughter. The defendant is subsequently charged with the first-degree murder of the daughter. The relevant statutes in effect in this jurisdiction are as follows:Section 169: Murder in the first degree is the unlawful and intentional killing of a human being with malice aforethought. Section 170: Malice is expressed when there is manifested a deliberate intention to take away the life of another. Which of the following, if established, would provide the defendant with his best defense?\n\nA. He intended to kill the friend and not the daughter.\nB. He intended only to wound the friend.\nC. He was unaware of the elements of malice.\nD. The killing was the result of negligence in missing the friend.\n"

This could potentially reduce the charge from first-degree murder (which requires premeditation and malice aforethought) to second-degree murder or manslaughter, depending on how the court interprets the defendant's state of mind and the circumstances of the shooting.\n\nOptions A, B, and C do not address the issue of malice aforethought required for a first-degree murder conviction. Option A does not mitigate the malice towards the intended target. Option B suggests intent to cause serious bodily harm, which can still fulfill the malice requirement. Option C implies ignorance of the law, which is generally not a defense."
