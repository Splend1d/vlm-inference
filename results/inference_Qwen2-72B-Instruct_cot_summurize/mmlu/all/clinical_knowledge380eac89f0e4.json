Ingestion of carnitine during exercise.\n\nWhile carnitine can play a role in energy metabolism and potentially aid in recovery or endurance, its direct impact on success in sports is less significant compared to other factors like ability to tolerate heavy training, tactics, and diet. However, this does not mean that carnitine supplementation is entirely ineffective; its benefits might just be more subtle and specific to certain types of athletes or under certain conditions."
