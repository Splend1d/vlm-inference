She has hypertension treated with enalapril for the past 3 months. She does not smoke. There is no history of lung disease. She weighs 54 kg (120 lb) and is 163 cm (64 in) tall. Her temperature is 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), blood pressure is 130/80 mm Hg, pulse is 70/min, and respirations are 12/min. Examination and an x-ray of the chest show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely mechanism of this patient's cough?\n\nA. Decreased plasma renin activity\nB. Decreased serum angiotensin II concentrations\nC. Increased serum angiotensin I concentrations\nD. Increased serum bradykinin concentrations\n"

Increased serum bradykinin concentrations.\n\nAngiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors like enalapril can lead to a side effect of chronic cough due to increased levels of bradykinin. Bradykinin is a potent vasodilator that can cause inflammation and increased sensitivity leading to coughing. ACE inhibitors block the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, but they also inhibit the breakdown of bradykinin, leading to its accumulation and potential for causing cough."
