The man took the agent to the home of a drug dealer, who sold the agent four pounds of marijuana. At trial, the drug dealer claimed the defense of entrapment and demanded that the informant's identity be disclosed and that he be produced. At no time prior to trial did the drug dealer seek to subpoena the man. However, the man was a fugitive from justice the whole time, and no subpoena could have been served. The government claims a right to protect the informant's identity. Should the government's claim be honored?\n\nA. Yes, because an informant has a Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination.\nB. Yes, because informants would not assist in crime prevention unless they were reasonably certain that their identities would be kept secret.\nC. No, because under the Fifth Amendment, a defendant has the right to be confronted by witnesses against him.\nD. No, because under the Sixth Amendment, a defendant has the right to a fair trial.\n"

Yes, because informants would not assist in crime prevention unless they were reasonably certain that their identities would be kept secret.\n\nThe government has a legitimate interest in protecting the identity of confidential informants to encourage cooperation in law enforcement efforts. This protection is based on the need to maintain effective law enforcement and the safety of the informant. However, this does not mean that the informant's identity can never be disclosed. If the defendant can show that the disclosure of the informant's identity is relevant and necessary to his defense, the court may order the government to disclose the informant's identity. In this case, since the informant is a fugitive and cannot be produced or subpoenaed, the court may weigh the necessity of the informant's testimony against the government's interest in protecting the informant's identity."
