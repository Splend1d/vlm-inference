The scripture he references and the argument he develops align most closely with option B: \"all a part of one body.\" This concept is often used in Christian teachings to describe the unity and interconnectedness of believers as members of the body of Christ (1 Corinthians 12:12-27). In this metaphor, each individual has a role and function that contributes to the health and well-being of the whole body. Thus, according to Butler's discussion, human beings are not merely independent and autonomous but are also interdependent and part of a larger community or body."
