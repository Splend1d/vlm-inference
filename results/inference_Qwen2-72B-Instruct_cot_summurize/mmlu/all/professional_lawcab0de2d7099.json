However, since the student did not have a car, he rode the bus to and from the college each day. The student soon discovered that he was spending up to two hours each day to make the round trip to and from college on the bus, whereas the trip could be made in half that time if he had a car. He decided to buy a car and asked his father to accompany him as he looked for a car to purchase. After visiting a number of car lots, the son finally found a used car to his liking. However, the son only had $2,500 in his bank account, and the price of the car was $10,000. Since the son had not built up a credit history, the car lot was reluctant to sell the car to the son. The father then told the finance manager of the car lot, \"If you will sell the car to my son and for any reason he defaults on the payments, I will pay the balance due. \" The finance manager then approved the deal, which required the son to pay $2,500 down and monthly payments of $500 for 15 months. Six months later, the son defaulted on the payment plan, and the car lot sought recovery from the father without first suing the son. With regard to the father's obligation under his promise to the finance manager, the court would most likely\n\nA. relieve the father of liability, because the car lot failed to first sue the son.\nB. relieve the father of liability, because the father was never under a duty as a surety.\nC. not relieve the father of liability, because of the main purpose exception.\nD. not relieve the father of liability, because parents are responsible for the debts of their children.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is C. not relieve the father of liability, because of the main purpose exception.\n\nIn this scenario, the father acted as a guarantor or surety by promising to pay the balance due if his son defaulted on the payments. The main purpose exception to the suretyship rules applies when the primary purpose of the transaction is to benefit the guarantor, rather than the principal debtor. In this case, the father's primary purpose in making the promise was to help his son acquire the car, but it can also be argued that there was an indirect benefit to the father as well, such as ensuring his son's transportation and education. Therefore, the court would most likely hold the father liable under his promise to the finance manager, despite the son defaulting on the payments. The fact that the car lot did not first sue the son does not necessarily relieve the father of his liability as a guarantor."
