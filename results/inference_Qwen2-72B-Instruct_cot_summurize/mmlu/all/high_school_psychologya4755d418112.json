Humanistic\n\nHumanistic theories of personality, such as those proposed by Carl Rogers and Abraham Maslow, emphasize free will, personal growth, and the inherent goodness of people. They suggest that individuals have the capacity to make choices and are not simply determined by their environment or biology. This perspective contrasts with more deterministic models like behaviorism (which focuses on environmental conditioning) and biological/evolutionary approaches (which emphasize genetic and evolutionary factors)."
