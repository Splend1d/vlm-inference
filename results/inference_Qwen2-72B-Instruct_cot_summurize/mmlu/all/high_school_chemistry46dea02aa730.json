When it loses one electron to form Rb+, its electron configuration becomes [Kr], which is the same as that of a krypton atom.\n\nB. Se2- - Selenium (Se) has an atomic number of 34, and its electron configuration is [Ar] 4s2 3d10 4p4. When it gains two electrons to form Se2-, its electron configuration becomes [Ar] 4s2 3d10 4p6, which is the same as that of a krypton atom.\n\nC. As5+ - Arsenic (As) has an atomic number of 33, and its electron configuration is [Ar] 4s2 3d10 4p3. When it loses five electrons to form As5+, its electron configuration becomes [Ar] 4s2 3d10, which is not the same as that of a krypton atom. It is instead similar to the configuration of a calcium atom.\n\nD. Sr2+ - Strontium (Sr) has an atomic number of 38, and its electron configuration is [Kr] 5s2. When it loses two electrons to form Sr2+, its electron configuration becomes [Kr], which is the same as that of a krypton atom.\n\nTherefore, all of the ions except for As5+ have the same electron configuration as a krypton atom."
