Let's check the other options:\n\nB. 1: The intersection could indeed have a dimension of 1. This would happen if the two subspaces overlap in only one line (a 1-dimensional subspace).\n\nC. 2: The intersection could also have a dimension of 2. This would occur if the two subspaces overlap in a plane (a 2-dimensional subspace).\n\nD. 3: However, the intersection cannot have a dimension of 3. If it did, then by the formula above:\n\ndim(V + W) = 4 + 4 - 3 = 5\n\nBut since V and W are both subspaces of X, their sum must also be a subspace of X, and its dimension cannot exceed the dimension of X, which is 7. However, if V \u2229 W had a dimension of 3, then the sum of V and W would be 5-dimensional, which is possible within a 7-dimensional space. But we need to consider the maximum possible dimension for V+W. Since V and W are each 4-dimensional, the maximum dimension for their sum would be 7 (the dimension of X), and that would require their intersection to have a dimension of at most 1. So, D. 3 is indeed impossible given the constraints.\n\nSo the correct answer is D. 3."
