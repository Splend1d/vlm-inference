To convert this repeating decimal into a fraction, we can use the following method:\n\n1. Set up the equation: $x = 0.\\overline{7}$\n2. Multiply both sides by 10 to shift the decimal point one place to the right: $10x = 7.\\overline{7}$\n3. Subtract the original equation from this new equation to eliminate the repeating part: $10x - x = 7.\\overline{7} - 0.\\overline{7}$\n4. Simplify: $9x = 7$\n5. Solve for $x$: $x = \\frac{7}{9}$\n\nThus, $0.\\overline{7} = \\frac{7}{9}$. The question asks for the reciprocal of this fraction, which is simply the fraction flipped over. Therefore, the reciprocal of $\\frac{7}{9}$ is $\\boxed{\\frac{9}{7}}$, which corresponds to option D."
