Both A and B.\n\nIn digital electronics, a three-state buffer (also known as a tri-state buffer) can have three possible output states: high (1), low (0), and high-impedance (float). This high-impedance state is often referred to as \"float\" because it allows the buffer's output to be effectively disconnected from the circuit, neither sourcing nor sinking current. Thus, both options A and B accurately describe the output states of a three-state buffer. The terms \"High\" and \"Low\" are simply alternative ways of describing \"1\" and \"0\", respectively, in the context of logic levels. Options D (Set, Reset, Halt) does not describe the output states of a three-state buffer but rather refers to control signals or states that might be associated with flip-flops or other sequential logic circuits."
