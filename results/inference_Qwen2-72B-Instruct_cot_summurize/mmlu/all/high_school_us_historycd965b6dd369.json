After a recital of a case of peculiar hardship one of them exclaimed: \"Wouldn't it be fine if we had a boarding club of our own, and then we could stand behind each other in a time like this?\" After that events moved quickly. We \u2026 discussed all the difficulties and fascinations of such an undertaking, and on the first of May, 1891, two comfortable apartments near Hull House were rented and furnished. The Settlement was responsible for the furniture and paid the first month's rent, but beyond that the members managed the club themselves.\u2026 At the end of the third year the club occupied all of the six apartments which the original building contained, and numbered fifty members.\n\u2014Jane Addams, Twenty Years at Hull House, 1912\nSettlement houses like Hull House expressed a desire of reformers to do which of the following?\n\nA. Convert immigrants to Christianity\nB. Prevent political radicalism\nC. Provide cheap labor for industry\nD. Improve conditions in urban neighborhoods\n"

Specifically, the excerpt discusses the establishment of a boarding club to support working girls during times of hardship, such as strikes, by providing them with affordable housing and a sense of community. This initiative aimed to empower these women by offering mutual support and stability, allowing them to better withstand economic pressures and maintain their resolve during labor disputes.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Improve conditions in urban neighborhoods\n\nThe other options (A, B, and C) are not supported by the information provided in the passage. There is no mention of religious conversion efforts (A), attempts to prevent political radicalism (B), or provision of cheap labor for industry (C). Instead, the focus is on social welfare and support for the working class."
