However, based on the statement you've given about post-modern ethics, it aligns with the idea that ethics are indeed context-specific and individual-specific, suggesting that there is an internal guide to ethics for each person (which could be considered as part of their conscience or personal values). If your numbered list includes these concepts, then the correct answer might be C. 1,2,3 or B. 1,3, depending on what else is included in those options. Could you please provide the full list of statements for clarity?"
