The Orient is a constructed subject that is imagined as inferior, irrational, and backward, in comparison to the West.\n\nSaid's concept of Orientalism, as presented in his influential book \"Orientalism\" (1978), argues that the 'Orient' has been historically constructed and portrayed by Western scholars, artists, and policymakers as fundamentally different and inferior to the West. This depiction has served to justify colonialism and domination by positioning the West as rational, civilized, and enlightened, while the East is seen as exotic, mysterious, and uncivilized."
