In his defense, the defendant has testified that he had no intention of keeping the car but got caught up in marital problems and simply delayed returning it. The defendant calls a witness to testify that the defendant told him, during the two days, \"I'm going to return this car as soon as I work things out with my wife.\" Is the witness's testimony admissible?\n\nA. No, because it is a self-serving statement by an accused.\nB. No, because it is hearsay not within any exception.\nC. Yes, as a prior consistent statement of the defendant.\nD. Yes, as a statement by the defendant of his then-existing state of mind.\n"

Yes, as a statement by the defendant of his then-existing state of mind.\n\nThe witness's testimony is admissible because it falls under an exception to the hearsay rule. Rule 803(3) of the Federal Rules of Evidence allows for the admission of statements that reflect the declarant's then-existing state of mind, emotion, sensation, or physical condition, including statements of intent, plan, motive, design, mental feeling, pain, and bodily health. In this case, the defendant's statement about his intention to return the car can be considered relevant to show his state of mind at the time he made the statement, which could be used to support his defense that he never intended to permanently deprive the owner of the car."
