In scenario 1, causing unnecessary harm to an animal for entertainment is cruel and unethical. In scenario 2, digging a hole in a public space without permission can be dangerous to others and is considered vandalism or destruction of public property, which is also morally and legally wrong. However, the severity and nature of the wrongness differ between the two scenarios."
