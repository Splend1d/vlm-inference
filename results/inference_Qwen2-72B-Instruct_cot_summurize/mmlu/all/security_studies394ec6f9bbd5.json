The increased levels of globalization in trade, finance, and movement have produced an environment conducive to TNC by making it easier for criminals to move illicit profits and illegal goods, provide service, and smuggle persons across borders.\nB. The wave of political transitions to democracy and economic transitions to free market capitalism since the 1980s - a phenomenon which frequently occurred simultaneously in the same country - have undermined state capacity to enforce rule of law and created new opportunities for organized crime groups to penetrate societies in transition.\nC. The sharp increase in civil conflicts around the globe also created a new generation of refugees. These diasporas have provided the family and ethnic ties that help facilitate a transnational criminal enterprise.\nD. All of these options.\n"

Globalization has indeed made it easier for transnational criminal organizations (TNCs) to operate across borders, as they can exploit the interconnectedness of economies and societies to move illicit goods and funds with greater ease.\n\nB. Political and economic transitions, particularly from authoritarian regimes or planned economies to democratic systems and free markets, often lead to a period of instability and weakened state institutions. This creates opportunities for organized crime to take root and flourish, as the state may lack the capacity to effectively enforce laws and maintain order.\n\nC. Civil conflicts have led to massive movements of people, creating diaspora communities around the world. These communities can sometimes be exploited by criminal networks, which use existing social connections to facilitate illegal activities such as human trafficking, smuggling, and other forms of organized crime.\n\nAll three factors have contributed to undermining state authority in various ways, by challenging the state's ability to control its territory, regulate its economy, and maintain social order."
