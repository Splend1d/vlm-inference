This results in a high conductivity of the solution due to the presence of these ions which can carry electric current.\n\nAcetic acid (CH3COOH or HC2H3O2) is a weak electrolyte as it only partially ionizes in water.\n\nPhosphorus pentachloride (PCl5) does not ionize in water; instead, it reacts with water to form phosphoric acid (H3PO4) and hydrochloric acid (HCl), but PCl5 itself is not an electrolyte in aqueous solution."
