He suggests that the availability of euthanasia could create a subtle pressure on patients to choose death over continued suffering, even if they would prefer to continue living. This pressure could come from family members, healthcare providers, or society at large, and could make patients feel like a burden or like they are imposing on others by continuing to live. As a result, patients may feel compelled to justify their decision to continue living, which can undermine their autonomy and dignity."
