One major factor is America's increased prominence in international affairs (I), which has required more active involvement from the President in foreign policy decisions and negotiations. Another factor is the New Deal and other programs that have expanded federal responsibility (III), giving the President a greater role in domestic policy and social welfare programs. Lastly, the development of mass media (IV) has made the President more visible to the public, increasing their influence and ability to communicate directly with citizens. However, continually improved public confidence in the federal government (II) is not necessarily a reason for the growth in presidential power and prestige, as public confidence can fluctuate over time."
