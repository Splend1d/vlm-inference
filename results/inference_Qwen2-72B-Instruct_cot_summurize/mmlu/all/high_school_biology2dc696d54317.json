ATP and NADPH provide the power and raw materials for the Calvin cycle.\n\nThe light reactions of photosynthesis, which occur in the thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts, produce ATP (adenosine triphosphate) and NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate). These energy-rich molecules are then used in the Calvin cycle, also known as the light-independent reactions or the dark reactions, to convert carbon dioxide into glucose. The Calvin cycle takes place in the stroma of the chloroplasts. The energy from ATP and the reducing power of NADPH drive the conversion of CO2 into organic molecules, such as glucose, through a series of enzymatic reactions."
