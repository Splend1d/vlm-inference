He can date her because he was a medical student, not a physician, when he contributed to her care\nB. He can date her because she is no longer his patient\nC. He can date her, but only after at least 1 year has passed since he treated her\nD. He cannot date her because she was once his psychiatric patient\n"

This is especially true in psychiatric settings where patients often share deeply personal information. Dating a former patient, even after they have been discharged, can exploit the power imbalance inherent in the doctor-patient relationship and potentially harm the patient. Many professional guidelines, including those of the American Psychiatric Association, prohibit romantic or sexual relationships with current or former patients."
