It can be increased in several ways:\n\nI. Increasing the sample size: This is correct because a larger sample size generally provides more information about the population, making it easier to detect an effect if one exists. As a result, the test's power increases.\n\nII. Increasing the significance level (alpha): This is also correct because increasing the significance level reduces the chance of committing a Type I error (incorrectly failing to reject the null hypothesis when it is false), but it increases the power of the test by making it more likely to reject the null hypothesis.\n\nIII. Increasing the probability of a Type II error (beta): This is incorrect because increasing the probability of a Type II error actually decreases the power of the test. The power of a test is 1 - beta, so as beta increases, the power decreases.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. I and II."
