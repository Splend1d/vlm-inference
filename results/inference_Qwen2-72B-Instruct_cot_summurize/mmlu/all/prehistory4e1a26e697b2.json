It tested the ability of human beings to adapt.\n\nThe late Pleistocene to early Holocene climate change, which included the last Ice Age and the subsequent warming period, had significant effects on human populations. These changes in climate led to fluctuating environments, including colder temperatures during the Ice Age and warmer conditions during the Holocene. This variability tested human adaptability, leading to innovations such as clothing (option C) and changes in diet, technology, and migration patterns. While some populations may have moved toward the equator (option A), this was not the only response, and the overall effect was a demonstration of human resilience and adaptability in the face of environmental challenges. Option D is incorrect because there is ample evidence that these climate changes had profound impacts on human societies."
