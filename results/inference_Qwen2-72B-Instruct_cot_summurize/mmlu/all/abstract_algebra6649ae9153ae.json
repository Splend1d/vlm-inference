This means that the polynomial cannot be factored into polynomials of lower degree with coefficients in \\(\\mathbb{Z}_3\\).\n\nLet's test each option:\n\n### A. \\(c = 0\\)\n\nThe polynomial becomes \\(x^3 + 1\\). We need to check if this polynomial has any roots in \\(\\mathbb{Z}_3\\), as having a root would imply it is reducible (since we can factor out \\((x - r)\\) where \\(r\\) is a root).\n\n- For \\(x = 0\\): \\(0^3 + 1 = 1\\)\n- For \\(x = 1\\): \\(1^3 + 1 = 2\\)\n- For \\(x = 2\\): \\(2^3 + 1 = 8 + 1 = 9 = 0\\) in \\(\\mathbb{Z}_3\\)\n\nSo, \\(x = 2\\) is a root, which means \\(x^3 + 1 = (x - 2)(x^2 + 2x + 1)\\) is reducible. Thus, when \\(c = 0\\), the quotient ring is not a field.\n\n### B. \\(c = 2\\)\n\nThe polynomial becomes \\(x^3 + 2x^2 + 1\\).\n\n- For \\(x = 0\\): \\(0^3 + 2\\cdot0^2 + 1 = 1\\)\n- For \\(x = 1\\): \\(1^3 + 2\\cdot1^2 + 1 = 4 = 1\\) in \\(\\mathbb{Z}_3\\)\n- For \\(x = 2\\): \\(2^3 + 2\\cdot2^2 + 1 = 8 + 8 + 1 = 17 = 2\\) in \\(\\mathbb{Z}_3\\)\n\nNone of these are zeros in \\(\\mathbb{Z}_3\\), so the polynomial has no linear factors and thus is irreducible. Therefore, for \\(c = 2\\), the quotient ring is a field.\n\n### C. \\(c = 1\\)\n\nThe polynomial becomes \\(x^3 + x^2 + 1\\).\n\n- For \\(x = 0\\): \\(0^3 + 0^2 + 1 = 1\\)\n- For \\(x = 1\\): \\(1^3 + 1^2 + 1 = 3 = 0\\) in \\(\\mathbb{Z}_3\\)\n\nSince \\(x = 1\\) is a root, the polynomial is reducible. Thus, when \\(c = 1\\), the quotient ring is not a field.\n\n### D. \\(c = 3\\)\n\nIn \\(\\mathbb{Z}_3\\), \\(3 \\equiv 0\\), so this case reduces to the case of \\(c = 0\\), which we already determined does not yield a field.\n\nTherefore, the only value of \\(c\\) in \\(\\mathbb{Z}_3\\) for which \\(\\mathbb{Z}_3[x]/(x^3 + cx^2 + 1)\\) is a field is **B. \\(c = 2\\)**."
