This test can be used to detect autocorrelation up to any specific order, making it suitable for testing up to third order autocorrelation. \n\nA. The Durbin-Watson test can only detect first-order autocorrelation.\nB. White's test is used for detecting heteroskedasticity, not autocorrelation.\nC. The RESET test is used to check for model specification errors, such as omitted variables or incorrect functional form, not for autocorrelation."
