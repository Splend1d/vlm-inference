The firm will continue to hire additional workers as long as the value of the marginal product (VMP), which is the MPL multiplied by the price of the output, exceeds the wage rate. When VMP equals the wage rate, the firm has reached its optimal level of labor employment, as hiring an additional worker would not increase profits."
