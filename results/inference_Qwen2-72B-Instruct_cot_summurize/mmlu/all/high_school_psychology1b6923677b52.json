Providing acceleration for gifted students, especially within the areas of their interests and skills\n\nResearch indicates that acceleration, which can include grade-skipping, subject acceleration, early entrance to school, and other forms of advanced placement, is one of the most effective educational strategies for gifted students. It allows them to learn at a pace and depth appropriate to their abilities and interests, reducing boredom and underachievement (Assouline, Colangelo, & Mohn, 2009). Acceleration has been shown to have positive effects on academic achievement, motivation, and social-emotional well-being when implemented appropriately (Van Tassel-Baska, 1991).\n\nWhile the other options mentioned\u2014heterogeneous grouping, independent research projects, and cooperative learning\u2014can also be beneficial in certain contexts, they may not always provide the level of challenge and stimulation that gifted students need. Acceleration, tailored specifically to a student's individual needs, often proves to be the most effective approach.\n\nReferences:\n- Assouline, S. G., Colangelo, N., & Mohn, D. L. (2009).
