Implied authorization refers to a situation where the UNSC does not explicitly authorize an action but such authorization can be inferred from its silence, previous resolutions, or the circumstances surrounding a particular issue.\n\nHowever, if I have to choose the closest answer based on the given options, it would be:\n\nA. Presumption of Security Council approval of armed force when a State has been forewarned\n\nThis option comes closest to describing a scenario where implied authorization might be inferred, although it's still not a precise definition. Implied authorization often arises when the UNSC does not issue a clear prohibition or explicit authorization for certain actions, and parties involved interpret the council's stance as tacitly permitting those actions."
