                    "text": "The correct answer is C. By contracting, changing gravitational potential energy into thermal energy.\n\nJupiter generates its internal heat primarily through the process of gravitational contraction. This is known as the Kelvin-Helmholtz mechanism. As the planet contracts under its own gravity, the gravitational potential energy is converted into thermal energy, which heats up the interior of the planet. This process continues until the core of the planet reaches a state of hydrostatic equilibrium where the inward force of gravity is balanced by the outward pressure from the hot, dense material in the core.\n\nWhile Jupiter does have a rapid rotation rate and differential rotation (where different parts of the planet rotate at different speeds), this does not contribute significantly to the planet's internal heat generation. Similarly, chemical reactions are not thought to play a significant role in generating Jupiter's internal heat. Nuclear fusion, which powers stars like our Sun, does not occur in Jupiter because it does not have enough mass or temperature in its core to initiate and sustain fusion reactions."
