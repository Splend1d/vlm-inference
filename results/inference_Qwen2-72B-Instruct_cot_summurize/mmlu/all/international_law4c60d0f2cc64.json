Instead, it introduced various reforms aimed at improving the efficiency of the court, including changes to the admissibility procedure and the abolition of the Commission of Human Rights. The term of office for judges remained at six years, although Protocol 14 did introduce a system of staggered elections to ensure continuity in the composition of the Court."
