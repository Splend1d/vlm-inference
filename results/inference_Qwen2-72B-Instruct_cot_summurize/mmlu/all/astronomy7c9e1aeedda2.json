This type occurs in binary systems.\n\nType Ia supernovae occur in binary systems where a white dwarf star accretes matter from its companion star until it reaches a critical mass and undergoes a thermonuclear explosion. This makes option A the correct answer. Type Ia supernovae do not necessarily occur only in young galaxies (option B is incorrect), nor do they produce gamma-ray bursts (option C is incorrect) or specifically high amounts of X-rays compared to other forms of radiation during their peak (option D is incorrect, although they can emit X-rays during certain phases)."
