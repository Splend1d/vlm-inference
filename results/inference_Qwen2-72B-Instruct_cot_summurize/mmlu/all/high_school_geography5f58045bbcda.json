In a unitary state, power is held by a central government, and local or regional authorities have limited autonomy. In contrast, in a federal state, power is divided between a central government and constituent political units, such as provinces, states, or cantons, which have a degree of self-governance.\n\nHere's a brief overview of the other options:\n\nA. Canada: A federal state with 10 provinces and 3 territories.\nB. United States: A federal state with 50 states and several territories.\nD. People's Republic of China: Although it is often described as a unitary state, the PRC has some features that resemble federalism, such as autonomous regions. However, it is primarily considered a unitary state with a single-party system."
