Certain kinds of visuospatial tasks are performed better by the right hemisphere than by the left.\n\nStudies on individuals with split brains, resulting from surgical severing of the corpus callosum (the bundle of fibers connecting the two hemispheres), have revealed that the two hemispheres have specialized functions. One of the most consistent findings is that the right hemisphere is superior in processing spatial and visual information, while the left hemisphere is typically dominant for language and analytical tasks. However, it's important to note that the brain's functions are highly interconnected, and the division of labor between the hemispheres can vary among individuals and tasks."
