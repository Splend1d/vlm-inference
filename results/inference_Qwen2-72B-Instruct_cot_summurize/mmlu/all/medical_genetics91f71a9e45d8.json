In this case, the primary defect is renal agenesis (the absence of one or both kidneys). This leads to oligohydramnios (low amniotic fluid) because the fetus is not producing urine to contribute to the amniotic fluid volume. The oligohydramnios then results in pulmonary hypoplasia (underdevelopment of the lungs), as the lack of amniotic fluid restricts chest expansion and lung growth. Each subsequent abnormality follows logically from the initial defect, forming a sequence."
