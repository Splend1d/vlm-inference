High dose \u03b2-carotene supplements\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the other factors listed can increase the risk of other types of cancer or health issues, but they are not specifically linked to an increased risk of lung cancer in the same way that high dose \u03b2-carotene supplements have been shown to be. Smoking tobacco is by far the leading cause of lung cancer, but this option was not provided.\n\nResearch has shown that high doses of beta-carotene supplements may actually increase the risk of lung cancer in certain populations, particularly smokers and individuals exposed to asbestos. This finding came from studies like the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention (ATBC) Study and the Beta-Carotene and Retinol Efficacy Trial (CARET), which found higher rates of lung cancer among participants taking beta-carotene supplements compared to those taking placebos.\n\nIt should also be mentioned that obesity and alcohol consumption can contribute to various cancers and health problems, but their direct link to lung cancer is less established compared to smoking and exposure to certain environmental pollutants. Saturated fat intake is more commonly associated with heart disease and other health issues rather than lung cancer."
