The formula for the multiplier is 1/(1-MPC). In this case, the MPC is 0.75, so the multiplier is 1/(1-0.75) = 4.\n\nThis means that every dollar spent will generate four times as much in economic activity due to the multiplier effect. So if Tiger Woods spends $1 on a golf ball, the total increase in England's real GDP could potentially be $4.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that this assumes that all of the money spent circulates within the English economy, and that there are no leakages such as savings or imports. In reality, the impact on GDP may be less than this theoretical maximum.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\nD. $4"
