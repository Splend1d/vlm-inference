Photosynthesis\n\nPhotosynthesis is not a source of atmospheric carbon; instead, it removes carbon dioxide from the atmosphere by converting it into organic compounds, such as glucose, which are used to build plant structures. The other options (respiration, bacterial decomposition, and combustion of fossil fuels) all contribute to the release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere."
