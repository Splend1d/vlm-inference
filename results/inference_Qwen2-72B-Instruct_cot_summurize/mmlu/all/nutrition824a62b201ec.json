This is because the safety evaluation of a food substance typically involves determining the acceptable daily intake (ADI) level for humans based on toxicity and dose-response data from animal studies. The ADI is calculated by dividing the no-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) from animal studies by an uncertainty factor that takes into account interspecies differences and individual variability in humans. The ADI is then compared to the estimated daily intake of the substance by humans consuming the food to ensure that it is below the ADI and therefore considered safe. However, it's worth noting that all of the options listed can be relevant to the overall safety evaluation of a food substance."
