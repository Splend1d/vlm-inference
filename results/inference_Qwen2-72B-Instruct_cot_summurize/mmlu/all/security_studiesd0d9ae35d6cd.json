However, if I have to choose one that might be considered less universally applicable, it would be:\n\nC. The adoption of extraordinary measures can retrospectively convince an audience of the existential threat.\n\nThis statement could be seen as less universally applicable because the effectiveness of extraordinary measures in convincing an audience of an existential threat may depend on the specific circumstances and the nature of the audience. In some cases, such measures might indeed help to reinforce the perception of a threat, but in others, they might lead to skepticism or backlash against the securitizing actor. Nonetheless, this statement can still be valid in many instances of the securitization process. \n\nIt's important to note that securitization theory posits that the success of a securitization move (the framing of an issue as an existential threat requiring emergency measures) depends on the acceptance of the audience. The other three statements are generally accepted as part of the securitization framework. Statement A highlights the role of the securitizing actor; B points out the importance of the audience, especially in democratic contexts; and D acknowledges the potential dominance of certain actors in non-democratic settings."
