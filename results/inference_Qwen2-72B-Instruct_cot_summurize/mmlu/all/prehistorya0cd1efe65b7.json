All of the above.\n\nArchaeological remains can be discovered through various methods, including stumbling upon them accidentally while walking in the woods (option A), conducting extensive excavations over a large area (option B), or utilizing advanced technology such as satellite imaging to identify potential sites from space (option C). Therefore, all three options could potentially lead to the discovery of archaeological remains like those at Pilfershire. However, it's important to note that once a site is identified, proper archaeological procedures must be followed to ensure the preservation and accurate interpretation of the findings."
