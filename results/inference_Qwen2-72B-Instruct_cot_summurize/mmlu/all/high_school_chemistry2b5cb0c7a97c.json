This implies that there is a positive enthalpy change (\\(\\Delta H > 0\\)), as energy is taken in by the system (the substance melting).\n\nAdditionally, when a solid melts, the particles gain freedom of movement, transitioning from a highly ordered crystalline structure to a less ordered liquid state. This increase in disorder corresponds to an increase in entropy. Therefore, the entropy change (\\(\\Delta S\\)) for the melting of a solid is also positive.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\nA. positive enthalpy change and positive entropy change."
