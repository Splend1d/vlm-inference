The patient states that he is filing a lawsuit against the limousine company that employs him because he developed post-traumatic stress disorder following a motor vehicle collision. He appears irritable and tense as he provides his history. He relays his symptoms by reading them aloud from a written list. At this time, which of the following is the most appropriate approach toward confirming the underlying diagnosis of this patient?\n\nA. Administer amobarbital and then interview the patient\nB. Ask the patient to provide a narrative with detailed description of the incident and of his symptoms\nC. Interview the patient under hypnosis\nD. Interview the patient while paying close attention to his willingness to make eye contact\n"

Ask the patient to provide a narrative with a detailed description of the incident and of his symptoms.\n\nThis approach allows the physician to gather detailed information about the patient's experience and symptoms in their own words, which can be crucial for confirming a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Asking the patient to describe the incident and their symptoms in detail can help assess the presence of core PTSD symptoms such as re-experiencing, avoidance, negative alterations in mood and cognition, and alterations in arousal and reactivity. It also provides an opportunity to evaluate the patient's affect, thought processes, and overall mental status, which can be informative in diagnosing PTSD and ruling out other potential conditions."
