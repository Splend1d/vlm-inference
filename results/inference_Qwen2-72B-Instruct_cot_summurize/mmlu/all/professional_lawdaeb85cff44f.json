Upon delivery, the buyer was surprised to find an assortment of pacific wild salmon, domestic salmon raised in captivity, and mixed east coast salmon. In prior discussions, the parties agreed on all pacific wild salmon for fulfillment of the order, and none of the other inferior types were discussed. Does the parol evidence rule apply to preclude the buyer's testimony regarding what kind of salmon the parties' intended by the term \"quality salmon\" in the written contract?\n\nA. No, the parol evidence rule does not apply to preclude testimony in cases such as this one where the testimony would explain what the parties meant by the terms they used.\nB. Yes, the parol evidence rule applies to preclude the testimony because the testimony would add to or contradict the final signed writing.\nC. No, the parol evidence rule does not apply because the contract was reduced to writing.\nD. Yes, the parol evidence rule applies to preclude the testimony because the terms of the contract were not recorded and preserved at the time of signing the contract.\n"

No, the parol evidence rule does not apply to preclude testimony in cases such as this one where the testimony would explain what the parties meant by the terms they used.\n\nThe parol evidence rule generally prohibits the introduction of oral or extrinsic evidence that contradicts, varies, or adds to the terms of a complete and unambiguous written contract. However, the rule does not apply when the written contract is ambiguous or when there is evidence of fraud, mistake, or misrepresentation. In this case, the term \"quality salmon\" could be considered ambiguous if it is not defined in the contract, and the buyer's testimony about the prior discussions regarding the type of salmon (all pacific wild salmon) could be used to clarify the meaning of the term as it was understood by both parties during their negotiations."
