The auditor lacks independence with respect to the entity.\n\nIndependence is a fundamental principle for auditors, and if it is compromised, the auditor cannot issue any type of audit opinion, including a qualified opinion. A qualified opinion indicates that the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the company except for certain matters which could influence the decision-making of users. However, if the auditor is not independent, this calls into question the integrity and objectivity of the audit process, making it impossible to issue a qualified or unqualified opinion.\n\nOptions B, C, and D describe situations where a qualified opinion might be appropriate because they involve limitations on the scope of the audit or disagreement with management, but they do not necessarily preclude the issuance of a qualified opinion. Lack of independence, however, is a more serious issue that would prevent any type of opinion from being issued. In such cases, the auditor would need to withdraw from the engagement or disclose the lack of independence in the report, which would likely result in a disclaimer of opinion rather than a qualified opinion."
