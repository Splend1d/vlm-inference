She has type 2 diabetes mellitus, a long history of hypertension, and chronic renal failure presumed secondary to diabetes mellitus and hypertension. Reversible causes of renal failure have been excluded. She underwent a tonsillectomy at age 9 years and a laparoscopic cholecystectomy at age 68 years. Serum creatinine concentration on admission was 6.0 mg/dL. Her current therapy includes a low-sodium, low-protein American Diabetes Association (ADA) diet, enalapril, and acetaminophen. She is a retired seamstress. She and her husband live on a farm 90 miles from the nearest dialysis facility. In considering longterm treatment options for this patient, which of the following is the most appropriate factor to consider?\n\nA. Her eligibility to receive Medicare\nB. Her history of an abdominal operation\nC. Her history of arthritis\nD. Her suitability for home dialysis\n"

Given the patient's distance from the nearest dialysis facility, her age, and medical comorbidities, home dialysis may be a more suitable option for long-term treatment. Home dialysis can offer greater flexibility and convenience for patients who live far from a dialysis center or have mobility issues. It also allows for more frequent and longer treatments, which can improve outcomes in some patients with chronic kidney disease. The patient's medical history, including her diabetes, hypertension, and renal failure, will need to be carefully evaluated to determine if she is a good candidate for home dialysis."
