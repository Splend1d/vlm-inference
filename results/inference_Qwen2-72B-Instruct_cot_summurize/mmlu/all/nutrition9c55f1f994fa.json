Females are three times more affected than males.\n\nAnorexia Nervosa does occur in both males and females, but it is indeed more prevalent among females. The ratio of females to males diagnosed with anorexia nervosa is often reported to be around 10:1, although some studies suggest it might be closer to 3:1. However, this ratio varies depending on the study and how cases are defined and identified.\n\nStatement B is incorrect because anorexia nervosa can and does occur in children and post-menopausal women, albeit less commonly than in adolescent and young adult females.\n\nStatement C is partially correct in that males from any socioeconomic background can be affected by anorexia nervosa, but this statement doesn't specifically address the epidemiology of the disorder compared to other statements.\n\nStatement D is an overestimation. The prevalence rate of anorexia nervosa in female adolescents is not as high as 2%. According to various studies, the lifetime prevalence of anorexia nervosa in females ranges from 0.3% to 1%, which is significantly lower than 2%."
