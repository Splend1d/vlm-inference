It only guarantees the existence of a subgroup of order \\(p^k\\), where \\(p^k\\) is the highest power of a prime \\(p\\) dividing \\(n\\). Therefore, Statement 1 is false in the way it's phrased here, although it's true that there exist subgroups whose orders divide the order of the group, specifically those of prime power orders.\n\nStatement 2 is known as Lagrange's Theorem which states that if \\(a\\) belongs to a finite group \\(G\\), then the order of \\(a\\) (denoted by \\(|a|\\)) divides the order of the group (\\(G\\)), denoted by \\(|G|\\). This statement is true.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. False, True."
