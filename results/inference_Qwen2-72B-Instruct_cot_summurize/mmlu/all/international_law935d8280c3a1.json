Reparation includes restitution, compensation, and satisfaction, either alone or alongside other forms of reparation\n\nIn international law, the obligation of reparation can take several forms depending on the nature of the wrong and the circumstances surrounding it. These forms include:\n\n1. **Restitution**: This involves restoring the situation which existed before the wrongful act was committed. It is the primary form of reparation and aims to put the injured party in the position they would have been in had the wrong not occurred.\n\n2. **Compensation**: When restitution is not possible or is insufficient, compensation may be awarded. This usually takes the form of financial payment to cover any damages or losses incurred as a result of the wrongful act.\n\n3. **Satisfaction**: This form of reparation is more symbolic and is used when the injury cannot be adequately redressed by restitution or compensation. Satisfaction may include apologies, public acknowledgment of the wrong, or other measures that aim to restore the dignity and reputation of the injured party.\n\nIt's important to note that these forms of reparation can be applied separately or in combination, depending on the specific requirements of each case. The determination of the appropriate form(s) of reparation is often subject to negotiation between the parties involved or decided by an international tribunal or court if the dispute is brought before one."
