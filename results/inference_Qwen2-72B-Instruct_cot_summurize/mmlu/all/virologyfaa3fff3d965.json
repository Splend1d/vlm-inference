This allows for a process known as genetic reassortment, or \"antigenic shift,\" where different strains of the virus can swap segments during co-infection of a single host cell, leading to new combinations of viral genes. This is one of the main reasons why the influenza virus has complicated genetics and can rapidly evolve into new forms that may evade the immune system or vaccines."
