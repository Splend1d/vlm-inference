However, correlation does not imply causation, and regression analysis alone cannot establish causality.\n\n(iv) Is not generally used for the independent variable. \"The effect variable\" would typically refer to the outcome or the dependent variable that is affected by other variables.\n\nGiven these explanations, the correct answer is:\n\nB.
