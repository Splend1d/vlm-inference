                    "text": "A veterinarian was the owner in fee of a 50-acre tract of farmland. The veterinarian contracted to sell her property to an investor for $300,000. The parties signed a written land-sale agreement that provided for 30 monthly installment payments of $10,000 each. According to the terms of the sale agreement, the veterinarian would deliver a warranty deed to the investor upon payment of the last installment. In accordance with state law, the farmland's land-sale agreement was properly recorded. After making the first 10 installment payments, the investor discovered that there was an unrecorded mortgage on the farmland. The veterinarian, who is the mortgagor, has regularly made her mortgage payments and is not in default. This jurisdiction has the following recording statute in effect:\"No conveyance or instrument is good as against any subsequent purchaser for value and without notice, unless the same be recorded prior to subsequent purchase. \"After the investor learned of the outstanding mortgage, he discontinued making further installment payments to the veterinarian. The investor alleged that the veterinarian was in breach of the land-sale agreement due to the existence of the unrecorded mortgage. The investor sues the veterinarian for breach of contract. Ifjudgment is rendered in favor of the veterinarian, it will be because\n\nA. the installment land-sale agreement is a security device.\nB. although the land-sale agreement is actually a mortgage, it does not impair the investor's right of redemption.\nC. the prior mortgage has no legal effect on the investor's rights under the installment land-sale agreement.\nD. the time for the veterinarian, as seller, to deliver marketable title has not yet arrived.\n"

Since the investor stopped making payments after only 10 installments out of the 30 required, the time for the veterinarian to deliver marketable title has not yet arrived. The veterinarian's obligation to provide clear title is contingent upon the full payment of the agreed-upon price by the investor. Therefore, the veterinarian cannot be found in breach of the contract for failing to deliver marketable title at this point in time.\n\nAdditionally, the recording statute cited does not apply to the investor since they are not a subsequent purchaser, but rather a party to the original agreement. The fact that the mortgage was unrecorded does not affect the validity of the agreement between the veterinarian and the investor, as long as the veterinarian continues to make mortgage payments and remains in good standing with the lender."
