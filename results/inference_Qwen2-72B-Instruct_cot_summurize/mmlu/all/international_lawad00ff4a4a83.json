In this context, \"qualified rights\" are those that can be restricted or limited under certain circumstances as provided for in the convention itself.\n\nA. Article 3 - Prohibition of torture and inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. This is an absolute right and cannot be derogated from under any circumstances. Therefore, it is not a qualified right.\n\nB. Article 8 - Right to respect for private and family life. This is a qualified right because it can be limited in accordance with the conditions set out in paragraph 2 of the article.\n\nC. Article 9 - Freedom of thought, conscience, and religion. This is also a qualified right because it can be limited in accordance with the conditions set out in paragraph 2 of the article.\n\nD. Article 11 - Freedom of assembly and association. This is a qualified right because it can be limited in accordance with the conditions set out in paragraph 2 of the article.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is A. Article 3."
