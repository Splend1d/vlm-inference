If the economy is operating at a level of real GDP that is below full employment, this increase in demand can help close the output gap by stimulating economic activity and potentially reducing unemployment.\n\nHowever, the extent to which inflation might rise depends on several factors, including the size of the output gap (how much below full employment the economy is), the responsiveness of supply to increased demand, and the overall state of monetary policy.\n\nIn the given scenario, since equilibrium real GDP is far below full employment, there is significant idle capacity in the economy. This means that the economy has room to grow without immediately causing high levels of inflation. The additional demand generated by lower taxes can be met by putting underutilized resources, such as labor and capital, back to work.\n\nTherefore, the most likely outcome would be:\n\nA. Unemployment falls with little inflation.\n\nThis is because the economy can absorb the additional demand without significant price pressures due to the existing slack in the labor market and production capacity."
