The subject \"Eileen\" is represented by the constant 'e', and \"plays fiddle\" is represented as the predicate 'F'. Thus, \"Eileen plays fiddle\" becomes 'Fe'. Similarly, \"Sherri sings\" becomes 'Ss'. Therefore, \"If Eileen plays fiddle then Sherri sings\" is correctly translated as 'Fe \u2283 Ss'."
