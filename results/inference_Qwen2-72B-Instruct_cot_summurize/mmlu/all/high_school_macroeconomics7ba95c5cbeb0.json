In the short run, there is a negative relationship between inflation and unemployment (as inflation increases, unemployment decreases, and vice versa), whereas in the long run, the relationship is considered to be constant (or more accurately, the curve becomes vertical), meaning that there is no trade-off between inflation and unemployment. The economy adjusts to a natural rate of unemployment regardless of the inflation rate."
