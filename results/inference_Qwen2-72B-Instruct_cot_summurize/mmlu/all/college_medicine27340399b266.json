This process typically occurs in muscle cells during intense exercise when oxygen supply is insufficient for aerobic metabolism. Anaerobic metabolism involves the breakdown of glucose or other organic molecules to generate ATP without the need for oxygen as an electron acceptor, unlike aerobic metabolism."
