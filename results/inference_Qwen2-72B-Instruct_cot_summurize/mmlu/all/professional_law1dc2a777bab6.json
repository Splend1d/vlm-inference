A few moments later, a train conductor shouted, \"All aboard!\" to indicate that the train was about to depart the station. At that moment, a man, carrying a large cardboard box, came running through the station toward the train \"Wait for me!\" he shouted as he ran toward the train. The man with the box reached the edge of the platform, next to the train, just as the train started to move. The man hesitated, unsure of whether he should give up or go ahead and jump onto the train even though it was moving. A railroad worker, who happened to be standing next to the train, decided to be helpful. He said, \"You can make it,\" and gave the man a shove toward the open door of the train. The man stumbled and dropped the box that he was carrying. Instantly, the box made a loud screeching noise. The box contained powerful fireworks, and the impact of the box hitting the ground had caused a large rocket to ignite. The rocket flew out of the box and shot across the train station, glancing off the ceiling and finally crashing into a wall of a small coffee shop on the far side of the train station, about 150 feet from the train. The rocket's collision caused a shelf on the wall to fall. A large container of coffee that was on the shelf fell and hit a customer who was sitting in the shop and enjoying a cup of coffee. The coffee shop customer suffered an injury to her shoulder as a result of being hit by the container of coffee. If the coffee shop customer asserts a negligence claim against the railroad, which of the following elements of her claim will the plaintiff be unable to satisfy?\n\nA. Duty.\nB. Breach.\nC. Cause-in-fact.\nD. Proximate or legal causation.\n"

                    "text": "The element of the claim that the plaintiff will likely have difficulty satisfying is D. Proximate or legal causation. \n\nProximate cause refers to the legal principle that holds a defendant responsible for the reasonably foreseeable consequences of his actions. In this case, while the actions of the railroad worker (shoving the man) and the subsequent chain of events led to the customer's injury, it could be argued that the injury was not a reasonably foreseeable consequence of the worker's actions. The ignition of the powerful fireworks inside the box and the resulting rocket flying across the station, hitting the ceiling, and causing damage to the coffee shop and its patrons is a highly unusual and unforeseeable sequence of events.\n\nWhile the worker may have breached a duty of care by shoving the man onto the moving train, leading to cause-in-fact (the direct link between the action and the harm), the proximate causation element requires that the harm be a foreseeable result of the breach. Given the extraordinary circumstances, the railroad might successfully argue that the customer's injury was not a reasonably foreseeable result of the worker's actions, thus potentially absolving them of liability under the doctrine of proximate causation."
