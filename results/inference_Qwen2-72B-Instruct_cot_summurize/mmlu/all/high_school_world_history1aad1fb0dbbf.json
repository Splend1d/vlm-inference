Without meaning to say that the foreigners harbor such destructive intentions in their hearts, we yet positively assert that from their inordinate thirst after gain, they are perfectly careless about the injuries they inflict upon us! And such being the case, we should like to ask what has become of that conscience which heaven has implanted in the breasts of all men? We have heard that in your own country opium is prohibited with the utmost strictness and severity. This is a strong proof that you know full well how hurtful it is to mankind. Since you do not permit it to injure your own country, you ought not to have this injurious drug transferred to another country, and above all others, how much less to the Inner Land! Of the products which China exports to your foreign countries, there is not one which is not beneficial to mankind in some shape or other.\nLin Zexu, Chinese trade commissioner, letter to Queen Victoria, 1839\nWhich of the following background facts persuaded Europeans to engage in the actions described in the passage?\n\nA. China had recently placed an embargo on exports of silk.\nB. The price of Chinese tea had risen higher than European buyers found acceptable.\nC. China refused to allow a meaningful volume of European goods to be sold there.\nD. China's emperor had repeatedly insulted the British ambassador.\n"

China refused to allow a meaningful volume of European goods to be sold there.\n\nThis situation created a trade imbalance, as European demand for Chinese goods (such as tea, silk, and porcelain) was high, while Chinese demand for European goods was low. To counteract this imbalance and continue to profit from trade with China, Europeans, particularly the British, turned to the opium trade. They sold opium to Chinese merchants, which helped to balance their payments for Chinese goods. This action led to the Opium Wars between Britain and China in the mid-19th century."
