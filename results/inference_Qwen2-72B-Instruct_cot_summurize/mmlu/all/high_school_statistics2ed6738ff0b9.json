When you choose a significance level \u03b1, you're setting the probability of a Type I error to exactly \u03b1.\n\nExplanation for other options:\nA. The probability of a Type II error (\u03b2) is not directly dependent on the probability of a Type I error (\u03b1), but they are indirectly related through the power of the test (1-\u03b2). As you decrease \u03b1 (making it harder to reject the null hypothesis), \u03b2 typically increases (making it easier to fail to reject a false null hypothesis).\nB. It is not possible to simultaneously make both a Type I and a Type II error in the same hypothesis test because a Type I error occurs when you incorrectly reject a true null hypothesis, while a Type II error occurs when you incorrectly fail to reject a false null hypothesis.\nC. A Type II error occurs when you fail to reject a false null hypothesis, regardless of the distribution of the data. Assuming that the data are normally distributed when they are not could affect the validity of your test results, but it does not directly result in a Type II error."
