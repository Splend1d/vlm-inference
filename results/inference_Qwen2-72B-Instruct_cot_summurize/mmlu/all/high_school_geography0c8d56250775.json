This family also includes languages from other parts of the world such as Persian, Hindi, and Greek. The Ural-Altaic family was once proposed but is no longer widely accepted; it would have included Finnish, Hungarian, and Turkish. Basque is a language isolate in Europe, and Phoenician is an extinct Semitic language."
