                    "text": "The act of State doctrine is a principle in international law that holds that the courts of one sovereign state will not sit in judgment on the acts of another sovereign state, performed within its own territory. This means that domestic courts will generally refrain from examining or ruling on the validity or legality of official acts taken by a foreign government within its own borders. Therefore, option D comes closest to defining the act of State doctrine accurately: it is a legal mechanism that allows courts to provide immunity to public acts of foreign states.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the application of this doctrine can vary significantly between different legal systems and jurisdictions. In some countries, the doctrine has been interpreted more narrowly, allowing for greater judicial review of certain foreign state actions under specific circumstances. For instance, the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that the act of state doctrine does not bar U.S. courts from hearing cases involving expropriation of property in violation of international law, even if the act occurred within the territory of a foreign state. This illustrates how the doctrine may be subject to exceptions and limitations depending on the legal context."
