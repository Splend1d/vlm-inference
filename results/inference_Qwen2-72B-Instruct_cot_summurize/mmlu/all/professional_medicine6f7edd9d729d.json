Pulmonary hypoplasia.\n\nOligohydramnios, or low amniotic fluid, can lead to pulmonary hypoplasia due to the lack of space for the lungs to develop properly. The absence of a urethral opening could indicate a severe form of a condition such as bladder outlet obstruction or posterior urethral valves, which can cause oligohydramnios by preventing urine from being excreted into the amniotic cavity. This would further contribute to the development of pulmonary hypoplasia."
