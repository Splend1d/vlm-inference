Resolution 678 is broader because it authorized the use of force with respect to any matter threatening the peace and security of the Gulf region. This resolution, adopted on November 29, 1990, after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, permitted member states to use \"all necessary means\" to enforce earlier resolutions demanding Iraq's withdrawal from Kuwait. This language was interpreted as giving a green light for military action against Iraq, which went beyond the traditional limits of self-defense under Article 51 of the UN Charter. The latter restricts the use of force to situations where a state is defending itself against an armed attack until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security. In contrast, Resolution 678 allowed for a more proactive approach in dealing with the aggression in the Gulf region."
