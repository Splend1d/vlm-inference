This refers to the child's ability to use symbols, such as words and images, to represent objects that are not physically present. It is during this stage that children begin to engage in pretend play and develop language skills. While option B (the object concept) is important for the sensorimotor stage, and option A (conservation) and C (formal operations) are associated with later stages of cognitive development according to Piaget's theory, the symbolic function is a key achievement of the preoperational stage."
