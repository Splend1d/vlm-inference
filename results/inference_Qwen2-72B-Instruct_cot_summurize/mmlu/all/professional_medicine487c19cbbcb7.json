                    "text": "A 38-year-old man with Down syndrome and severe mental retardation is brought to the emergency department by ambulance because of increasing lethargy for the past several hours. The patient is noncommunicative and you are unable to obtain an initial history of his present illness or a past medical history. You do not know if he takes any medications. Vital signs are temperature 38.3\u00b0C (100.9\u00b0F), pulse 90/min, respirations 19/min, and blood pressure 120/60 mm Hg. On physical examination the patient is awake but lethargic. Auscultation of the chest discloses clear lungs; cardiac examination discloses a systolic click. Neurologic examination shows decreased muscle tone. Serum electrolyte concentrations are normal. Complete blood count shows a leukocyte count of 18,000/mm3 with 23% band neutrophils. The patient's caregiver, who is also the patient's guardian, cannot be located and staff at the group home where the patient resides cannot be reached by telephone. The patient refuses lumbar puncture for examination of cerebrospinal fluid. Toxicologic screening of the urine is negative. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?\n\nA. Administer intravenous antibiotics\nB. Await contact with the caregiver before proceeding with management\nC. Obtain CT scan of the head\nD. Obtain echocardiography\n"

                    "text": "The most appropriate next step in this case would be A. Administer intravenous antibiotics. The patient's symptoms of increasing lethargy, fever, and elevated white blood cell count with a left shift (increased band neutrophils) suggest a possible bacterial infection. The presence of a systolic click on cardiac examination could indicate a heart valve abnormality that may predispose the patient to endocarditis, a serious bacterial infection of the heart valves. Given the patient's inability to communicate and the lack of available medical history, it is important to err on the side of caution and treat for a potential sepsis, which can rapidly become life-threatening. While awaiting further information, initiating empiric antibiotic therapy is prudent.\nCT scan of the head (option C) might be indicated if there were focal neurologic deficits or other signs suggestive of an acute neurological process, but the patient's symptoms are more consistent with systemic infection than with a primary neurological disorder.\nEchocardiography (option D) could be useful for evaluating the heart valve abnormality detected on physical examination, but it is not the immediate priority when facing a potentially septic patient.\nAwaiting contact with the caregiver (option B) is not advisable given the urgency of the situation and the need for prompt intervention to address what appears to be a serious infection. In cases where a patient is unable to give consent and no proxy decision-maker is immediately available, medical providers are often guided by the principle of acting in the best interest of the patient, which in this case would likely include initiating empiric antibiotic therapy."
