Confidential medical records are a personal document with closed access, meaning that only the individual to whom the records pertain and authorized healthcare providers should have access to them. The other options listed may also be considered sensitive or private, but they do not necessarily fall under the category of a personal document with closed access in the same way that medical records do. Government 'white papers' are typically public documents, household account books may be shared among members of a household, and the shares register of a business may be accessible to shareholders or regulatory authorities."
