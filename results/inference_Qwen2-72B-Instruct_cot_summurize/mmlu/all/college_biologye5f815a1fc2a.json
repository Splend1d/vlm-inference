Proton pumps (H+-ATPases) create a proton gradient across the plasma membrane, which is then used to drive the co-transport of sugars against their concentration gradient through symporters. This process is called active loading and it is essential for the long-distance transport of sugars from sources (like leaves where photosynthesis occurs) to sinks (such as growing tissues or storage organs)."
