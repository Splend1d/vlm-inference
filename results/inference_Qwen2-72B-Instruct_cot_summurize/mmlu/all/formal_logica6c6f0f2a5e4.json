Therefore, the antecedent of the conditional in premise 1 cannot be true, because if A were true, then by the conditional, both B and C would have to be true, which contradicts premise 2. Hence, A must be false for the conditional in premise 1 to hold true. So, we can conclude ~A from these premises.\n\nThe third premise, A \u2228 (D \u2228 B), does not play a role in this immediate consequence since we can already determine ~A from the first two premises alone."
