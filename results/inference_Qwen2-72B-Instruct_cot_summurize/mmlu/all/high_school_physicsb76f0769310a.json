                    "text": "The motion of a charged particle in an electric field can be analyzed using the equations of motion, considering the force exerted by the electric field on the particle. The force acting on the particle is given by:\n\n\\[ F = QE \\]\n\nwhere \\(Q\\) is the charge of the particle, and \\(E\\) is the electric field strength.\n\nThis force causes an acceleration \\(a\\) on the particle given by Newton's second law:\n\n\\[ F = ma \\]\n\nSubstituting for \\(F\\), we have:\n\n\\[ QE = ma \\]\n\nSolving for \\(a\\), we get:\n\n\\[ a = \\frac{QE}{m} \\]\n\nLet's consider the initial conditions: a particle with mass \\(m\\), charge \\(Q\\), and velocity \\(V\\) enters the electric field and travels a distance \\(d\\). The final velocity \\(V_f\\) after traveling this distance can be found using the equation of motion:\n\n\\[ V_f^2 = V^2 + 2ad \\]\n\nSubstituting for \\(a\\), we have:\n\n\\[ V_f^2 = V^2 + 2 \\left( \\frac{QE}{m} \\right) d \\]\n\nNow, let's consider the new conditions: the particle's original velocity is doubled (\\(2V\\)), and its mass is cut in half (\\(\\frac{m}{2}\\)). The acceleration under these new conditions is:\n\n\\[ a' = \\frac{QE}{m/2} = 2 \\frac{QE}{m} \\]\n\nUsing the same equation of motion to find the new distance \\(d'\\) traveled by the particle before reaching the same final velocity \\(V_f\\):\n\n\\[ V_f^2 = (2V)^2 + 2a'd' \\]\n\nSubstituting for \\(a'\\) and \\(V_f^2\\) from the first case, we have:\n\n\\[ V^2 + 2 \\left( \\frac{QE}{m} \\right) d = (2V)^2 + 2 \\left( 2 \\frac{QE}{m} \\right) d' \\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[ V^2 + 2 \\left( \\frac{QE}{m} \\right) d = 4V^2 + 4 \\left( \\frac{QE}{m} \\right) d' \\]\n\nSince the final velocity is the same in both cases, we can equate the two sides and solve for \\(d'\\):\n\n\\[ 2 \\left( \\frac{QE}{m} \\right) d = 4V^2 - V^2 + 4 \\left( \\frac{QE}{m} \\right) d' \\]\n\n\\[ 2 \\left( \\frac{QE}{m} \\right) d = 3V^2 + 4 \\left( \\frac{QE}{m} \\right) d' \\]\n\nWe know that \\(3V^2\\) doesn't affect the comparison between \\(d\\) and \\(d'\\) since it's not related to \\(d\\) or \\(d'\\). Therefore, focusing on the terms involving \\(d\\) and \\(d'\\):\n\n\\[ 2 \\left( \\frac{QE}{m} \\right) d = 4 \\left( \\frac{QE}{m} \\right) d' \\]\n\nDividing both sides by \\(2 \\left( \\frac{QE}{m} \\right)\\):\n\n\\[ d = 2d' \\]\n\nThus, when the original velocity is doubled and the mass is halved, the particle travels half the distance it would have traveled under the original conditions before reaching the same final velocity. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. 1/2d\n\nHowever, the question seems to ask how far the particle travels in total, not the distance it travels before reaching the same final velocity as in the original scenario. If we interpret the question as asking for the total distance traveled in the electric field until it stops or changes direction, then we need to consider the work-energy theorem, which states that the work done on the particle equals the change in kinetic energy. Since doubling the velocity quadruples the initial kinetic energy (\\(KE = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2\\)), and halving the mass while doubling the velocity keeps the initial kinetic energy the same, the particle will travel the same distance before coming to a stop, assuming it has enough kinetic energy to overcome the work done by the electric field over that distance. In this interpretation, the answer would be C. d, but the analysis provided above assumes the question is about reaching a specific final velocity, not stopping."
