Long conducted business on the Internet and had little contact with Frost. After Frost was declared incompetent in a judicial proceeding, Long placed an order with Grant Corp. on Frost's behalf. Both Long and Grant were unaware of Frost's incompetence. Will Frost or Frost's legal representative be liable to Grant?\n\nA. Yes, because Long's agency survived Frost's incompetence.\nB.

No, because Long did not have authority to enter into the contract.\n\nWhen Frost was declared incompetent, any existing agency relationship would typically terminate at that point. As a result, Long no longer had the authority to act on behalf of Frost. Since Long acted without authority after Frost's incompetence was declared, any contract entered into by Long on behalf of Frost would generally be voidable by Frost's legal representative. Therefore, Frost or Frost's legal representative would not be liable to Grant for the contract entered into by Long after Frost's incompetence. However, if Grant can prove that they were unaware of Frost's incompetence and that Long appeared to have the authority to act (apparent authority), there might be some exceptions where liability could still arise. In this case, the question specifies that both Long and Grant were unaware of Frost's incompetence, but the key issue is that Long lacked actual authority after the declaration of incompetence."
