These plants have a mutualistic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria.\n\nLegumes, such as beans, peas, and lentils, can grow well in nitrogen-poor soils because they have a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, primarily in the genus Rhizobium. These bacteria live in root nodules and convert atmospheric nitrogen (N2) into ammonia (NH3), which is a form of nitrogen that the plant can use to synthesize amino acids and proteins. This process is called nitrogen fixation, and it allows legumes to obtain the nitrogen they need from the air, rather than relying on nitrogen compounds in the soil."
