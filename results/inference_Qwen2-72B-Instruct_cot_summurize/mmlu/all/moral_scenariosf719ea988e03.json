In Scenario 1, offering extra money to a babysitter for staying late is generally considered a kind gesture or responsible behavior, provided that the offer is made respectfully and with clear communication about expectations. In Scenario 2, going skinny-dipping in the ocean where there are no other people around does not harm others or infringe upon their rights, assuming it's done in a private or secluded area where such behavior would not be unexpected or offensive to others. Public nudity laws vary by location, but if the area is truly uninhabited and private, this scenario would not be considered morally wrong."
