It is well to notice this advantage\u2014the advantage of complete organization. They are organized; and yet were not at the pains of creating their organizations. The State governments, where the system of slavery exists, are complete slavery organizations. The church organizations in those States are equally at the service of slavery; while the Federal Government, with its army and navy, from the chief magistracy in Washington, to the Supreme Court, and thence to the chief marshalship at New York, is pledged to support, defend, and propagate the crying curse of human bondage. The pen, the purse, and the sword, are united against the simple truth, preached by humble men in obscure places.\"\nFrederick Douglass, 1857\nThe excerpt from Frederick Douglass is most clearly an example of which of the following developments in the mid-nineteenth century?\n\nA. The gradual replacement of indentured servants with African slaves\nB. The preservation of African culture through cultural adaptation\nC. Southern influence upon the federal government to defend the institution of slavery\nD. The success of abolitionists to sway majority public opinion\n"

In the passage, Douglass criticizes how various institutions, including state governments, churches, and the federal government, are organized to support and defend slavery. He highlights the power and reach of the pro-slavery forces, extending from local levels to the highest offices of the federal government. This reflects the significant political clout that supporters of slavery had in the mid-nineteenth century, particularly in shaping federal policies and legislation favorable to the continuation and expansion of slavery."
