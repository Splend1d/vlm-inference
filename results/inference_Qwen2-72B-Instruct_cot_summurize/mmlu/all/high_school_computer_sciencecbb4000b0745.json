The bank is considering two options: a single line where the customer at the front waits for the next available teller, or separate lines for each teller. The bank decides to use a computer simulation of these two options to determine the average wait time for customers. Which of the following is NOT true about the bank's plan?\n\nA. The bank can incorporate other factors, such as the number of tellers, in the simulation.\nB. The bank can use the simulation to investigate these two options without causing inconvenience for customers.\nC. The bank may consider new alternatives based on the simulation results.\nD. The simulation will not produce usable results because actual customer data are not available.\n"

The simulation will not produce usable results because actual customer data are not available.\n\nThis statement is not true because simulations can be designed using assumptions and estimates based on industry standards or similar situations if actual customer data are not available. The simulation can still provide valuable insights into the relative performance of the two queuing systems being considered. While actual customer data would improve the accuracy of the simulation, it is not an absolute requirement for the simulation to produce usable results."
