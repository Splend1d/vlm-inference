Inward.\n\nWhen a tin can (or any object) is whirled in a horizontal circle, it experiences centripetal force, which acts toward the center of the circular path. This inward force is what keeps the can moving in a circular path rather than flying off in a straight line as Newton's first law would predict in the absence of external forces."
