This is because a surplus in one account (like the current account) implies that the country is exporting more than it is importing, leading to an inflow of foreign currency. This surplus cannot simply accumulate without limit; instead, it must be balanced by either spending that foreign currency on imports or investing it abroad.\n\nThe financial account records the net change in ownership of national assets, including purchases of foreign assets by domestic residents and sales of domestic assets to foreign residents. Therefore, if a country has a trade surplus, it often means that the excess earnings from exports are being used to purchase foreign assets, or foreigners are purchasing fewer domestic assets, leading to a corresponding deficit in the financial account.\n\nThus, the correct answer would be:\n\nD. current-account or financial-account only\n\nHowever, this option seems to imply that only one of these accounts can adjust, while in reality, both may adjust simultaneously to balance out the surplus in the current account. A more precise answer might be \"both the current-account and financial-account balances,\" but given the options provided, D is the closest choice."
