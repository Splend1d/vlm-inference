It involves the use of antiretroviral medications to prevent HIV infection in people who are HIV-negative but at high risk of becoming infected. However, specific guidance and recommendations may vary based on factors such as local epidemiology, resource availability, and individual circumstances. For pregnant women, PrEP can also be considered, but guidelines might differ due to considerations about the safety of the medication during pregnancy."
