Changes must be made in the delivery of the core program.\n\nThis indicates that there is likely a systemic issue with how instruction is being delivered, which is affecting a broad range of students. Adjusting the core program can address underlying instructional methods, materials, or pacing that might not be effectively reaching students. This could include modifying teaching strategies, providing professional development for teachers, or revising curriculum content to better meet student needs.\n\nWhile options B, C, and D may also be appropriate actions depending on the specific circumstances, they are more targeted interventions that address individual or smaller groups of students rather than the whole population. Option A is the most suitable first step when the issue appears to be widespread."
