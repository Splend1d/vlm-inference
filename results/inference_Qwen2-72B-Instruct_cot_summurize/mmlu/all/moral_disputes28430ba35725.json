This is because the effects of climate change, such as rising sea levels, more frequent and severe weather events, and loss of biodiversity, will continue to worsen over time and will be felt most acutely by people who have not yet been born. This creates an intergenerational injustice, where the current generation benefits from the use of fossil fuels while future generations suffer the consequences.\n\nHowever, the issue is also compounded by the fact that the compounding effects of greenhouse gas emissions require the current generation to, in effect, cooperate with future generations (option C). This means that action needs to be taken now to reduce emissions and mitigate the worst impacts of climate change, even though the benefits may not be fully realized until many years or even decades into the future.\n\nAdditionally, there is a concern that countries may be biased toward the interests of the current generation, which largely benefits from carbon dioxide emissions (option D). This can make it difficult to achieve the level of cooperation and commitment needed to address the global challenge of climate change."
