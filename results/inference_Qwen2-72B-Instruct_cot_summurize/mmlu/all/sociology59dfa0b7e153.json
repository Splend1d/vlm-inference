Participant observation involves the researcher immersing themselves in a particular setting and observing the behavior and interactions of individuals within that setting, often while participating in the activities themselves. Field notes are typically recorded during this process to document observations and insights gained from the experience. This method allows the researcher to gain a deep understanding of the social dynamics and power relations within the institution being studied."
