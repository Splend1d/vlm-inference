In this scenario, the junior psychologist ran the experiment, helped analyze the data, and contributed to writing up the results. These actions constitute significant contributions to the research, and therefore, the junior psychologist should be listed as an author on the publication. The order of authorship (whether they are listed as the first author or not) would depend on the specific roles and contributions of each individual involved in the research."
