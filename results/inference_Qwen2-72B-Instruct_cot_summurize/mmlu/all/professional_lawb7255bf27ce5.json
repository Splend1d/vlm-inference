By the terms of the lease, the friend expressly covenanted to pay a monthly rental of $300 and to pay the taxes on the premises during the term of the lease. The lease also stipulated that the friend, as lessee, may not assign or sublease the said premises. The friend and his family lived in the house for two years. Then the friend assigned his leasehold interest in the property to a cousin, who was unaware of the prohibition against assignments. This written assignment expressly provided that the cousin would pay the owner the monthly rental of $300, but was silent concerning the payment of taxes. The owner never objected to this assignment. Six months after the assignment, the owner conveyed her property interest in the premises to a developer. During the cousin's tenancy, the State Highway Authority filed proceedings to condemn two acres of the tract for the purpose of highway construction. As a result, the cousin contacted the developer and informed him that he should be entitled to an apportioned reduction in the rental. After the developer refused to reduce the rent, the cousin brings an action to have his rent apportioned pro tanto. Judgment should be for\n\nA. the developer, although the cousin would be entitled to terminate the lease.\nB. the developer, because the cousin would be held to the original leasehold contract.\nC. the cousin, because the value of his leasehold interest was reduced pro tanto.\nD. the cousin, because eminent domain operates as an apportionment of rent.\n"

This is known as the doctrine of \"pro tanto\" reduction. Therefore, since two acres of the tract were condemned for highway construction, the cousin's leasehold interest was reduced, and he is entitled to an apportioned reduction in the rent. \n\nIt is worth noting that the prohibition against assignments in the lease does not affect the cousin's right to seek a reduction in rent due to the condemnation of part of the leased property. Additionally, the fact that the owner never objected to the assignment does not mean that the cousin is entitled to terminate the lease, as the lease still remains valid and enforceable between the cousin and the developer."
