She remembers injuring the knee while playing soccer last week, but she was able to finish the game. She has no history of rash or joint pain. Her sister has inflammatory bowel disease. The patient's temperature is 39\u00b0C (102.2\u00b0F), blood pressure is 110/80 mm Hg, pulse is 95/min, and respirations are 20/min. Examination of the right knee shows swelling, tenderness, warmth, and erythema; range of motion is limited. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?\n\nA. Nuclear scan of the right knee\nB. MRI of the right knee\nC. Antibiotic therapy\nD. Arthrocentesis\n"

This procedure involves removing fluid from the joint using a needle and syringe, which can help determine if there is an infection present. The patient's symptoms of fever, pain, swelling, warmth, and erythema of the knee, as well as her recent history of injury, suggest that she may have septic arthritis, which requires prompt diagnosis and treatment with antibiotics. An arthrocentesis can also help differentiate between septic arthritis and other conditions such as inflammatory arthritis or crystal-induced arthritis. A nuclear scan or MRI may be indicated after the diagnosis is confirmed, but they are not the initial step in management. Antibiotic therapy should not be started until a diagnosis is made, as it could potentially mask important diagnostic findings."
