The relationship between the correlation coefficient (r) and the proportion of variance explained (R^2, also known as the coefficient of determination) is given by R^2 = r^2.\n\nIf 15% of the variance is explained, then R^2 = 0.15. To find the correlation coefficient (r), we take the square root of R^2:\n\nr = sqrt(0.15)\n\nCalculating the square root of 0.15 gives us approximately 0.39.\n\nSo the correct answer is:\n\nC. 0.39\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the correlation coefficient can be positive or negative depending on the direction of the relationship. In this context, since more study time is likely associated with higher GPAs, the correlation should be positive, so the actual value of r would be +0.39."
