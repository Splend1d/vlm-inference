Shortly thereafter, the investor prepared a subdivision plan that created 90 one-acre residential building lots on this tract with the remaining 10-acre lot proposed for a public school building. In the investor's sales brochure promoting the subdivision, he stated that \"in addition to the close proximity of the proposed school for subdivision residents, the county school district would not need to expend tax money to acquire this property for school construction. \" In 2007, the subdivision plan was recorded with the county recorder's office. On January 15, 2009, the county school board voted to build a new school on the 10-acre tract. The investor's proposed designation of the 1 0-acre tract for construction of a school building would best be described as a (an)\n\nA. equitable servitude.\nB. restrictive covenant.\nC. unenforceable restriction.\nD. easement for public use.\n"

An easement for public use would allow the public or a public entity, such as the county school board, to use a portion of the land for a specific public purpose, in this case, the construction of a school. This type of easement can be created by express grant, as seems to be the case here, where the investor has designated the land for school use in his sales brochure and the subdivision plan. It does not appear to be an equitable servitude or a restrictive covenant, which typically run with the land and restrict how the land can be used, nor is it necessarily unenforceable since it was part of the recorded subdivision plan."
