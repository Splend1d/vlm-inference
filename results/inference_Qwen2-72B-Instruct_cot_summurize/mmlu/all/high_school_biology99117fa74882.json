                    "text": "The correct answer is:\n\nD. None of the individual insects should have possessed genomes that made them resistant to DDT.\n\nResistance to pesticides like DDT can develop when some individuals in a population have genetic variations that confer resistance to the pesticide. When the pesticide is used, it kills off the susceptible individuals but leaves the resistant ones alive. These resistant individuals then reproduce and pass on their resistance genes to their offspring, leading to an increase in the proportion of resistant individuals in the population over time. For pest eradication efforts to be successful in the long run, there should be no resistant individuals present to begin with or effective measures must be taken to prevent the development of resistance, such as using integrated pest management strategies that combine multiple control methods and rotate pesticides with different modes of action."
