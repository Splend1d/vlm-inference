Yes, but only if there is a single entrance to the school.\nC. Yes, because the 24 out of every 25 students who are not selected will form a control group.\nD.

No, because not every sample of the intended size has an equal chance of being selected.\n\nThis sampling method is known as systematic sampling, where every kth element from a list or ordered population is selected. In this case, every 25th student is chosen. While it might seem like a simple random sample at first glance, systematic sampling is not the same as simple random sampling.\n\nIn simple random sampling, each individual (or group) in the population has an equal and independent chance of being selected for the sample. This ensures that any subset of the population has an equal chance of being selected as any other subset of the same size. However, in systematic sampling, once the starting point is determined, the rest of the sample is automatically chosen based on the set interval (in this case, every 25th student). This means that some patterns within the population may not be adequately represented, especially if there's a periodicity or regular pattern in the characteristic being studied that aligns with the sampling interval.\n\nFor example, if students tend to arrive at school in groups or waves (e.g., due to bus schedules), then systematically selecting every 25th student might disproportionately represent certain groups over others, leading to biased results. Therefore, while systematic sampling can be efficient and easy to implement, it does not guarantee that every possible sample of a given size has an equal chance of being selected, which is a key requirement for simple random sampling."
