Attitudinal coherence refers to the consistency or alignment among different attitudes held by an individual. In this case, individuals may have held separate and seemingly contradictory attitudes towards Clinton's personal behavior and his policy decisions. Despite disapproving of his personal actions, some Americans were able to maintain a positive attitude toward his political performance, showing that their attitudes in one domain (personal life) did not necessarily influence their attitudes in another domain (policy decisions)."
