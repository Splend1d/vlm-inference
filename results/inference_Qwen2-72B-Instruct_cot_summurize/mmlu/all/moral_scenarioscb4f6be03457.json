It is not considered morally wrong to tell someone about an issue that they might want to correct.\n\nIn Scenario 2, running a comb through Martha's hair is not inherently morally wrong either. This action could be seen as helpful or caring, depending on the context and relationship between the individuals involved. If Martha consented to this action or it was part of a normal routine, there is no moral wrongdoing."
