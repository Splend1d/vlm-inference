Rigg, Steele, and Urco.\n\nFor corporations to qualify as an affiliated group and file a consolidated federal income tax return, certain ownership and control tests must be met according to IRS regulations. The primary requirement is that at least 80% of one corporation (the subsidiary) must be owned by another corporation (the parent) or a group of corporations in the chain.\n\nIn this case:\n\n- Rigg owns 85% of Steele, which satisfies the 80% ownership rule for Rigg to be considered the parent of Steele.\n- Steele owns 50% of Urco. However, since Rigg indirectly owns a portion of Urco through its ownership of Steele, we need to calculate the indirect ownership. Rigg's indirect ownership of Urco through Steele is 85% * 50% = 42.5%. When combined with Rigg's direct ownership of Urco (40%), Rigg has a total ownership of 82.5% (40% + 42.5%) in Urco, satisfying the 80% ownership rule for Rigg to be considered the parent of Urco.\n\nThus, Rigg, Steele, and Urco together form an affiliated group and may join in the filing of a consolidated federal income tax return."
