An appeal to tradition\n\nAutomatically rejecting a claim simply because it's traditional is an example of the appeal to tradition, a logical fallacy that assumes something is better or correct merely because it is older, traditional, or \"always has been done.\" This fallacy dismisses valid arguments or evidence without proper consideration based solely on the age or tradition of the claim.\n\nA. Not reasonable - This is also true, but B is more specific and identifies the type of fallacy being committed.\nC. An appeal to the masses - This refers to a different logical fallacy, where something is assumed to be true or better because many people believe it.\nD. Reasonable - This is incorrect as it contradicts the nature of critical thinking and evaluating claims based on evidence and logic rather than tradition."
