                    "text": "The reserve ratio is calculated by dividing the amount of reserves a bank holds by the total amount of its deposits.\n\nGiven that a bank has $1000 in checking deposits and it is required to reserve $250, we can calculate the reserve ratio as follows:\n\nReserve Ratio = Required Reserves / Total Deposits\nReserve Ratio = $250 / $1000\nReserve Ratio = 0.25 or 25%\n\nExcess reserves are the reserves held by a bank beyond the required reserves. If the bank is holding exactly $250 in reserves, which is the exact amount required, then it has no excess reserves. However, if we interpret the question as asking what would be the excess reserves if the bank had only the required reserves, then the calculation for excess reserves would be based on any amount above the required $250. Since the question doesn't specify how much more than $250 the bank has, we cannot determine a specific value for excess reserves from the information given. But based on the options provided, we will assume the bank holds only the required reserves, making the excess reserves $0 in this case (though not explicitly listed as an option).\n\nThe money multiplier is calculated using the formula:\n\nMoney Multiplier = 1 / Reserve Ratio\n\nUsing the reserve ratio we found:\n\nMoney Multiplier = 1 / 0.25\nMoney Multiplier = 4\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. 25% $750 M = 4\n\nHowever, there's a discrepancy in the answer regarding the excess reserves. The correct interpretation based on the given options would be that the bank has $750 in potential lending capacity (not necessarily excess reserves), and the money multiplier is 4. The excess reserves part of the answer choice is not accurate given the information provided in the question."
