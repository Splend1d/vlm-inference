Addison's disease leads to generalized pigmentation. \n\nAddison's disease, also known as primary adrenal insufficiency, is a disorder that occurs when the adrenal glands do not produce enough hormones, specifically cortisol and aldosterone. This can lead to a variety of symptoms including fatigue, weakness, weight loss, and darkening of the skin (hyperpigmentation) due to increased production of melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH). \n\nOptions A, C, and D are incorrect:\n\nA. Addison's disease is not due to a deficiency of prolactin hormone, which is produced by the pituitary gland and regulates lactation.\n\nC. Addison's disease does not cause hypertension; in fact, it often leads to low blood pressure (hypotension) due to aldosterone deficiency.\n\nD. Diabetes is not a complication of Addison's disease. However, people with Addison's disease may have an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes due to the use of high-dose corticosteroids for treatment."
