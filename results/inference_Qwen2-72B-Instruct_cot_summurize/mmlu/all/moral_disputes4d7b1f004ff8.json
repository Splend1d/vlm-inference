He argues that human beings have an intrinsic worth, which he calls \"dignity,\" that is not based on their utility or any qualities they may possess, but simply on their status as rational and autonomous beings capable of making moral decisions. This dignity, according to Kant, is what gives rise to our moral obligations to treat others as ends in themselves and not merely as means to our own ends."
