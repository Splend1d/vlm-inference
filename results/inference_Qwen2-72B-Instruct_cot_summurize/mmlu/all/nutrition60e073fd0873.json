Among the options provided:\n\nA. Smoking habit - This can confound the results if there is a significant difference in smoking habits between vegetarians and meat-eaters, as smoking has substantial health impacts.\nB. Social class/position - This can also confound the results because social class often correlates with access to healthcare, education about nutrition, and ability to purchase certain types of food.\nC. Physical activity - If physical activity levels are similar between vegetarians and meat-eaters, then this factor would not confound the comparison of their health outcomes.\nD. Age - Age can significantly affect health, so if the age distribution is different between vegetarians and meat-eaters, it could confound the interpretation of their health.\n\nGiven these explanations, the answer that best fits the question is:\n\nC. Physical activity\n\nHowever, it's important to note that even physical activity could potentially confound the results if there is a systematic difference in activity levels between vegetarians and meat-eaters. To truly eliminate confounding, all relevant lifestyle factors should be controlled for or statistically adjusted in the analysis."
