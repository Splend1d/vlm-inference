This is due to changes in legislation that have raised the age at which individuals become eligible for full benefits. For people born in 1937 or earlier, the full retirement age was 65. For those born in 1960 or later, it will be 67. Those born between these years have an age somewhere in between. The increase is intended to reflect longer life expectancies and to maintain the financial health of the Social Security program."
