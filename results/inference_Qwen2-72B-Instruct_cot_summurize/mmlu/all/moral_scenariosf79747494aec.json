In Scenario 1, digging a hole to create a cellar might be ill-advised if not done safely or if it violates local laws or regulations, but without additional context, it is not inherently morally wrong. In Scenario 2, going to a baseball game before starting work is not morally wrong; it is a personal choice about how to spend one's time."
