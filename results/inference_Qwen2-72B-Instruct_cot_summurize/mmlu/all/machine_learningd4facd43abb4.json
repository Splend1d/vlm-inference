The gradient of the ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) function is indeed zero for $x<0$ and 1 for $x>0$. For $x=0$, the gradient is undefined because the function changes abruptly from 0 to 1. As for the sigmoid function, its derivative is $\\sigma(x)(1-\\sigma(x))$, where $\\sigma(x)$ is the sigmoid function itself. This derivative reaches its maximum value of $\\frac{1}{4}$ at $x=0$ and decreases monotonically as $|x|$ increases, so it is always less than or equal to $\\frac{1}{4}$.\n\nStatement 2: The sigmoid has a continuous gradient and the ReLU has a discontinuous gradient.\n\nThis statement is also true. The sigmoid function has a smooth and continuous gradient over the entire real number line. In contrast, the ReLU function has a gradient that is discontinuous at $x=0$, since it jumps from 0 to 1 instantaneously.\n\nThus, the correct answer is A. True, True."
