However, the environments are very similar except that some ponds contain predatory fish, while others do not. In high predation ponds, selection has favored the evolution of a body shape that enables rapid bursts of speed. In low predation ponds, another body type is favored\u2014one that is well-suited to swim for long periods of time.\n\nA. Reproductive isolation caused geographic isolation.\nB.

Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Allopatric isolation brought about reproductive isolation. \n\nHowever, it's important to note that the question does not provide enough information to determine whether reproductive isolation is complete or not. It only describes the process of allopatric isolation leading to divergent evolutionary adaptations in the two populations of mosquito fish."
