                    "text": "The discovery and detailed characterization of new polyomaviruses often involves the use of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies, which can include both shotgun sequencing and deep pyrosequencing. These methods allow for the comprehensive analysis of viral genomes directly from clinical samples without the need for prior cultivation or specific antibodies.\n\nA. Shotgun sequencing: This method involves randomly breaking up the DNA into small fragments, which are then sequenced. The resulting sequences are assembled using computational algorithms to reconstruct the original genome.\n\nC. Deep pyrosequencing (NGS): This is a high-throughput sequencing method that can generate millions of sequence reads in a single run. It's particularly useful for detecting low-abundance viruses and for de novo assembly of viral genomes.\n\nB. Cultivation in human neural cells: While some viruses can be grown in cell culture, polyomaviruses typically do not grow well in standard cell cultures, including human neural cells. Therefore, this method is not commonly used for the discovery of new polyomaviruses.\n\nD. Monoclonal antibody techniques: These techniques are used for the detection and quantification of specific viral antigens but are not typically used for the initial discovery of new viruses. They require prior knowledge of the virus and the availability of specific antibodies, which are not available when a new virus is being discovered.\n\nIn summary, options A and C are the most relevant methods for detailing new polyomaviruses. NGS technologies, including shotgun and deep pyrosequencing, have revolutionized the field of virology by enabling the rapid identification and characterization of novel viruses."
