Sandel argues that there is a moral difference between treatment (which aims to restore or maintain normal function) and enhancement (which aims to improve upon normal function). Kamm critiques this view by arguing that the distinction is not always clear-cut and that the moral status of an intervention depends on its purpose and context rather than simply whether it is considered treatment or enhancement. Therefore, Kamm does not assume that nature in itself has no moral value (option A), that nature is sacred and should be honored (option B), or that human beings want enhancement more than they want treatment (option C)."
