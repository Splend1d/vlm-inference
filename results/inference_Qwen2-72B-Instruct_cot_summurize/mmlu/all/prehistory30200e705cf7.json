Warfare was an important aspect of Inca society and served multiple purposes, including territorial expansion, resource acquisition, and cultural integration. However, it also provided a platform for identifying capable individuals who could potentially rise through the ranks of the military and administrative hierarchy. Through warfare, the Incas were able to test the skills and loyalty of their subjects, and promote those who showed exceptional abilities in leadership, strategy, and bravery. This helped to maintain a strong and effective government, as well as fostered a culture of discipline and excellence among the Inca people. While the other options listed may have played some role in Inca warfare, they are not considered primary motivations for engaging in conflict."
