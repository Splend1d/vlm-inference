Objective personality inventories, such as the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) or the Hogan Personality Inventory, are standardized tests designed to measure various personality traits that are relevant to job performance.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the most valid predictor can vary depending on the specific job and the skills required. For instance, biographical inventories (Option D) can also have high predictive validity for certain jobs, as they ask candidates about past behaviors and experiences which can be indicative of future job performance.\n\nInterviews (Option C) can also be predictive if they are structured and focused on job-related competencies, but their predictive validity can be lower than that of objective personality inventories due to potential biases and inconsistencies.\n\nProjective techniques (Option A), such as the Rorschach inkblot test or the Thematic Apperception Test, are less likely to have high predictive validity in industrial settings because they rely heavily on subjective interpretation and are not as standardized as other methods.\n\nOverall, the best approach is often to use a combination of assessment methods tailored to the specific job requirements to maximize predictive validity."
