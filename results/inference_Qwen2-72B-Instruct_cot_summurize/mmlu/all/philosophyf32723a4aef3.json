In his work, Hare discusses various strategies for avoiding moral arguments, such as adopting a purely descriptive or emotivist approach to ethics, but he suggests that each strategy has its own costs or limitations. For instance, adopting a purely descriptive stance may allow one to avoid normative claims, but it also risks failing to engage with important ethical questions. Similarly, an emotivist approach may allow one to avoid making objective moral claims, but it also risks reducing moral discourse to mere expressions of preference. Thus, while these strategies may be effective in certain contexts, they all come with potential drawbacks or trade-offs."
