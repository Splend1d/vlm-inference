While he was handing his money to the store clerk at the cash register, a police officer entered the store. The taxi driver had received several traffic tickets from the police officer, and he felt that the police officer had been very rude to him. Seeking to gain some revenge, the taxi driver immediately began to taunt and berate the police officer, calling him a variety of profane and insulting names. The police officer was going through a series of personal difficulties and was feeling very emotionally fragile. As the taxi driver's insults rained down on him, the police officer suddenly snapped. He whipped out his gun and fired a shot at the taxi driver. The bullet missed the taxi driver but hit the store clerk, who was standing behind the taxi driver. The clerk survived the shooting but suffered a gunshot wound to his shoulder. In an action by the injured clerk against the taxi driver to recover for his personal injuries, plaintiff will most likely\n\nA. recover, because the taxi driver's conduct was the proximate cause of the clerk's injuries.\nB. recover, because it was foreseeable that the taxi driver's conduct would result in the clerk being shot.\nC. not recover, because the shooting was not a foreseeable consequence of the taxi driver's conduct.\nD. not recover, because the police officer intended to shoot the taxi driver, not the store clerk.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is C. not recover, because the shooting was not a foreseeable consequence of the taxi driver's conduct.\n\nIn order for the injured party (the store clerk) to recover damages from the taxi driver, the taxi driver's actions must have been the proximate cause of the injury. Proximate cause requires that the injury be a foreseeable result of the defendant's actions. In this case, while it might be foreseeable that the police officer could respond to the taunts with anger or even an arrest, it is not reasonably foreseeable that the police officer would react by pulling out his gun and shooting at someone inside a crowded store, especially given that police officers are trained to handle provocation without resorting to lethal force.\n\nMoreover, the fact that the police officer was experiencing personal difficulties and \"snapped\" does not make the shooting a foreseeable consequence of the taxi driver's taunting. The intervening act of the police officer's sudden and extreme reaction breaks the chain of causation between the taxi driver's taunts and the clerk's injury. Therefore, the injured clerk would most likely not be able to recover from the taxi driver based on the doctrine of proximate cause."
