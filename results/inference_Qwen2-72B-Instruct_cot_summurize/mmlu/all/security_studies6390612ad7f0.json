A condition where people exist independently of state support, where human life is self-sufficient in that individuals do not require the assistance of state apparatus in order to live securely.\n\nHuman security is a multidimensional concept that encompasses protection from chronic threats such as hunger, disease, and repression, and protection from sudden and hurtful disruptions in patterns of daily life\u2014whether in homes, in jobs, or in communities. It includes freedom from fear (e.g., protection from violence) and freedom from want (e.g., access to basic needs). Option D, however, implies a complete independence from state support, which may not be realistic or desirable for ensuring the well-being and security of all individuals, especially those who are vulnerable or marginalized. Human security often requires some level of state intervention and support to ensure that basic needs are met and rights are protected."
