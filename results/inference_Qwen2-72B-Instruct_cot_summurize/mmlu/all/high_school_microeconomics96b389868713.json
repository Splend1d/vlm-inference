Market failure\n\nIn the absence of intervention, the conditions you mentioned (imperfect competition, externalities, public goods, and imperfect information) can lead to market failure. This means that the allocation of goods and services by an unregulated market is not Pareto efficient, as there may be situations where one individual's situation could be improved without worsening another's. In other words, the market on its own may not reach the socially optimal outcome."
