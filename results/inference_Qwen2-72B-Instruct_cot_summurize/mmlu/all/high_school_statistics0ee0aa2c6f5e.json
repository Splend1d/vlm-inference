                    "text": "To determine which individual is more unusually tall within their respective sex, we need to compare how many standard deviations each person's height is from the mean height for their group.\n\nFor the man:\n- Mean height = 70 inches\n- Standard deviation = 4 inches\n- Height = 74 inches\n\nThe number of standard deviations above the mean that the man's height is can be calculated as follows:\n\\[ \\frac{74 - 70}{4} = 1 \\]\n\nSo, the man is 1 standard deviation above the mean height for men.\n\nFor the woman:\n- Mean height = 66 inches\n- Standard deviation = 3 inches\n- Height = 70 inches\n\nThe number of standard deviations above the mean that the woman's height is can be calculated as follows:\n\\[ \\frac{70 - 66}{3} = \\frac{4}{3} \\approx 1.33 \\]\n\nSo, the woman is approximately 1.33 standard deviations above the mean height for women.\n\nGiven this information, the woman is more unusually tall within her sex because her height is farther from the mean in terms of standard deviations than the man's height is from the mean for men.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. The woman, because her height is 1.33 standard deviations above the mean height of all women, whereas the man\u2019s height is only one standard deviation above the mean height of all men."
