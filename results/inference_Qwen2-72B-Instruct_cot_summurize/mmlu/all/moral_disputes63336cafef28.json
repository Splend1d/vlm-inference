She suggests that Kant's focus on the concept of humanity as the basis for his argument against sexual objectification may be too narrow and that there are other ethical considerations at play. Papadaki also argues that sexual objectification does not necessarily involve treating a person merely as a means to an end, which is a key aspect of Kant's definition of objectification. Therefore, option B is also correct. Option C is not accurate, as Papadaki does not argue that sexual objectification enhances humanity. Option D is incorrect, as Papadaki does not agree with Kant's view entirely."
