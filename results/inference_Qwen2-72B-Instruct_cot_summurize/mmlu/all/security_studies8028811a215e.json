The electro-magnetic pulse occurs when gamma radiation interacts with matter (the atmosphere), \"the Compton effect.\" EMP produces a high voltage charge, harmless to humans but destructive to electronic systems. EMP effects are maximized at high altitude. However thermal-light pulse can produce flash blindness, retinal burn, and fire whilst the airburst can cause severe skin burns.\nB. A nuclear detonation produces a shockwave resulting from a rise in atmospheric pressure and dynamic overpressure sufficient to destroy concrete structures. Blast effects were generally used by military planners to calculate casualty rates in a nuclear attack: It was estimated that 50 percent living in a five mile radius of a one-mgt airburst would be killed or wounded by blast effects.\nC. Nuclear reactions in the initial nuclear detonation or the fallout can cause radiation poisoning, as irradiated debris is picked up by the nuclear fireball and lofted into the atmosphere. A dirty bomb uses chemical high-explosive to disperse radioactive material, relying on radiation to produce a lethal effect. Panic set off by even a limited dispersion of radioactive material might be more costly in terms of the disruption it causes than actual casualties or damage to property produced by a dirty bomb detonation; some observers believe that the blast itself causes the greatest amount of damage.\nD. All of the above\n"

Electro-Magnetic Pulse (EMP): This is caused by gamma radiation interacting with the atmosphere, producing a high voltage charge that can damage electronic systems.\n\nB. Thermal Light Pulse and Blast Effects: These can result in flash blindness, retinal burn, severe skin burns, and destruction of concrete structures due to the shockwave and dynamic overpressure.\n\nC. Fallout and Radiation Poisoning: Fallout consists of irradiated debris that is picked up by the nuclear fireball and dispersed into the atmosphere. This can lead to radiation sickness and long-term health effects for those exposed.\n\nD. All of these effects contribute to the catastrophic consequences of a nuclear explosion, including immediate destruction, long-term environmental damage, and potential loss of life."
