CO\u2083\u00b2\u207b and NO\u2083\u207b** correctly identifies the molecules that exhibit sp\u00b2 hybridization around the central atom. \n\nHowever, since **NO\u2082\u207b** also exhibits sp\u00b2 hybridization, the most accurate choice considering all provided options would be:\n\n**D. CO\u2083\u00b2\u207b, NO\u2082\u207b, and NO\u2083\u207b** if such an option were available in the context of your question.
