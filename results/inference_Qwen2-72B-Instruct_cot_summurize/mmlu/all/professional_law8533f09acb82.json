Such actions are usually regulated by specific legislation passed by Congress or by the regulatory authority granted to agencies like the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA has the authority to approve drugs for safety and efficacy, and it can restrict or ban drugs based on scientific evidence. An executive order bypassing these established regulatory processes would likely be seen as unconstitutional."
