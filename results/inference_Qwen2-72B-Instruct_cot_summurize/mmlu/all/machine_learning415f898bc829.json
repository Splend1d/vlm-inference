Minimizes the within class variance for a given number of clusters.\n\nK-means is an iterative, unsupervised machine learning algorithm that aims to partition n observations into k clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean, serving as a prototype of the cluster. This results in minimizing the within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS) or equivalently, the within-class variance.\n\nRegarding the other options:\nA. There is no such requirement on the dimensions of the feature space. The dimension can be larger than the number of samples.\nB. When K=1, the objective function would not have any meaning because it will always group all data points into one cluster, making the within-class variance zero by definition, but this doesn't mean it has the smallest value in a meaningful sense.\nD. The convergence to the global optimum is not guaranteed even if the initial means are chosen as some of the samples themselves. K-means can get stuck in local minima depending on the initialization of the centroids."
