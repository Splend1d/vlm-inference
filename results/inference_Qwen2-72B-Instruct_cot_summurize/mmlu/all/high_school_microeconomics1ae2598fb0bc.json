Marginal utility, on the other hand, is the additional satisfaction gained by consuming one more unit of a good or service.\n\nAir is essential for life, so it provides enormous total utility because we need it constantly to survive. However, since air is abundant and we breathe it continuously without any additional effort or cost, the marginal utility of an additional breath of air is very low (basically zero). We don't gain much additional satisfaction from breathing one more breath of air because we're already breathing as much as we need to sustain ourselves.\n\nTherefore, among the options provided, air is most likely to provide both the largest total utility and the smallest marginal utility."
