According to this law, the illumination (I) at a point is inversely proportional to the square of the distance (d) from the source and directly proportional to the luminous intensity (L) of the source.\n\n\\[ I = \\frac{L}{d^2} \\]\n\nGiven that the illumination (I) at a point 5 meters below the lamp is 6 lux, we can use this equation to find the luminous intensity (L). Rearranging the equation to solve for L gives:\n\n\\[ L = I \\times d^2 \\]\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\n\\[ L = 6 \\times 5^2 \\]\n\n\\[ L = 6 \\times 25 \\]\n\n\\[ L = 150 \\]\n\nThus, the candle power (luminous intensity) of the lamp is 150 candelas.\n\nThe correct answer is C. 150."
