AP rises when MP is above it and falls when MP is below it.\n\nThis statement correctly describes the relationship between average product (AP) and marginal product (MP) of labor. When the marginal product is greater than the average product, the average product increases because adding another unit of labor increases output by more than the current average. Conversely, when the marginal product is less than the average product, the average product decreases because adding another unit of labor increases output by less than the current average. The two curves intersect at the maximum point of the average product curve, but this detail is not included in the given options. Option B is incorrect because MP intersects AP at the maximum of AP, not MP. Options C and D are incorrect as they do not accurately describe the relationship between AP and MP."
