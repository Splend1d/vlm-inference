She took it home with her, intending to return it the next day. The following morning, however, the defendant decided to keep the watch, and did so.

In this case, the defendant found the watch and, having recognized it as belonging to someone from her law firm, had a duty to return it. However, instead of returning it, she decided to keep it for herself, which is an act of embezzlement. Larceny involves taking property without any legal claim or right to it, but since the defendant initially intended to return the watch and only later decided to keep it, her actions more closely align with embezzlement."
