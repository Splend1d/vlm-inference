The criteria for gambling disorder include things like tolerance (needing to gamble with increasing amounts of money to achieve the desired excitement), preoccupation with gambling, repeated unsuccessful efforts to control or cut back on gambling, restlessness or irritability when attempting to cut down or stop gambling, and so on. Legal problems and lying to conceal the extent of involvement with gambling are also included in the diagnostic criteria."
