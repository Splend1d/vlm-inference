In addition, the employment contract provided that the employer would pay the employee an annual bonus \"to be determined by the employer within two weeks after the year's profits have been ascertained. \"At the end of the first year, the business showed a net profit of $50,000. Accordingly, the employer and the employee agreed that the employee should receive a bonus of $5,000. This amount was subsequently paid to the employee. At the end of the second year, the business realized a net profit of $10,000. Once the profit had been calculated, the employer telephoned the employee and offered him a second-year bonus of $1,000. The employee refused and demanded a bonus of $2,000. The employer refused the employee's demand and immediately terminated his employment. Following his dismissal, the employee brought suit for breach of contract against the employer. Which of the following is the most accurate statement?\n\nA. The employee has a cause of action against the employer to recover a bonus for the second year in an amount to be determined by the court.\nB. The employer is excused for his obligation to pay a bonus, because of the unforeseen downtum in business during the second year.\nC. The employee is not entitled to any recovery, because employment contracts are generally terminable at will.\nD. The employee is not entitled to a bonus, but the employee can sue for loss of wages.\n"

The employee has a cause of action against the employer to recover a bonus for the second year in an amount to be determined by the court.\n\nThe employee was hired under a written contract that specified he would receive an annual bonus determined by the employer within two weeks after the year's profits had been ascertained. The fact that the employer and employee agreed on a bonus amount for the first year does not set a precedent or guarantee the same amount for future years. However, it does show that the employer recognized the obligation to provide a bonus based on profits.\n\nIn the second year, the employer offered a bonus that the employee deemed insufficient. Since the contract did not specify a formula for calculating the bonus, a court may need to determine what constitutes a reasonable bonus given the circumstances, including the profit level and the previous year's bonus.\n\nThe termination of employment does not necessarily absolve the employer of the obligation to pay the bonus for the time worked during the second year, especially since the termination appears to have occurred over a disagreement about the bonus amount rather than for cause related to job performance.\n\nOptions B, C, and D are incorrect based on the information provided:\n\nB. The employer's obligation to pay a bonus is not excused by a downturn in business if the contract does not include such a clause.\nC. The employee's contract was for a fixed term (five years), which means it is not terminable at will unless the contract includes provisions allowing for early termination.\nD. The employee is seeking a bonus, not loss of wages, and the termination of employment does not directly relate to the bonus dispute unless the termination was in violation of the contract terms."
