If it's meant to imply taking your daughter for a drive with the sunroof open, that is also not morally wrong. However, if you meant to say you threw an object at your daughter, that would be wrong, but based on the given scenario, it does not seem to be the case. Therefore, both scenarios do not depict actions that are clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020."
