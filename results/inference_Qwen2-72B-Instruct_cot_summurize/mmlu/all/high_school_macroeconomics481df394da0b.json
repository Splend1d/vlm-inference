Tax reductions put more money into the hands of consumers and businesses, encouraging spending and investment. Open market purchases by the central bank increase the money supply, which can lead to lower interest rates and make borrowing cheaper, further stimulating the economy. These actions are designed to counteract the downturn and encourage expansion."
