In her work \"Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity\" (1990), and further elaborated in \"Body that Matters\" (1993), Butler argues that gender is not merely a reflection of one's biological sex but is rather a set of performative acts and behaviors that are culturally constructed. She posits that these performances of gender through bodily gestures, speech, and other actions over time come to be understood as natural or inherent, thus creating what we perceive as 'sex'. This theory is known as Gender Performativity.\n\nOptions A, B, and C do not accurately represent Butler's views:\nA. Sexual characteristics are not the sole determinants of gender according to Butler; gender is socially constructed.\nB. Butler challenges the idea of fixed, essential identities, arguing that identities such as heterosexuality and homosexuality are also constructed and performed.\nC. While true historically, this statement does not reflect Butler's main arguments about gender being a performance rather than a fixed identity based on a two-sex model."
