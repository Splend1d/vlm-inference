A smaller proportion of older women report dreams about sex.\n\nAge differences refer to changes that occur as individuals grow older, whereas cohort differences refer to differences between groups of people who were born in different time periods and have experienced different historical events and cultural norms. Option B is more likely to be a cohort difference because it could reflect changes in social attitudes towards sexuality and aging over time. For example, women from older cohorts may have been raised with more conservative views on sexuality and may be less likely to report having sexual dreams compared to women from younger cohorts who may have been exposed to more open discussions about sexuality throughout their lives. \n\nIn contrast, options A, C, and D are more likely to be age differences because they describe biological processes (menopause, balding, and cancer) that typically occur with aging."
