Cross-links formed by oxidation of -SH groups of cysteine to form disulphide bridges render the amino acid unavailable to digestion.\n\nExplanation:\nA. The sequence of amino acids in a protein is its primary structure, not its tertiary structure.\nB. This statement is correct. Disulfide bonds formed by the oxidation of cysteine residues can stabilize the protein's three-dimensional structure and make those amino acids less accessible to digestive enzymes.\nC. While cross-links between the \u03b5-amino group of lysine and the carboxyl group of glutamate (or aspartate) do occur and can affect the protein's structure, this doesn't necessarily mean that these amino acids become completely unavailable for digestion. Digestive enzymes can still cleave other parts of the protein.\nD. This statement is incorrect because different proteins have different secondary structures, which include alpha helices, beta sheets, and turns or loops, depending on their specific amino acid sequences and environmental conditions."
