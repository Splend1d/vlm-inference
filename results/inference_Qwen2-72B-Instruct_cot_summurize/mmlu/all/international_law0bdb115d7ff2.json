The Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, adopted by the World Conference on Human Rights in Vienna in 1993, affirmed that \"all human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent and interrelated\" (paragraph 5). This means that civil, cultural, economic, political, and social rights are all equally important and cannot be considered in isolation from one another. They must be promoted and protected as a whole. While the declaration did emphasize the importance of civil and political rights (option B), it did not state that third-generation rights (option A) were of primary importance or that social and economic rights (option D) were non-enforceable."
