At trial, the defendant called a witness who testified that he witnessed the altercation and that the victim was the aggressor. The witness further testified that he has known the defendant for 10 years and that the defendant is a peaceable man who was acting reasonably in self-defense. The prosecution then offered the testimony of the victim's brother-in-law, who proposed to testify that the victim was a peaceable and law-abiding person. Upon objection by the defendant's attorney, the brother-in-law's proposed testimony is\n\nA. admissible, for the purpose of rebutting the contention that the defendant was a peaceable person.\nB. admissible, for the purpose of repudiating the defendant's claim of self-defense.\nC. inadmissible, because the victim's character cannot be proved by the brother-in-law's testimony.\nD. inadmissible, because the defendant did not directly attack the victim's character.\n"

However, this does not open the door for the prosecution to introduce evidence of the victim's character through the brother-in-law's testimony. The prosecution must first show that the defendant had knowledge of the victim's character to make such evidence relevant. Since the defendant did not directly attack the victim's character, the brother-in-law's proposed testimony would not be admissible for the purpose of repudiating the defendant's claim of self-defense or rebutting the contention that the defendant was a peaceable person."
