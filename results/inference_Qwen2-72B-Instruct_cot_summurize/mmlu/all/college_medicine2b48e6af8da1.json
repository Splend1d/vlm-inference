One gram of palmitic acid\n\nFats, such as palmitic acid, release more energy upon oxidation than carbohydrates or proteins because they have a higher ratio of carbon and hydrogen to oxygen. This means that fats store more energy per gram than carbohydrates or proteins. Glucose is a carbohydrate, leucine is an amino acid (part of proteins), and alcohol (ethanol) has less energy content per gram compared to fats. Specifically, the energy yield from complete oxidation is approximately:\n\n- Glucose: 4 kcal/g\n- Palmitic acid (fat): 9 kcal/g\n- Leucine (protein): 4 kcal/g\n- Alcohol: 7 kcal/g"
