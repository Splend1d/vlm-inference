According to Socrates, even though societies or individuals may appear to differ about what is required for the good life, that in no way contradicts the fact that there are objective principles for thought and action that are required for the good life. This belief in objective moral truths is a central theme in Socratic philosophy, which holds that knowledge of the good is essential for living a virtuous life. Socrates believed that through questioning and critical examination, individuals could discover these objective principles and apply them to their own lives."
