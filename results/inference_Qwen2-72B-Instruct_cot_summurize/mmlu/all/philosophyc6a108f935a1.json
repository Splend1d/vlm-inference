Both A and B.\n\nParfit, in his work on ethics and personal identity, argues that an outcome can be worse for a particular person compared to an alternative (A), but he also acknowledges that an outcome can simply be worse than an alternative without necessarily harming any specific individual (B). This latter point is part of his discussion on impersonal harm, where the harm does not accrue to any identifiable person but is nonetheless a matter of ethical concern."
