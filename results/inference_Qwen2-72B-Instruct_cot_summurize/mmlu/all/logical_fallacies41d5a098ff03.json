Appeal to ignorance\n\nThe fallacy of evading the burden of proof is often referred to as an \"appeal to ignorance.\" This fallacy occurs when someone argues that a claim must be true because it hasn't been proven false, or vice versa. Essentially, they are shifting the burden of proof away from themselves and onto their opponent, which is a logical fallacy. The person making the claim bears the responsibility of providing evidence to support it."
