Separated law from religion, ethics, sociology and history\n\nKelsen's theory of law is often referred to as the \"pure theory of law\" because he sought to create a scientific approach to understanding law that was free from other disciplines such as morality, religion, politics, and sociology. He aimed to analyze law as a system of norms that could be understood independently of its content or the influences of other social factors. This approach emphasizes the structural and formal aspects of legal systems, treating them as self-contained orders of validity."
