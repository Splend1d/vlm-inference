(i), (ii), (iii), and (iv)\n\nHowever, it's important to note that while (iii) is true in the sense that the autocovariances are constant, they are actually zero for all lags except at lag zero, making (iv) the more precise statement for a white noise process. Therefore, if we're being very strict about the definitions, the most accurate choice would be:\n\nA. (ii) and (iv) only\n\nBut given the options and the common definition of a white noise process, D seems to be the intended answer as it includes all the typical characteristics."
