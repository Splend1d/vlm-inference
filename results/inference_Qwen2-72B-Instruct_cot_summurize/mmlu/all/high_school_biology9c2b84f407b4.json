This acidic environment is necessary for the proper functioning of the enzymes contained within the lysosome, which are specifically adapted to work at this lower pH. The proton pump responsible for this process is called a vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase), which uses energy from ATP hydrolysis to transport protons against their concentration gradient."
