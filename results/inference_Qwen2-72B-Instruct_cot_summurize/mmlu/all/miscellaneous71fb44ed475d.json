A major shift of African American voters from the Republican to the Democratic Party\n\nThis was indeed a significant factor in the electoral success of Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal coalition during the 1930s. The New Deal policies, which aimed at providing relief, recovery, and reform during the Great Depression, attracted many African American voters who had traditionally supported the Republican Party since the time of Abraham Lincoln. Roosevelt's New Deal coalition also included other groups such as labor unions, farmers, intellectuals, and white Southerners. However, the shift of African American voters was particularly notable as it marked a long-term realignment that has generally kept this demographic within the Democratic fold ever since."
