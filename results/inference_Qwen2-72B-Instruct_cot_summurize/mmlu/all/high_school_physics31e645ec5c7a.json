In this case, since the electric field only depends on the radial distance \\(r\\), we can integrate along a straight line from the origin to the point \\((3, 4)\\).\n\nFirst, let's find the radial distance \\(r\\) to the point \\((3, 4)\\). Using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\n\\[r = \\sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} = \\sqrt{9 + 16} = \\sqrt{25} = 5\\, \\text{m}\\]\n\nThe electric field is given as \\(E_r = -6r^2 + 4r + 3\\). To find the potential difference \\(\\Delta V\\), we need to calculate the integral of the electric field from \\(r=0\\) to \\(r=5\\):\n\n\\[\\Delta V = -\\int_{0}^{5} E_r\\, dr = -\\int_{0}^{5} (-6r^2 + 4r + 3)\\, dr\\]\n\nIntegrating each term separately:\n\n\\[\\Delta V = -\\left[-2r^3 + 2r^2 + 3r\\right]_0^5\\]\n\nPlugging in the limits:\n\n\\[\\Delta V = -\\left[-2(5)^3 + 2(5)^2 + 3(5) - 0\\right]\\]\n\n\\[\\Delta V = -\\left[-250 + 50 + 15\\right]\\]\n\n\\[\\Delta V = -\\left[-185\\right] = 185\\, \\text{V}\\]\n\nTherefore, the potential difference between the origin and the point \\((3, 4)\\) is \\(185\\, \\text{V}\\).\n\nThe correct answer is D. 185 V."
