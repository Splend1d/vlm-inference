                    "text": "A state has adopted a system of bifurcated trials in cases in which a defendant's insanity is in issue. According to the bifurcated trial system, whenever a defendant pleads not guilty to an offense by reason of insanity, two trials will be held. The first one will simply determine whether the defendant has committed the offense for which she is charged. This trial will not address the issue of insanity. In the event that it is found that the defendant has, in fact, committed the offense, then a second trial will be conducted to determine whether she should be exculpated for the criminal action by reason of insanity. A woman was arrested and charged with murder. She pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity. At her first trial, the state introduced evidence showing that the woman was having an affair with the victim. When the victim tried to break off their relationship, the woman shot and killed him during a lover's quarrel. The woman was then called to testify in her own behalf. She testified that she had been living with the victim for two years prior to the time of his death. During that period she had undergone psychiatric treatment and was diagnosed as being schizophrenic. She further testified that at the time the victim was killed, she was under the influence of narcotics. While she was hallucinating, she remembered perceiving the victim as a demon and shot at this satanic figure in order to free herself from his evil spell. She then testified that she didn't believe shooting the demon was morally wrong. The prosecuting attorney objected to the woman's testimony. Over such objections, the trial judge admitted the woman's testimony. Was the trial judge correct in admitting the woman's testimony?\n\nA. No, because proof of mental disease requires the use of expert testimony.\nB. No, because testimony relating to her belief that she didn't know what she was doing was wrong, is not relevant until the second trial.\nC. Yes, because her testimony is relevant to the mental state necessary for the commission of the crime.\nD. Yes, because her testimony is relevant to the issue of self-defense.\n"

Yes, because her testimony is relevant to the mental state necessary for the commitment of the crime.\n\nIn the context of a bifurcated trial system where insanity is a defense, the defendant's mental state at the time of the offense is crucial to determine whether they have indeed committed the act they are charged with. The woman's testimony about her mental condition (schizophrenia), the influence of narcotics, and her perception of the victim as a demon at the time of the killing are all pertinent to establishing her mental state during the commission of the crime. Her claim that she did not believe shooting the demon was morally wrong could also contribute to understanding her mental capacity and state of mind when the crime occurred. This information is directly related to the first phase of the trial, which aims to establish whether the defendant committed the offense, and thus, the trial judge was correct in admitting her testimony."
