Among the options you've provided, SEZs can be found in:\n\nC. China - China is well known for its SEZs, which were first established in the late 1970s as part of its \"Open Door Policy.\" Cities like Shenzhen, Zhuhai, and Xiamen were among the first SEZs.\n\nD. Vietnam - Vietnam also has several SEZs, which it uses to promote industrial development and attract foreign direct investment. These include zones such as the Saigon Hi-Tech Park and the Dinh Vu Industrial Zone.\n\nWhile Japan and South Korea have implemented various forms of economic zones, they are not typically referred to as SEZs in the traditional sense, as their regulatory environments may not differ as drastically from the rest of the country as those in China or Vietnam. However, both countries do have regions designated for specific economic activities and incentives. For instance, Japan has Special Economic Zones for Promoting Structural Reform, and South Korea has Free Economic Zones (FEZs)."
