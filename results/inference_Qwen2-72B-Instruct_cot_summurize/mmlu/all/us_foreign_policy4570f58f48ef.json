Prior to World War I, Europe was the center of global finance, but the war changed that dynamic. As European nations borrowed heavily to finance their war efforts, much of this borrowing was done from American banks and financiers. By the end of the war, the U.S. had become the world's largest creditor nation, and New York City supplanted London as the leading financial center.\n\nAdditionally, during the war, American industries ramped up production to meet the demands of the Allies, significantly boosting the U.S. economy. This industrial growth, coupled with the loans extended to European countries, solidified the shift in economic power from Europe to the United States."
