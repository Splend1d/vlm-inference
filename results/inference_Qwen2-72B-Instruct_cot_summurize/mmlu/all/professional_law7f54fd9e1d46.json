The chief purpose of the code is to limit traffic congestion and noise in the neighborhood. One provision in the code provides that a \"family\" means a number of individuals related to the nominal head of the household or to the latter's spouse living as a single housekeeping unit in a single dwelling unit, but is limited to the following:(a) husband or wife of the nominal head of the household;(b) married or unmarried children of the nominal head of the household or the latter's spouse, provided, however, that such married or unmarried children have no children of their own residing with them;(c) father or mother of the nominal head of the household or of the latter's spouse. A resident of the city lives in her home together with her son and his two children. She received a notice of violation from the city which stated that both grandchildren were illegal occupants of her home and that she must comply with the code. After she fails to remove her two grandchildren, the city brings criminal charges against the resident. In an action by the resident challenging the constitutionality of the code provision, the court will most likely declare the provision\n\nA. constitutional, on the grounds that the housing provision bears a rational relationship to permissible state objectives.\nB. constitutional, under the state police power.\nC. unconstitutional, as violative of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nD. unconstitutional, as having no substantial relation to the public health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the state.\n"

By limiting the ability of a grandparent to live with her grandchildren, even when they are part of the same housekeeping unit, the code may be seen as infringing upon fundamental rights without a sufficient justification. The stated purpose of the code\u2014to limit traffic congestion and noise\u2014may not be a sufficiently compelling interest to justify such an infringement on familial rights.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the actual decision would depend on the specific legal arguments presented in court and the interpretation of the relevant laws by the presiding judge. This answer represents a likely outcome based on the information given, but legal outcomes can be complex and nuanced."
