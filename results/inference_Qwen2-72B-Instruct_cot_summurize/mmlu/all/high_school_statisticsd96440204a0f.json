                    "text": "In regression analysis, the R-squared value (R\u00b2) represents the proportion of the variance for a dependent variable that's explained by an independent variable or variables in a regression model. When the R-squared value is high, such as 98.1%, it indicates that a large portion of the variance in the data is accounted for by the model, meaning that the model fits the data well.\n\nGiven that the R-squared value is 98.1%, we can conclude that:\n\nIII. About 98% of the variation in the response variable can be explained by the regression on the explanatory variable.\n\nHowever, the R-squared value alone does not tell us whether the relationship between the explanatory and response variables is positive or negative; it merely tells us how much of the variation is explained. To determine if the relationship is positive or negative, we would need to look at the sign of the coefficient for the explanatory variable in the regression equation.\n\nTherefore, neither statement I nor II can be definitively confirmed just from knowing the R-squared value. However, since the question asks which statements are true based on the given information, and without additional information about the sign of the coefficient, we cannot confirm either I or II.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\nC. I or II (but not both) and III\n\nThis choice acknowledges that without further information, we cannot determine whether the relationship is positive or negative, but we can confirm that a high percentage of the variation is explained by the model. However, the precise wording suggests that either I or II could be true, but not both simultaneously, which aligns with the nature of linear relationships. A relationship cannot be both strongly positive and strongly negative at the same time."
