OLS minimises the sum of the squares of the vertical distances from the points to the line.\n\nThis means that in a regression analysis, OLS estimates the coefficients of the model in such a way that the sum of the squared differences between the observed values and the predicted values (the residuals) is as small as possible. These differences are measured vertically, i.e., parallel to the y-axis, which represents the dependent variable."
