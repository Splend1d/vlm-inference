May increase carbohydrate malabsorption: Gluten itself doesn't directly increase carbohydrate malabsorption, but it can damage the lining of the small intestine in people with celiac disease or non-celiac gluten sensitivity, leading to malabsorption of various nutrients including carbohydrates.\n\nB. Is a constituent of avenin: This is incorrect. Avenin is a protein found in oats that is similar to gluten, but it is not gluten itself.\n\nC. Is the main protein in maize: This is incorrect. Gluten is primarily found in wheat, barley, and rye. The main proteins in maize (corn) are zeins.\n\nD. May be contra-indicated in UC: Gluten may exacerbate symptoms in some individuals with Ulcerative Colitis (UC), although there is no direct link between gluten and UC like there is with celiac disease. Some people with UC find that a gluten-free diet helps manage their symptoms.\n\nThe correct answer would be A, as gluten can lead to malabsorption issues in susceptible individuals by damaging the intestinal lining. However, none of the statements are entirely accurate or complete, so in a strict sense, none of them are completely correct. But if you have to choose one, A is the closest to being correct."
