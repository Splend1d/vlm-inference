Demand for the good produced by this labor is stronger.\n\nWhen demand for the goods or services produced by the labor force increases, it leads to an increase in the demand for labor. This increased demand for labor can push up wages as employers compete to hire more workers to meet the higher production needs. In a competitive labor market, if there's no immediate increase in the supply of labor to match the increased demand, the market wage will rise until a new equilibrium is reached where the quantity of labor supplied equals the quantity demanded at the higher wage rate."
