A process of securitization is when an issue not included in the political sphere becomes politicized and is managed within the political system. A securitized issue is part of public policy requiring governmental action; decision-making, resource allocation and even communal governance.\nB. A securitizing actor can argue for an issue to be securitised when it is outside of the political domain. An existential threat can be made a matter for state attention even when it is not included within public debate. Securitization refers to the recognition of the threat prior to its emergence in the political process.\nC. Securitization refers to the move of issues from a politicized state to a heightened state of politics beyond the normal political domain of decision-making activities. Once placed above the political sphere it cannot be returned to the public sphere, having been translated into a state interest above normal proceedings.\nD. An issue can be securitized, that is framed as a security question, when it is moved from the politicized to the securitized sphere. During the securitization process, the securitizing actor(s) use discourse to persuade an audience that the issue at hand is one of urgency and priority, and that it presents an existential threat to some referent object.\n"

This process is typically initiated by a securitizing actor who uses discourse to convince an audience of the urgency and importance of the issue. The goal is to prompt exceptional measures that go beyond normal political procedures to address the perceived threat. Once an issue is successfully securitized, it may lead to special policies, resource allocation, and governance mechanisms to manage the threat. However, it is important to note that the process of de-securitization, returning an issue to the normal political domain, is also possible if the threat is no longer deemed existential or if there is a shift in political priorities."
