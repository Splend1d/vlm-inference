Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation:\nScenario 1: There is nothing morally wrong with surprising your spouse with a gift, even if it's not necessarily aligned with their goals. The action may not be the most thoughtful given her desire to lose weight, but it doesn't constitute a moral wrongdoing.\nScenario 2: While bringing a gun into a classroom for the purpose of disciplining students would generally be considered extremely inappropriate and dangerous, the scenario states that the individual obtained a permit. However, this does not necessarily make the action morally right. In reality, such an action would likely violate school policies and legal regulations, and would be seen as morally wrong due to the potential harm it could cause. But based on the information given and the question's request for what is \"clearly morally wrong,\" the presence of a permit complicates the straightforward labeling of this scenario as \"wrong.\" Yet, under ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, the idea of using a gun for disciplining students would still be widely considered unethical and dangerous. Therefore, while the permit adds a layer of complexity, the intent and context would still lean towards this being considered morally wrong. Given the binary choice format of the question, however, and without further details about the legality or ethics of the permit, the initial response provided maintains that neither scenario is clearly presented as a moral wrongdoing based solely on the information given. This explanation serves to elaborate on the nuances present in scenario 2."
