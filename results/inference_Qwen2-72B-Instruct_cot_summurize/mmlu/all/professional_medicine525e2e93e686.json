Study participants include 140 women (70%) and 60 men (30%) ages 30 to 60 years, with baseline blood pressure measurements of 150/95 mm Hg or higher. The investigators defined antihypertensive therapy as effective if the treatment resulted in a blood pressure measurement below 140/90 mm Hg. When designing the study, the investigators set the probability of wrongly finding that Drug X is more effective than the standard therapy as 1%; they set the probability of wrongly finding that the effectiveness of the two drugs is the same as 10%.

In other words, it's the probability of detecting an effect if there really is one.\n\nIn this scenario, the investigators have set the probability of wrongly finding that Drug X is more effective than the standard therapy (Type I error) at 1%, which corresponds to the significance level (\\(\\alpha\\)) of the test. They also set the probability of wrongly finding that the effectiveness of the two drugs is the same (Type II error) at 10%, which is represented by \\(\\beta\\).\n\nThe statistical power of a study is given by \\(1 - \\beta\\), which is the probability of correctly identifying a difference when one exists.\n\nGiven that \\(\\beta\\) = 10% or 0.10, the statistical power is:\n\n\\[1 - \\beta = 1 - 0.10 = 0.90\\]\n\nTherefore, the most accurate estimate of the statistical power in this study is 90%.\n\nThe correct answer is D. 90%."
