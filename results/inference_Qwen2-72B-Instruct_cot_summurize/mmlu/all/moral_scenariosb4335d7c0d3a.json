This is a common practice and not generally considered morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, \"I boarded the submarine because I knew I could infect the crew,\" the individual is intentionally putting others at risk of harm or death by knowingly exposing them to an infection. This action is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, as it shows disregard for the health and well-being of others."
