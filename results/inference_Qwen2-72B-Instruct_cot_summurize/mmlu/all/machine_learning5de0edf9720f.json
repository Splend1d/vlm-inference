Can use a mix of different activation functions\n\nNeural networks can indeed utilize various types of activation functions depending on the requirements of the task or layer. Common activation functions include sigmoid, tanh (hyperbolic tangent), ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit), Leaky ReLU, and softmax, among others. Different layers within the same network might use different activation functions to better capture the complexity of the data.\n\nA. is incorrect because neural network training does not necessarily optimize a convex function; the loss surfaces of neural networks are typically non-convex.\nB. is incorrect because while stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is a popular method for training neural networks due to its efficiency, other optimization algorithms like Adam, RMSprop, and Adagrad can also be used."
