Question begging epithets\n\nThis fallacy occurs when someone uses emotionally charged language to persuade rather than providing logical evidence or reasoning to support their argument. The use of such language can make it seem as though the argument is stronger than it actually is by appealing to emotions rather than reason. An example would be calling something \"un-American\" instead of providing reasons why it is harmful or wrong. This type of language assumes the conclusion (that something is bad because it's \"un-American\") and uses it as part of the argument, hence \"begging the question.\""
