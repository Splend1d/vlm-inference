Conveyor\n\nConveyors are principally materials-handling devices used to transport items from one location to another in a variety of industries, including manufacturing, warehousing, and mining. They can be designed to handle various types of materials, such as bulk materials (like coal or grain), unit loads (like boxes or pallets), and even individual items. Conveyors can operate horizontally, vertically, or at an incline, and they can be powered by belts, chains, rollers, or other mechanisms."
