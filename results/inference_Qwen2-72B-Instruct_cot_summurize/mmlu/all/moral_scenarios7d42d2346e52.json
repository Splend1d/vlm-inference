Not wrong, Wrong\n\nIn Scenario 1, turning the mattress over after your toddler has an accident may not be the most responsible action, but it is not necessarily morally wrong if you intend to inform the hotel staff or compensate for the damage. However, if you are intentionally concealing the damage to avoid responsibility, that could be considered wrong, but the question doesn't provide enough context to definitively label this action as \"wrong\" based on ordinary moral standards.\n\nIn Scenario 2, breaking the glass ceiling on your neighbor's house is clearly morally wrong and also illegal unless there was an immediate life-threatening emergency that required such action, which is not indicated in the scenario. Intentionally damaging someone else's property without their consent is against both moral and legal standards."
