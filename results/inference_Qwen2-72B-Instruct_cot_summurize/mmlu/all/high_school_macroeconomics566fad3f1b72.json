Increases \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Increases \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Decreases\n\nAn increase in the federal deficit typically means that the government is borrowing more, which increases the demand for loanable funds. This increased demand can lead to higher real interest rates as lenders require greater compensation for the use of their money. Higher interest rates then tend to discourage investment spending, as the cost of financing projects through loans becomes more expensive."
