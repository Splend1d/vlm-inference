Changing from equal size treatment groups to very different size treatment groups does not necessarily increase the power of the test. The power of a t-test can be affected by the sample sizes, but it's not simply about whether they are equal or unequal. In some cases, unequal sample sizes can decrease power if the smaller group has less variability or fewer observations.\n\nB. Changing from a 5% significance level to a 1% significance level would actually decrease the power of the test. Power is the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when it is false. Reducing the significance level makes it harder to reject the null hypothesis, thus decreasing the power of the test.\n\nC. Taking more careful measurements to reduce variability in the response would indeed increase the power of the test. This is because reducing variability increases the sensitivity of the test to detect a true effect, assuming one exists.\n\nD. Increasing the sample size would not reduce the probability of a Type I error (rejecting a true null hypothesis). The probability of a Type I error is fixed at the chosen significance level (in this case, 5%). However, increasing the sample size would increase the power of the test, making it more likely to detect an effect if there is one."
