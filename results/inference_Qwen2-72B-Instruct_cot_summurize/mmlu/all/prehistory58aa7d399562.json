It was here that the Sumerians established the first cities around 4000 BCE, creating the foundations for urban life, writing systems, and complex social structures. While other regions such as Egypt, Crete, and Eastern China also developed significant ancient civilizations, they emerged later than the civilization in Mesopotamia."
