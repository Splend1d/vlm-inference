Planned reliance on the prescribed control.\n\nWhen an auditor finds that the sample rate of deviation plus the allowance for sampling risk exceeds the tolerable rate, it indicates that the control is not operating as effectively as expected. As a result, the auditor will likely reduce their planned reliance on this control and increase their reliance on other audit procedures, such as substantive tests, to gather sufficient appropriate audit evidence. This could also lead to an increase in the assessed level of control risk. However, among the given options, reducing the planned reliance on the prescribed control is the most direct response to the situation described."
