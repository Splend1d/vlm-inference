                    "text": "The correct answer is C. The Responsibility to Protect (R2P) is a principle that was endorsed by the United Nations in 2005, which holds that states have the responsibility to protect their populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing, and crimes against humanity. If a state is unable or unwilling to fulfill this responsibility, the international community has a responsibility to take collective action, through the UN Security Council, to protect those populations. This can include diplomatic, economic, and military measures.\n\nHumanitarian intervention, on the other hand, refers to the use of force by external actors to prevent or stop widespread suffering or loss of life in another state. It does not necessarily require a call for assistance by the state in distress, and it may not involve the UN Security Council or have the primary objective of averting a humanitarian crisis. Humanitarian intervention can be more arbitrary and controversial, as it often involves the violation of state sovereignty without clear legal justification.\n\nTherefore, while both R2P and humanitarian intervention aim to protect populations from harm, R2P is less arbitrary because it requires some UN Security Council input and its primary objective is to avert a humanitarian crisis."
