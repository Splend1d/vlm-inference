However, it's important to note that this does not necessarily mean he endorses the use of torture, but rather that if it is going to happen, it should be done within a legal framework. He has also discussed the \"ticking bomb\" scenario as a hypothetical case where some may argue that torture could be justified, but he does not necessarily argue that it is permissible. And he has also argued for B, that no democratic society should allow public officials to engage in illegal actions \"off the books.\" So technically, D would be the correct answer, but with the clarification that his primary argument is for C."
