We are interested in finding the number of distinct possible values for the expression $(x + y) + xy$.\n\nNotice that we can rewrite the expression as:\n\\[xy + x + y = (x+1)(y+1) - 1.\\]\n\nThis simplifies our problem into finding the number of distinct values of $(x+1)(y+1)$ and then subtracting one from each of those values.\n\nGiven that $x, y \\in \\{2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14\\}$, we have $x+1, y+1 \\in \\{3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15\\}$.\n\nNow, let's list out all possible products of $(x+1)(y+1)$ for $x+1, y+1 \\in \\{3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15\\}$:\n\n- For $x+1=3$:\n  - $3*3=9$\n  - $3*5=15$\n  - $3*7=21$\n  - $3*9=27$\n  - $3*11=33$\n  - $3*13=39$\n  - $3*15=45$\n\n- For $x+1=5$:\n  - $5*5=25$\n  - $5*7=35$\n  - $5*9=45$\n  - $5*11=55$\n  - $5*13=65$\n  - $5*15=75$\n\n- For $x+1=7$:\n  - $7*7=49$\n  - $7*9=63$\n  - $7*11=77$\n  - $7*13=91$\n  - $7*15=105$\n\n- For $x+1=9$:\n  - $9*9=81$\n  - $9*11=99$\n  - $9*13=117$\n  - $9*15=135$\n\n- For $x+1=11$:\n  - $11*11=121$\n  - $11*13=143$\n  - $11*15=165$\n\n- For $x+1=13$:\n  - $13*13=169$\n  - $13*15=195$\n\n- For $x+1=15$:\n  - $15*15=225$\n\nNow, we need to consider that we might have some repeated values due to the symmetry of multiplication ($a*b=b*a$), but since we're dealing with distinct pairs and considering that both $x$ and $y$ can be the same, we've listed all possibilities without repetition.\n\nThe distinct values we have found are: $9, 15, 21, 25, 27, 33, 35, 39, 45, 49, 55, 63, 65, 75, 77, 81, 91, 99, 105, 117, 121, 135, 143, 165, 169, 195, 225$.\n\nSubtracting one from each of these gives us $27$ distinct values. Therefore, the correct answer is **B. 27**."
