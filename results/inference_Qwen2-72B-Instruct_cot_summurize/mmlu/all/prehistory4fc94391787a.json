Erectus possessed a larger brain.\n\nHomo erectus had a larger brain than Homo habilis, with an average cranial capacity of around 900-1100 cubic centimeters compared to Homo habilis' average of about 600-750 cubic centimeters. This is one of the significant differences between the two species. Additionally, Homo erectus fossils have been found outside of Africa, in regions such as Asia and Europe, indicating a wider geographic range and longer survival as a species compared to Homo habilis."
