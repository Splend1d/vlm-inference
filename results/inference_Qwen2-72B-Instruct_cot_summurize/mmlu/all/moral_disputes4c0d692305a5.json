According to philosopher Michael Baxter, his \"very general way\" of stating what we should strive for environmentally assumes that we can measure in some way the incremental units of human satisfaction. This view is known as anthropocentrism, which places humans at the center of moral concern and values the environment primarily for its ability to contribute to human well-being. However, it's important to note that this view has been criticized by many environmental ethicists who argue that nonhuman animals and ecosystems have intrinsic value and deserve moral consideration independent of their utility to humans."
