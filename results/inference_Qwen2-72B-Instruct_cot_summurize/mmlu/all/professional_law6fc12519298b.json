After 10 years of marriage, the couple began experiencing marital difficulties. In 1992, they separated and the husband moved to another state where his family lived. The woman continued to reside in the dwelling. In 1994, the husband quitclaimed his interest in the home to his son, who promptly recorded his deed. In 1995, the couple divorced. In 1996, the woman changed the locks to the home, preventing the son from entering the property, and the woman refused the son's repeated demands to allow him access to the home and property. From 1995 to 2005, the woman paid all the taxes and insurance on the property. She also was responsible for making whatever repairs were necessary. The period of adverse possession in this jurisdiction is 10 years. In 2006, the woman filed suit to quiet title to the home claiming absolute fee simple ownership. The son has countersued asserting that he owns an undivided 50 percent interest in the property. If the court rules in favor of the woman, it will be because\n\nA. the son will be unjustly enriched, inasmuch as the woman has paid all the taxes, insurance, and made necessary repairs.\nB. the son acquired his interest in the property by quitclaim deed.\nC. the deed from the husband to the son was void for lack of consideration.\nD. the woman obtained the son's interest by adverse possession.\n"

                    "text": "If the court rules in favor of the woman, it will most likely be because D. the woman obtained the son's interest by adverse possession.\n\nAdverse possession requires several elements to be met: actual possession, open and notorious use, exclusive use, continuous use for the statutory period, and hostile use (without permission). Since the woman has been living in the house, paying taxes and insurance, and making repairs since at least 1996, she meets the requirements for adverse possession if the jurisdiction has a 10-year statutory period. By changing the locks and refusing the son's demands to enter the property, she has demonstrated exclusive control over the property.\n\nAdditionally, the fact that the woman and her husband held the property as tenants in common means that each owned an undivided interest in the property. When the husband quitclaimed his interest to his son, the son became a tenant in common with the woman. However, the son's interest could be extinguished through adverse possession if the woman meets all the requirements for the statutory period.\n\nThe other options do not provide a legal basis for the court to rule in favor of the woman:\n\nA. Unjust enrichment may be relevant to the court's decision but is not the primary reason for the court to rule in favor of the woman. Unjust enrichment might be considered if the court awards the woman compensation for expenses she incurred while maintaining the property, but it does not address the issue of title ownership.\n\nB. The fact that the son acquired his interest by quitclaim deed does not affect the validity of the woman's claim to the property through adverse possession.\n\nC. The validity of the deed from the husband to the son is not relevant to the woman's claim to the property through adverse possession. Even if the deed was invalid for lack of consideration, the son would still have a potential claim to the property as the husband's heir unless the woman can establish adverse possession."
