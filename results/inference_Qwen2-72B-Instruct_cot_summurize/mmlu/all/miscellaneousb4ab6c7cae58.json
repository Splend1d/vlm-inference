The opening theme song of \"All in the Family,\" titled \"Those Were the Days,\" includes the lyrics: \"Boy, the way Glen Miller played / Songs that made the Hit Parade / Guys like us, we had it made / Those were the days.\" Later in the song, it mentions: \"And where's that rainbow for all us who live in the shadow / Where's the blue sky? Where's the sunny side of the street? / Guess it's just a crazy notion / But I miss the way it used to be / When we trusted Nixon and the Dodgers were in Brooklyn / And there wasn't all this sex and violence on TV.\" So, while the song doesn't mention President Nixon by name in the part commonly used as the theme, it does reference him in the full version of the song."
