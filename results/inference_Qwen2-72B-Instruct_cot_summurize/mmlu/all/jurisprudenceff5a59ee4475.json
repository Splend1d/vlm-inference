Judges exercise strong discretion.\n\nDworkin argues against the idea that judges have wide discretion in deciding cases, particularly in \"hard cases,\" where the law seems indeterminate. He maintains that even in such cases, there is a single correct legal answer to be found through principled reasoning grounded in moral and political principles, not merely personal judgment or discretion. Thus, the notion of judges exercising strong discretion contradicts his view that legal decisions should be based on objective, discoverable legal principles."
