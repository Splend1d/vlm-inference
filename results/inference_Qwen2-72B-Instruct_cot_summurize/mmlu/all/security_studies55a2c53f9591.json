It involves removing the special rights and extraordinary measures that are typically associated with securitization, which can lead to the erosion of established civil liberties. By advocating for desecuritization, one can help prevent the erosion of civil liberties and promote a more balanced approach to addressing security threats. While B and C may also be valid reasons for desecuritization, they do not directly address the issue of civil liberties, which is a key concern in the context of securitization. D is actually a reason to advocate for securitization rather than desecuritization."
