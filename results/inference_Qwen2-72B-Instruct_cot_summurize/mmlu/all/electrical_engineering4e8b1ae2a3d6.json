The area A of the spherical surface is given by \\( A = 4\\pi r^2 \\), where r is the radius of the sphere. Given that r = 1 m, we have:\n\n\\[ A = 4\\pi (1)^2 = 4\\pi \\, \\text{m}^2 \\]\n\nGiven that the surface charge density \u03c3 = 20 C/m\u00b2, the total charge Q on the sphere is:\n\n\\[ Q = \\sigma A = 20 \\times 4\\pi = 80\\pi \\, \\text{C} \\]\n\nThus, the total outward electric displacement (or electric flux) through the surface of the enclosing cube is equal to the total charge enclosed by the cube, which is 80\u03c0 coulombs.\n\nSo the correct answer is B. 80\u03c0 coulombs."
