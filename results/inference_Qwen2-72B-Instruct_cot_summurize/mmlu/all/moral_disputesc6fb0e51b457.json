Therefore, the correct answer is D. A and B only. \n\nInterdivisional misogynist speech refers to instances where men speak about women in a derogatory or demeaning way to other men, often in an attempt to reinforce their own masculinity or social status. Intradivisional misogynist speech, on the other hand, occurs when women themselves participate in or perpetuate harmful stereotypes or beliefs about women, often due to internalized sexism or societal pressure to conform to gender norms. \n\nInterpersonal misogynist speech, while certainly a form of harmful language, is not one of the specific categories identified by Richardson-Self in her analysis of misogynist discourse."
