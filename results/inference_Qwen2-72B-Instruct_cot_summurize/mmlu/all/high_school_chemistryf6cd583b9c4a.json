However, among the options given, the one that comes closest to being correct for many but not all bases is:\n\nA. All bases donate OH- ions into solution.\n\nThis statement is generally true for many bases, especially in aqueous solutions where they can accept protons (H+) from water molecules and thus increase the concentration of hydroxide (OH-) ions. However, it's important to note that this does not apply to all bases under all circumstances. Some bases might not be in an environment where they can interact with water or might exist in a form that doesn't readily dissociate to release hydroxide ions.\n\nLet's briefly address why the other options are incorrect:\n\nB. Only strong bases create solutions in which OH- ions are present.\n- This is incorrect because both strong and weak bases can create solutions with OH- ions. The difference is in the extent of ionization; strong bases will fully ionize, whereas weak bases will only partially ionize.\n\nC. Only strong bases are good conductors when dissolved in solution.\n- Conductivity in a solution is related to the mobility and concentration of ions. Both strong and weak electrolytes can conduct electricity, although strong electrolytes (like strong acids and strong bases) tend to conduct better due to their higher concentration of ions.\n\nD. For weak bases, the concentration of the OH-ions exceeds the concentration of the base in the solution.\n- This is generally false. For weak bases, the concentration of undissociated base is typically greater than the concentration of OH- ions since weak bases only partially dissociate in solution."
