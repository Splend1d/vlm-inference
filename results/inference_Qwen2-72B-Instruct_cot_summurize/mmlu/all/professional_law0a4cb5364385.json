The offeree sent a notification to the offeror stating, \"We have received your offer to sell landscaping stone per specified terms this date.\" The offeror shipped the goods upon receiving that notification. On the date of shipment, the offeree posted an acceptance form with slight modifications to the terms. After the goods arrived, the offeree called the offeror's manager and told him that the company was unable to accept the offer at this time, he was shipping the goods back, and to \"ignore any paperwork we sent.\" The offeror sued the offeree for breach of contract. Who will prevail?\n\nA. The offeror will prevail because the posting of the acceptance finalized a contract between the parties.\nB. The offeree will prevail because it never accepted the offer on the same terms specified.\nC. The offeror will prevail because it shipped the goods when it received the first acceptance.\nD.

The offeror will prevail because the posting of the acceptance finalized a contract between the parties.\n\nThis could be a valid argument if the posting of the acceptance form (even with slight modifications) is considered a counter-offer that was then accepted by the offeror through shipping the goods. However, the modifications in the acceptance could mean that no binding contract was formed since the terms were not agreed upon by both parties.\n\nB. The offeree will prevail because it never accepted the offer on the same terms specified.\n\nThis could also be correct, as the offeree's acceptance contained modifications, which legally constitutes a counter-offer rather than an acceptance. Since the original offer was not accepted without modification, there may not have been a binding contract.\n\nC. The offeror will prevail because it shipped the goods when it received the first acceptance.\n\nThis argument assumes that the initial notification from the offeree (\"We have received your offer to sell landscaping stone per specified terms this date.\") constituted an acceptance. However, this statement does not necessarily indicate an intent to be bound by the offer; it merely acknowledges receipt of the offer. Thus, the offeror's action of shipping the goods might not have been enough to create a binding contract.\n\nD. The offeree will prevail because it rejected the offer when it called the offeror's manager.\n\nThis could be true if the rejection came before any acceptance was effectively communicated to the offeror. However, if the offeree's call to reject the offer came after the offeror had already shipped the goods in response to what they believed was an acceptance, the timing of the rejection becomes critical. If the rejection occurred after the goods were shipped, and assuming the shipping of goods was a proper acceptance, the offeree's rejection would be ineffective.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most likely answer is B. The offeree will prevail because it never accepted the offer on the same terms specified. This is because the offeree's acceptance included modifications, which legally makes it a counter-offer, and there is no evidence that the offeror accepted this counter-offer. Therefore, no binding contract was formed under the original offer's terms."
