In the context of learned helplessness, an individual learns to associate certain stimuli with negative outcomes and comes to believe that they have no control over these outcomes, even when they do. This can result from repeated exposure to uncontrollable events or situations where the individual has no way to escape or avoid negative consequences. Over time, this conditioning can lead to a passive response in new situations where the individual might actually be able to influence outcomes."
