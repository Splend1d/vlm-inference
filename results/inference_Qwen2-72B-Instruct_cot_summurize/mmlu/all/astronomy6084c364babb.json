Because it\u2019s in the southern hemisphere where it is winter now.\n\nSpirit, like all rovers on Mars, needs sunlight to power its solar panels. During the Martian winter, the Sun spends more time near the horizon in the northern sky, so tilting the rover's solar panels toward the north maximizes the amount of sunlight they receive. This helps keep the rover's batteries charged and allows it to survive the long, cold Martian nights. However, it's important to note that Spirit became stuck in soft soil in 2009 and was declared non-operational in 2011, so it is no longer actively exploring Mars."
