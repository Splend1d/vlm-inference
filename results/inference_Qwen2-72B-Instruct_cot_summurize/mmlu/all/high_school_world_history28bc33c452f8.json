When the gods performed a sacrifice with the offering Purusa, spring was its clarified butter, summer the kindling, autumn the oblation.\nIt was Purusa, born in the beginning, which they sprinkled on the sacred grass as a sacrifice. It made the beasts of the air, the forest and the village. From that sacrifice completely offered, the mantras [Rig Veda] and the songs [Samaveda] were born. The sacrificial formulae [Yajurveda] were born from it. From it the horses were born and all that have cutting teeth in both jaws. The cows were born from it, also. From it were born goats and sheep.\nWhen they divided Purusa, how many ways did they apportion him? What was his mouth? What were his arms? What were his thighs, his feet declared to be? His mouth was the Brahman, his arms were the Rajanaya [Ksatriya], his thighs the Vaisya; from his feet the Sudra was born. Thus, they fashioned the worlds. The gods sacrificed with the sacrifice to the sacrifice. These were the first rites.\n\u2014Hymns excerpted and adapted from the Rig Veda, oldest surviving literary work, India, 1500\u20131000 BCE\nWhich of the following would best contradict the argument that the caste system imposed rigid economic and social roles on Indian society in the period 600 BCE to 600 CE?\n\nA. For there is nothing better for a Kshatriya than a righteous battle.\nB. The four divisions of human society are created by me [Krishna].\nC. The person traditionally credited with composing the Mahabarata was born to a fisherwoman.\nD. The Hindu God Shiva is considered to be simultaneously the creator, the preserver, and the destroyer.\n"

                    "text": "The answer is C. The statement \"The person traditionally credited with composing the Mahabharata was born to a fisherwoman\" would best contradict the argument that the caste system imposed rigid economic and social roles on Indian society during the period 600 BCE to 600 CE. This is because it provides an example of someone who, despite being born into a lower caste or outside the traditional caste system (as a fisherwoman would likely be), still achieved a significant accomplishment, such as authoring one of the most important epic poems in Indian literature. This suggests that there was some degree of social mobility within the caste system during this time period.\n\nThe other statements do not contradict the idea of a rigid caste system:\n\nA. \"For there is nothing better for a Kshatriya than a righteous battle.\" This statement reinforces the idea that the Kshatriyas, as warriors, had a specific role in society.\n\nB. \"The four divisions of human society are created by me [Krishna].\" This statement supports the idea that the caste system was divinely ordained, which would reinforce its rigidity.\n\nD. \"The Hindu God Shiva is considered to be simultaneously the creator, the preserver, and the destroyer.\" This statement is about the nature of the god Shiva and does not relate to the caste system or social roles."
