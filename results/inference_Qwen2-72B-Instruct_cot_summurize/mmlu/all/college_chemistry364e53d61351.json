This implies that if we have two molecules with molecular masses Mr1 and Mr2, their volumes V1 and V2 will be proportional in the same way as their masses:\n\n\\[ \\frac{V_1}{V_2} = \\frac{Mr_1}{Mr_2} \\]\n\nFor a spherical object, the volume is given by:\n\n\\[ V = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3 \\]\n\nTherefore, the radius of a sphere is proportional to the cube root of its volume:\n\n\\[ r \\propto V^{1/3} \\]\n\nGiven that the rotational correlation time \u03c4c is proportional to r^3 (as per the Stokes equation), we can conclude that \u03c4c is also proportional to the volume (or molecular mass) of the object:\n\n\\[ \\tau_c \\propto V = Mr \\]\n\nThus, if we have two objects with molecular masses Mr1 and Mr2, their rotational correlation times \u03c4c1 and \u03c4c2 will be proportional to their molecular masses:\n\n\\[ \\frac{\\tau_{c1}}{\\tau_{c2}} = \\frac{Mr_1}{Mr_2} \\]\n\nWe're given \u03c4c1 = 50 ps for Mr1 = 100 and asked to find \u03c4c2 for Mr2 = 8400. Plugging these values into our proportionality equation:\n\n\\[ \\frac{50\\,ps}{\\tau_{c2}} = \\frac{100}{8400} \\]\n\n\\[ \\tau_{c2} = \\frac{50\\,ps \\times 8400}{100} = 4200\\,ps = 4.2\\,ns \\]\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. 4.2 ns."
