The stoma (the opening for the ileostomy) should ideally be slightly raised above the skin level to ensure that the appliance fits properly and prevents leakage. However, \"flush with the skin\" can also be acceptable, depending on the individual's anatomy and the specific appliance being used. It is important to note that the size of the stoma is not measured in length but rather in diameter, typically ranging from about 1 to 2.5 cm."
