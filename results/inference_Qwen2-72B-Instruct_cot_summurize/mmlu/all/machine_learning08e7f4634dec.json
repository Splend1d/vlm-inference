Unlike a probability mass function for discrete random variables, which does indeed have values between 0 and 1, the probability density function can take on values greater than 1. What's important about a probability density function is that it integrates to 1 over the entire space, not that each value is between 0 and 1. Therefore, statement 1 is false.\n\nFor statement 2, this statement is also incorrect. Decision trees are typically learned by maximizing information gain, not minimizing it. Information gain measures how much uncertainty (entropy) is reduced when a dataset is split on an attribute. The goal is to find splits that maximize this reduction in entropy, so decision trees aim to maximize information gain at each step as they grow. Therefore, statement 2 is false.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\nB. False, False"
