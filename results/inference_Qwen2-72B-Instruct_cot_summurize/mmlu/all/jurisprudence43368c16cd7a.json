However, the most direct reason from the options provided is:\n\nC. The majority held that the abortion law of Texas was unconstitutional because it violated a woman's right to privacy.\n\nThis decision established the constitutional right to have an abortion and overturned many state laws that restricted or prohibited abortions, leading to significant controversy and debate over reproductive rights, states' rights, and the role of the judiciary in interpreting the Constitution. While the other options may be relevant to some extent, option C directly addresses the central issue of the case and the basis for the Court's ruling."
