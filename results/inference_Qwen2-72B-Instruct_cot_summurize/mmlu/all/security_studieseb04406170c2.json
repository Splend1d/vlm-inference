The inability to use and develop traditional language signifies the destruction of a society.\nB. Threats to societal security exist when a society regards its collective identity as being under question. Such circumstances include the suppression of expression and interference with a society's ability to reproduce itself across generations.\nC. Military threats to societies in the form of external aggression, mainly through de-population policies with the intent of preventing collective identities from being reproduced over generations.\nD. Migratory influxes into a host receiving state results in a shift in the composition of the population resulting in horizontal competition or vertical competition. This is not an outright threat to survival but part of wider uncontrollable processes of evolutionary identity.\n"

Societies are indeed threatened when their linguistic heritage and traditions are under attack. Language is often central to a society's identity, and when it is lost, so too can be cultural practices, knowledge, and history. This can lead to a loss of cultural cohesion and identity.\n\nB. Threats to societal security do indeed exist when a society perceives its collective identity as being under question. This can happen through the suppression of expression, interference with reproduction across generations, or the imposition of another culture. When a society feels its identity is being eroded, it can lead to social unrest, conflict, and potentially violence.\n\nC. Military threats to societies in the form of external aggression can indeed pose a significant threat to a society's survival. De-population policies, such as those used in genocide or ethnic cleansing, can prevent collective identities from being reproduced over generations, leading to the eventual disappearance of that society.\n\nD. Migratory influxes into a host receiving state can indeed result in shifts in the composition of the population, leading to horizontal competition for resources and vertical competition for power and status. While this may not be an outright threat to survival, it can lead to social tensions and conflicts, particularly if the host society feels its identity is being threatened by the influx of newcomers.\n\nOverall, these are all valid ways in which a society can be threatened, and they highlight the complex interplay between identity, culture, politics, and power that shapes the dynamics of societies over time."
