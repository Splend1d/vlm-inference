However, IQ scores can vary somewhat from one testing to another due to factors such as test anxiety, health on the day of testing, or even changes in the child's knowledge and skills since the last test. It's also possible that the child might have improved in some areas while not improving or declining in others, which could result in the same overall IQ score but with different subtest scores.\n\nIt's important to note that IQ tests are designed to measure a wide range of cognitive abilities, and different forms of the same test may emphasize different aspects of those abilities. Therefore, it's quite possible for someone to achieve the same overall IQ score on two different forms of the test but with different patterns of strengths and weaknesses across the subtests.\n\nHowever, without knowing the specific details of how the child's abilities have changed over time or the nature of the alternate form of the test, we cannot definitively predict whether the score will be exactly 130 again or if it will be higher or lower. The most likely scenario, given what we know, is that the child will receive a similar overall score but potentially with different subtest profiles."
