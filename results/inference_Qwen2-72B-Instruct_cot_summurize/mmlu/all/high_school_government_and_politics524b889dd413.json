This is because the United States has a two-party system, where the Democratic and Republican parties dominate politics and tend to represent a broader range of views within their respective parties. In contrast, multiparty systems like those in England and Israel can result in smaller parties that focus on narrower issues or ideologies, making it more difficult for any one party to fully represent the goals of an entire constituency. However, it's important to note that this is a generalization and there can be significant variation within each country's political system."
