In the relaxed position tropomyosin impedes myosin's access to the binding site of actin.\n\nExplanation:\nA. During contraction, H zones actually become shorter because the thick filaments overlap more with the thin filaments.\nB. This statement is correct. Tropomyosin, when in its resting position, blocks the binding sites on actin for myosin heads. Calcium ions must bind to troponin to cause a conformational change in tropomyosin, exposing the binding sites.\nC. Each myosin molecule has two globular heads that contain the actin-binding site and the ATP-hydrolyzing site, not the helical tail.\nD. Troponin and tropomyosin are regulatory proteins that sit on the thin filament (actin). The thick filaments are made up of myosin, and the thin filaments are primarily composed of actin."
