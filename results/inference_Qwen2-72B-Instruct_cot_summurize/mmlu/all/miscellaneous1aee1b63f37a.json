It is often used for sculpture, pottery, and architectural elements. The name terra-cotta comes from the Italian words \"terra\" meaning earth and \"cotta\" meaning cooked or baked. This refers to the process of firing clay in a kiln to create a hard, durable material. Terra-cotta typically has a reddish-brown color due to the iron content in the clay, but it can vary depending on the specific type of clay used and the firing process."
