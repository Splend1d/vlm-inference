Maintain redundant systems for instant availability to assure the flow of transactions\n\nIn an e-commerce environment where the IT system must be available continuously, maintaining redundant systems becomes crucial to ensure that there is no interruption in service. This is more critical than in a traditional organization where downtime might not have as immediate or severe an impact on operations. Redundant systems allow for failover capabilities, ensuring that if one part of the system fails, another can take over seamlessly, thus maintaining the availability and integrity of the e-commerce platform."
