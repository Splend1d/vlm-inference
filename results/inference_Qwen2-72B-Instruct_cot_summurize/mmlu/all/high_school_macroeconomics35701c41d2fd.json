I and II\n\nFiscal policy may not always be effective due to \"crowding out\" (I), which occurs when increased government spending or borrowing leads to higher interest rates, thereby reducing private investment. Additionally, \"rational expectations\" (II) can undermine fiscal policy if individuals anticipate the effects of policy changes and adjust their behavior accordingly, potentially offsetting the intended impact of the policy. The balanced budget amendment (III) could also limit the effectiveness of fiscal policy by restricting the government's ability to run deficits during economic downturns, but it is not necessarily a reason why fiscal policy is not always effective in the context of economic theory as rational expectations and crowding out."
