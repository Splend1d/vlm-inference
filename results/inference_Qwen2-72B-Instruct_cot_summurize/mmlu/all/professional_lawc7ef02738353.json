Twelve years ago, the men replaced the shack with a fish processing plant and a commercial fishing boat dock. The men maintained their commercial fishery operation on the land until one of them died intestate last year, leaving a sole heir. The period of time to acquire title by adverse possession in the jurisdiction is 10 years. The woman has now become aware of the changes that have occurred on the land. In an action to determine title, for whom should the court decide?\n\nA. For the man who is still alive and the deceased man's heir, because the men acquired title as tenants in common.\nB. For the man who is still alive, because he is the surviving adverse possessor.\nC. For the woman, because the use was changed by the men while they were in possession.\nD. For the woman, because title cannot be claimed by two adverse possessors simultaneously.\n"

For the man who is still alive and the deceased man's heir, because the men acquired title as tenants in common.\n\nThe men occupied the property continuously for more than the required 10-year period to claim adverse possession. When the first man died intestate (without a will), his interest in the property would pass to his heir. The living man and the heir would then hold the title as tenants in common since there is no indication that any other form of co-tenancy was established. The fact that the use of the land was changed from a fishing shack to a fish processing plant and dock does not affect their ability to claim adverse possession, as long as the occupation was open, notorious, exclusive, and continuous for the statutory period. The woman's lack of knowledge about the changes does not grant her any additional rights or protections against the adverse possession claim."
