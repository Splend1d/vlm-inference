The trial court denied the defendant's request and instead instructed the jury that the defendant had the burden of proof to establish the defense of duress by a preponderance of the evidence. After she was convicted by the jury, the defendant claims on appeal that the jury instructions regarding duress violated the due process clause. Were the jury instructions correct?\n\nA. No, because the prosecution bears the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt on all elements and defenses produced at trial by a defendant.\nB. No, because the jury instruction impermissibly shifts the burden of proof to the defendant.\nC. No, because the defense of duress is no longer a recognized defense in federal prosecutions, although it was recognized at common law, and is recognized in most state courts.\nD. Yes, because the defense has the burden of proving the defense of duress by a preponderance of the evidence.\n"

Yes, because the defense has the burden of proving the defense of duress by a preponderance of the evidence.\n\nIn criminal cases, while the prosecution bears the burden of proving the defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, affirmative defenses such as duress are typically treated differently. The defendant usually bears the burden of proving an affirmative defense by a preponderance of the evidence, which means that it is more likely than not that the defense is true. This standard is lower than the \"beyond a reasonable doubt\" standard required for the prosecution to prove guilt. Therefore, the jury instructions given by the trial court were correct under this legal framework."
