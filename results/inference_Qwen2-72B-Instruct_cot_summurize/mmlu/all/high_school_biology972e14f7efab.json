This means that it has a much slower rate of repair and regeneration compared to bone tissue. Cartilage is also softer and more flexible than bone, which makes it suitable for areas where cushioning and smooth movement are required, such as joints and the ends of bones. Both cartilage and bone are part of the skeletal system, both are composed of collagen and mineral salts, and both secrete a matrix, so options A, B, and D do not accurately describe the major difference between the two tissues."
