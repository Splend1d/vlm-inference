However, it's important to note that in this context, the punishment (yelling) seems to be having a paradoxical effect of increasing the undesired behavior (sloppiness), rather than decreasing it. This could mean that the punishment is not effective or that there might be other reinforcing factors at play that are overriding the punishing effects of the yelling."
