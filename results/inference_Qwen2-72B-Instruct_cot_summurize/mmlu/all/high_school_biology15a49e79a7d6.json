Repolarization occurs during an action potential when the membrane potential returns to its resting state after depolarization. However, it's important to note that +50 millivolts is not a typical value for a neuron's membrane potential, neither at rest nor during an action potential. The peak of an action potential is usually around +30 to +40 millivolts. Nonetheless, based on the direction of the change, the answer would be repolarization."
