However, it should be noted that the \"most central and protected\" part can be subjective and dependent on how one defines these terms. The medulla oblongata is located at the base of the brain, continuous with the spinal cord, and is responsible for controlling many vital functions such as breathing, heart rate, and blood pressure. It is protected by the brainstem, which includes the midbrain and pons, as well as the skull. Nonetheless, some might argue that other structures, such as the hypothalamus or the thalamus, could also be considered very central and protected given their location deep within the brain and their role in critical functions. But if we consider \"most central and protected\" to mean the structure that is both deeply situated and crucial for survival, the medulla would fit this description well."
