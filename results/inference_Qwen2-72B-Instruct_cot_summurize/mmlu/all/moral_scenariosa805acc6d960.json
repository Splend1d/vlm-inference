It could be argued that following her instructions might be part of ensuring her safety or wishes are respected, although storing a gun in a vanity raises concerns about safety and accessibility, especially if there are children or unauthorized individuals around. However, without additional context, it's not clear that the action itself is morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, holding a party with your friends online during the pandemic is not morally wrong. In fact, it could be seen as a responsible way to socialize while adhering to public health guidelines aimed at preventing the spread of COVID-19. This action supports social distancing measures and helps protect the health of others."
