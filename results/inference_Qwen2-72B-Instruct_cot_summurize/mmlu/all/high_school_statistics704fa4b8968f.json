The z-score for the 10th percentile is approximately -1.28 and for the 90th percentile is approximately +1.28 (these are approximate values).\n\nUsing the formula for converting between z-scores and raw scores in a normal distribution:\n\\[X = \\mu + Z\\sigma\\]\n\nFor the lower bound (10th percentile):\n\\[X_{10} = \\mu + (-1.28)\\sigma = 167 + (-1.28)(76) = 167 - 97.28 \\approx 69.72\\]\n\nRounding to the nearest minute gives us 70 minutes.\n\nFor the upper bound (90th percentile):\n\\[X_{90} = \\mu + (1.28)\\sigma = 167 + (1.28)(76) = 167 + 97.28 \\approx 264.28\\]\n\nRounding to the nearest minute gives us 264 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the interval that contains the middle 80% of the durations, to the nearest minute, is from 70 minutes to 264 minutes.\n\nThe correct answer is C. 70 minutes to 264 minutes."
