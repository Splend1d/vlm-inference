                    "text": "To determine which statement is false, let's analyze the given system of linear equations:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{cases}\nw + 3x + 2y + 2z = 0 \\\\\nw + 4x + y = 0 \\\\\n3w + 5x + 10y + 14z = 0 \\\\\n2w + 5x + 5y + 6z = 0\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\nWe can rewrite this system in matrix form as \\(AX = 0\\), where\n\n\\[\nA =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 3 & 2 & 2 \\\\\n1 & 4 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n3 & 5 & 10 & 14 \\\\\n2 & 5 & 5 & 6\n\\end{pmatrix},\nX =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nw \\\\\nx \\\\\ny \\\\\nz\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nThe system \\(AX = 0\\) represents a homogeneous system of linear equations. A homogeneous system is always consistent (it always has at least one solution, the trivial solution \\(\\mathbf{0}\\)), so statement A is true.\n\nTo investigate the other statements, we need to determine the rank of matrix \\(A\\) and the dimension of its null space. We'll do this by row reducing \\(A\\) to its reduced row echelon form (RREF).\n\nLet's perform Gaussian elimination on matrix \\(A\\):\n\n\\[\nA =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 3 & 2 & 2 \\\\\n1 & 4 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n3 & 5 & 10 & 14 \\\\\n2 & 5 & 5 & 6\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nSubtract the first row from the second row and three times the first row from the third row, and twice the first row from the fourth row:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 3 & 2 & 2 \\\\\n0 & 1 & -1 & -2 \\\\\n0 & -4 & 4 & 8 \\\\\n0 & -1 & 1 & 2\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nAdd four times the second row to the third row and add the second row to the fourth row:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 3 & 2 & 2 \\\\\n0 & 1 & -1 & -2 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nSubtract three times the second row from the first row:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 0 & 5 & 8 \\\\\n0 & 1 & -1 & -2 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nThis is the RREF of \\(A\\). It shows that the rank of \\(A\\) is 2 since there are two leading ones in the matrix. Since \\(A\\) is a 4x4 matrix, the dimension of its null space is \\(4 - 2 = 2\\). This means that the system has infinitely many solutions (since the null space has dimension greater than 0), so statement B is true.\n\nFor statement C, in a homogeneous system, if \\(\\mathbf{x}_1\\) and \\(\\mathbf{x}_2\\) are solutions, then \\(c_1\\mathbf{x}_1 + c_2\\mathbf{x}_2\\) is also a solution for any scalars \\(c_1\\) and \\(c_2\\). In particular, the sum of any two solutions is a solution. So, statement C is true.\n\nFinally, for statement D, we need to check if every solution is a scalar multiple of \\((-5, 1, 1, 0)\\). Let's express the general solution based on the RREF of \\(A\\). From the RREF, we have:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{cases}\nw + 5y + 8z = 0 \\\\\nx - y - 2z = 0\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\nLet \\(y = s\\) and \\(z = t\\) be free variables. Then,\n\n\\[\n\\begin{cases}\nw = -5s - 8t \\\\\nx = s + 2t\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\nThus, the general solution is:\n\n\\[\nX = \\begin{pmatrix}\n-5s - 8t \\\\\ns + 2t \\\\\ns \\\\\nt\n\\end{pmatrix} = s\\begin{pmatrix}\n-5 \\\\\n1 \\\\\n1 \\\\\n0\n\\end{pmatrix} + t\\begin{pmatrix}\n-8 \\\\\n2 \\\\\n0 \\\\\n1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nSo, the solution space is spanned by \\((-5, 1, 1, 0)\\) and \\((-8, 2, 0, 1)\\). Therefore, not every solution is a scalar multiple of \\((-5, 1, 1, 0)\\), making statement D false.\n\nThe answer is **D**."
