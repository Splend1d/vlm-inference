Phytochrome\n\nPhytochrome is the photoreceptor that plays a crucial role in the photoperiodic response of plants, including the regulation of flowering time in many angiosperms (flowering plants). It is sensitive to red and far-red light and helps plants detect day length, which is critical for flowering in response to seasonal changes."
