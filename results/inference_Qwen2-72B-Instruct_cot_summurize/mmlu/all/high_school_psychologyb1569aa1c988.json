They have a lower absolute threshold for light than cones, which means they can detect light at much lower intensities. Rods do not play a significant role in color vision but are essential for night or twilight vision. They are primarily located in the peripheral areas of the retina rather than the center (where the cones are concentrated). Both rods and cones synapse with bipolar cells as part of the visual signal processing pathway in the retina."
