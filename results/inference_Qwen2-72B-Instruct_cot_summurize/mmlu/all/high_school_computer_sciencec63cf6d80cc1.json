Both algorithms work correctly on all input values.\nB. Algorithm I always works correctly, but Algorithm II only works correctly when the maximum value is not the first value in the list.\nC. Algorithm II always works correctly, but Algorithm I only works correctly when the maximum value is greater than or equal to -l.\nD. Neither algorithm will correctly identify the maximum value when the input contains both positive and negative input values.\n"

Algorithm II always works correctly, but Algorithm I only works correctly when the maximum value is greater than or equal to -1.\n\nExplanation:\nAlgorithm I initializes the `max` variable with -1. This initialization can cause issues if all the numbers in the list are less than or equal to -1 because the algorithm would incorrectly conclude that -1 is the maximum value. However, if the maximum value in the list is greater than or equal to -1, then Algorithm I will work correctly.\n\nAlgorithm II initializes the `max` variable with the first value in the list. This ensures that no matter what the range of the numbers is, the algorithm will correctly update the `max` variable as it iterates through the rest of the list. Therefore, Algorithm II will always work correctly for any list of integers."
