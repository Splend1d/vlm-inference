Cognitive dissonance theory and self-perception theory both predict that participants in the $1.00 condition will subsequently report greater liking for the dull experiment than will those in the $20.00 condition.\n\nAccording to cognitive dissonance theory, when people experience discomfort due to holding two contradictory beliefs or behaviors, they will attempt to reduce this dissonance by changing their attitudes or beliefs. In this case, if participants are paid only $1.00 to lie about the experiment being interesting, they may experience dissonance between their behavior (lying) and their beliefs (that the experiment was dull). To reduce this dissonance, they may convince themselves that the experiment was actually more interesting than it seemed, thus aligning their behavior with their beliefs.\n\nSelf-perception theory, on the other hand, suggests that individuals infer their attitudes from their observed behavior, especially when their internal cues are ambiguous. Participants in the $1.00 condition may not have strong internal cues about how they really feel about the experiment, so they may look to their behavior (telling others the experiment was interesting) to infer their own attitude. Since they behaved as if the experiment was interesting, they may conclude that they must have found it somewhat interesting.\n\nIn contrast, participants in the $20.00 condition have an obvious external incentive (the money) for lying about the experiment's interest level, so they are less likely to need to resolve dissonance or infer their attitudes from their behavior. They can attribute their behavior solely to the large payment they received, without needing to change their beliefs about the experiment."
