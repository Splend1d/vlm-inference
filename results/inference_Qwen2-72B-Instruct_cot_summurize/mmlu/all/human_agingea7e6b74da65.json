Clifford and Lucia Pauling, in their book \"Senior View,\" discuss the natural process of aging and how it affects the body. They emphasize the importance of understanding these changes and adopting healthy habits to maintain well-being as one ages. While meditation can certainly have benefits for mental and physical health, it is not presented as a means to offset physical changes directly. Furthermore, there is no indication that they believe physical changes should not be discussed in public."
