They play a central role as producers of food, managers of natural resources, income earners and caretakers of household nutrition.\n\nWomen play a crucial role in ensuring food security at the household and community levels. They are often responsible for producing food, managing natural resources, earning income, and ensuring that their families receive adequate nutrition. In many parts of the world, women make up a significant portion of the agricultural labor force and are involved in all aspects of crop production, including planting, weeding, harvesting, and processing. They also manage small-scale livestock and fisheries, gather wild foods, and maintain kitchen gardens. Women's roles in food production and management contribute significantly to food security and the overall well-being of their households and communities."
