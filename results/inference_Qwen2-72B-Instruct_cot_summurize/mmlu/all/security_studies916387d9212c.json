Anarchy means that the state exists as part of society being indistinguishable from national government and the domestic character of the state.\nB. Anarchy refers to the lack of over-arching power in the international system - there is no controlling power beyond the multiple states. In the absence of such authority, states have their own agenda for achieving security, and can determine their own goals and behaviour.\nC. Anarchy means that there is little continuity in a government's foreign policy over time. Leaders come and go and their foreign policy changes, which is reflective of different preoccupations and ideologies.\nD. Anarchy means that the structure of the international system is distinctive because states have a strong sense that they are part of a larger entity in international politics with overarching interests and goals, making association unlimited and important.\n"

This is a central concept in realism, which posits that the international system is anarchic because there is no global government or central authority to enforce rules and resolve disputes. As a result, states must rely on their own resources and capabilities to ensure their survival and pursue their interests, leading to a self-help system where states act primarily in their own self-interest. This condition of anarchy creates a security dilemma where states may feel compelled to increase their military capabilities to deter potential threats, leading to a cycle of arms races and conflict."
