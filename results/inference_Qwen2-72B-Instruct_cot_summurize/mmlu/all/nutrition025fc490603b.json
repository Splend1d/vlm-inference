The RNA formed by transcription of DNA undergoes splicing and further modifications to form mRNA.\n\nExplanation:\nA. This statement is incorrect because not all the information in DNA codes for proteins. Only certain regions, known as genes, code for proteins. Other regions may contain regulatory sequences or non-coding RNAs.\nB. This statement is partially correct but oversimplified. The mRNA formed by transcription does indeed carry the genetic code for a specific protein, but it also includes additional information such as untranslated regions and signals for processing.\nC. This statement is incorrect because only one strand of DNA, known as the template strand, is transcribed to form mRNA. The other strand, known as the coding strand, serves as a complementary copy that can be used to reconstruct the mRNA sequence.\nD. This statement is correct. After transcription, the pre-mRNA (primary transcript) undergoes several modifications, including splicing to remove introns (non-coding regions), addition of a 5' cap and a poly-A tail at the 3' end, which are crucial for mRNA stability and translation initiation. These modifications are essential for the formation of mature mRNA, which is then ready for translation into a protein."
