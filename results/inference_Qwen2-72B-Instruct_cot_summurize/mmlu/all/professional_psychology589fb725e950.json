This includes cases where a patient discloses information about past or current abuse, even if it was committed by the patient themselves. Failure to report such information could result in legal consequences for the psychologist and could also put the child at further risk of harm. It is important for the psychologist to inform the patient that they will be reporting the abuse to the authorities, as this can help to prevent further harm and ensure that the patient receives appropriate treatment and support."
