She takes levothyroxine for hypothyroidism and uses an over-the-counter inhaler as needed for exercise-induced asthma. Her blood pressure is 140/80 mm Hg, and pulse is 100/min. Examination shows dry skin and hair. She is cooperative but appears anxious, glancing around quickly when a loud noise is heard outside the office. Leukocyte count is 12,000/mm3 , and serum thyroid-stimulating hormone concentration is 5.0 \u03bcU/mL. An ECG shows sinus tachycardia. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\n\nA. Acute stress disorder\nB. Agoraphobia\nC. Generalized anxiety disorder\nD. Hypothyroidism\n"

                    "text": "The symptoms described, including increased anxiety, abdominal discomfort, irritability, difficulty concentrating, dry skin, hair changes, and sinus tachycardia, could be indicative of several conditions. However, given the patient's history of hypothyroidism and her current thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level, which is slightly elevated at 5.0 \u03bcU/mL (normal range typically being 0.4-4.0 \u03bcU/mL), it suggests that her hypothyroidism might not be optimally controlled.\n\nFurthermore, the patient's recent traumatic experience could contribute to acute stress disorder or exacerbate underlying anxiety disorders. The symptoms of hypothyroidism can often mimic those of anxiety disorders, making it challenging to distinguish between the two based on symptoms alone.\n\nGiven the context and the options provided:\n\nA. Acute stress disorder: This is a possibility due to the recent traumatic event, but the physical symptoms such as dry skin and hair, as well as the laboratory findings, suggest another primary cause.\n  \nB. Agoraphobia: This diagnosis does not fit the symptoms described.\n  \nC. Generalized anxiety disorder: This could be present, especially considering the recent trauma, but the physical symptoms and lab results point more strongly toward an endocrine disorder.\n  \nD. Hypothyroidism: This is the most likely diagnosis based on the symptoms and laboratory findings. The patient is already on levothyroxine, suggesting she has a known history of hypothyroidism. The slightly elevated TSH level indicates inadequate control of her condition.\n\nTherefore, the most likely diagnosis is **D. Hypothyroidism**. It would be appropriate to adjust her levothyroxine dosage and monitor her thyroid function tests to ensure adequate control of her hypothyroidism. Additionally, considering her psychological symptoms, referral to a mental health professional for evaluation of possible acute stress disorder or other anxiety disorders may be warranted."
