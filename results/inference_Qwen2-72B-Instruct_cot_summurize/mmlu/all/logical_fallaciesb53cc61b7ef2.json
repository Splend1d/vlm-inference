However, the closest option given would be:\n\nC. appeal to tradition\n\nAlthough this might not seem like a perfect fit, the reasoning behind choosing this answer is that by arguing that a change will have no significant effect without evidence, the person may be implicitly suggesting that the current state (or tradition) is sufficient or preferable due to its familiarity, despite lacking evidence for why the change would be ineffective.\n\nHowever, if we were to strictly categorize the fallacy described, it would more accurately be considered an \"appeal to ignorance,\" which suggests that something is true because it hasn't been proven false, or vice versa. This fallacy is not listed among the options provided. \n\nHere's how each of the other options differs:\n\nA. Poisoning the well: This involves prejudicing an audience against an opponent before they make their argument.\nB. Solid slope (which seems to be a mislabeling and might be intended as \"slippery slope\"): This involves predicting a chain of events leading to an undesirable outcome based on a relatively small first step.\nD. Argument from authority: This involves using the opinion of an authority figure as evidence for the truth of a claim, regardless of the authority's expertise in the relevant field."
