                    "text": "Under U.S. GAAP, an operating segment is reportable if it meets any one of the following criteria:\n1. Its revenues are 10% or more of the combined revenues of all operating segments.\n2. Its profit or loss is 10% or more of the combined profits or losses of all operating segments.\n3. Its assets are 10% or more of the combined assets of all operating segments.\n\nLet's evaluate each segment based on these criteria:\n\nSegment A:\n- Revenues: $42 thousand / $177 thousand = 23.73%\n- Profit: $12 thousand / $74 thousand = 16.22%\n- Assets: $470 thousand / $1,350 thousand = 34.81%\n\nSegment B:\n- Revenues: $121 thousand / $177 thousand = 68.36%\n- Profit: $65 thousand / $74 thousand = 87.84%\n- Assets: $800 thousand / $1,350 thousand = 59.26%\n\nSegment C:\n- Revenues: $14 thousand / $177 thousand = 7.85%\n- Profit (loss): ($3) thousand / $74 thousand = -4.05%\n- Assets: $80 thousand / $1,350 thousand = 5.93%\n\nFrom the calculations above, we can see that:\n- Segment A meets the revenue test (over 10%) and the asset test (over 10%).\n- Segment B meets all three tests (revenue, profit, and asset over 10%).\n- Segment C does not meet any of the tests individually, but since segments A and B already meet the criteria, we need to consider whether segment C's omission would cause the reported information to be misleading. However, given the threshold percentages, segment C's contribution to total revenues and assets is below the 10% threshold, and its profit or loss does not significantly affect the overall profitability ratio.\n\nAccording to the rules, if two segments together do not account for at least 75% of the company's revenues or profit/loss, then the third segment must also be reported. In this case, Segments A and B together account for more than 75% of revenues, profit, and assets, so there is no requirement to report Segment C under the 75% rule.\n\nHowever, under IFRS, there is a \"disclosure by aggregation\" rule which requires that segments below the quantitative thresholds be aggregated with other segments to form a single reportable segment if they have similar economic characteristics. This rule doesn't directly apply here as the question seems to refer to US GAAP reporting standards.\n\nGiven the information provided and applying US GAAP rules, the correct answer would be:\n\nA. A and B only."
