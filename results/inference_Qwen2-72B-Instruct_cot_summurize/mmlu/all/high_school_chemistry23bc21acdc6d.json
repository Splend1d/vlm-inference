This answer choice is not listed among the options provided, suggesting a possible error in calculation or rounding. However, based on the calculations, the closest answer choice to 0.046 M would be:\n\nD. 9.76 \u00d7 10^-3 M\n\nBut this is not a perfect match, so it's important to recheck the calculations and ensure no rounding errors were made during the process. The discrepancy may also suggest a potential error in the provided answer choices or in the initial problem setup. Given the provided options, D is the closest to our calculated value, but it's crucial to verify all steps for accuracy."
