Prevention is normally associated with the concept of terrorism as war or crime. All governments will practice prevention (seen as repression from the terrorist perspective) by seeking to arrest or eliminate those actively involved in the violence. Security forces attack the terrorists before they strike (war) or they are arrested after the attack (crime).\nB. Large terrorist organizations are hard to penetrate, being highly cohesive and centralized in structure. In both the warfare and criminal model, intelligence is obtained by two methods; firstly to elicit information from captured terrorists or secondly from an informer within the group. An intelligence coup greatly enhances the prospect of stopping terrorist operations once the larger group has been compromised.\nC. Prevention of terrorism is a highly controversial policy designed to reduce the appeal of terrorism within the population through reform packages. The method is characterized by diplomatic exchanges. However, as a preventative method it has been questioned and it is argued to resemble concessionary politics.\nD. Prevention is conceived as securing the physical integrity of targets and key political installations, particularly weapons installations, national buildings, national or cultural symbols, or defence deployments. Protecting possible targets of the state enhances the wellbeing of more vulnerable targets. Terrorists may move to more convenient territory to target their objectives which make it more difficult to control.\n"

Repression: Governments may seek to arrest or eliminate those actively involved in the violence. This involves using security forces to attack the terrorists before they can carry out an attack or arresting them after the attack.\n\nB. Intelligence gathering: Intelligence is obtained by eliciting information from captured terrorists or from informers within the group. This can help to stop terrorist operations once the larger group has been compromised.\n\nC. Diplomatic exchanges: Prevention of terrorism can also involve reducing the appeal of terrorism within the population through reform packages. This method involves diplomatic exchanges and addressing the root causes of terrorism.\n\nD. Target hardening: Governments may also seek to secure the physical integrity of targets and key political installations. This includes protecting weapons installations, national buildings, national or cultural symbols, or defense deployments. By protecting these targets, more vulnerable targets may become less appealing to terrorists.\n\nOther measures that governments may take include increasing border security, monitoring suspicious activities, and conducting counterterrorism operations. Additionally, governments may work with international partners to share intelligence and coordinate efforts to prevent terrorist attacks. It's important to note that while preventative measures can be effective, they must be balanced with civil liberties and human rights concerns."
