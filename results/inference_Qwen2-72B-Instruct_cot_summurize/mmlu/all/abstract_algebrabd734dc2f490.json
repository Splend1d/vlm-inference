                    "text": "Let's analyze each statement separately:\n\n### Statement 1: Some abelian group of order 45 has a subgroup of order 10.\n\nAn abelian group of order 45 would have the structure \\(G \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_{45}\\) or some other direct product of cyclic groups whose orders multiply to 45. The prime factorization of 45 is \\(3^2 \\times 5\\). According to the fundamental theorem of finite abelian groups, any abelian group of order 45 can be expressed as a direct product of cyclic groups of orders that are powers of these primes. This means that an abelian group of order 45 could be \\(\\mathbb{Z}_9 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_5\\) or \\(\\mathbb{Z}_{45}\\).\n\nHowever, for a subgroup of order 10 to exist in such a group, it must be consistent with the conditions set by Lagrange's theorem, which states that the order of a subgroup divides the order of the group. Since 10 does not divide 45 evenly (i.e., 45/10 is not an integer), there cannot be a subgroup of order 10 in any abelian group of order 45. Therefore, this statement is **False**.\n\n### Statement 2: A subgroup H of a group G is a normal subgroup if and only if the number of left cosets of H is equal to the number of right cosets of H.\n\nThis statement is actually true but trivially so. The number of left cosets of a subgroup H in a group G is always equal to the number of right cosets of H in G. This is because both the left and right cosets partition the group into disjoint subsets, each of the same size, and each containing one element from every coset. However, this equality does not necessarily imply that the subgroup H is normal. Normality of a subgroup H in G is defined by the condition that for all \\(g \\in G\\), \\(gH = Hg\\). This means that the left cosets and right cosets not only have the same number but also correspond exactly to each other. Thus, while the statement is technically true due to the nature of cosets, it does not capture the essence of what makes a subgroup normal. However, since the question asks whether the statement is true, we must acknowledge that the literal interpretation of the statement is **True**, albeit misleading.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **D. False, True**."
