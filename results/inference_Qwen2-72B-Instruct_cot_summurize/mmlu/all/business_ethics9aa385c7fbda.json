Denial of injury, Appeal to higher loyalties, Metaphor of the ledger\n\nThese are three common strategies used by individuals to justify or deny unethical behavior:\n\n1. Denial of injury: This strategy involves convincing oneself that one's actions do not harm anyone. For example, an actor may rationalize their actions by believing that the people affected by their actions will not be harmed in any significant way.\n\n2. Appeal to higher loyalties: This strategy involves arguing that one's norm violation is an attempt to realize higher-order values. For example, an actor may justify their actions by claiming that they are acting in the best interests of their company, country, or family.\n\n3. Metaphor of the ledger: This strategy involves arguing that one is owed something, often as compensation for past wrongs. For example, an actor may justify their actions by claiming that they have been mistreated in the past and are simply trying to balance the scales of justice."
