This specialization enables people to develop skills and techniques in specific crafts such as weaving, metalworking, and pottery manufacturing, which leads to more efficient and higher quality production. It is also considered one of the characteristics of a civilization, as it indicates a level of social and economic development where roles within the society become more defined and complex."
