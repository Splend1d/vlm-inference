However, his beliefs align most closely with option B: \"Life was hard but worthwhile.\"\n\nDarrow was known for his agnostic views and skepticism about traditional religious beliefs. He often expressed a pessimistic view of human nature and the hardships of life, but he also believed in the importance of striving for justice and compassion in a difficult world. In his writings and speeches, he frequently emphasized the value of individual freedom, critical thinking, and the pursuit of knowledge.\n\nIn his book \"The Story of My Life,\" Darrow wrote, \"I do not believe that life is worth living, but I am sure that it is worth fighting for.\" This quote suggests that while he did not necessarily find life inherently worthwhile, he believed that it was worth the struggle to make it so through personal effort and social progress.\n\nTherefore, the best answer from the given options would be B. \"Life was hard but worthwhile.\""
