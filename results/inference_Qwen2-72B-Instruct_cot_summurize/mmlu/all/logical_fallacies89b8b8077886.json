This leads to a valid conclusion.\n\nB. \"I won't take the test\"\nThis minor premise does not directly relate to the major premise because it introduces a new scenario (not taking the test) that was not part of the original disjunction. However, if we assume that not taking the test automatically results in not doing well on it (since there would be no score), then the speaker might be mad due to not doing well (by default). This can also lead to a valid conclusion, but it depends on an unstated assumption.\n\nC. \"My birthday is today\"\nThis minor premise has no direct relation to the major premise and does not lead to a valid conclusion based on the information given.\n\nD. Both A and B\nSince A definitely leads to a valid conclusion and B could potentially lead to a valid conclusion under certain assumptions, D is technically correct. However, the validity of B's conclusion is less clear-cut than A's, as it requires making additional assumptions about how not taking the test relates to the original disjunction.\n\nIn strict logical terms, only A directly leads to a valid conclusion without needing additional assumptions. B might lead to a valid conclusion if we assume that not taking the test is equivalent to not doing well on it, but this is not explicitly stated in the major premise. Therefore, the most straightforward answer is:\n\nA. \"I won't do well on the test\""
