According to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the number of deaths attributed to Alzheimer's in the United States increased by over 145% between 2000 and 2017. This rise is largely due to an aging population, as Alzheimer's predominantly affects people aged 65 and older.\n\nWhile cancer and cardiovascular diseases remain leading causes of death, their mortality rates have not shown such a dramatic increase over this period due to improvements in treatment and prevention strategies. Homicide rates, on the other hand, have fluctuated but generally have not seen a huge increase comparable to that of Alzheimer's disease."
