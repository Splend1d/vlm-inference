This means that if someone dies during the commission of a felony, such as armed robbery, the perpetrator can be charged with first degree murder even if they did not intend to kill anyone. In this case, Max's actions in pulling out a gun and demanding money from the cashier created a situation where it was foreseeable that someone could be killed, and the accidental discharge of the gun that resulted in the death of a customer would fall under this rule."
