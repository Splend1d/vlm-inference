This implies that we have a duty to promote the morally permissible ends of others and also to strive for our own self-improvement or self-perfection, as long as it does not come at the expense of treating others merely as means. The other options listed (producing happiness, increasing welfare, self-sacrifice) do not directly align with Kant's formulation. While they may be related to ethical behavior, they are not the specific goals mandated by the Humanity formulation."
