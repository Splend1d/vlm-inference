Mercury(II) oxide\n\nWhen heated, mercury(II) oxide decomposes and releases mercury vapor, which is highly toxic and can be easily inhaled, posing a significant health risk. The other substances listed generally do not pose as great a safety risk when heated under controlled laboratory conditions. Iron and sulfur, when mixed and heated, can undergo a reaction that produces a molten metal, but this is less hazardous than mercury vapor. Sodium chloride (table salt) and copper(II) sulfate hydrate are relatively stable when heated and do not produce dangerous byproducts."
