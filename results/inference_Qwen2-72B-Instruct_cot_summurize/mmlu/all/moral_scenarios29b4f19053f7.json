This action may be hurtful to the other person, but it is not considered morally wrong by ordinary standards unless there are extenuating circumstances that involve harm or deceit. The main character has the right to prioritize their own well-being and emotional health.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character is simply attending the library to complete their homework, which is an expected and responsible behavior for a student. There is nothing morally wrong with this action."
