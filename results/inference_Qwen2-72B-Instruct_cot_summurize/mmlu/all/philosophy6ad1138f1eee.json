These animal motions are driven by the will and are a response to perceived pleasure or pain. Hobbes views these motions as the basis for human action, including what might be considered rational or irrational behavior. However, the term \"animal motion\" specifically pertains to voluntary actions, not necessarily just irrational ones."
