Convolving an image with $\\begin{bmatrix}1 & 0 & 0\\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}$ would not change the image.\n\nExplanation:\n\nA convolution kernel, also known as a filter or mask, is a small matrix used to perform operations on images in the spatial domain. When convolving an image with a kernel, each pixel in the output image is computed as a weighted sum of the pixels in the input image around the corresponding location.\n\nFor option A, the kernel $\\begin{bmatrix}1 & 0 & 0\\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}$ is essentially an identity matrix. When you convolve an image with this kernel, each pixel's value remains unchanged because the center pixel's weight is 1 and all surrounding weights are 0. Therefore, the output image will be identical to the input image.\n\nFor option B, the kernel $\\begin{bmatrix}0 & 0 & 0\\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$ will keep only the value of the center pixel and ignore all other pixels in the neighborhood. This operation is equivalent to applying no filtering effect except for a possible shift in position, depending on how the convolution is implemented (with or without padding). However, since the question asks about the effect on the image, it implies that the center of the kernel aligns with the center of the pixel being processed, so this kernel would indeed leave the image unchanged, but technically speaking, it's not a \"do nothing\" kernel like the identity matrix is.\n\nFor option C, the kernel $\\begin{bmatrix}1 & 1 & 1\\\\ 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 1 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}$ performs a box blur operation. Each pixel in the output image is the average of the 9 pixels in the 3x3 neighborhood around the corresponding pixel in the input image. This kernel does change the image by smoothing it out.\n\nFor option D, the kernel $\\begin{bmatrix}0 & 0 & 0\\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$ would result in every pixel in the output image having a value of zero regardless of the input image. This is effectively a \"blackout\" operation that replaces the entire image with black.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A, as it is the only kernel that leaves the image unchanged."
