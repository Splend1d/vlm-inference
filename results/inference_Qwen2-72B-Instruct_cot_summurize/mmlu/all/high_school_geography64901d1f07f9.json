They were considered outside the four main varnas (castes): Brahmins (scholar-priests), Kshatriyas (warrior-landowners), Vaishyas (businessmen and farmers), and Shudras (laborers and service providers). The untouchables, also known as Dalits or Harijans, were often relegated to menial jobs and faced social exclusion. However, it's important to note that this term is now considered derogatory, and the Indian constitution has officially abolished untouchability and recognized the rights of these communities under the Scheduled Castes category."
