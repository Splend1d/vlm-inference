Instead, she argues that even if we grant that the fetus has a right to life, this right does not necessarily override the pregnant woman's right to bodily autonomy. Therefore, the abortion issue cannot be settled just by determining at what stage (if any) the fetus is a person. So the answer would be:\n\nA. the abortion issue cannot be settled just by determining at what stage (if any) the fetus is a person."
