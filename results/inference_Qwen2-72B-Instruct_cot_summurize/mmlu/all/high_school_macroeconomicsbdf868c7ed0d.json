This means that for each additional dollar of income, consumption will increase by the amount of the MPC, which is typically between 0 and 1.\n\nB is incorrect because the slope is not equal to the Marginal Propensity to Save (MPS), which represents the portion of an additional dollar of income that is saved rather than spent.\n\nC is incorrect because the MPC and MPS are related but do not add up to the slope of the consumption function; rather, they add up to 1 since all additional income either gets consumed or saved.\n\nD is incorrect because the consumption function actually shifts downward when consumers become more pessimistic about the future, as they will likely save more and consume less in anticipation of potential economic downturns."
