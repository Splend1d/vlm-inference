This specialization was crucial for the emergence of complex societies as it enabled some individuals to engage in activities other than farming, such as crafts, trade, and administration.\n\nWhile the other options (shellfish collection, construction of the Piramide Mayor, and the creation of sunken plazas) were certainly part of Caral's culture and may have contributed to its complexity in various ways, irrigation and agriculture are often considered fundamental drivers of societal complexity in prehistoric civilizations."
