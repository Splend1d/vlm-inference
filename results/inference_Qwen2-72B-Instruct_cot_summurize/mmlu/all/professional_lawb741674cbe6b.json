The shopper does nothing to warn or assist the second shopper, who is a stranger to her. She could have taken action to protect the second shopper without harming herself. Did the shopper have a duty to take action to try and protect the second shopper from injury?\n\nA. No, there is no duty for a shopper to render assistance to a stranger even if it can be done without hurting herself.\nB. Yes, the fact that a person sees that action is needed for another's aid or protection does impose a legal duty to act.\nC. No, a failure to act does not and cannot result in liability under any circumstances.\nD. Yes, the shopper must take action under the \"last clear chance\" doctrine.\n"

However, generally speaking, most jurisdictions do not impose a legal duty on a passerby or witness to rescue or assist someone in danger unless there is a special relationship between the two parties (such as parent-child, teacher-student, employer-employee, or custodian-detainee). Therefore, option A is the most likely correct answer in many legal systems.\n\nHowever, some jurisdictions may recognize exceptions to this general rule, such as the \"Good Samaritan\" laws that encourage but do not require people to provide reasonable assistance to those in need, or the \"last clear chance\" doctrine that holds the last party with an opportunity to avoid harm liable for damages if they fail to do so. But these exceptions typically apply only in certain circumstances and do not create a general duty to rescue or assist strangers. Option D is not universally applicable, as the \"last clear chance\" doctrine is not recognized in all jurisdictions and has specific requirements that may not be met in every situation.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer to this question is:\n\nA. No, there is no duty for a shopper to render assistance to a stranger even if it can be done without hurting herself."
