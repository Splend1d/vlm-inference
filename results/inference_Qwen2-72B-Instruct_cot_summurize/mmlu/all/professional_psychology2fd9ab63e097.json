However, it might be contraindicated or require special consideration when one of the family members has severe depression (option C).\n\nIn cases of severe depression, individual therapy might be prioritized over family therapy, especially if the depressed individual is not able to engage constructively in family sessions due to the severity of their condition. Severe depression can sometimes make it difficult for the person to participate actively, which could limit the effectiveness of family therapy. Additionally, family therapy should be conducted with caution to avoid exacerbating the individual's depressive symptoms by inadvertently placing them under additional stress.\n\nIt's important to note that the decision to use family therapy or not in any given situation should be made by a qualified mental health professional who can assess the specific circumstances and needs of the individuals involved."
