First, we find the sales tax on a \\$60 bill:\n\n\\[ \\text{Sales Tax} = 60 \\times 0.0825 = \\$5.00 \\]\n\nNow, we double that sales tax to find the tip:\n\n\\[ \\text{Tip from Sales Tax} = 5.00 \\times 2 = \\$10.00 \\]\n\nFinally, we compare the two tips to see how much greater the tip calculated from the sales tax is compared to the standard tip:\n\n\\[ \\text{Difference} = 10.00 - 9.00 = \\$1.00 \\]\n\nSince the question asks for the difference in cents, we convert the dollar amount to cents:\n\n\\[ \\$1.00 = 100 \\text{ cents} \\]\n\nHowever, none of the provided options (A. 90, B. 80, C. 70, D. 60) match our calculation of 100 cents.
