Primers complementary to certain portions of the DNA.\n\nWhen performing a Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), the following components are required:\n\n1. Template DNA: This is the DNA sample that you want to amplify.\n2. Taq polymerase or another heat-stable DNA polymerase: This enzyme synthesizes new DNA strands.\n3. Primers: These are short, synthetic DNA sequences that are complementary to specific regions of the template DNA. They serve as starting points for DNA synthesis.\n4. Deoxynucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs): These are the building blocks of DNA that the polymerase uses to synthesize new strands.\n5. Buffer solution: This includes magnesium ions and other components that provide an optimal environment for the PCR reaction.\n\nReverse transcriptase (option A) is used in reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) to convert RNA into DNA but is not necessary for standard PCR which amplifies existing DNA. A vacuum chamber (option B) is not required for PCR. DNA ligase (option D) is used in DNA repair and ligation processes but is not needed for PCR since the polymerase performs all necessary enzymatic functions during the reaction."
