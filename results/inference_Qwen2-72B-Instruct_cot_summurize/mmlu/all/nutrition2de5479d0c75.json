While it is true that DHA, an omega-3 fatty acid, is most commonly found in fish and other seafood, some microalgae can produce DHA, and these algae oils are used as supplements and sometimes added to vegan foods to provide this nutrient. Therefore, vegans can obtain DHA through fortified foods or supplements derived from algae."
