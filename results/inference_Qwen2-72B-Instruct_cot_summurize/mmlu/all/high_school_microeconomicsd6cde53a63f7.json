Therefore, firms in an oligopoly are highly interdependent, as they must consider how their pricing, output, and marketing strategies will impact competitors' behavior. This interdependence can lead to collusion, price wars, or the creation of cartels, which are subject to antitrust legislation. Firms in an oligopoly can earn economic profits, especially if there are barriers to entry that prevent new competitors from entering the market."
