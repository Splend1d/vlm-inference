However, based on the logic of each part of the question, the correct answer would be:\n\nD. Sell bonds Decreases Decreases Inflation\n\nSelling bonds by the central bank decreases the money supply (because banks have less reserves to lend out), which in turn decreases aggregate demand (because there is less money available for borrowing and spending). This action helps to fight inflation, not unemployment. If the goal was to fight unemployment, the central bank would likely lower interest rates and buy bonds to increase the money supply and stimulate aggregate demand."
