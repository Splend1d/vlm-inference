One week later, the purchasing agent received a telephone call from the vice president of the dressmaking company, who informed her that the dressmaking company's sales representative had made an error in calculating the contract price. As a result, the vice president said that unless the women's clothing store agreed to pay an additional $15,000, the garments would not be delivered. If the purchasing agent should have known that the dressmaking company's original price term of $75,000 was in error, but agreed to the contract anyway, which of the following is the most accurate statement?\n\nA. There was an enforceable contract at the original price term, because the mistake resulted from an error in computation, not in judgment.\nB. There was an enforceable contract at the original price term, because the mistake was unilateral.\nC. There was no valid contract formed, because there was no mutuality of assent.\nD. There was a voidable contract, because the purchasing agent should have known of the error.\n"

There was a voidable contract, because the purchasing agent should have known of the error.\n\nWhen one party enters into a contract under a mistaken belief as to a material fact and the other party is aware or should be aware of the mistake, the contract may be voidable by the party who was mistaken. In this case, since the purchasing agent should have known that the price term of $75,000 was in error, the contract could be considered voidable at the option of the dressmaking company. This means that the dressmaking company has the right to rescind the contract if they choose to do so due to the mistake."
