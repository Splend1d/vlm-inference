This typically happens due to insufficient bounds checking on input data or an error in programming logic.\n\nOption C is the closest to the correct answer: when a pointer is used to access memory not allocated to it, but this specifically refers to accessing unauthorized memory rather than just overflowing a buffer. A buffer overflow specifically occurs when the amount of data exceeds the size of the buffer, often due to a lack of proper input validation or boundary checks.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer from the given options would be:\n\nC. when a pointer is used to access memory not allocated to it\n\nHowever, a more precise answer would be something like: \"when more data is written to a buffer than its allocated size, causing the extra data to overwrite adjacent memory.\"\n\nThe other options do not directly describe situations that lead to buffer overflows:\n\nA. when writing to a pointer that has been freed - This describes use-after-free errors, not buffer overflows.\nB. when copying a buffer from the stack to the heap - This operation itself does not cause a buffer overflow; it's how much data is copied and whether the destination buffer can hold it that matters.\nD. when the program notices a buffer has filled up, and so starts to reject requests - This describes a situation where the program is handling the buffer fill-up correctly by rejecting further requests, which prevents a buffer overflow."
