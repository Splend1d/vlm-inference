This holds true if \\(a\\) commutes with every element in \\(G\\), i.e., \\(ay = ya\\) for all \\(y \\in G\\).\n\nNow, let's check the options:\n\nA. If \\(G\\) is abelian, then it satisfies the condition since in an abelian group, every element commutes with every other element. Thus, \\(ay = ya\\) for all \\(y \\in G\\), making option A correct.\n\nB. If \\(G = \\{e\\}\\), then there is only one element in the group, which trivially commutes with itself, so option B is also correct.\n\nC. The condition \\(a^3 = e\\) does not necessarily imply that \\(a\\) commutes with every element in \\(G\\). For instance, consider the cyclic group of order 3 generated by \\(a\\). While \\(a^3 = e\\) holds, \\(a\\) does not commute with every element in the group unless the group is abelian. Therefore, option C is not necessarily true.\n\nD. The condition \\(a^2 = a\\) implies that \\(a = e\\) or \\(a\\) has order 2. If \\(a = e\\), then the map becomes \\(f(x) = ex = x\\), which is a homomorphism. However, if \\(a\\) has order 2 and \\(G\\) is not abelian, then \\(a\\) might not commute with every element in \\(G\\), meaning that \\(f\\) might not be a homomorphism. Thus, option D is not necessarily true.\n\nTherefore, the correct answers are A and B."
