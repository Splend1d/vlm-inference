                    "text": "The correct answer is A. The O\u2013H bonds in sulfuric acid are much weaker than in sulfurous acid due to the electron-withdrawing effect of the additional oxygen atoms in sulfuric acid. This allows sulfuric acid to more easily donate a proton (H+) and thus makes it a stronger acid than sulfurous acid.\n\nSulfurous acid (H2SO3) and sulfuric acid (H2SO4) both have sulfur as the central atom bonded to oxygen atoms, but sulfuric acid has two additional oxygen atoms compared to sulfurous acid. These extra oxygens help stabilize the negative charge left on the molecule after a proton is donated, making it easier for sulfuric acid to lose a proton and thus making it a stronger acid."
