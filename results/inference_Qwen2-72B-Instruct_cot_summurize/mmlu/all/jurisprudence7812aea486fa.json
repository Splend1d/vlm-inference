Fuller's famous hypothetical case of the Speluncean Explorers, published in the Harvard Law Review in 1946, is primarily concerned with exploring the philosophical underpinnings of law and its relationship with morality. The case poses a moral dilemma where five spelunkers (cave explorers) become trapped in a cave by a landslide and are forced to kill and eat one member of their group to survive until they can be rescued. The four survivors are then put on trial for murder. Through this scenario, Fuller invites readers to consider various aspects of legal theory, such as the nature of law, the limits of legal authority, the role of judges in interpreting laws, and the interplay between law and morality."
