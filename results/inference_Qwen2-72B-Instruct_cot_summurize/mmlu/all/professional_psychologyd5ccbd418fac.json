In terms of ethical guidelines, if Dr. Carlson accepts Marla\u2019s invitation, he will be:\n\nA. clearly violating ethical guidelines.\nB. acting ethically since he is not the one who initiated a potential relationship.\nC. acting ethically as long as Marla is a student in a department other than the psychology department and will not be taking any classes in the psychology department.\nD. acting ethically as long as he does not become sexually involved with Marla until she is no longer affiliated with the university.\n"

According to the American Psychological Association's Ethical Principles of Psychologists and Code of Conduct, psychologists should not engage in sexual or romantic relationships with current students or supervisees, regardless of whether they are in the same department or not. This prohibition extends to avoid engaging in such relationships with former students or supervisees for a reasonable period of time after the termination of the professional relationship. Therefore, Dr. Carlson should decline Marla's invitation to maintain professional boundaries and adhere to ethical guidelines."
