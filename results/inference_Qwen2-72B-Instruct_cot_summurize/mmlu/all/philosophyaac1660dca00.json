According to Plato, knowledge involves more than just believing something to be true; it requires justification through rational argumentation and an understanding of the underlying reality. The correct answer to the question is:\n\nD. beyond sense experience to unchanging ideas (Forms) that are perceived as rationally ordered.\n\nPlato argues that true knowledge comes from grasping the eternal and unchanging Forms or Ideas, which are accessed through reason rather than the senses. This is because the senses can deceive us and only provide us with appearances, not the true nature of things. By contrast, the Forms represent the ultimate reality and can be known through intellectual contemplation and dialectical reasoning."
