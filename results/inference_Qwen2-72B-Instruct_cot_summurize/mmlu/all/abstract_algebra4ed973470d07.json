The symmetric group \\(S_n\\) consists of all permutations of \\(n\\) elements. For \\(n \\geq 3\\), \\(S_n\\) contains at least one pair of elements that do not commute (i.e., there exist \\(a, b \\in S_n\\) such that \\(ab \\neq ba\\)). A simple example to illustrate this is with \\(S_3\\), where you can take two transpositions, say \\((12)\\) and \\((23)\\). Their products in different orders are:\n- \\((12)(23) = (123)\\)\n- \\((23)(12) = (132)\\)\n\nSince \\((123) \\neq (132)\\), \\(S_3\\) is not Abelian. This property holds for all \\(S_n\\) where \\(n \\geq 3\\), as larger symmetric groups contain \\(S_3\\) as a subgroup, and thus also contain non-commuting elements.\n\n**Statement 2: If \\(a\\) is a permutation that is an \\(m\\)-cycle and \\(b\\) is a permutation that is an \\(n\\)-cycle, then \\(|ab| = \\text{lcm}(m,n).\\)**\n\nThis statement is false. The order of the product of two cycles, \\(|ab|\\), does not necessarily equal the least common multiple of their lengths (\\(\\text{lcm}(m,n)\\)). The order of the product depends on how these cycles interact when composed. For instance, if \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) have no elements in common, they commute, and the order of \\(ab\\) would be the least common multiple of their orders. However, if they share elements, the situation becomes more complex, and the order of \\(ab\\) can be less than \\(\\text{lcm}(m,n)\\).\n\nFor example, consider \\(a = (123)\\) and \\(b = (34)\\) in \\(S_4\\). Here, \\(a\\) is a 3-cycle and \\(b\\) is a 2-cycle, but the product \\(ab = (1243)\\) is a 4-cycle, so \\(|ab| = 4\\), which is not equal to \\(\\text{lcm}(3,2) = 6\\).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **C. True, False**."
