This reflects the classical economic theory that, in the long run, the economy's output is determined by its factors of production (capital and labor) and technology, not by demand. The LRAS curve represents the maximum potential output that an economy can produce when all resources are fully utilized. Since prices are assumed to be flexible in the long run, any changes in aggregate demand will not affect the level of real GDP but will instead lead to changes in the price level."
