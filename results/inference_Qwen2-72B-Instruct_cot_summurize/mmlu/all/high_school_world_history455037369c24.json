However, Buddhism differs from Hinduism in its rejection of the caste system, the authority of the Vedas, and the worship of gods. But when it comes to reincarnation and the role of karma in determining one's future lives, the two religions share similarities. In Buddhism, the ultimate goal is to achieve Nirvana, a state of enlightenment that breaks the cycle of samsara, while in Hinduism, the goal is to achieve Moksha, which also breaks the cycle of rebirth."
