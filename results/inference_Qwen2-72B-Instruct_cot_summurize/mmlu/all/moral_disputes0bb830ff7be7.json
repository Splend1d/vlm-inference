In his view, abortion is morally equivalent to killing a person because it deprives the fetus of a future like ours, which he argues has significant moral weight. However, he also acknowledges that there may be circumstances where abortion could be justified, such as when the mother's life is at risk or in cases of severe fetal abnormalities. Nonetheless, he maintains that abortion is generally seriously presumptively wrong."
