During trial, plaintiff's counsel asked an opposing witness on cross examination: \"At any time during the assault did anyone attempt to leave?\" Defense counsel objected to the question. How will the court rule on the objection?\n\nA. The objection will be sustained because the question is misleading.\nB. The objection will be sustained because the question is leading.\nC.

The objection will be overruled because leading questions are allowed on cross examination.\n\nIn general, leading questions are not permitted during direct examination but are commonly allowed during cross-examination. A leading question is one that suggests the answer within the question itself, which can influence the witness's response. However, during cross-examination, attorneys are typically allowed to ask leading questions to test the credibility of the witness or to elicit specific information. Therefore, in this scenario, the court would likely overrule the defense counsel's objection and allow the question."
