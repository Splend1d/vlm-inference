Since the sample may not perfectly represent the population, there can be some degree of error in our estimation. This type of error is inherent in the sampling process and can be reduced by increasing the sample size or improving the sampling method, but it cannot be completely eliminated. Options A, C, and D describe specific types of bias or issues that can affect the accuracy of a sample, but they are not the fundamental reason why sampling error occurs."
