                    "text": "The correct answer is D. The linear momentum of the system is conserved because the net force on the system is zero.\n\nIn this scenario, we have two ice skaters colliding on a frictionless surface. Since there are no external forces acting on the system (consisting of both skaters), the total linear momentum of the system must be conserved according to the conservation of momentum principle. This applies regardless of whether the collision is elastic or inelastic.\n\nSince the skaters stick together after the collision, it is an inelastic collision. In inelastic collisions, kinetic energy is not conserved because some of it is converted into other forms of energy (such as heat or deformation). However, linear momentum is always conserved in any type of collision, provided there are no external forces acting on the system.\n\nTherefore, options B and C, which state that only kinetic energy is conserved, are incorrect. Option A is also incorrect because it incorrectly states that the net force on the system is nonzero during the collision, which would violate the conservation of momentum principle. The correct answer is D, which correctly identifies that the linear momentum of the system is conserved due to the absence of net external forces."
