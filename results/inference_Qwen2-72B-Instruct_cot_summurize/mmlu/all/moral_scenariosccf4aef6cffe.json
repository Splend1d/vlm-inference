In scenario 1, renting out a run-down apartment to college students for no more than it's worth could be seen as neglecting one's responsibilities as a landlord if the conditions are unsafe or unhealthy, but without additional context about the condition of the property and whether it meets legal and ethical standards for habitability, it cannot be definitively labeled as morally wrong. If the property is safe and legally habitable, then renting it out at its fair market value is not morally wrong.\n\nIn scenario 2, going to the sea to fish for salmon is not inherently morally wrong. However, there may be environmental concerns or legal restrictions around fishing that could make such an action morally questionable under certain circumstances, such as overfishing, fishing during breeding seasons, or fishing without a proper license. Without additional context, though, this action cannot be considered clearly morally wrong."
