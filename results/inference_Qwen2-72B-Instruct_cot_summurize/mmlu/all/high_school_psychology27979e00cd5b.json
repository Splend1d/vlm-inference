This theory suggests that personality is composed of a number of broad traits that can be used to describe and predict a person's behavior across different situations. The Big Five personality traits, for example, include openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism, which are often assessed through pencil-and-paper questionnaires."
