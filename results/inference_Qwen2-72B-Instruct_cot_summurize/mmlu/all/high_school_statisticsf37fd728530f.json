The mean of the residuals is always zero.\n\nIn an ordinary least squares regression, the sum of the residuals is minimized, and this minimization process results in the mean of the residuals being zero. This property is fundamental to the least squares method because it ensures that the regression line is positioned to balance the residuals on either side of the line.\n\nRegarding the other options:\n\nA. Influential scores can have large residuals, but not all influential scores necessarily do, and not all large residuals come from influential scores. An influential score is one that has a significant impact on the position of the regression line. However, a point could be influential without having a large residual if it lies close to the regression line but pulls the line towards itself, affecting the slope.\n\nB. If the linear model is good, it does not guarantee that the number of positive residuals will be exactly the same as the number of negative residuals. While the distribution of residuals around the regression line should ideally be random (no discernible pattern), the exact number of positive and negative residuals might not match due to random variation.\n\nD. If the correlation is 0, it means there is no linear relationship between the variables, but this does not necessarily imply a distinct pattern in the residual plot. Instead, you would expect the residuals to appear randomly scattered around the horizontal axis with no clear trend or shape. A distinct pattern in the residual plot could indicate a nonlinear relationship or other issues with the model assumptions."
