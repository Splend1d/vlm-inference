A senior partner in the law firm contacted a professor at the law school seeking information about the graduate's qualifications. The professor replied, \"Don't be misled by that \u0080\u0098A' I gave the graduate in entertainment law. I later found out that he had obtained the grade by cheating. \"The graduate soon received a letter from the law firm notifying him that he was not suitable to become a member in the prestigious tradition of the firm. After the graduate received the rejection letter, he phoned the senior partner to inquire why he was not suitable for employment. The senior partner told him what the professor had said and then stated, \"We do not hire cheaters who are dumb enough to get caught. \"The graduate brings suit against the professor for defamation for falsely charging the graduate with being a cheater. If the professor pleads truth as a defense, he should not be permitted to introduce evidence that shows that\n\nA. the graduate did, in fact, cheat on an examination in the entertainment law class.\nB. another professor told him that the graduate had cheated on an admiralty law final examination.\nC. the findings of the law school indicated that the graduate had submitted a plagiarized paper in a moot court brief.\nD. the reputation among the graduate's fellow classmates was that he frequently cheated on law school examinations.\n"

This means that the professor can introduce evidence that directly supports his claim that the graduate cheated in that specific class (option A), or that there were findings by the law school indicating academic dishonesty in other coursework (option C), or even that there was a general perception among the graduate's peers that he often cheated (option D). However, the professor cannot introduce evidence of alleged cheating in a different class taught by another professor (option B) because it does not pertain to the specific statement made to the law firm about the entertainment law class. Therefore, option B is not admissible as evidence in support of the truth defense."
