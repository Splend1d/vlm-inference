The first few terms of the sequence can be calculated as follows:\n\n- First term: \\(a_1 = 1\\)\n- Second term: \\(a_2 = a_1 = 1\\) (sum of all previous terms, which is just itself since there's only one term before it)\n- Third term: \\(a_3 = a_1 + a_2 = 1 + 1 = 2\\)\n- Fourth term: \\(a_4 = a_1 + a_2 + a_3 = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4\\)\n- Fifth term: \\(a_5 = a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 = 1 + 1 + 2 + 4 = 8\\)\n\nFrom these initial calculations, we notice that each term is actually a power of 2, starting from \\(2^0\\). This pattern occurs because each new term is the sum of all previous terms, which themselves are powers of 2. Thus, each term is double the previous term.\n\nGiven this pattern, we need to find the smallest term in the sequence that exceeds 5000. We're looking for the smallest power of 2 greater than 5000.\n\nLet's test the options provided:\n\nA. 10240\n\nThis is \\(2^{13}\\) (\\(2^{13} = 8192\\)) but the number given is 10240, which is not a power of 2.\n\nB. 5001\n\nThis is not a power of 2.\n\nC. 5002\n\nThis is also not a power of 2.\n\nD. 8192\n\nThis is indeed a power of 2 (\\(2^{13}\\)). It's the smallest power of 2 greater than 5000.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **D. 8192**."
