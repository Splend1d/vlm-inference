In fact, one of the key features of VAR models is that they are atheoretical or agnostic about the underlying economic relationships. They are designed to capture the dynamic interrelationships among multiple time series without imposing strong theoretical priors.\n\n(ii) This statement is true. One of the main advantages of VAR models is that they can be used easily to produce time-series forecasts. Because the model is estimated using the observed data, it can generate forecasts for all variables in the system simultaneously.\n\n(iii) This statement is false. VAR models are not typically highly parsimonious. The number of parameters in a VAR model grows quickly with the number of lags and variables included in the system. This can lead to overfitting if the sample size is not large enough.\n\n(iv) This statement is true. OLS (Ordinary Least Squares) can indeed be applied separately to each equation in a reduced form VAR model. This is one of the reasons why VAR models are relatively easy to estimate compared to more complex structural models.\n  \nSo, the correct answer is A: (ii) and (iv) only."
