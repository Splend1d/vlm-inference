One morning the husband saw the brother, whom he mistakenly believed was the man. The husband walked toward the brother and said, \"I'm going to punch you in the face, you rat. \" The brother immediately realized that the husband had mistaken him for his brother. The brother had enough time to inform the husband of his mistake but didn't say anything. When the husband came closer, the brother punched him in the mouth. If the husband brings suit against the brother for battery, he should\n\nA. prevail, because the brother did not inform him of his mistake.\nB. prevail, because the husband's threat was accompanied by an overt act when the husband approached the brother.\nC. not prevail, because the husband was the initial aggressor.\nD. not prevail, because the brother used reasonable force given the threat.\n"

The brother's response was immediate and proportionate to the perceived threat, making it a case of reasonable self-defense. The fact that the husband mistook the brother for the man does not change the legality of the brother's actions in defending himself. Therefore, in a lawsuit for battery, the brother would likely not be held liable since his actions were justified under the circumstances."
