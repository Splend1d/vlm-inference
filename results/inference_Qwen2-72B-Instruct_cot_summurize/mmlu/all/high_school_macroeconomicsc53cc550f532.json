                    "text": "In the context of a Classical aggregate supply curve, which is vertical at the full employment level of output, a leftward shift in the aggregate supply (AS) curve would mean that, at any given price level, less output is supplied by firms due to higher costs or other factors reducing production capacity. When this occurs, the new equilibrium will occur where the aggregate demand (AD) curve intersects the new AS curve.\n\nGiven the vertical nature of the Classical aggregate supply curve, a leftward shift of the AS curve does not change the equilibrium price level because the curve remains vertical and the price level is determined by the intersection with the AD curve. However, the equilibrium quantity of output will decrease because the economy moves from its original point on the old AS curve to a new point on the leftward-shifted AS curve, which corresponds to a lower level of output.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. The equilibrium price level increases while the equilibrium quantity of output decreases.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that under classical economics, the price level is supposed to be perfectly flexible, and thus the aggregate supply curve is vertical. This means that a shift in the aggregate supply curve should not affect the price level, which is instead determined by the money supply and velocity of money. Therefore, a more accurate response based on strict classical theory would be that the price level remains unchanged, but since that option is not provided, option A is the closest approximation given the choices.\n\nBut for the sake of accuracy within classical theory, the correct interpretation would actually be:\n\nD. The equilibrium price level remains unchanged while the equilibrium quantity of output decreases. \n\nThis reflects the classical view that the economy always returns to full employment regardless of changes in the aggregate supply curve, and thus the price level is not affected by such shifts. However, since option D is not presented as an option indicating a decrease in output, option A is the best choice given among the provided options if we consider a scenario where prices can adjust in the short run."
