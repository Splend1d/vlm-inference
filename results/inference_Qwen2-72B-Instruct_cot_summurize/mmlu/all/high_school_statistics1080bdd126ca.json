The company plans to send out an e-mail survey to a sample of current customers with a link that gives participants a month of streaming service for free once the survey has been completed. They know that musical tastes vary by geographical region. Which of the following sample plans would produce the most representative sample of its customers?\n\nA. Choose all of the customers who joined in the last month.\nB. Make a list of all the customers who joined in the last 12 months and choose a random sample of customers on this list.\nC. From the list of all customers who joined in the last 12 months, classify customers by the state in which they live, then choose 10 customers from each state.\nD.

By selecting a proportional number of customers (3%) from each state, the sample should reflect the diversity of the customer base across different regions. This method is known as stratified sampling, where the population is divided into strata (in this case, states) and samples are taken from each stratum."
