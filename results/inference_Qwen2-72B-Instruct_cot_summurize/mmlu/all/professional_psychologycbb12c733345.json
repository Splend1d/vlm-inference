Interpretations of the data and limiting circumstances involving the test administration.\nC. Raw data, where this is appropriate in the psychologist\u2019s professional judgment.\n\nOption A is not necessarily true because it is not always feasible or necessary to have independent corroborating evidence for all data included in a psychological report. Option D is also not necessarily true because psychologists should report current findings and impressions based on the available data, not speculate about potential future pathologies without evidence. However, if there are indications of potential issues that require follow-up, these can be noted in the report as recommendations for further evaluation or monitoring. \n\nIt's important to note that ethical guidelines for psychological testing reports can vary depending on the jurisdiction and professional organization. The American Psychological Association (APA) provides ethical guidelines for psychologists in the United States, which emphasize accuracy, fairness, and respect for the welfare of those being assessed."
