Selection for larger female algae-eaters, bearing broods composed of more, and larger, young\n\nThis is because larger size would make these algae-eaters more visible to the pike-cichlid predators, thereby increasing their chance of being preyed upon. In response to predation pressure, we would expect natural selection to favor traits that reduce the likelihood of being detected or caught by predators, such as smaller size, better camouflage, or nocturnal activity patterns. Therefore, selection for larger female algae-eaters would be least likely under this scenario."
