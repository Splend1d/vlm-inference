She has a 2-year history of type 1 diabetes mellitus controlled with insulin. She had a normal Pap smear 3 months ago and saw her ophthalmologist 6 months ago. Her 67-year-old grandmother has breast cancer. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 57 kg (125 lb); BMI is 20 kg/m2 . Her hemoglobin A1c is 6.2%, and fingerstick blood glucose concentration is 118 mg/dL. Which of the following health maintenance recommendations is most appropriate at this time?\n\nA. Dietary modification for weight loss\nB. Human papillomavirus testing\nC. Mammography\nD. Influenza virus vaccine\n"

As it is October, which is during flu season, and she has a history of type 1 diabetes mellitus, which puts her at higher risk for complications from influenza, it is important that she receives the flu vaccine to protect her health.\n\nOptions A, B, and C are not as appropriate at this time:\nA. Dietary modification for weight loss: The patient's BMI is within the healthy range, so there is no indication for weight loss at this time.\nB. Human papillomavirus testing: She had a normal Pap smear 3 months ago, so additional HPV testing is not necessary at this time.\nC. Mammography: She is only 22 years old, and mammography is typically recommended starting at age 40 unless there are high-risk factors present. Although her grandmother has breast cancer, this does not automatically necessitate early screening for the patient."
