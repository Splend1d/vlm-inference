This negative evaluation can serve as a protective mechanism against acting on inappropriate impulses. Cognitive dissonance could also be involved as the person experiences discomfort due to the conflict between their arousal and their values or beliefs about what is appropriate behavior. However, the primary focus in this model for this scenario would be on the negative evaluation of the arousal."
