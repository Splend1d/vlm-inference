A permanent population: The entity must have a stable group of people living within its territory.\n2. A defined territory: The entity must have a specific area of land that is under its control.\n3. A government: The entity must have a functioning government that can exercise authority over its population and territory.\n4. A capacity to enter into foreign relations: The entity must be able to interact with other states and participate in international affairs.\n\nThese four criteria are widely accepted as the fundamental requirements for statehood in international law. Recognition by other states is not a requirement for statehood under the Montevideo Convention, although it may be necessary for practical purposes such as establishing diplomatic relations. Stable and indissoluble borders are also not mentioned as a criterion for statehood in the convention."
