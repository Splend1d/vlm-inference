Child\n\nThe loss of a child is often regarded as the most severe type of loss in the U.S., and it can frequently produce intense feelings of grief, guilt, and other complex emotions in parents and family members. This is because the death of a child goes against the natural order of life that people expect, where children are supposed to outlive their parents. The bereaved may feel guilt over things they did or didn't do, and there can be a profound sense of failure in protecting their offspring."
