Conditional programs, such as the Millennium Challenge, that require change before receipt of aid have been an effective way of disbursing US foreign aid to encourage change in target states. These programs often set specific goals and benchmarks that recipient countries must meet in order to receive aid, which can incentivize them to implement reforms and make progress in areas such as governance, economic policy, and human rights. This approach is based on the idea that aid should be used as a tool to promote development and good governance, rather than simply providing assistance without any strings attached. While there is no one-size-fits-all solution to the complex issue of foreign aid effectiveness, conditional programs have shown promise in promoting positive change in some cases. However, it's important to note that the success of these programs depends on various factors, including the political will of the recipient country, the quality of the program design, and the level of coordination among donors."
