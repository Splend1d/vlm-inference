He argued that modest living and independence from societal pressures were more likely to lead to a happy, healthy, and virtuous life than the constant pursuit of wealth and luxury. Therefore, according to Epicurean philosophy, the wealth required for a good life is not material wealth but rather the wealth of a peaceful mind, which is accessible to all and does not require great effort or resources to achieve."
