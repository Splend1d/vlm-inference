This may involve economic sanctions and withholding weaponry deals, which undermines the state's ability to pay or supply the army which increases the risk of army disaffection and possible coups.\nB. Weak states are threatened by the proliferation of small arms which can be used in a challenge to the authority of the state. Small and light weapons are purchasable through legal and illegal channels and are prevalent in regions with warlords, criminals and private militias.\nC. Weak states cannot remain isolated from processes of globalization. Increasingly porous borders lead to migration and immigration. In order to compete in a globalized market weak states look to secure financial-credit assistance or aid from international institutions. However, these processes undermine the hegemonic idea of the state and societal identity is blurred which makes it difficult for the state to sustain its ideological appeal.\nD. All of these options.\n"

Diplomatic pressures from powerful states, including economic sanctions and restrictions on arms deals, can destabilize weak states by undermining their economies and military capabilities.\n\nB. The proliferation of small arms can empower non-state actors such as warlords, criminals, and private militias, challenging the authority of the weak state and potentially leading to internal conflicts.\n\nC. Globalization can lead to increased migration and border permeability, blurring societal identities and making it harder for weak states to maintain control and ideological appeal. Additionally, seeking financial assistance from international institutions can come with conditions that further erode state sovereignty.\n\nAll of these factors can contribute to the fragility of weak states and pose significant external challenges to their stability and governance."
