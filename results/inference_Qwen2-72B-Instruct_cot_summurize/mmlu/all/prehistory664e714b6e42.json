If we consider the age of the universe to be approximately 13.8 billion years, and if we compress this timeline into a two-hour (120-minute) movie, humans and their direct ancestors represent only a tiny fraction of that history.\n\nGiven that Homo habilis, one of the earliest known members of the human family, appeared around 2.8 million years ago, we can calculate their appearance in the movie timeline as follows:\n\n- The entire movie represents 13.8 billion years.\n- The appearance of Homo habilis is 13.8 billion - 2.8 million = 13,799,997,200 years after the Big Bang.\n\nTo find out when Homo habilis appears in the movie, we need to calculate the proportion of the movie timeline they occupy:\n\\[ \\frac{13,799,997,200}{13,800,000,000} \\approx 0.999999725 \\]\n\nMultiplying this by the total duration of the movie (120 minutes) gives us the time at which Homo habilis appears:\n\\[ 120 \\times 0.999999725 \\approx 119.999967 \\]\n\nThis means Homo habilis appears approximately 119.999967 minutes into the movie, or during the final few seconds of the film. Therefore, the correct answer is D. during the final 3 seconds of the film. However, it's important to note that this calculation assumes a linear scaling of time throughout the movie, which may not necessarily be how the movie represents the timeline given the vast differences in time scales between the early universe and the later emergence of human life."
