In Scenario 1, taking a minor to a show featuring exotic dancers is inappropriate and potentially harmful to the child's well-being and development. In Scenario 2, going fishing for dolphins is also morally wrong because dolphins are protected marine mammals and it is illegal and unethical to hunt or harm them. However, if \"going fishing for dolphins\" was meant as a figure of speech or joke, then without further context, it might not be a literal wrongdoing, but it still could be seen as insensitive or inappropriate humor. Assuming the literal interpretation, both scenarios represent clear moral wrongs."
