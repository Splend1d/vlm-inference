But the payment of duties laid by an act of Parliament as regulations of commerce was never disputed. . . . An external tax is a duty laid on commodities imported; that duty is added to the first cost and other charges on the commodity, and, when it is offered for sale, makes a part of the price. If the people do not like it at that price, they refuse it; they are not obliged to pay it. But an internal tax is forced from the people without their consent if not laid by their own representatives. The Stamp Act says we shall have no commerce, make no exchange of property with each other, neither purchase nor grant, nor recover debts; we shall neither marry nor make our wills, unless we pay such and such sums; and thus it is intended to extort our money from us or ruin us by the consequence of refusing to pay it.\"\n\u2014Benjamin Franklin, Examination before Parliament, 1766\nPresident Jackson's policy was later altered by the\n\nA. Homestead Act of 1862.\nB. Immigration Act of 1921.\nC. Supreme Court decision in Plessy v. Ferguson.\nD. Dawes Act of 1887.\n"

                    "text": "The passage provided is from Benjamin Franklin's examination before Parliament in 1766, discussing the issues of taxation without representation and distinguishing between external and internal taxes. This context does not directly relate to any of the options given (Homestead Act of 1862, Immigration Act of 1921, Supreme Court decision in Plessy v. Ferguson, or Dawes Act of 1887), as those are all unrelated policies and events that occurred much later in history.\n\nHowever, since the question seems to be structured as a lead-in to asking about President Andrew Jackson's policies, none of the options provided actually pertain to altering President Jackson's policy. To clarify:\n\nA. The Homestead Act of 1862 was enacted under President Abraham Lincoln, allowing settlers to claim ownership of public land after improving it.\nB. The Immigration Act of 1921 was enacted under President Warren G. Harding, establishing quotas for immigration based on national origin.\nC. The Supreme Court decision in Plessy v. Ferguson (1896) upheld the constitutionality of racial segregation under the \"separate but equal\" doctrine.\nD. The Dawes Act of 1887 was enacted under President Grover Cleveland, aimed at assimilating Native Americans into American society by dividing communal tribal land into individual allotments.\n\nNone of these options are related to President Jackson's policies. However, if we were to consider an option that might have indirectly affected policies initiated during Jackson's presidency, the closest would be the Dawes Act of 1887 (option D), which dealt with Native American lands and attempted to dismantle the tribal system by allocating individual plots to Native Americans, which was a continuation of the Indian Removal policies that Jackson supported. Nonetheless, this is not a direct alteration of Jackson's policies but rather a continuation and expansion of them in a different historical context."
