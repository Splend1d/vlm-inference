People with NPD often exaggerate their achievements and talents, feel entitled to special treatment, take advantage of others, and have a strong desire for attention and admiration. They may also become angry or defensive when criticized or challenged. Brenda's behavior fits these characteristics, making NPD the most likely diagnosis among the options provided."
