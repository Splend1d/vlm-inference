                    "text": "To find the magnitude of the applied force, we can use the work-energy theorem, which states that the work done on an object is equal to the change in its kinetic energy.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the initial and final kinetic energies of the box.\nInitial kinetic energy (KEi) = 0.5 * m * vi^2 = 0.5 * 10 kg * (1 m/s)^2 = 5 J\nFinal kinetic energy (KEf) = 0.5 * m * vf^2 = 0.5 * 10 kg * (2 m/s)^2 = 20 J\n\nThe change in kinetic energy (\u0394KE) is KEf - KEi = 20 J - 5 J = 15 J\n\nThis change in kinetic energy is due to the work done by the force over the distance of 5 m. We can use the formula for work, W = F * d * cos(\u03b8), where \u03b8 is the angle between the force and displacement vectors. Since the force is applied in the direction of motion, \u03b8 = 0\u00b0, and cos(0\u00b0) = 1.\n\nSo, W = F * d = \u0394KE\nF = \u0394KE / d = 15 J / 5 m = 3 N\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. 3 N."
