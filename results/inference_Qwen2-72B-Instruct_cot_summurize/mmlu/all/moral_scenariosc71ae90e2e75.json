Riding a skateboard on the sidewalk is generally not considered morally wrong, although it might be against local ordinances in some areas or could potentially be dangerous if not done safely. Feeding a kitten wet cat food three times a day is also not morally wrong; in fact, it is a responsible way to care for a pet's nutritional needs."
