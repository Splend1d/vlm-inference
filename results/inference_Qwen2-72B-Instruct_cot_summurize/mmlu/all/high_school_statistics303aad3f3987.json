A distribution of all the values taken by a statistic from all possible samples of a given size\n\nA sampling distribution is the probability distribution of a statistic that is obtained from a large number of samples drawn from a specific population. It represents how the statistic (such as the mean, median, or standard deviation) would vary if you took many different samples of the same size from the same population and calculated the statistic for each sample."
