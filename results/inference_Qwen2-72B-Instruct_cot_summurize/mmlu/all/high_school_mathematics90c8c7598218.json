                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to understand how the product of the divisors of an integer $n$ relates to its prime factorization. Let's denote $n = p_1^{e_1} \\cdot p_2^{e_2} \\cdots p_k^{e_k}$ where $p_i$ are distinct prime numbers and $e_i$ are their respective exponents.\n\nThe product of all divisors of $n$ can be calculated by taking each prime $p_i$ to the power of the sum of all possible exponents from $0$ to $e_i$, multiplied across all primes. This sum for one prime $p_i$ is given by $\\frac{(e_i+1)(e_i+2)}{2}$, because you're essentially summing up the series $0 + 1 + 2 + \\ldots + e_i$. However, since we want the product of all divisors, we raise $p_i$ to this power and multiply it with similar expressions for other primes.\n\nIn general, if $n$ has $k$ prime factors (not necessarily distinct), then the product of all divisors of $n$ is:\n\\[P(n) = n^{\\frac{d(n)}{2}}\\]\nwhere $d(n)$ is the number of divisors of $n$. The formula for $d(n)$ is $(e_1+1)(e_2+1)\\cdots(e_k+1)$.\n\nGiven that the product of the divisors of $n$ is $n^6$, we have:\n\\[n^{\\frac{d(n)}{2}} = n^6\\]\n\\[d(n) = 12\\]\n\nSo, we need to find the smallest $n$ such that $d(n) = 12$. The possibilities for $d(n)$ come from the factors of 12: $(12, 1)$, $(6, 2)$, $(4, 3)$, and $(3, 4)$, $(2, 6)$, $(1, 12)$. Since $n > 1$, we ignore $(12, 1)$ and $(1, 12)$ as these imply $n$ being a prime raised to the 11th power or a single prime respectively, which won't yield the smallest $n$.\n\nLet's analyze the remaining options:\n\n- For $(6, 2)$, this implies $n = p_1^5 \\cdot p_2^1$ for some primes $p_1, p_2$. The smallest such $n$ would be $2^5 \\cdot 3^1 = 96$.\n- For $(4, 3)$, this implies $n = p_1^3 \\cdot p_2^2$ for some primes $p_1, p_2$. The smallest such $n$ would be $2^3 \\cdot 3^2 = 72$.\n- For $(3, 4)$, this implies $n = p_1^2 \\cdot p_2^3$ for some primes $p_1, p_2$. The smallest such $n$ would be $2^2 \\cdot 3^3 = 108$.\n- For $(2, 6)$, this implies $n = p_1 \\cdot p_2^5$ for some primes $p_1, p_2$. The smallest such $n$ would be $2^1 \\cdot 3^5 = 486$.\n\nNone of these match the given options. However, we missed an important case: $(2, 2, 3)$ which implies $n = p_1^1 \\cdot p_2^1 \\cdot p_3^2$. The smallest such $n$ would be $2^1 \\cdot 3^1 \\cdot 5^2 = 150$, but this isn't among the options either.\n\nLooking at the options provided, let's check them individually:\n\nA. $30 = 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5$. The number of divisors is $(1+1)(1+1)(1+1) = 8$. So, this doesn't fit our criteria.\n\nB. $64 = 2^6$. The number of divisors is $(6+1) = 7$. So, this doesn't fit our criteria.\n\nC. $2048 = 2^{11}$. The number of divisors is $(11+1) = 12$. This fits our criteria, and the product of its divisors would indeed be $n^6$.\n\nD. $60 = 2^2 \\cdot 3^1 \\cdot 5^1$. The number of divisors is $(2+1)(1+1)(1+1) = 12$. This also fits our criteria, and the product of its divisors would indeed be $n^6$.\n\nBetween C and D, option D ($60$) is smaller, making it the correct answer. Therefore, the smallest positive integer $n$ whose positive divisors have a product of $n^6$ is **D. 60**."
