Deception in an experiment may be considered ethically permissible if the scientific value of the study outweighs the potential harm caused by the deception and if there are no feasible alternative methods that could achieve the same results without using deception. Additionally, the deception should not significantly mislead participants, and they should be fully debriefed about the nature of the deception as soon as possible after the experiment is completed. Option B is incorrect because there is no specific time frame for debriefing participants about the deception used in an experiment. Option C is incorrect because withholding information about the purpose of the research can also be considered a form of deception. Option D is partially correct but does not capture the full criteria for ethical use of deception in research."
