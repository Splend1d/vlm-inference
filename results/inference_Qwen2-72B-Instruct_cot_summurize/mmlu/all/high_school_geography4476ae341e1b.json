Of the options given:\n\nA. 10 miles east of Pittsburgh - This is not an absolute location because it is a relative distance from another location rather than a precise set of coordinates.\n\nB. Washington - This is also not an absolute location because \"Washington\" could refer to multiple places (e.g., Washington, D.C., or various towns named Washington in different states). Without specifying the state or country, this is too ambiguous to be considered an absolute location.\n\nC. 3 degrees south - This is part of an absolute location but incomplete since it only provides one coordinate (latitude). An absolute location would require both latitude and longitude.\n\nD. 479 Elm Street, Muncie, Indiana - While this is a specific address and might seem like an absolute location, addresses are not universally consistent globally and can change over time. However, if you were to convert this address into latitude and longitude coordinates, then it would become an absolute location.\n\nGiven the choices provided, the closest thing to an absolute location without providing actual coordinates is option D, which is a specific street address. However, for something to truly be considered an absolute location, it should include latitude and longitude coordinates. If we assume that option D can be converted into such coordinates, then it could be considered the answer closest to an absolute location among the options."
