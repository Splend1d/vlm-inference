Can the defense attorney ask her on cross examination about her habit of feeding the pigeons? The defense knows that she was cited several times for illegally feeding the pigeons. Defense counsel tries to ask, \"You have a longtime habit of feeding the pigeons, don't you? You have in fact been ticketed several times for feeding pigeons, haven't you, and yet you persisted in doing it, isn't that so?\" Will the trial court likely allow the witness to be questioned on these matters?\n\nA. No, because the question has no probative value regarding the credibility of the witness or the guilt of the defendant.\nB. No, because a witness can never be asked about personal prior bad acts.\nC. Yes, because the statement indicates that the witness' attention was always focused on feeding the pigeons.\nD. Yes, because feeding pigeons in the park and persisting in it after being ticketed may show an antisocial trait of the witness.\n"

No, because the question has no probative value regarding the credibility of the witness or the guilt of the defendant.\n\nThe defense attorney's attempt to question the witness about her habit of feeding pigeons and receiving citations for it is not directly relevant to the case at hand, which is the witness's testimony regarding a murder. It does not bear on the witness's ability to perceive, remember, or recount the events of the crime, nor does it directly relate to the defendant's guilt or innocence. Therefore, it is unlikely that the court would allow such questioning as it does not have probative value in assessing the witness's credibility or the facts of the case."
