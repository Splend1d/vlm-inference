Aposomatic coloration\n\nAposomatic coloration, also known as warning coloration, is a type of animal coloration that serves to warn predators of a potential prey's unpalatability, toxicity, or danger. This coloration is often bright and conspicuous, making the animal easily visible but simultaneously advertising its defenses. Animals with chemical defenses, such as poison dart frogs, monarch butterflies, and many species of snakes, often exhibit aposomatic coloration."
