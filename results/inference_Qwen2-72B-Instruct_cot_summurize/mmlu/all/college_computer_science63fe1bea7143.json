Ethernets do not use circuit switching; they use packet switching, where data is sent in small chunks called packets. Circuit switching is used in traditional telephone networks where a dedicated path is established for the duration of the communication. In contrast, Ethernet uses a shared medium and employs carrier sense multiple access with collision detection (CSMA/CD) or carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) in newer standards like 802.11 (Wi-Fi) for managing access to the shared medium."
