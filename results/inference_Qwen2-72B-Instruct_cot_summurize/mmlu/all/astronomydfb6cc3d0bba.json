This slow rotation affects the dynamo effect that generates a planet's magnetic field. The dynamo effect requires a rotating, conductive fluid, which in the case of planets like Earth and Venus would be the molten metal in their cores. Earth's faster rotation helps maintain the convection currents in its liquid outer core, which in turn generate the planet's magnetic field. Venus's slow rotation means these convection currents are weaker, resulting in a much weaker or virtually non-existent magnetic field. However, recent studies suggest that Venus might still have a weak dynamo mechanism, but it is not strong enough to produce a significant global magnetic field. \n\nOption D (It does not have a metallic core) is incorrect because Venus does indeed have a metallic core, similar to Earth's. The difference lies in the way this core behaves due to the planet's slow rotation."
