Prior to the revolution, literacy rates were quite low among peasants, who made up the majority of Russia's population. The Soviet government made education for all citizens a priority, and this would have had the greatest impact on those with the lowest rates of literacy, namely the rural peasantry. This is evident from the steep increase in literacy rates after the Bolsheviks came to power in 1917. By 1955, literacy rates had reached almost 100%, indicating that even the most remote and underprivileged groups had been reached by the educational programs. \n\nOn the other hand, members of the Russian Orthodox clergy (B), the urban middle class (C), and officers in the armed forces (D) were more likely to already have higher levels of literacy prior to the revolution, so the increase in literacy rates would not have as significant an impact on these groups."
