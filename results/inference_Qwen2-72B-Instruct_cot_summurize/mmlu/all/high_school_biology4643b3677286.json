                    "text": "Hydrolysis is a chemical reaction in which water is used to break down molecules into smaller components. The process typically involves the splitting of a bond within a molecule by the addition of a hydrogen ion (H+) from water and a hydroxyl group (OH-) from water.\n\nLet's examine each option:\n\nA. Conversion of fats to fatty acids and glycerol: This is an example of hydrolysis because triglycerides (fats) are broken down by adding water, resulting in the release of fatty acids and glycerol.\nB. Conversion of proteins to amino acids: This is also an example of hydrolysis because peptide bonds in proteins are broken by the addition of water, resulting in the release of individual amino acids.\nC. Conversion of starch to simple sugars: This is another example of hydrolysis because the glycosidic bonds in starch are broken by the addition of water, resulting in the production of simple sugars like glucose.\nD. Conversion of pyruvic acid to acetyl CoA: This is NOT an example of hydrolysis. Pyruvic acid is converted to acetyl CoA through a series of enzymatic reactions that involve the removal of a carbon atom as CO2 and the transfer of the remaining two-carbon unit to coenzyme A. This process does not involve the addition of water to break a bond.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Conversion of pyruvic acid to acetyl CoA."
