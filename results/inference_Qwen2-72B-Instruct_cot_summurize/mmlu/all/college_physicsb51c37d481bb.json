At low temperatures, these electrons occupy quantum states up to a maximum energy level known as the Fermi energy. This means that even at absolute zero temperature, the electrons have significant kinetic energy due to their quantum mechanical nature. The electrons are said to form a degenerate Fermi gas because they are packed into a relatively small volume and their kinetic energies are much higher than what would be expected from classical thermodynamics at the same temperature.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while electrons do have different degrees of freedom compared to atoms, it does not directly explain why their kinetic energy is much higher than \\(kT\\).\n\nOption B could potentially apply in certain non-equilibrium situations, but under normal conditions, the electrons and the lattice are considered to be in thermal equilibrium.\n\nOption D is incorrect because, although electrons can reach relativistic speeds in some high-energy contexts, in typical metallic conductors, the electrons' velocities are still well within the non-relativistic regime."
