These are free-standing nude male statues that were common in the Archaic period of Ancient Greece (7th-6th centuries BCE). The female equivalent is known as Kore, which is typically clothed and has a less rigid pose. Caryatids (A) are sculpted female figures serving as architectural supports, Telamones (B) are similar but represent male figures, and Discoboloi (C) are statues of discus throwers, typically depicted in action."
