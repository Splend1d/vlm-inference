For an electron with charge \\(-e\\) (where \\(e\\) is the elementary charge), moving in a uniform magnetic field \\(\\vec{B}\\) directed into the page, the direction of the force can be determined using the right-hand rule. Since the electron has a negative charge, the force will be in the opposite direction to what the right-hand rule would indicate for a positive charge. This means the force will be directed towards the center of a circle if the electron is moving in a counterclockwise direction as viewed from above the plane of the page.\n\nGiven that the electron is moving upwards and into a magnetic field directed into the page, the force will cause it to move in a circular path. The direction of this path will be counterclockwise when viewed from above the plane of the page.\n\nThe radius \\(r\\) of the circular path can be found using the relation between the centripetal force and the magnetic force acting on the electron:\n\\[F_c = F_B\\]\n\\[\\frac{mv^2}{r} = qvB\\]\n\nSolving for \\(r\\), we get:\n\\[r = \\frac{mv}{qB}\\]\n\nSubstituting \\(-e\\) for \\(q\\) (since the electron has a charge of \\(-e\\)):\n\\[r = \\frac{mv}{-eB}\\]\n\nHowever, since we usually express equations with positive quantities for variables like radius, we can write:\n\\[r = \\frac{mv}{eB}\\]\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\nB.
