It shall be unlawful for any person to engage in picketing before or about the residence of an individual. Nothing herein shall be deemed to prohibit the holding of a meeting or assembly on any premises used for the discussion of subjects of general public interest. \"A group of teachers who work for a public school inside of the city were angry that the principal decreased their salaries. The teachers reacted by picketing on the lawn of the principal's privately owned house. The teachers were charged with violating Section 202 of the ordinance. The teachers have filed suit attacking the constitutionality of Section 202. The court will most likely declare Section 202\n\nA. constitutional, as a permissible time, place, and manner regulation.\nB. constitutional, as a valid exercise of a state's reserved powers under the Tenth Amendment.\nC. unconstitutional, as discriminatory on its face.\nD. unconstitutional, as vague and overbroad.\n"

The exception for meetings or assemblies on premises used for the discussion of subjects of general public interest suggests that the ordinance aims to balance free speech rights with the need to maintain order and protect residential tranquility. This type of regulation has been upheld by courts when they are content-neutral and narrowly tailored to serve a significant government interest, without unnecessarily infringing upon First Amendment rights."
