At trial, the mother is then called to testify as to her conversation with the man at the hospital where her son was rushed immediately following the accident. According to the mother, the man told her, \"Don't worry, my insurance company will pay for all of your son's medical expenses. \"If offered into evidence, the court will most likely rule that the mother's statement is\n\nA. admissible, on the issue of the defendant's negligence.\nB. admissible, to show that the defendant is able to pay for the medical expenses.\nC. inadmissible, because the testimony was highly prejudicial.\nD. admissible, only to prove ownership or control of the motorcycle.\n"

                    "text": "The statement made by the man to the child's mother about his insurance covering the medical expenses is not an admission of guilt or negligence regarding the accident itself. It is more likely to be considered an expression of willingness to fulfill financial obligations, which is separate from admitting legal liability for the accident. Therefore, it would not be admissible to prove negligence (Option A) or to prove ownership or control of the motorcycle (Option D).\n\nOption B suggests that the statement could be used to show that the defendant is able to pay for the medical expenses. While this might be true, it is not typically relevant to the issues being decided in a negligence case.\n\nOption C suggests that the statement might be inadmissible because it is highly prejudicial. This could be a valid reason for exclusion if the statement has no probative value other than to prejudice the jury against the defendant, but we need to consider the specific rules of evidence to determine its admissibility.\n\nAccording to Federal Rules of Evidence Rule 409, statements made in compromise negotiations are generally inadmissible to prove liability for or invalidity of the claim or its amount. The statement \"Don't worry, my insurance company will pay for all of your son's medical expenses\" can be seen as part of such negotiations, and thus, the court will most likely rule that the mother's statement is:\n\nC. inadmissible, because the testimony was highly prejudicial.\n\nHowever, the reasoning provided here should be understood in the context of Rule 409 and similar rules regarding the admissibility of statements made during compromise negotiations. This rule aims to encourage parties to settle disputes without fear that their offers will later be used against them in court."
