In this scenario, option D is true:\n\nD. Further increases in aggregate demand will not lower the unemployment rate but will create inflation.\n\nAt full employment, all available labor and capital are being used efficiently. If the economy is operating beyond this point, additional demand will not lead to more production because there are no idle resources to use. Instead, the extra demand will push up prices, leading to inflation, as businesses do not have the capacity to increase output proportionally to meet the higher demand without increasing prices.\n\nOptions A and B are incorrect because they contradict standard economic theory. The short-run aggregate supply (SRAS) curve is not horizontal; instead, it slopes upward, indicating that as the price level increases, the quantity of goods and services supplied also increases. Further increases in aggregate demand while the economy is already beyond full employment will typically result in higher, not lower, price levels.\n\nOption C could be true under certain circumstances, such as when prices are sticky in the short run. However, it does not directly address the situation where the economy is operating beyond full employment. It is more of a general statement about how a decrease in aggregate demand might affect the price level under sticky price conditions, which can occur whether or not the economy is at full employment."
