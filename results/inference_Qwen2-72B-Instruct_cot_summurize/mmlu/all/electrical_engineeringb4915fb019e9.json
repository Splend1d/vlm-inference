Enable the data bus to be used as low order address bus\n\nThe ALE (Address Latch Enable) signal in the Intel 8085A microprocessor is used to separate the address and data signals on the common bus. When ALE goes high, it indicates that the address information is available on the bus, and an external latch can capture this address information. This allows the lower 8 bits of the address (A0-A7) to be multiplexed on the same lines as the data bus (D0-D7). When ALE goes low, the data bus is then free to carry actual data for read/write operations."
