The bartender served the drink, even though the accountant looked and acted as though he was already very intoxicated. The accountant soon had consumed five more cocktails, which the bartender served, despite the accountant's obviously and unmistakably drunken condition. After finishing his sixth drink in the bar, the accountant said good night to the bartender, staggered out of the bar, got into his car, and drove away. After weaving back and forth across the road for several blocks, the accountant crashed his car into a pedestrian who was walking on the sidewalk next to the road. The pedestrian suffered serious injuries to his back and legs. The bartender's act of serving drinks to the accountant would most likely be viewed as the\n\nA. proximate cause of the pedestrian's injuries.\nB. superseding cause of the pedestrian's injuries.\nC. direct cause of the pedestrian's injuries.\nD. intervening cause of the pedestrian's injuries.\n"

However, the question of whether it is also a proximate cause could be subject to legal interpretation and the specific laws of the jurisdiction where the incident occurred.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, there are dram shop laws that hold bars and bartenders liable for serving alcohol to visibly intoxicated patrons if those patrons subsequently cause harm to themselves or others. Under such laws, the bartender's actions could be seen as contributing to the harm caused by the accountant's decision to drive while intoxicated.\n\nHowever, the direct cause of the pedestrian's injuries would be the accountant's decision to drive while under the influence of alcohol and his subsequent negligent driving. The bartender's actions contributed to the accountant's level of intoxication but did not directly cause the accident.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most appropriate answer to the question posed would be:\n\nD. intervening cause of the pedestrian's injuries.\n\nThis acknowledges that the bartender's actions played a role in the chain of events leading to the pedestrian's injuries but were not the immediate cause of the accident itself. The accountant's decision to drive while intoxicated was the direct cause of the injuries. Whether the bartender's actions are considered a proximate cause would depend on the specific legal context and how the law defines proximate cause in cases involving dram shop liability."
