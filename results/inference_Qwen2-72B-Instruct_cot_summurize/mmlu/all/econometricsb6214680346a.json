The model is much harder to estimate than a standard regression model with a continuous dependent variable\n\nIn fact, the LPM is easier to estimate than many other models because it can be estimated using ordinary least squares (OLS), which is a straightforward method for estimating regression models. The LPM's simplicity makes it computationally less demanding compared to models like logistic regression, which require more complex estimation procedures such as maximum likelihood.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that while the LPM may be easier to estimate, it has several drawbacks, including those mentioned in the other statements. For instance, A is true because the LPM does not inherently constrain the predicted probabilities to lie within the [0,1] interval. B is also true since the probabilities may indeed be truncated at 0 and 1, leading to issues with interpretation and prediction. C is true because the error terms in an LPM are typically heteroscedastic and not normally distributed, violating assumptions of OLS regression."
