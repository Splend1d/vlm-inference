These party activists are more likely to be ideological purists and may prioritize policy positions over electability, leading to the nomination of candidates who are further to the right than the average Republican voter. This is one reason why Republican candidates who tend to be more successful in the primaries are often more conservative than rank-and-file Republicans."
