This style of leadership is directive and focuses on defining roles and tasks, setting objectives, and providing detailed instructions to subordinates. It is particularly effective when the tasks or job roles are ambiguous or complex, as it helps clarify expectations and reduces uncertainty.\n\nHere's how each option relates to different leadership styles within the Path-Goal Theory:\n\nA. Establishes supportive relationships with subordinates - This describes the \"Supportive Leadership\" style, which involves being friendly, approachable, and considerate towards subordinates' personal needs and well-being.\n\nB. Includes subordinates in decision-making - This aligns with the \"Participative Leadership\" style, which encourages team members to participate in decision-making processes, fostering a sense of ownership and engagement.\n\nC. Provides specific guidelines and clear rules and procedures - This is the \"Instrumental Leadership\" style, which focuses on providing structure, direction, and clarity in task execution.\n\nD. Sets challenging goals and encourages higher levels of performance - This describes the \"Achievement-Oriented Leadership\" style, where leaders set high standards and motivate their team to achieve them by offering support and constructive feedback."
