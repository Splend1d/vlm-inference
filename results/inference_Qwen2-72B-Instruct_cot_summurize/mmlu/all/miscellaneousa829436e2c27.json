Living things can sense changes in their environment and respond accordingly, whether it's moving towards food, away from danger, or adjusting to changes in temperature or light. This ability is essential for survival and adaptation. While some living organisms can move (A), perform photosynthesis (C), or maintain a constant internal temperature (D), not all can do so. For example, plants don't move from place to place but they do detect and respond to environmental changes."
