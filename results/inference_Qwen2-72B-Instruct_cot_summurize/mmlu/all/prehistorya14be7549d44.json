While Neandertal canines were indeed larger than those of modern humans, suggesting a diet that included more meat, it doesn't mean they relied solely on meat. Neandertals also consumed plant-based foods.\n\nB. This statement is not direct evidence of hunting. Stone tool cut marks on animal bones could indicate scavenging or butchering of carcasses, rather than hunting.\n\nC. The presence of large animal bones in caves where Neandertals lived does suggest that they hunted these animals, as these species would not have been easy to scavenge regularly.\n\nTherefore, the strongest evidence that Neandertals were hunters comes from the combination of both C (the presence of large animal bones in Neandertal sites) and the understanding that their diet included significant amounts of meat, which likely came from hunting activities. However, it's important to note that Neandertals were also capable of scavenging and gathering food resources."
