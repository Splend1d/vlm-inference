In its advocacy of global political institutions, the Treaty of Westphalia defined state sovereignty as being subjective to the behaviour of the political or ruling elite in that state, prioritizing human welfare over arbitrary values of sovereignty and thus legitimising humanitarian intervention where necessary.\nB. Theories of Westphalian sovereignty decree that principles of non-intervention are paramount to achieving security; this has been extended into the contemporary global security environment in which international bodies such as the UN condemn humanitarian intervention, regarding it as detrimental to state-centric security.\nC. State sovereignty and principles of non-interference that underpin the Westphalian approach can be disregarded, provided that there is a consensus amongst international actors that human life within the state is at risk, and where that risk is from the actions of the state itself.\nD. The international society is governed by norms of Westphalian sovereignty that advocate non-intervention and the respect of state sovereignty as a means of achieving security. These norms are enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, which bans the use of force between states except in self-defence or when authorized by the UN.\n"

State sovereignty and principles of non-interference that underpin the Westphalian approach can be disregarded, provided that there is a consensus amongst international actors that human life within the state is at risk, and where that risk is from the actions of the state itself. This reflects the evolution of the concept of sovereignty from the traditional Westphalian model to the Responsibility to Protect (R2P) doctrine, which holds that the international community has a responsibility to intervene when a state is unable or unwilling to protect its own citizens from mass atrocities. This does not mean that the Westphalian model is completely discarded, but rather that it has been adapted to include considerations of human rights and humanitarian concerns. Options A and B are incorrect because they misrepresent the Westphalian model and its relationship to humanitarian intervention. Option D is partially correct but does not fully capture the nuances of the relationship between Westphalian sovereignty and humanitarian intervention."
