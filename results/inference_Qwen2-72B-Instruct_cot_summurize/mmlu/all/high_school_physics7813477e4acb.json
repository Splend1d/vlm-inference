                    "text": "First, let's find the voltage of the battery. We can use the formula Q = CV, where Q is the charge, C is the capacitance, and V is the voltage.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we know that when the 2 \u03bcF capacitor is fully charged, it stores 600 \u03bcC of charge. Thus,\n\nQ = CV\n\n600 \u03bcC = (2 \u03bcF) * V\n\nSolving for V gives us:\n\nV = 600 \u03bcC / 2 \u03bcF = 300 V\n\nNext, we need to find the equivalent capacitance of the three 18 \u03bcF capacitors in series. The formula for the equivalent capacitance (C_eq) of capacitors in series is:\n\n1/C_eq = 1/C_1 + 1/C_2 + ... + 1/C_n\n\nIn this case, n = 3, and all the capacitors have the same value of 18 \u03bcF. So,\n\n1/C_eq = 1/18 \u03bcF + 1/18 \u03bcF + 1/18 \u03bcF\n\n1/C_eq = 3/(18 \u03bcF)\n\nC_eq = 18 \u03bcF / 3 = 6 \u03bcF\n\nNow, we can find the charge stored on each of the capacitors using the formula Q = CV again. Since the capacitors are in series, they will all have the same voltage across them as the battery, which is 300 V. Thus,\n\nQ = C * V\n\nQ = (18 \u03bcF) * 300 V = 5400 \u03bcC\n\nHowever, this is the total charge stored on all three capacitors combined. Since the capacitors are in series, the charge stored on each capacitor must be the same. Therefore, the charge stored on each capacitor is:\n\nQ = 5400 \u03bcC / 3 = 1800 \u03bcC\n\nThe answer is D. 1800 \u03bcC."
