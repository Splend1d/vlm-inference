Chicks from cliff nests must tumble down the cliff to get to the ocean, and many are killed by the fall. Which of the following is most consistent with the hypothesis that cliff nesting is adaptive in this goose species?\n\nA. Many more geese nest on the beaches than on the cliffs.\nB. Cliff-side nesting confers a higher fitness than does beach nesting.\nC. Chicks from cliff nests instinctively step off the cliffs at the appropriate time.\nD. More chicks survive the fall from the cliffs than are killed.\n"

Cliff-side nesting confers a higher fitness than does beach nesting.\n\nFor cliff nesting to be considered an adaptive trait, it must provide some advantage or benefit to the geese that outweighs the disadvantages (such as chicks being killed during the fall). If cliff-side nesting offers greater protection from predators, access to better food sources, or other benefits that result in a higher overall fitness for the adults (more successful breeding, longer life, etc.), then it can be seen as an adaptive strategy despite the risks to the chicks. This means that, on average, geese nesting on cliffs have more surviving offspring than those nesting on beaches, even accounting for the losses during the fall."
