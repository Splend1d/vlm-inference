                    "text": "In 1973, a woman was the actual and record owner of 20 acres of certain undeveloped timberland. In September 1973, the woman mortgaged the 20 acres of timberland to the bank by a mortgage deed (in the traditional form of a conveyance in fee simple subject to a condition subsequent), which was not recorded until January 1974. The mortgage deed contained the following clause immediately after the legal description of the 20 acres of timberland:\"Together with all the real property now owned by (the woman) or which shall be owned by (the woman) during the continuance of the indebtedness secured by this mortgage. \" This mortgage was given, as the recorded instrument revealed, to secure a note for $100,000 repayable over a 40-year term. In March 2004, the woman, using money loaned by a finance company, purchased a 50-acre mountainous estate situated outside of a major city. This deed was recorded immediately. In April 2004, the woman executed and delivered to the finance company a mortgage to secure its loan. This mortgage was promptly and duly recorded. The finance company had no actual notice of the prior mortgage to the bank. In February 2007, the woman defaulted on both mortgages. The bank then initiated foreclosure proceedings against the woman and the finance company as joint defendants. In its foreclosure action, the bank averred that its mortgage was a first mortgage on both the 20 acres of timberland and the 50-acre estate. The finance company filed a cross-complaint, alleging that its mortgage was a first mortgage on the 50-acre estate and praying for foreclosure on that parcel of property. In order to decide this case in favor of the bank, the court does not need to resolve which of the following issues?\n\nA. Whether the finance company is charged with record notice of the bank's mortgage.\nB. Whether the quoted clause in the mortgage instrument to the 20 acres of timberland covers the 50-acre estate.\nC. Whether the finance company's mortgage is a purchase money mortgage.\nD. Whether the finance company can rely on the doctrine of implied purchase money liens.\n"

                    "text": "In order to decide this case in favor of the bank, the court does not need to resolve issue C: Whether the finance company's mortgage is a purchase money mortgage.\n\nThe priority of the bank's claim over the finance company's claim would typically depend on whether the finance company had record notice of the bank's prior mortgage and whether the quoted clause in the bank's mortgage instrument covered the subsequently acquired 50-acre estate. If the bank's mortgage includes a dragnet clause that covers future acquisitions and if the finance company did not have record notice of the bank's mortgage when it made its loan, the bank's mortgage would likely take priority over the finance company's mortgage on the 50-acre estate.\n\nHowever, the question asks which issue the court does not need to resolve in order to decide in favor of the bank. Since the bank's claim to priority is based on its prior mortgage and the dragnet clause, and assuming the finance company did not have record notice, the bank's priority would not hinge on whether the finance company's mortgage was a purchase money mortgage (issue C). A purchase money mortgage typically has priority over other liens on the same property, but this would only be relevant if the finance company were seeking priority over an unrelated lien. In this scenario, the bank's priority is established through its earlier and broader mortgage, not by the nature of the finance company's mortgage.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Whether the finance company's mortgage is a purchase money mortgage."
