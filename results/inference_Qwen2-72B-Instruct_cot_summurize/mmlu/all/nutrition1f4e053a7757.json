Dietary starch is a potent stimulator of small intestinal motility because it causes insulin release from the pancreas\n\nWhile dietary starch can indeed influence small intestinal motility, this effect is not primarily due to insulin release. Insulin is mainly involved in regulating glucose metabolism and does not have a direct role in stimulating small intestinal motility. Small intestinal motility is more directly influenced by hormones such as cholecystokinin (CCK) and gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP), which are released in response to the presence of nutrients in the small intestine. These hormones help regulate the movement of food through the digestive tract, not by causing insulin release but by interacting with the enteric nervous system and smooth muscle cells of the gut."
