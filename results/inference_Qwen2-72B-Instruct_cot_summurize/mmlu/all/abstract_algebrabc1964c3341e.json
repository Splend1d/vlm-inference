Consider a non-Abelian group \\(G\\) with a normal subgroup \\(N\\). The factor group (or quotient group) \\(G/N\\) can be Abelian even if \\(G\\) itself is not. A classic example is the symmetric group \\(S_3\\) (which is non-Abelian) and its subgroup \\(A_3\\) (the alternating group on 3 elements), which is normal in \\(S_3\\). The factor group \\(S_3 / A_3\\) is isomorphic to \\(\\mathbb{Z}_2\\), which is Abelian. Therefore, the first statement is **False**.\n\n**Statement 2**: \"If \\(K\\) is a normal subgroup of \\(H\\) and \\(H\\) is a normal subgroup of \\(G\\), then \\(K\\) is a normal subgroup of \\(G\\).\"\n\nThis statement is also false. For \\(K\\) to be a normal subgroup of \\(G\\), it must be true that for every element \\(g \\in G\\) and every element \\(k \\in K\\), the conjugate \\(gkg^{-1}\\) must be in \\(K\\). However, just because \\(K\\) is normal in \\(H\\) and \\(H\\) is normal in \\(G\\), it does not necessarily follow that \\(K\\) is normal in \\(G\\). A counterexample would involve groups where the condition fails to hold for elements from \\(G\\) that are not in \\(H\\).\n\nTherefore, both statements are false, leading to answer choice:\n\n**B. False, False**"
