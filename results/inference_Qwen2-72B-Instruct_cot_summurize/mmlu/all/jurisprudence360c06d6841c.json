Analytical\n\nThe Analytical School of jurisprudence, also known as analytical legal positivism, asserts that the law is a system of rules and principles that can be analyzed logically without reference to moral or ethical considerations. This school focuses on the structure and language of legal systems and argues that the validity of laws can be determined through logical analysis, independent of their content or purpose."
