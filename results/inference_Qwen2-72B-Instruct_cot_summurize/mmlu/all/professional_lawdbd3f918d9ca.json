The squatters did not ask permission, and the company did not feel it was an urgent problem. The squatters used a small lake on the property for bathing and drinking water. Within a few days, two squatters died from what was later revealed to be highly polluted water coming from the company's waste discharges. The company knew that it had a waste discharge problem. The estates of the two decedents sued the company. Will they likely prevail on their tort claim despite the company's defense that the decedents were trespassers?\n\nA. Yes, because even though they trespassed, the owner had a duty to warn because it knew that they were in danger.\nB. Yes, because the owner was strictly liable for any injuries caused by the hazardous condition of the water in the lake.\nC. No, because owner owes no duty to trespassers except if it acts with willful or wanton disregard.\nD. No, because an owner of land never has to worry about protecting the safety of trespassers.\n"

Yes, because the owner was strictly liable for any injuries caused by the hazardous condition of the water in the lake.\n\nIn this scenario, the chemical manufacturer is likely to be held strictly liable for the deaths of the two squatters due to the pollution in the lake. Strict liability applies when a defendant engages in an abnormally dangerous activity, such as discharging hazardous chemicals into the environment, and does not require the plaintiff to prove negligence. The fact that the decedents were trespassers does not absolve the company of its responsibility for the consequences of its actions in this case."
