The mall has a Social Security Office and the real estate is owned by the state. The grocery store pays rent to the state. Any type of picketers are prevented from entering the mall to picket inside by the owners of the mall, who also pay rent to the state for the land, and there is no outside entrance of the store at the mall where the picketers could strike. If the picketers go before the court to claim violations of First and Fourteenth Amendment rights, will state action likely be found against the store and the mall owners?\n\nA. No, under the mantle of authority test there are not enough connections between the state and the private actions of the mall and the store.\nB. No, because a private actor can never be held liable in a constitutional rights claim that requires state action.\nC. Yes, because the equal protection balancing test shows that there is state action in renting the property to private actors who are discriminating.\nD. Yes, because First Amendment violations require strict scrutiny, and here the connection between the state and the mall cloaks the mall and store with state action status.\n"

No, under the mantle of authority test there are not enough connections between the state and the private actions of the mall and the store.\n\nState action doctrine requires that the action complained of be fairly attributable to the state. The \"mantle of authority\" test is one of several tests used to determine whether private conduct can be attributed to the state. In this case, while the state owns the real estate and rents it to the mall and grocery store, the actions taken to prevent picketing are those of the private mall owners and grocery store. The state's role as landlord does not necessarily mean that its authority was used to direct or encourage the private parties to infringe on constitutional rights. Without more substantial evidence that the state was involved in or endorsed the decision to prevent picketing, state action may not be found. However, it's important to note that courts might apply different tests or considerations, and the outcome could vary based on the specific circumstances and legal arguments presented."
