Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation:\nScenario 1: The statement \"I sometimes try to tell the truth, unless it gets me in trouble\" might not be an ideal ethical stance, but it is not inherently morally wrong for someone to admit they prioritize self-preservation over honesty in certain situations. This is a common human behavior and while not commendable, it is not necessarily considered wrong by ordinary moral standards.\nScenario 2: Kissing one's girlfriend at a magic show is not generally considered morally wrong. It is a normal expression of affection within a relationship, assuming that both parties are comfortable with public displays of affection."
