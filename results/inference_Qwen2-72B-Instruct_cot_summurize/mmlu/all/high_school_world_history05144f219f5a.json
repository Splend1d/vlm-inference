When the gods performed a sacrifice with the offering Purusa, spring was its clarified butter, summer the kindling, autumn the oblation.\nIt was Purusa, born in the beginning, which they sprinkled on the sacred grass as a sacrifice. It made the beasts of the air, the forest and the village. From that sacrifice completely offered, the mantras [Rig Veda] and the songs [Samaveda] were born. The sacrificial formulae [Yajurveda] were born from it. From it the horses were born and all that have cutting teeth in both jaws. The cows were born from it, also. From it were born goats and sheep.\nWhen they divided Purusa, how many ways did they apportion him? What was his mouth? What were his arms? What were his thighs, his feet declared to be? His mouth was the Brahman, his arms were the Rajanaya [Ksatriya], his thighs the Vaisya; from his feet the Sudra was born. Thus, they fashioned the worlds. The gods sacrificed with the sacrifice to the sacrifice. These were the first rites.\n\u2014Hymns excerpted and adapted from the Rig Veda, oldest surviving literary work, India, 1500\u20131000 BCE\nWhich element of the Hindu religion can this passage be used to explain?\n\nA. The only requirement for salvation being faith\nB. The importance of environmental stewardship\nC. The importance of sacrifice to the gods\nD. The emphasis on karma, or right actions, to achieve enlightenment\n"

The importance of sacrifice to the gods\n\nThis hymn describes a cosmic sacrifice involving the primordial being Purusa, from whose body the world and social order were created. It highlights the significance of ritual sacrifices in Vedic religion, which is a foundational aspect of Hinduism. The text also outlines the origins of the four varnas (social classes) from different parts of Purusa's body, illustrating the divine justification for the caste system, which is another important element of Hindu society. However, the primary focus of the passage is on the sacrificial ritual and its cosmological implications."
