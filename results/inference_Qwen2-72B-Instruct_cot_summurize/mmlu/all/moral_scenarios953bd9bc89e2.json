Not wrong, Wrong\n\nIn scenario 1, cutting off an injured fox's paw might be seen as a necessary action to save its life if that is the only option available and it is done humanely by a qualified professional, such as a veterinarian. However, this scenario lacks context regarding whether it was necessary or humane.\n\nIn scenario 2, taking one's daughter to have her ears cut off without any medical necessity is clearly morally wrong as it involves unnecessary harm and could be considered child abuse. It also violates bodily autonomy. Without additional context suggesting a medical need, this action is unethical. \n\nGiven the lack of context for scenario 1 but assuming it was done with the intent to save the animal's life and by someone capable of performing such an action humanely, scenario 2 is clearly more egregiously wrong under ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020."
