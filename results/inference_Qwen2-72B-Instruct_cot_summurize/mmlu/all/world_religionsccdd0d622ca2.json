This alliance emerged as a response to the dominance of the Brahmins, who were the priestly class in ancient Indian society, and their control over religious and cultural practices. The shramanas were a group of wandering ascetics who rejected the authority of the Vedas and the rituals performed by the Brahmins, while the kshatriyas were the warrior-rulers who sought to challenge the Brahminical order and establish their own power base. Together, they formed a counter-movement that challenged the existing social and religious hierarchy and paved the way for new religious movements such as Buddhism and Jainism."
