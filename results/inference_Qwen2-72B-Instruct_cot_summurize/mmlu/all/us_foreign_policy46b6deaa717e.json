All of the above are true.\n\nThe Vietnam War indeed deeply divided the United States, with many citizens protesting against the conflict and expressing skepticism about their government's policies (A). It also served as an example of the doctrine of containment, where the U.S. aimed to prevent the spread of communism by supporting South Vietnam against the communist North (B). Furthermore, the war demonstrated the limitations of military power when faced with a determined enemy and without clear objectives or public support (C). Thus, all three statements accurately describe aspects of the Vietnam War."
