His pulse is 120/min, respirations are 28/min, and blood pressure is 70/40 mm Hg. Breath sounds are normal on the right and decreased on the left. Abdominal examination shows an entrance wound in the left upper quadrant at the midclavicular line below the left costal margin. There is an exit wound laterally in the left axillary line at the 4th rib. Intravenous fluid resuscitation is begun. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?\n\nA. CT scan of the chest\nB. Intubation and mechanical ventilation\nC. Peritoneal lavage\nD. Left tube thoracostomy\n"

The presence of an entrance and exit wound also indicates that the bullet has traversed through the body, potentially damaging vital organs.\n\nGiven these circumstances, the most appropriate next step in management would be to stabilize the airway and breathing if necessary, but the immediate concern here seems to be the potential for ongoing abdominal hemorrhage. However, since there is also mention of decreased breath sounds on the left side, which could indicate a hemothorax or pneumothorax (blood or air in the pleural space), it is critical to address this issue as well.\n\nBetween the options given:\n- A CT scan of the chest might be informative, but it is not the immediate life-saving intervention needed.\n- B Intubation and mechanical ventilation might be necessary if the patient's respiratory status deteriorates, but it does not address the potential sources of bleeding.\n- C Peritoneal lavage was a diagnostic tool used in the past to determine if surgery was necessary based on the return from the lavage. It is no longer considered a standard of care in the initial management of penetrating abdominal trauma.\n- D Left tube thoracostomy is indicated for suspected hemothorax or pneumothorax, which can rapidly compromise the patient's respiratory function and is a quick procedure that can be done at the bedside to alleviate these conditions.\n\nConsidering the immediate threat to the patient's life, the most appropriate next step would be:\n\n**D. Left tube thoracostomy**\n\nThis will address the potential compromise of the patient's respiratory function due to the decreased breath sounds on the left side. After securing the airway and addressing any respiratory issues, further steps such as surgical exploration to control intra-abdominal bleeding would be necessary."
