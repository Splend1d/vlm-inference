A national election recalling an unpopular judge\n\nThe United States does not have a recall process for federal judges, who are appointed for life under Article III of the Constitution. Federal judges can only be removed from office through impeachment by the House of Representatives and conviction by the Senate. Therefore, a national election cannot limit the influence of the federal courts or remove a judge."
