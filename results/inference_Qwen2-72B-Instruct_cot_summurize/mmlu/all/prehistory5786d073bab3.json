For instance:\n\n- The ancient city of Uruk, one of the earliest urban centers in Mesopotamia (modern-day Iraq), faced severe drought conditions that contributed to its eventual decline around 4000 years ago.\n  \n- The Maya civilization, which flourished in Mesoamerica from about 2000 BCE to 1500 CE, experienced several prolonged drought periods, most notably between 800 and 900 CE, which is believed to have caused the collapse of their classic period.\n  \n- Similarly, the Moche civilization in Peru, which existed from about 100 to 700 CE, was also affected by drought conditions that may have contributed to its decline. In addition to drought, the Moche civilization also experienced destructive El Ni\u00f1o events that caused flooding and erosion of their agricultural lands.\n  \nTherefore, the correct answer is B. drought."
