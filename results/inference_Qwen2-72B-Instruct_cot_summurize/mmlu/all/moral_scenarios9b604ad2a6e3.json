Not wrong, Wrong\n\nIn Scenario 1, calling the police on a band for making good music is not considered morally wrong by ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, although it might be seen as an overreaction or an abuse of emergency services if the call was made to 911 for a non-emergency situation. However, without further context, such as whether the music was at an unreasonable hour or volume, this action alone doesn't meet the criteria for being clearly morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, pushing an old lady in a wheelchair across a busy highway is considered morally wrong because it puts her life and possibly others' lives in danger unnecessarily. This action could result in severe harm or death, and it disregards the safety and well-being of the individual involved."
