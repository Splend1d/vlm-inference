Individual organisms do not evolve during their lifetimes; rather, it is the frequency of particular alleles (variants of genes) within a population that changes due to processes such as mutation, natural selection, genetic drift, and gene flow. These changes can lead to adaptations and, over long periods, to speciation. Thus, the population is considered the evolutionary unit because it is the aggregate of all the alleles present in all the individuals that undergoes change over generations."
