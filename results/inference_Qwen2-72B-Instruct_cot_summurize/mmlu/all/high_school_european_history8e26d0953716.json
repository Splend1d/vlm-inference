If anyone habitually living at Court absented himself he insisted on knowing the reason; those who came there only for flying visits had also to give a satisfactory explanation; anyone who seldom or never appeared there was certain to incur his displeasure. If asked to bestow a favor on such persons he would reply haughtily: \"I do not know him\"; of such as rarely presented themselves he would say, \"He is a man I never see\"; and from these judgments there was no appeal.\nNo one understood better than Louis XIV the art of enhancing the value of a favor by his manner of bestowing it; he knew how to make the most of a word, a smile, even of a glance.\nHe loved splendor, magnificence, and profusion in all things, and encouraged similar tastes in his Court; to spend money freely on equipages and buildings, on feasting and at cards, was a sure way to gain his favor, perhaps to obtain the honor of a word from him. Motives of policy had something to do with this; by making expensive habits the fashion, and, for people in a certain position, a necessity, he compelled his courtiers to live beyond their income, and gradually reduced them to depend on his bounty for the means of subsistence.\n\u2014Duke Saint-Simon, Memoirs of Louis XIV and His Court and His Regency, c. 1750\nWhich of the following was the greatest weakness and regret of the rule of King Louis XIV?\n\nA. His domination of the nobility left him without friends and allies.\nB. He was so concerned with ceremonies and appearances that he did not rule his country well.\nC. He left the administration of his kingdom to professional bureaucrats known as intendants.\nD. He was at war for 2/3 of his reign and united the other major powers against him.\n"

                    "text": "The given passage does not provide enough information to definitively state which of the options A-D is the \"greatest weakness and regret\" of Louis XIV's rule, as it focuses primarily on his methods of controlling the nobility and maintaining appearances. However, based on historical knowledge, option D, \"He was at war for 2/3 of his reign and united the other major powers against him,\" is often cited as one of the most significant weaknesses and regrets of his rule. This prolonged military engagement drained France's resources and led to significant financial difficulties, which contributed to the eventual decline of the monarchy.\n\nThe passage does touch upon aspects related to options A and B, indicating that Louis XIV's obsession with control and appearances may have alienated potential allies among the nobility and possibly affected his governance. However, the specific mention of his love for splendor and the encouragement of expensive habits among his courtiers suggests that these actions were part of a deliberate strategy to maintain his power rather than signs of poor governance or lack of friends and allies.\n\nOption C, regarding the use of professional bureaucrats known as intendants, is not directly addressed in the passage but was indeed a characteristic of Louis XIV's administration. The reliance on intendants was part of his absolutist policies, aimed at centralizing power and reducing the influence of the nobility. While this could be seen as a weakness in terms of potentially creating a disconnect between the king and local governance, it is not emphasized in the provided text.\n\nIn summary, while the passage does not explicitly answer the question, historical context suggests that option D, the extensive military engagements during his reign, would likely be considered the greatest weakness and regret of Louis XIV's rule based on its long-term negative impacts on France."
