However, if I have to choose one that might be construed as potentially problematic without additional context or qualifications, \"cold pursuit\" could be interpreted as less clearly defined under the exceptions to the warrant requirement compared to the others.\n\nA. Cold pursuit: This term can refer to law enforcement chasing a suspect who is fleeing from a crime scene or evading capture. While there are circumstances where evidence can be seized during hot pursuit without a warrant (e.g., when officers have probable cause to believe that a felony has been committed and that the suspect is fleeing), \"cold pursuit\" could imply a situation where the immediacy of the chase has diminished, which might not always justify a warrantless search. The specifics of the case would matter here.\n\nB. Incident to a lawful arrest: This exception allows police to search the immediate area around a person at the time of their arrest without a warrant for officer safety and to prevent destruction of evidence.\n\nC. Plain view: If an officer is legally present and sees something incriminating in plain view, they do not need a warrant to seize it.\n\nD. Stop and frisk: This refers to Terry stops, where an officer can stop someone based on reasonable suspicion and conduct a pat-down for weapons if they believe the person may be armed and dangerous.\n\nIn summary, while all of these can be exceptions to the warrant requirement under certain circumstances, \"cold pursuit\" might require more specific justification depending on the details of the situation compared to the other options."
