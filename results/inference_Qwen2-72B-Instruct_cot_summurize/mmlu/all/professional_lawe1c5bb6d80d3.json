                    "text": "A write-in candidate is a Mexican-American and is of the opinion that he needs a large turnout of Mexican voters in order to win the election. As a result, his campaign manager, decides to mail to every registered Mexican voter a tear-off sticker, which bears the candidate's name and office for which he is running. Since many native Mexican people are not proficient in reading and writing English, the campaign manager believes that many of the voters will have difficulty writing the candidate's name and office on the ballot. As a result, the campaign manager has mounted an extensive media campaign to inform voters on how to apply the stickers to the ballot. Five months prior to the election an election official notifies the candidate's campaign committee that the tear-off stickers do not comply with the state statute. In her letter, the official explains that state election officials are of the opinion that it is necessary for potential voters to write the candidate's name in ink. Therefore, she concludes that the stickers do not comply with statutory requirements. Three weeks later, the candidate filed suit in federal district court against state election officials claiming that their interpretation of the state statute violates the U. S. Constitution. Which of the following, if established, sets forth the strongest constitutional argument supporting the election official's interpretation of the statute?\n\nA. Voter turnout among registered Mexican American voters who lack proficiency in English has been less than 1% of the entire state total in recent elections.\nB. A state statute requires that each voting booth be equipped with an ink pen to facilitate the writing in of votes.\nC. Since large numbers of write-in votes generally increase the time needed to count all votes, it is necessary to cast such votes in a uniform manner.\nD. The potential for voting fraud is substantially greater with preprinted stickers.\n"

                    "text": "The strongest constitutional argument supporting the election official's interpretation of the statute would be D. The potential for voting fraud is substantially greater with preprinted stickers. This argument invokes the state's interest in maintaining the integrity of the electoral process, which is a compelling interest under constitutional law. By arguing that preprinted stickers could lead to increased opportunities for fraud, the election official can justify the restriction as necessary to protect the democratic process.\n\nOption A does not address the constitutionality of the statute but rather the effectiveness of the stickers in increasing voter turnout. Option B merely states a fact about voting booths without explaining why it relates to the constitutionality of the statute. Option C addresses practical concerns about vote counting but does not directly relate to constitutional arguments unless it can be shown that the uniformity of votes is necessary to prevent disenfranchisement or other constitutional violations.\n\nTherefore, option D provides the strongest constitutional argument because it relates to preventing fraud, which is a legitimate state interest that can justify restrictions on voting methods."
