This includes determining the meaning and application of laws, as well as their constitutionality. Making laws is the responsibility of the legislative branch (Congress), enforcing laws is the duty of the executive branch (President and federal agencies), and overriding laws or vetoes can be done by Congress with a two-thirds majority vote in both the House and the Senate."
