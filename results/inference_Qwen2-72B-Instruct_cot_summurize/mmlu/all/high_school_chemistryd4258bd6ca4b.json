Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. mixture where the potential energy of the mixture is the same as that of the individual solvents\n\nThis definition implies that an ideal solution exhibits Raoult's law behavior, meaning that the vapor pressure of each component is proportional to its mole fraction in the solution. In other words, the solution behaves as if it were a mixture of pure components.\n\nHowever, option A could also be considered correct depending on the context because an ideal solution can indeed be a mixture where two solvents can be dissolved in all ratios without any limitation or restriction. But since the question asks for the most accurate definition of an ideal solution, option C is the best answer."
