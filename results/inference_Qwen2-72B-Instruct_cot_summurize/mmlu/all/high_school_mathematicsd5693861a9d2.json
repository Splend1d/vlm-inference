                    "text": "To find the smallest prime number whose digits sum to 19, we can start by analyzing the options given and then construct or identify the smallest possible prime that meets this criterion.\n\nLet's consider the options:\n\nA. 5 - The digit sum is 5, which does not equal 19.\nB. 11 - The digit sum is 1 + 1 = 2, which does not equal 19.\nC. 17 - The digit sum is 1 + 7 = 8, which does not equal 19.\nD. 199 - The digit sum is 1 + 9 + 9 = 19, which does meet the criterion.\n\nHowever, option D (199) may not necessarily be the smallest prime number whose digits sum to 19. We need to verify if there's a smaller prime number that meets the condition.\n\nGiven the constraint of having a digit sum of 19, we want to minimize the number of digits while ensuring the number is prime. Since the smallest digit is 0 and we cannot have a leading zero in a positive integer, the next smallest digits we can use are 1 and 9. Using three digits, the minimum digit sum of 19 would require one 1 and two 9s. This gives us the number 199, which has been listed as an option.\n\nNow let's check if 199 is prime:\n- It's not divisible by 2 (it's odd).\n- It's not divisible by 3 (the sum of its digits, 19, is not divisible by 3).\n- It's not divisible by 5 (it doesn't end in 0 or 5).\n- Checking divisibility by primes up to the square root of 199 (\\(\\sqrt{199} \\approx 14\\)):\n  - Not divisible by 7 (199 / 7 is not an integer).\n  - Not divisible by 11 (199 / 11 is not an integer).\n  - Not divisible by 13 (199 / 13 is not an integer).\n\nSince 199 is not divisible by any prime less than its square root, it is indeed a prime number. \n\nTherefore, **the smallest prime number whose digits sum to 19 is 199**. This makes the correct answer **D. 199**."
