Absorption of fatty acids in the intestine occurs mainly through FABP and FAT/CD36 transport proteins in the enterocytes of the distal duodenum\nB. After absorption, medium chain triglycerides (MCT) enter the lymphatic system, whereas long chain triglycerides enter the portal blood system.\nC. The products of partial digestion of triglycerides (triacylglycerols) can form mixed micelles with pancreatic cholesterol and phospholipids and this increases absorption\nD. Triglycerides (triacylglycerols) must be emulsified and digested before the fatty acids can be transported\n"

                    "text": "The correct statement is:\n\nD. Triglycerides (triacylglycerols) must be emulsified and digested before the fatty acids can be transported.\n\nExplanation:\nTriglycerides (also known as triacylglycerols) are large lipid molecules that need to be broken down into smaller components before they can be absorbed by the body. This process involves several steps:\n\n1. **Emulsification**: Bile salts secreted by the liver and stored in the gallbladder help emulsify the triglycerides in the small intestine. Emulsification breaks down the triglycerides into smaller droplets, increasing their surface area for digestive enzymes to act upon.\n\n2. **Digestion**: Pancreatic lipases then break down the triglycerides into monoglycerides and free fatty acids. This process occurs primarily in the duodenum, the first part of the small intestine.\n\n3. **Absorption**: The monoglycerides and free fatty acids are absorbed by the enterocytes of the small intestine. They are reassembled into triglycerides inside these cells and packaged into chylomicrons.\n\n4. **Transport**: Chylomicrons are released into the lymphatic system, not directly into the bloodstream. They eventually make their way into the bloodstream via the thoracic duct and are transported to various tissues where they can be used for energy or stored as fat.\n\nStatement A is incorrect because while FABPs (fatty acid-binding proteins) and FAT/CD36 do play roles in fatty acid uptake by enterocytes, the main site of absorption is throughout the length of the small intestine, not specifically in the distal duodenum.\n\nStatement B is incorrect because it reverses the transport pathways: MCTs are typically absorbed directly into the portal venous system and enter the liver without passing through the lymphatics, while LCTs are absorbed into the lymphatic system.\n\nStatement C contains an error in that it mentions \"pancreatic cholesterol,\" which is not a product of triglyceride digestion and does not form mixed micelles in this context. Phospholipids and bile salts do form mixed micelles, which aid in the absorption of fatty acids and monoglycerides. However, the inclusion of \"cholesterol\" makes this statement inaccurate."
