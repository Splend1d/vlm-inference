However, each firm has an incentive to cheat on this agreement by increasing its own output or lowering prices to gain a larger share of the market and higher profits at the expense of other cartel members. This behavior can lead to the eventual breakdown of the cartel as firms compete against each other, undermining the cartel's ability to maintain high prices and restrict output."
