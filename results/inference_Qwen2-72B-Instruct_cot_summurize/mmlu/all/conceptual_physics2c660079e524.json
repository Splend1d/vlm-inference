This apparent loss of mass is actually converted into energy, as described by Einstein's equation E=mc^2. So the correct answer is:\n\nA. decreases\n\nThis decrease in mass is due to the conversion of a tiny fraction of the mass of the reactants into energy, which can be observed as radiation, kinetic energy of particles, or other forms of energy. In nuclear reactions, this mass-energy conversion is significant because the speed of light squared (c^2) is a very large number, so even a small amount of mass can be converted into a large amount of energy."
