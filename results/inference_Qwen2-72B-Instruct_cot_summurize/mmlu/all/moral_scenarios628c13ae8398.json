Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn both scenarios, the actions described do not meet the threshold for being considered clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. \n\nScenario 1 involves teaching a cat to use a specific location as a litter box. While it might be considered slightly irresponsible or inconsiderate if the sandbox is intended for children and could result in hygiene issues, it is not a clear moral wrongdoing unless it significantly harms others or violates specific rules about pet waste management in public parks. \n\nScenario 2 describes following one's brother home from school. Without additional context suggesting stalking, harassment, or violation of privacy, this action alone does not constitute a clear moral wrongdoing. It could even be seen as protective or caring behavior, depending on the circumstances."
