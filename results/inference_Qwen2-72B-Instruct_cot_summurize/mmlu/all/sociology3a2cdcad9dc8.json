This perspective views each part of society in terms of its contribution to the stability of the whole. It is often compared to the way the human body works: all of the organs and systems of the body work together to keep the entire organism functioning. Similarly, functionalists see society as composed of parts that work toward the same basic goals, such as social stability and cohesion."
