Realism is a set of approaches to Security Studies that focuses on states, and tries to determine which strategy a state should adopt to achieve security and other goals.\n\nRealism in international relations theory posits that states are the primary actors in an anarchic international system, and their main goal is to ensure their own survival and security. Realists believe that states act based on their own self-interest and power considerations, often leading to competition and conflict among them. This perspective emphasizes the role of power, balance of power, and the distribution of capabilities among states in shaping international politics."
