However, since the distribution of salaries is right-skewed and there's an outlier (the superintendent's salary), the normality assumption is likely violated. While the Central Limit Theorem suggests that the sampling distribution of the mean will be approximately normal for large enough sample sizes, a sample size of 20 might not be large enough to overcome the effects of the skewness and the outlier, especially if the skew is severe. Therefore, the use of a t-confidence interval may not be appropriate without further verification that the sample mean's distribution is sufficiently close to normal."
