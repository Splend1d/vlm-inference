CH3OCH2CH3 (Diethyl ether): This molecule contains oxygen atoms but does not have any hydrogen directly bonded to an oxygen atom. Thus, it cannot form hydrogen bonds.\n\nB. HCN (Hydrogen cyanide): In this molecule, the hydrogen atom is bonded to a nitrogen atom, which has a lone pair of electrons. This setup allows for hydrogen bonding.\n\nC. CH3OCH2Br (Bromoethanol ether): This molecule contains an oxygen atom bonded to a hydrogen atom in the -CH2- group, making it capable of forming hydrogen bonds due to the hydrogen-oxygen bond.\n\nD. CH3NH2 (Methylamine): The nitrogen atom in this molecule has a lone pair of electrons and is bonded to a hydrogen atom, enabling hydrogen bonding.\n\nTherefore, the molecules that can form hydrogen bonds are B. HCN, C. CH3OCH2Br, and D. CH3NH2."
