Males do indeed have one exit structure for both urine and reproductive fluids (the urethra), while females have separate exits: the urethra for urine and the vagina for menstrual fluids and childbirth.\nB. Males have an external sexual organ (the penis) that can become engorged with blood during arousal, leading to an erection. Females also have an external sexual organ (the clitoris), which can become engorged with blood but does not protrude as significantly as the penis.\nC. Both males and females have a high concentration of nerve endings in their respective sexual organs. The clitoris in females is particularly dense with nerve endings, often said to be more than the penis in males, though the exact ratio may vary. However, it is true that both organs are highly sensitive due to their innervation. \n\nIt's important to note that while there are anatomical differences between males and females, these differences do not determine or limit the sexual pleasure or experiences of individuals."
