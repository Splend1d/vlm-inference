They ascribe to the men of the preceding age a wisdom more than human, and suppose what they did to be beyond amendment\u2026.But I know also, that laws and institutions must go hand in hand with the progress of the human mind. As that becomes more developed, more enlightened, as new discoveries are made, new truths disclosed, and manners and opinions change with the change of circumstances, institutions must advance also, and keep pace with the times.\"\nThomas Jefferson, 1816\nWhich of following Amendments to the Constitution is most directly an example of the sentiments expressed above?\n\nA. The First Amendment, which guaranteed the right to free speech\nB. The Tenth Amendment, which allows powers not granted to the federal government be granted to the states\nC.

The Nineteenth Amendment, which guaranteed all women the right to vote.\n\nThis amendment was passed in 1920, long after Jefferson's time, and it responded to changing views on gender equality and women's roles in society. It recognized the evolving understanding of democracy and the rights of individuals, thus keeping pace with the times as Jefferson advocated."
