Augustine believed that all errors are a result of ignorance or false judgments due to incomplete knowledge or misunderstanding of reality. However, it's important to note that Augustine also believed that willful ignorance could itself be a form of sin, so there is some overlap between ignorance and wickedness in his thought. But directly addressing the question, Augustine does not hold that we can never err, but rather that our errors are always due to some form of ignorance."
