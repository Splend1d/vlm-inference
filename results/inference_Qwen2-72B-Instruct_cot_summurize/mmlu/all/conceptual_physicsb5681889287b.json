This is the principle behind Archimedes' buoyancy law, which states that the upward buoyant force exerted on a body immersed in a fluid is equal to the weight of the fluid that the body displaces. However, the statement specifically asks about what the object displaces, not the forces involved, so the most direct answer is the volume of fluid."
