In this reaction, magnesium is oxidized from Mg^0 to Mg^2+, while chromium is reduced from Cr^3+ to Cr^0. The stoichiometry shows that three moles of magnesium react with two moles of chromium (III) ions.\n\nThe other options do not accurately represent the reaction:\n\nA. This option incorrectly includes the nitrate ions in the products without showing their presence in the reactants in the same form. It also does not balance the charges on both sides of the equation.\n\nC. This option incorrectly suggests a 1:1 ratio between magnesium and chromium (III) ions, which does not balance the charges or the atoms.\n\nD. This option incorrectly includes nitrate ions in the products and does not balance the nitrate ions properly. It also does not show the correct stoichiometry for the reaction between magnesium and chromium (III) ions."
