                    "text": "The strength of an acid can often be predicted by looking at the bond strength between the hydrogen atom and the atom it is bonded to (in this case, S, I, Br, or O). The weaker the bond, the more likely the hydrogen ion (proton) is to dissociate from the molecule, making it a stronger acid.\n\nElectronegativity plays a role here as well. Generally, the more electronegative the atom bonded to hydrogen, the stronger the bond will be because the atom will pull electron density away from the hydrogen, making it harder for the hydrogen to leave. However, when we consider molecules like those listed, the size of the atom also matters. Larger atoms (like iodine) have a larger atomic radius, which means the electrons are further from the nucleus and experience less effective nuclear charge. This results in weaker bonds with hydrogen, despite the high electronegativity of the halogens.\n\nLet's compare the options:\n\nA. H2S: Sulfur is less electronegative than oxygen, but its larger size compared to oxygen means that the H-S bond is weaker than the H-O bond in water. However, sulfur is smaller than iodine and bromine, so its bond with hydrogen is stronger than those.\n\nB. HI: Iodine is the largest of these elements, which means its valence electrons are furthest from the nucleus, experiencing the least effective nuclear charge. Thus, the H-I bond is the weakest among these choices, making HI the most likely to donate a proton and therefore the strongest acid.\n\nC. HBr: Bromine is smaller than iodine but larger than sulfur, placing its bond strength with hydrogen somewhere between H2S and HI.\n\nD. H2O: Oxygen has a high electronegativity and is relatively small, resulting in a strong bond with hydrogen. Water is not a strong acid due to the strength of the H-O bond.\n\nGiven these considerations, **HI** (Hydrogen iodide) is the strongest acid among the given options due to the weakness of the H-I bond."
