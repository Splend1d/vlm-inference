Prosperity ripened the principle of decay; the causes of destruction multiplied with the extent of conquest; and, as soon as time or accident had removed the artificial supports, the stupendous fabric yielded to the pressure of its own weight. . . . The victorious legions, who, in distant wars, acquired the vices of strangers and mercenaries, first oppressed the freedom of the republic, and afterwards violated the majesty of the purple. The emperors, anxious for their personal safety and the public peace, were reduced to the base expedient of corrupting the discipline which rendered them alike formidable to their sovereign and to the enemy; the vigour of the military . . . was relaxed . . . ; and the Roman world was overwhelmed by a deluge of Barbarians.\n\u2014Adapted from Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, by Edward Gibbon\nMost classical empires shared which of the following traits?\n\nA. They required the cultural assimilation of conquered peoples to limit diversity within the empire.\nB. They provided state support of foreign religions to improve support of the government.\nC.

Among the options given:\n\nA. Cultural assimilation of conquered peoples was indeed a strategy used by some empires, such as the Romans, to limit diversity and strengthen control over their territories. However, this was not a universal trait among all classical empires.\n\nB. State support of foreign religions to improve support of the government was a practice used by some empires, like the Roman Empire under Emperor Constantine when he converted to Christianity and made it the state religion. This helped to unify the empire under one religious banner. However, this was also not a universal trait among all classical empires.\n\nC. Widespread public works projects to integrate their empires was a common feature among many classical empires. For example, the Roman Empire constructed roads, aqueducts, and public buildings to connect and manage its vast territories. The Persian Empire under Darius I also built extensive road networks and infrastructure. This trait seems more likely to be shared among classical empires than the others listed.\n\nD. Government bureaucracies based on the merit principle were not necessarily a universal feature of classical empires. Some empires, such as the Han Dynasty in China, did have a meritocratic bureaucracy where officials were selected through competitive examinations (the imperial examination system). However, other empires may have relied more on patronage, hereditary positions, or loyalty to the ruler rather than merit.\n\nBased on these considerations, option C is the most likely answer to the question of which trait was commonly shared among most classical empires:\n\nC. They embarked on widespread public works projects to integrate their empires."
