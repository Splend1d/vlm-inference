                    "text": "The correct answer would be B. Members of many families can cause the same sort of disease.\n\nViruses from different families can indeed cause similar types of diseases. For example, several different viruses including influenza viruses (Orthomyxoviridae family), respiratory syncytial virus (Paramyxoviridae family) and coronaviruses (Coronaviridae family) can all cause respiratory illnesses. Similarly, viruses from different families such as hepatitis A virus (Picornaviridae family), hepatitis B virus (Hepadnaviridae family), and hepatitis C virus (Flaviviridae family) can all cause liver infections.\n\nRegarding the other options:\nA. Each member of the 'family' causes the same disease - This is not true. While viruses within the same family share certain structural and genetic similarities, they can cause different diseases. For instance, in the Flaviviridae family, some viruses cause encephalitis while others cause hepatitis or hemorrhagic fever.\nC. Most virus diseases are now controlled by vaccines - Although vaccines have been highly effective in controlling many viral diseases, not all virus diseases are currently preventable by vaccination. Some examples of vaccine-preventable viral diseases include measles, mumps, rubella, polio, hepatitis B, and certain strains of human papillomavirus. However, there are still many viral diseases for which no vaccines are available.\nD. Most viruses can cross the placenta and be teratogenic - This statement is not accurate. While some viruses can cross the placenta and potentially cause harm to the developing fetus (teratogenic effects), this is not true for most viruses. Only certain viruses, such as rubella virus, cytomegalovirus, and Zika virus, are known to have the ability to cross the placenta and cause congenital abnormalities."
