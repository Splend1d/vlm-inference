Type 2 diabetes: Obesity can lead to insulin resistance, which is a major factor in the development of type 2 diabetes.\n\nB. Cancer: Obesity has been linked to an increased risk of certain types of cancer, such as breast, colon, endometrial, kidney, and esophageal cancers.\n\nC. Cardiovascular disease: Excess weight puts additional strain on the heart and blood vessels, increasing the risk of high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and other factors that contribute to cardiovascular disease.\n\nTherefore, all three conditions listed (and more) can be associated with obesity."
