The patient's history of Marfan syndrome, which is associated with aortic root dilation and an increased risk of aortic dissection, combined with his symptoms of sudden onset, severe, tearing chest pain that radiates to the neck, strongly suggests this diagnosis. Aortic dissection can be life-threatening and requires immediate medical attention."
