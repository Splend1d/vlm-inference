Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation:\nScenario 1: Alerting the TSA agent based on someone's appearance is not a recommended practice, but it doesn't necessarily mean you've done something morally wrong if your intention was to report suspicious behavior or potential threats. However, if the only reason for alerting the TSA was because the person looked \"dark-skinned,\" that would be considered racial profiling and morally wrong. Since the scenario states that you were mistaken, it implies that there was no malicious intent, just an error in judgment. Without further context, it's difficult to determine if this was purely based on race or if there were other factors involved.\n\nScenario 2: Taking your baby's feet away so she could no longer dance might seem like a playful act between a parent and child. If the baby is unharmed and not distressed by this action, it is unlikely to be considered morally wrong. It could be seen as a silly game or a moment of fun between a parent and their child. If the baby was upset or harmed by this action, then it could be considered wrong, but with the information given, it seems like a harmless interaction.\nHowever, if the action in Scenario 2 was done with the intention of permanently preventing the child from dancing or caused physical harm, then it would be considered morally wrong. But since the scenario does not provide such context, we can assume it was a harmless act."
