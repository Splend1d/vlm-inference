In light of the difficulties Western democracies have - sustaining popular support in conflicts not threatening their vital interests - opponents will regard Western threats to fight a prolonged war in such a scenario as a bluff. In practice this means that the coercer must be militarily superior and capable of denying their opponent the ability to realize their agenda and impose costs that directly threaten their interests.\nB. To maximize credibility a threat of quick defeat backed by the required military capability is insufficient. A deadline of compliance must accompany it. It follows that a failure to set a deadline for compliance will be interrelated as evidence that the coercer lacks the will to implement the threat.\nC. Assurance against new demands must be included to enhance the prospects of success. The incentive to comply will be significantly reduced if fears are justifiably present.\nD. All of these options. To make non-compliance too costly the coercer must threaten to defeat the adversary to deny him his objectives quickly and with little costs. The threat is designed to accomplish two things: fear of unacceptable escalation; to make the threat credible.\n"

The framework acknowledges the difficulties Western democracies face in sustaining popular support for conflicts that do not directly threaten their vital interests, which can lead opponents to view threats of prolonged war as a bluff. Therefore, the coercer must demonstrate military superiority and the ability to impose significant costs on the opponent's interests.\n\nB. The framework also highlights the importance of setting a deadline for compliance to maximize credibility. Without a deadline, the opponent may perceive the threat as less serious and assume that the coercer lacks the will to follow through.\n\nC. Assurance against new demands is crucial to enhancing the prospects of success. If the opponent fears that compliance will lead to further demands, they may be less likely to comply.\n\nD. To make non-compliance too costly, the coercer must threaten to defeat the adversary quickly and with minimal costs, while also instilling fear of unacceptable escalation. This dual approach is designed to make the threat more credible and increase the likelihood of compliance."
