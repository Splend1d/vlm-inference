The friend told him that a former employee, who was a \"hothead\", was making harassing phone calls and threats. He faxed the officer a oneparagraph summary of the matter. The officer questioned the prior employee, who became verbally abusive and vehemently denied making the calls. The officer arrested him for criminal harassment and wrongful use of a communications device, stating, \"I'm going to teach you a lesson.\" The criminal case was thrown out, however, at the preliminary hearing when the police could not produce proof that the former employee made any phone calls to the business. The former employee then sued the police officer and the business owner for the tort of malicious prosecution. Leaving aside any considerations of immunity for the officer, can the former employee allege facts sufficient to support a malicious prosecution case?\n\nA. No, because the officer received enough facts from the owner to establish the elements of the criminal charges that he filed against the former employee.\nB. Yes, there were sufficient facts for the former employee to establish the basic elements of the malicious prosecution tort.\nC. No, because the business owner knew that it was the former employee who made the calls even if he could not prove it.\nD. Yes, the officer committed abuse of legal process when he improperly initiated the case.\n"

Yes, there were sufficient facts for the former employee to establish the basic elements of the malicious prosecution tort.\n\nIn order to succeed in a claim of malicious prosecution, the plaintiff (in this case, the former employee) must generally show four elements: (1) that the defendant initiated a criminal proceeding; (2) that the criminal proceeding ended in the plaintiff's favor; (3) that there was no probable cause for the criminal proceeding; and (4) that the defendant acted with malice or for an improper purpose.\n\nThe facts presented indicate that the police officer initiated a criminal proceeding against the former employee by arresting him for criminal harassment and wrongful use of a communication device. The case was thrown out at the preliminary hearing due to lack of evidence, which means the criminal proceeding ended in the former employee's favor. The officer's statement, \"I'm going to teach you a lesson,\" suggests that he may have acted with malice or for an improper purpose rather than in good faith to enforce the law. Additionally, the lack of proof that the former employee made any phone calls to the business indicates that there may not have been probable cause for the arrest.\n\nTherefore, based on these facts, the former employee can potentially allege facts sufficient to support a malicious prosecution case against the police officer. The business owner might also be implicated if they were involved in initiating the proceedings without probable cause and with malice. However, the question specifically focuses on whether the former employee can sue the police officer and the business owner for malicious prosecution, and the answer is yes, given the information provided."
