The MMPI is an objective test because it uses standardized questions with fixed response options, which allows for quantifiable and replicable results. In contrast, the TAT (Thematic Apperception Test) and the Rorschach ink blot test are considered projective tests because they rely on subjective interpretation of ambiguous stimuli. The McAdams test of levels is not a recognized psychological assessment tool."
