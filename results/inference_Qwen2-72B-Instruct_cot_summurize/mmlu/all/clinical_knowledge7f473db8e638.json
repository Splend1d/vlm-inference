This type of water loss cannot be measured directly.\n\nLooking at the options you've given:\n\nA. Pyrexia: This refers to fever, which increases insensible water loss because the body's metabolic rate increases and more water is lost through respiration and evaporation from the skin.\n\nB. Using unhumidified oxygen: This can increase insensible water loss as the dry oxygen passing through the respiratory tract draws moisture from the body.\n\nC. Excessive weight loss: This does not directly cause an increase in insensible water loss. Weight loss can occur due to various reasons including decreased caloric intake, increased physical activity, or loss of body fluids. However, it doesn't specifically relate to insensible loss unless it involves dehydration.\n\nD. Diarrhoea: This is a form of sensible loss, not insensible loss. Sensible loss is the water loss that we can perceive, such as when we urinate, have a bowel movement, or sweat visibly. Diarrhoea falls into this category because it is a significant and noticeable loss of fluid.\n\nTherefore, the answer to your question is C. Excessive weight loss. It does not come from insensible loss."
