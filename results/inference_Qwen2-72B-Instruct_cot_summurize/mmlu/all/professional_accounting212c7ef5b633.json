Sales journal to the shipping documents.\n\nTo detect overstatements of sales, an auditor would typically start with the sales journal (or sales records) and trace these entries back to supporting documentation such as shipping documents or sales invoices. This process helps ensure that recorded sales transactions actually occurred and that goods were shipped to customers. If there are discrepancies or if not all sales recorded in the sales journal can be traced back to shipping documents, it could indicate potential overstatement of sales."
