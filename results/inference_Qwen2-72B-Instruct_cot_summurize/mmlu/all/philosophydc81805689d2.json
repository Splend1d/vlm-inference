However, he also recognizes the practical difficulties of calculating the exact consequences of every possible action in every situation. Therefore, his view is a nuanced combination of both A and B:\n\nA. We should consider the expected consequences of our action (utilitarian calculus), aiming for the greatest happiness for the greatest number.\n\nB. We should depend on rules of thumb or general principles derived from the principle of utility. These rules of thumb, often called \"intermediate principles\" or \"prudential maxims,\" serve as guidelines that have been found to generally promote happiness and can be applied without having to perform a detailed calculation of consequences in each case.\n\nThus, Mill's approach emphasizes the importance of both considering consequences and using practical wisdom gained from past experiences and general utility-based principles."
