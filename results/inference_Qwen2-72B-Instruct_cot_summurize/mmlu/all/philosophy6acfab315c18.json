This doesn't exactly match any of the options you've provided, but it's closest to option B: valid, in the sense that he believed moral arguments can be valid if they follow certain logical rules and use universally acceptable principles. However, he didn't claim that all moral arguments are automatically valid or sound (which would also imply that their premises are true), just that they can potentially be so. So the most accurate answer based on Hare's views would be that he believed all moral arguments aspire to be valid, but aren't necessarily so.\n\nFor a direct answer from the given choices, none perfectly represents Hare's view, but if pressed to choose, \"B. valid\" could be selected with the understanding that it is an ideal to which moral arguments should aspire, not a guaranteed state."
