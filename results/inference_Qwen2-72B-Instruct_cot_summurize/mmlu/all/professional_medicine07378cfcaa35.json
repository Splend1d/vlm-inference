He has daily purulent sputum and has noted decreased exercise tolerance over the past 2 years. He and his wife have been unable to conceive because of his low sperm count. Scattered expiratory wheezing and rhonchi are heard throughout both lung fields. An x-ray of the chest shows hyperinflation. Spirometry shows a decreased FEV1:FVC ratio. Which of the following is most likely to confirm the diagnosis?\n\nA. Arterial blood gas analysis\nB. Examination of sputum for eosinophils\nC. Sweat chloride test\nD. Sputum cytology\n"

                    "text": "The clinical presentation described in this case is consistent with cystic fibrosis (CF), a genetic disorder that affects multiple organ systems, including the lungs, pancreas, and reproductive system. The hallmark symptoms include recurrent respiratory infections, chronic cough with purulent sputum, decreased exercise tolerance, and male infertility due to congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens (CBAVD). Hyperinflation on chest X-ray and obstructive spirometry results (decreased FEV1:FVC ratio) also support this diagnosis.\n\nAmong the options provided for confirming the diagnosis:\n\nA. Arterial blood gas analysis can show respiratory acidosis or alkalosis and is useful in assessing the severity of lung disease but is not diagnostic of CF.\nB. Examination of sputum for eosinophils may be part of evaluating other respiratory conditions but does not confirm CF.\nC. Sweat chloride test measures the concentration of chloride ions in sweat, which is typically elevated in patients with CF. This test is considered the gold standard for diagnosing CF.\nD. Sputum cytology examines cells from the respiratory tract but would not provide specific information about CF.\n\nTherefore, the answer that is most likely to confirm the diagnosis is **C. Sweat chloride test**."
