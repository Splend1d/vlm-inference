Caveat emptor, Buyer beware, Regulation, National\n\nThe traditional notion of \"caveat emptor\" or \"buyer beware\" places the responsibility on the consumer to be aware of the quality of the product they are purchasing. Over time, this concept has been eroded by increased regulation at the national, EU, and UN levels, which aim to protect consumers from subpar products and unfair business practices. This shift reflects a growing recognition of the need for more balanced consumer protections in an increasingly complex marketplace."
