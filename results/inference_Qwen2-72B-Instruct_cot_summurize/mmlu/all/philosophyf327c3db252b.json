Among the options you've provided, one idea is not typically associated with Situation Ethics:\n\nA. Anything goes - This phrase does not accurately represent Situation Ethics because it implies a complete absence of moral standards, which is not the case. Situation Ethics still holds that love (agape) is the ultimate principle guiding moral decision-making.\n\nB. Principled relativism - This concept is actually quite aligned with Situation Ethics. It suggests that there are no absolute moral laws but rather principles that can guide decision-making in specific situations. In Situation Ethics, the principle is love, which should inform all decisions.\n\nC. The end justifies the means - This phrase is often associated with utilitarianism or consequentialism, where the morality of an action is determined by its outcome. While Situation Ethics might consider the consequences of actions, it primarily focuses on whether the action expresses agape love, not solely on the ends justifying the means.\n\nD. No choice - This option is not associated with Situation Ethics. Situation Ethics encourages making choices based on the particular circumstances and what would best express agape love in those circumstances. It does not suggest a lack of choice.\n\nAmong these options, \"Anything goes\" is the least associated with Situation Ethics because it does not account for the central role of love as a guiding principle in making moral decisions."
