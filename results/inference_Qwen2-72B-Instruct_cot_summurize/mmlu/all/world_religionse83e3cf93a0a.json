This festival, also known as the Festival of Lights, is celebrated by Hindus, Jains, Sikhs, and some Buddhists around the world. While other deities like Durga and Kali are also worshipped in different regions and traditions during Diwali, Lakshmi is the central figure for most celebrants. Mahavira is not a goddess but an important figure in Jainism, and he is not specifically associated with Diwali worship."
