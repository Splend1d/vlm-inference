                    "text": "The claim made by Shapiro is not specified in the question, but based on the options provided, it seems he may be referring to findings related to drug use patterns. However, without direct reference to Shapiro's work, I can only provide information based on what research in general has shown regarding these statements:\n\nA. Excessive use of illegal drugs being the norm is not supported by most research. While there are individuals who engage in excessive drug use, it is not the norm for all drug users or society at large.\n\nB. Moderate and/or controlled use of illegal drugs as the norm is also not generally supported by research. The use of illegal drugs is often associated with problematic use, although there are cases where individuals may use drugs in a more controlled manner.\n\nC. An individual's illegal drug use inevitably diminishing over time is not universally true. Some individuals may reduce or cease their drug use over time, but this is not inevitable for everyone. Factors such as age, social environment, access to drugs, and personal motivation play significant roles in drug use patterns.\n\nD. Those who begin using illegal drugs typically do not stop until they become addicted is a common misconception. Addiction does not occur in every case of drug use. Many people try drugs but do not continue to use them or become addicted. Addiction is a complex condition influenced by biological, psychological, and social factors.\n\nLongitudinal studies have indeed shed light on drug use patterns over time, showing that while some individuals may develop problematic use, others may use drugs experimentally or recreationally without developing addiction. It's important to note that the outcomes of drug use can vary widely among individuals."
