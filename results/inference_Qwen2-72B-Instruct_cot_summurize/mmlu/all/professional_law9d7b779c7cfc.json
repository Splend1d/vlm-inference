The mortgage was promptly recorded. The next year, the father died intestate. The father's heirs were the son and his two sisters. The sisters first learned of the mortgage just after their father died. The sisters now assert that the son, their brother, holds the mortgage for their benefit as well as for himself because as a tenant in common with his sisters, he has a fiduciary duty toward them. There are no applicable statutes. Are the sisters correct?\n\nA. No, because the mortgage was granted before the tenancy in common was created.\nB. No, because the three siblings took the farm as tenants in common rather than as joint tenants with right of survivorship.\nC. Yes, because a fiduciary relationship exists among tenants in common.\nD. Yes, because their three interests are equal.\n"

No, because the mortgage was granted before the tenancy in common was created.\n\nWhen the father secured the loan from his son with the mortgage on the farm, it was a transaction between the father and the son. The creation of the tenancy in common occurred only upon the death of the father when the property was inherited by the son and his two sisters. Since the mortgage was established prior to the creation of the tenancy in common, it does not automatically become a fiduciary obligation of the son towards his sisters. The son holds the mortgage based on the original agreement with his father, not as a trustee or fiduciary for his sisters. The fact that they are now tenants in common does not retroactively change the nature of the original mortgage agreement."
