Which single statement about this phenomenon, below, is actually correct?\n\n\nA. A \"flip-flop\" mechanism efficiently transports water directly across the enterocyte membrane\nB. Water flows into the gut from the mucosa, during digestion of starch and protein, in order to reduce luminal osmolality\nC. Water is mostly absorbed by movement between the cells lining the gut (enterocytes) via tight junctions\nD. Dietary intake of water is always greater than water movement in the small intestine\n"

Water is mostly absorbed by movement between the cells lining the gut (enterocytes) via tight junctions\n\nThis statement is correct because water absorption in the small intestine occurs primarily through passive diffusion across tight junctions between enterocytes, rather than through specific transport mechanisms. The other statements either describe incorrect mechanisms or make inaccurate generalizations about water movement in the digestive system."
