Marital satisfaction can indeed show ups and downs throughout the marriage, influenced by various life events and stages. While some couples may maintain high satisfaction throughout their marriage (option A), it's not the most common pattern. Option B, where satisfaction steadily declines over time, doesn't capture the reality for many couples who find ways to rekindle their relationship and maintain or increase satisfaction later in life. Option C, which suggests lower levels of satisfaction when children are present, can be true for some couples due to the added stress and responsibilities of parenthood, but it's not necessarily a universal experience.\n\nIt's important to note that every couple's experience is unique, and these patterns can vary widely based on individual circumstances and how couples navigate challenges together."
