                    "text": "A man brought a federal diversity action against his insurance company, alleging that the company had breached its duty under his insurance policy by refusing to pay for his medical expenses resulting from a mountain-biking accident. At the jury trial, the man presented evidence that he had paid all premiums on the insurance policy and that the policy cov-ered personal-injury-related medical expenses arising from accidents. After he rested his case, the company presented evidence that a provision of the policy excluded payment for injury-related expenses resulting from an insured's \u00d2unduly risky\u00d3 behavior. The company also presented a witness who testified that the accident had occurred in an area where posted signs warned bikers not to enter. The man did not cross-examine the witness. After resting its case, the company moved for judgment as a matter of law. Should the court grant the motion?\n\nA. No, because a motion for judgment as a matter of law must first be made at the close of the plaintiff's case-in-chief.\nB. No, because whether the man's behavior was unduly risky is a question of fact for the jury to resolve.\nC. Yes, because the company's uncontradicted evidence of the man's unduly risky behavior means that no reason-able jury could find that the policy covers his injuries.\nD. Yes, because the man waived his right to rebut the company's evidence by not addressing the \u00d2unduly risky\u00d3 policy provision in his case-in-chief.\n"

No, because whether the man's behavior was unduly risky is a question of fact for the jury to resolve.\n\nIn this scenario, the man has presented his case with evidence that he had paid all premiums and that the policy covered personal-injury-related medical expenses arising from accidents. The insurance company then presented evidence of a policy exclusion for \"unduly risky\" behavior and testimony that the accident occurred in an area with warnings against entry for bikers. This evidence raises questions about whether the man's actions fall under the policy's definition of \"unduly risky,\" which is a factual determination for the jury to make. Therefore, the court should not grant the motion for judgment as a matter of law, as it is the jury's role to decide issues of fact based on the evidence presented.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because a party can move for judgment as a matter of law after both parties have rested their cases, not just at the close of the plaintiff's case-in-chief. Choice C is incorrect because while the company's evidence may be uncontradicted, it does not automatically mean that no reasonable jury could find in favor of the man; the jury still needs to weigh the evidence and determine if the man's behavior meets the policy's criteria for exclusion. Choice D is incorrect because the man's failure to address the \"unduly risky\" policy provision in his case-in-chief does not waive his right to have the jury consider the issue."
