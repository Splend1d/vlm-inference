It provides the energy required for the cross-bridge cycling between actin and myosin filaments, which results in muscle contraction. While phosphocreatine can regenerate ATP in muscles during short bursts of high-intensity activity, and oxidative phosphorylation is a process that produces ATP, it's ATP itself that directly powers muscle contractions. ADP (adenosine diphosphate) is not an energy source but rather a molecule that is produced when ATP is used and needs to be rephosphorylated to become ATP again."
