Let's start with the first proposition:\n\nI \u2261 ~H\n\nThis proposition states that I is equivalent to the negation of H. We can represent this in a truth table as follows:\n\n| H | ~H | I | I \u2261 ~H |\n|---|----|---|--------|\n| T |  F | T |   F    |\n| T |  F | F |   T    |\n| F |  T | T |   T    |\n| F |  T | F |   F    |\n\nNow let's move on to the second proposition:\n\n~(~I \u2261 H)\n\nThis proposition states that the negation of the equivalence between the negation of I and H is true. We can represent this in a truth table as follows:\n\n| H | ~I | ~I \u2261 H | ~(~I \u2261 H) |\n|---|----|--------|-----------|\n| T |  F |   T    |     F     |\n| T |  T |   F    |     T     |\n| F |  F |   F    |     T     |\n| F |  T |   T    |     F     |\n\nNow we can compare the two truth tables to determine whether the propositions are logically equivalent, contradictory, consistent, or inconsistent.\n\nComparing the two truth tables, we can see that the truth values for the two propositions are not always the same. Specifically, when H is true and I is false, the first proposition is true while the second proposition is false. Similarly, when H is false and I is true, the first proposition is true while the second proposition is false. Therefore, the two propositions are not logically equivalent.\n\nHowever, we can also see that there are no cases where both propositions are false at the same time. This means that the two propositions are consistent with each other.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C: Neither logically equivalent nor contradictory, but consistent."
