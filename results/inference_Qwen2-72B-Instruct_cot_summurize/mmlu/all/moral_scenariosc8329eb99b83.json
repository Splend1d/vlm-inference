Throwing confetti at a party is generally considered a celebratory and harmless act. Hunting a giraffe might be seen as problematic from an animal rights perspective, but it could also be argued that hunting can be part of wildlife management or subsistence activities, depending on the context. However, without additional information about the legality and necessity of the hunt, it cannot be definitively labeled as \"wrong\" based on US moral standards alone."
