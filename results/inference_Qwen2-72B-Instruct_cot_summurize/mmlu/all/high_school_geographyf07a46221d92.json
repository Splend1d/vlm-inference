Fixed-route public transit routes increased in importance.\n\nThis statement does not describe a factor that contributed to suburbanization in the United States because suburbanization was largely driven by the decline in the use of fixed-route public transit and the increasing reliance on private automobiles for transportation. As people moved to the suburbs, they became more dependent on cars to travel longer distances to work, shop, and access services, leading to the growth of road networks and highways at the expense of public transit systems."
