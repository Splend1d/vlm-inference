An increase in government spending\n\nAn increase in government spending is likely to increase real GDP as it directly adds to the aggregate demand in an economy, assuming that other factors remain constant. Government spending can lead to higher levels of employment and income, which can then stimulate further economic activity through increased consumer spending.\n\nA. An increase in the real rate of interest may discourage investment by businesses if borrowing costs rise, potentially leading to a decrease in real GDP.\nB. An increase in taxes can reduce disposable income for households and potentially lower consumption, which could decrease real GDP.\nC. A decrease in net exports implies that imports are exceeding exports, which can subtract from real GDP growth since net exports are part of the calculation of GDP."
