Feedforward neural networks are artificial neural networks where the connections between units do not form a cycle. This means that data moves in only one direction through the network, from input to output, without loops or cycles.\n\nStatement 2 is also true. The original Transformers, introduced in the paper \"Attention is All You Need\" by Vaswani et al., use self-attention mechanisms to weigh the importance of different parts of the input data. Self-attention allows the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence when generating each element of the output sequence.\n\nOn the other hand, the original ResNet, introduced in the paper \"Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition\" by He et al., does not use self-attention. Instead, it uses skip connections (or residual connections) to help mitigate the vanishing gradient problem and enable the training of very deep networks."
