The recommendation for paid community improvement projects open to people from different, possibly conflicted, groups aligns with this hypothesis as it promotes direct contact and cooperation between individuals from diverse backgrounds.\n\n2. **Legal Hypothesis**: Stricter anti-hate ordinances being passed at the local level is an example of using legal frameworks to address and reduce prejudice and hate crimes. This approach is based on the idea that laws can set standards for behavior and provide consequences for actions that violate those standards.\n\n3. **Self-esteem Hypothesis**: While not directly mentioned in the context of the recommendations, increasing access to education can potentially boost self-esteem and reduce feelings of insecurity that might lead to prejudice. However, this hypothesis is less central to the recommendations than the Contact Hypothesis and Legal Hypothesis.\n\nGiven these points, the most accurate answer would be:\n\n**D. I, II, and IV**\n\nThis choice includes all the relevant hypotheses except for the \"Hypothesis\" (III), which is not a specific hypothesis and does not provide any context about its relevance to the task force's recommendations."
