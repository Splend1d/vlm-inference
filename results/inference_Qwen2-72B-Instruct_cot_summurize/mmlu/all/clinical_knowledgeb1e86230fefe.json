Pressure in the root of the neck reduces the impulse\n\nThis is because applying pressure to the carotid sinus (in the root of the neck) can reduce or stop an arterial pulse, as it activates baroreceptors that regulate blood pressure and heart rate. The other options do not directly relate to arterial pulsations in the neck."
