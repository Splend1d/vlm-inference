A decrease in the international demand for Mexican-made textiles\n\nWhen there is a decrease in the demand for goods and services produced in Mexico, such as textiles, it leads to a decrease in the demand for Mexican pesos. This is because fewer foreign buyers need to purchase Mexican pesos to buy those goods. As a result, the demand curve for the Mexican peso shifts to the left."
