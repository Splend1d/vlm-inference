A proposal for the extension of democratic rule globally\n\n'Democratic enlargement' refers to the idea of promoting democracy in countries that do not have it, with the belief that this will lead to a more peaceful and stable world. This concept gained popularity after the end of the Cold War when many countries in Eastern Europe transitioned from authoritarian regimes to democracies. It is often associated with the foreign policy strategies of the United States and other Western countries that sought to spread democratic governance around the globe. While it does not directly refer to economic policies like free markets, the promotion of democracy has sometimes been linked to economic liberalization in practice. However, the primary focus of 'democratic enlargement' is on extending democratic rule rather than free market principles."
