By increasing genetic variation of the bacteria\n\nViral transduction can significantly contribute to bacterial evolution by transferring genetic material between different bacterial cells, thus increasing their genetic diversity. This process allows bacteria to acquire new traits, such as antibiotic resistance or virulence factors, which can enhance their survival and adaptation in various environments."
