In a time-out, an individual is removed from a reinforcing situation or environment temporarily. This removal can decrease the likelihood of the behavior that preceded the time-out occurring again in the future because the individual no longer receives the reinforcement they were seeking when engaging in the undesired behavior. It's important to note that for time-out to be effective, the individual must find the current activity or environment reinforcing."
