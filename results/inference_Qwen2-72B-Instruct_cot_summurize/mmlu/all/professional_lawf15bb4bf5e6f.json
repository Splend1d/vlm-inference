The authorities arrested the man for felonious larceny, a crime that is also called theft in some states. The man defended on the basis that he had no intent to steal and only wanted his rightful compensation. He filed a motion to dismiss, relying essentially on proof that he had no intent to steal because he believed in good faith that it was his own property. What will be the most likely decision of the court?\n\nA. The charges will not be dismissed because his intent becomes irrelevant when he uses force to obtain possession of property.\nB. The charges will be dismissed because the intent to steal is a required element of both theft and larceny and this man did not intend to steal because he thought that he had a right to the money.\nC. The charges will be dismissed because he can raise the defense of necessity and it is always lawful to take what a person needs to survive.\nD. The charges will not be dismissed because the man's right to the money was disputed and therefore his intent is irrelevant as compared to the employer's intent and belief.\n"

If the court finds the man's belief credible and that he genuinely thought the money was due to him as compensation, then it could potentially lead to a dismissal of the charges based on lack of criminal intent. However, if the court does not find his belief credible or determines that his actions went beyond what was reasonable under the circumstances, the charges may not be dismissed."
