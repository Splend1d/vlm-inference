Since the model is measured in centimeters, let's convert meters to centimeters as well. There are 100 centimeters in one meter.\n\nThe scale becomes: 1.5 cm : 50 * 100 cm = 1.5 cm : 5000 cm\n\nNow we want to find out how many centimeters represent 150 meters on the model. Again, converting 150 meters to centimeters gives us 150 * 100 = 15000 cm.\n\nUsing the scale, we have:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1.5}{5000} = \\frac{x}{15000} \\]\n\nWhere \\(x\\) is the distance on the model in centimeters. Cross-multiplying to solve for \\(x\\):\n\n\\[ 1.5 * 15000 = 5000 * x \\]\n\n\\[ 22500 = 5000x \\]\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{22500}{5000} \\]\n\n\\[ x = 4.5 \\]\n\nSo, the distance between the two trees on the model is 4.5 centimeters. The correct answer is B. 4.5 centimeters."
