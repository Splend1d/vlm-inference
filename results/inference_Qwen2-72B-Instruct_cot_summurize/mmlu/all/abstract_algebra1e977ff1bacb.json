                    "text": "To determine if these sets form groups under matrix multiplication, we must check the group axioms for each: closure, associativity, identity, and inverses.\n\n**Statement 1**: The set of 2x2 matrices with integer entries and nonzero determinant is a group under matrix multiplication.\n\n1. **Closure**: If you multiply two 2x2 matrices with integer entries and nonzero determinants, the resulting matrix will also have integer entries. However, the determinant of the product can be zero even if both original matrices have nonzero determinants (e.g., consider two matrices where one is the inverse of the other but not in the set because it has non-integer entries).\n   \n   Counterexample: Let \\( A = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\) and \\( B = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{2} & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\). Both have integer entries when ignoring the second matrix's non-integer entries for this conceptual purpose, and both have nonzero determinants. But their product \\( AB = I \\), the identity matrix, has determinant 1, which doesn't violate the nonzero determinant condition on its own, but \\( B \\) itself isn't allowed in the set due to having non-integer entries. This counterexample doesn't directly prove the statement false, but it does highlight an issue with closure since the set needs to be restricted to matrices that are invertible within the set.\n\n2. **Associativity**: Matrix multiplication is associative.\n   \n3. **Identity**: The identity matrix \\( I = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\) is in the set since it has integer entries and a nonzero determinant.\n\n4. **Inverses**: Not all matrices in this set will have inverses that are also in the set (i.e., with integer entries). For example, the inverse of \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\) is \\( \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{2} & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\), which does not have integer entries.\n\nTherefore, **Statement 1** is **False**.\n\n**Statement 2**: The set of 2x2 matrices with integer entries and determinant 1 is a group under matrix multiplication.\n\n1. **Closure**: Multiplying two matrices with determinant 1 will result in a matrix with determinant 1, as det(AB) = det(A)det(B).\n\n2. **Associativity**: Matrix multiplication is associative.\n\n3. **Identity**: The identity matrix \\( I = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\) is in the set since it has integer entries and determinant 1.\n\n4. **Inverses**: If a matrix \\( A \\) has determinant 1, then its inverse \\( A^{-1} \\) will also have determinant 1 because det\\( (A^{-1}) \\) = 1/det(A) = 1/1 = 1. Since the determinant of \\( A \\) is 1, \\( A \\) is invertible over the integers, meaning its inverse will also have integer entries.\n\nThus, **Statement 2** is **True**.\n\nThe answer is **D. False, True**."
