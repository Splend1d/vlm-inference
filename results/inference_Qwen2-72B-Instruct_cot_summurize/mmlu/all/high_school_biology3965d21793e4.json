Unsaturated fatty acids are not necessarily linked to heart disease; in fact, they can be beneficial for heart health when consumed in moderation as part of a balanced diet.\n\nB. Lipids do not make up most cell surface receptors. Cell surface receptors are typically proteins that contain lipid components but are not made up mostly of lipids.\n\nC. Phospholipids are amphipathic molecules with hydrophilic (water-loving) heads and hydrophobic (water-fearing) tails, so they are not completely water-soluble.\n\nD. Steroids are lipids, but they do not consist of glycerol and fatty acids. Steroids have a characteristic four-ring structure that differentiates them from other lipids like triglycerides and phospholipids.\n\nTherefore, none of the given options is correct. A more accurate statement might be: \"Steroids are lipids characterized by their four-ring structure.\""
