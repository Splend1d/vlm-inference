This method is widely used for detecting and quantifying RNA viruses, such as HIV, hepatitis C, and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19). RT-PCR allows for the amplification of viral genetic material, making it possible to detect even small amounts of the virus in a sample.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the choice of diagnostic technique can depend on the specific virus being investigated and the resources available in the laboratory. For example, immuno-serology (D) might be more common for diagnosing certain viral infections based on antibody detection, while virus isolation in cell culture (A) may be necessary for some research purposes or when dealing with viruses that do not have reliable molecular diagnostics. Deep sequencing (NGS) (B) is also becoming increasingly important for virus diagnostics and surveillance, particularly for understanding viral evolution and transmission dynamics."
