These craters contain the only permanently shadowed regions on Mercury.\n\nMercury has no atmosphere to retain heat, so its surface temperature can drop significantly at night. However, in some of the planet's polar craters, the sun never rises above the horizon, leaving these areas in permanent shadow. This allows temperatures to remain low enough for water ice to be stable. Evidence for water ice at Mercury's poles was first suggested by radar observations in the 1990s, which showed reflective signatures consistent with ice. Later, the MESSENGER spacecraft confirmed the presence of water ice in these permanently shadowed regions."
