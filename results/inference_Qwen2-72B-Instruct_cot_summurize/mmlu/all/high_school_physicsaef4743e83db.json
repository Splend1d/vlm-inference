                    "text": "When two identical capacitors are connected in parallel, the following is true:\n\n1. The voltage across each capacitor is the same because they are connected across the same points in the circuit. This means that the voltage drop across each capacitor is equal.\n\n2. The capacitance of each individual capacitor does not change just because it is connected in parallel with another capacitor. The total capacitance of the system increases, but the capacitance of each individual capacitor remains unchanged.\n\n3. The charge stored on each capacitor is not necessarily the same. In fact, when two capacitors are identical and connected in parallel, the total charge stored by the pair will be distributed equally between them if they start uncharged. However, this equality of charge is a result of their identical capacitance and the same voltage across them, not an inherent property that must always be true regardless of the situation. If the capacitors were charged differently before being connected in parallel, or if there were some other factor affecting charge distribution, the charges could be different.\n\nGiven these points, the correct answer is:\n\nC. II and III only\n\nThe voltage across the capacitor (II) and the capacitance of the capacitor (III) must be the same for both capacitors when connected in parallel. The charge stored on the capacitor (I) might be the same under certain conditions but is not inherently guaranteed to be the same."
