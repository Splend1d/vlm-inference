Neutron activation analysis (NAA) involves bombarding a sample with neutrons to induce radioactivity in the elements present, allowing their identification and quantification through gamma-ray spectroscopy. X-ray fluorescence (XRF) works by exciting electrons in the atoms of a sample using X-rays, causing characteristic X-ray emissions that can be analyzed to determine elemental composition."
