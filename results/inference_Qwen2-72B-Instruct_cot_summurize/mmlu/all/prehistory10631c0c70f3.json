Monumental works, such as large buildings or structures, indicate a level of organization and resource allocation that is characteristic of complex societies. Burials with grave goods suggest social stratification, where some individuals are given more elaborate burials than others based on their status or achievements. A leisurely and sedentary lifestyle implies a surplus of resources and a division of labor, which are also features of complex societies."
