Individuals with the genetic disorder usually do not survive more than a few years, and thus are not able to reproduce and pass on the gene. What would explain how this allele and its associated disease is preserved in the population?\n\nA. Heterozygous individuals will show no symptoms.\nB. Spontaneous mutation converts the dominant allele to the recessive form.\nC. Occasionally the gene will instead increase the fitness of the individual.\nD.

Heterozygous carriers (individuals with one normal allele and one mutated allele) typically do not express the disease phenotype because the single normal allele is sufficient to produce enough functional enzyme or protein. As a result, these carriers can unknowingly pass the recessive allele to their offspring, maintaining the allele in the population."
