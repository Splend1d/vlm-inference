The grammar is ambiguous.\nAn ambiguous grammar produces more than one parse tree for some sentences. In this case, the grammar is not ambiguous because there is only one way to derive any string in the language defined by the grammar. For example, the string \"x\" can be derived as `S => x`, and the string \"(x)\" can be derived as `S => ( S ) => ( x )`. There are no alternative derivations for these strings, so the grammar is unambiguous.\n\nII. The grammar is suitable for top-down parsing.\nTop-down parsing starts with the start symbol and tries to match the input string by expanding the non-terminals. This grammar can be parsed using a simple recursive descent parser, which is a type of top-down parser. The parser would have two functions: one for `S` that either matches an 'x' or a pair of parentheses enclosing another call to `S`, and one for matching parentheses. Thus, the grammar is suitable for top-down parsing.\n\nIII. The grammar is suitable for bottom-up parsing.\nBottom-up parsing starts from the input string and attempts to build a parse tree by applying the grammar rules in reverse. A common bottom-up parsing technique is shift-reduce parsing. This grammar can be parsed using a simple LALR(1) parser, which is a type of bottom-up parser. The parser would shift tokens onto a stack and then reduce them according to the grammar rules when appropriate. Since the grammar is not left-recursive and has no conflicts, it can be effectively parsed using bottom-up techniques.\n\nGiven the analysis above, statements II and III are true. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. II and III only"
