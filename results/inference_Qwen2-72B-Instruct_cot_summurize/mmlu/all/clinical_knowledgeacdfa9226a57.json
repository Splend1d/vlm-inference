                    "text": "A muscle fibre relaxes when:\n\nA. the nerve stimulus is removed.\n\nWhen a nerve impulse reaches the neuromuscular junction, it triggers the release of a neurotransmitter called acetylcholine, which binds to receptors on the muscle cell membrane and initiates a series of events that lead to muscle contraction. When the nerve stimulus is removed, the release of acetylcholine stops. This leads to a decrease in calcium ion concentration within the muscle cell, which allows the protein tropomyosin to cover the binding sites on the actin filaments again. As a result, the myosin heads can no longer bind to actin, causing the muscle to relax."
