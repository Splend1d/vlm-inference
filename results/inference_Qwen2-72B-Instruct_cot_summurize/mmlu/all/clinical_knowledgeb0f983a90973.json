However, the amount of ATP stored in the muscles is limited and can only provide energy for very short bursts of high-intensity exercise, such as sprinting or heavy lifting.\n\nThe correct answer to your question is:\n\nB. 2 seconds.\n\nThis is the approximate duration that the ATP stored in muscles can sustain high-intensity activities before other energy systems (such as the phosphocreatine system, glycolysis, and oxidative phosphorylation) need to contribute to ATP production. However, it's worth noting that the exact duration can vary depending on factors like the individual's fitness level and the specific activity being performed. Some sources might state this time frame could extend up to about 5-10 seconds under certain conditions."
