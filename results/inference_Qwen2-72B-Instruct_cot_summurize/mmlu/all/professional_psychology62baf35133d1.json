In cluster sampling, the population is divided into clusters, which are typically geographic or social groups, and then a random sample of these clusters is selected for study. All individuals within the selected clusters are included in the sample. This method is often used when it is impractical or too costly to create a complete list of all members of the population and to randomly select individual members from that list. Cluster sampling can help increase external validity by ensuring that the sample is more representative of the population as a whole, especially if the clusters are chosen to reflect the diversity of the population. However, it can also introduce bias if the clusters themselves are not representative of the population."
