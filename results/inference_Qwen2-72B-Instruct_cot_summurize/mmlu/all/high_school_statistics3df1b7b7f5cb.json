The group that exercises serves as the treatment group, while the group that performs no exercise serves as the control group. However, there is no mention of blinding in the description, so we cannot say for sure if the study includes blinding. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. An experiment with blocking\n\nAlthough \"blocking\" typically refers to grouping subjects based on some characteristic before random assignment to treatments, here the term might be loosely used to describe separating the subjects into exercisers and non-exercisers. However, a more precise classification would simply call this an experiment with a control group, without specifically referring to it as having \"blocking.\" Since option A includes blinding, which is not mentioned in the scenario, and option C incorrectly identifies the study as observational, option B is the closest fit given the choices provided. But for clarity, the best description would be an experiment with a control group, without specifying blocking or blinding."
