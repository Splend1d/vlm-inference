                    "text": "The spontaneity of a reaction can be determined using the Gibbs free energy change (\\(\\Delta G\\)) which is given by the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta G = \\Delta H - T\\Delta S\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\(\\Delta H\\) is the enthalpy change (heat absorbed or released at constant pressure),\n- \\(\\Delta S\\) is the entropy change,\n- \\(T\\) is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nFor a reaction to be spontaneous at standard conditions (1 atm and 298 K), \\(\\Delta G\\) must be negative. The student found that the reaction was nonspontaneous at 298 K but became spontaneous when cooled to -78\u00b0C (195.15 K) using dry ice.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. \\(\\Delta H < 0\\), \\(\\Delta S < 0\\), and \\(\\Delta G = 0\\)\n\nThis would mean the reaction is at equilibrium at standard conditions, not nonspontaneous as observed.\n\nB. \\(\\Delta H > 0\\), \\(\\Delta S < 0\\), and \\(\\Delta G > 0\\)\n\nThis combination suggests that both enthalpy and entropy changes are unfavorable, making the reaction nonspontaneous at high temperatures. Lowering the temperature could potentially make the reaction spontaneous because the term \\(T\\Delta S\\) would decrease more than the \\(\\Delta H\\) term, making \\(\\Delta G\\) negative. This is plausible given the student's observation.\n\nC. \\(\\Delta H < 0\\), \\(\\Delta S < 0\\), and \\(\\Delta G > 0\\)\n\nA negative \\(\\Delta H\\) and negative \\(\\Delta S\\) could lead to a nonspontaneous reaction if the absolute value of \\(T\\Delta S\\) is greater than the absolute value of \\(\\Delta H\\). Cooling the system might not necessarily make the reaction spontaneous because decreasing the temperature would decrease the effect of the negative entropy on \\(\\Delta G\\), but \\(\\Delta H\\) is already negative. It's less likely this scenario would match the student's observation since a negative \\(\\Delta H\\) usually favors spontaneity at lower temperatures without needing further cooling.\n\nD. \\(\\Delta H > 0\\), \\(\\Delta S > 0\\), and \\(\\Delta G > 0\\)\n\nWhile an increase in entropy could potentially overcome an endothermic enthalpy change to make the reaction spontaneous at high temperatures, the observation that the reaction becomes spontaneous only upon cooling suggests this is not the case here.\n\nGiven the student's observation that the reaction becomes spontaneous upon cooling, option B best fits the scenario described: a positive \\(\\Delta H\\) (endothermic) and negative \\(\\Delta S\\) (decrease in entropy) lead to a nonspontaneous reaction at higher temperatures, but lowering the temperature sufficiently makes the reaction spontaneous due to the decreased effect of the negative entropy term. Thus, the correct answer is **B.**"
