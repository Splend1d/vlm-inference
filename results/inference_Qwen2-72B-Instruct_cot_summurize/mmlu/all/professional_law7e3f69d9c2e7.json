The buyer obtained the requisite financing from a bank. At the closing, the buyer executed a note to the seller for a portion of the purchase price, which note was not secured by a mortgage. The buyer then executed a second note, secured by a mortgage to executed a second note, secured by a mortgage to the bank, applying the bank loan proceeds to the purchase price of the property. The bank had actual knowledge of the prior note to the seller. The bank promptly recorded its mortgage. The buyer is now in default on both notes. There is no applicable statute. Which party has priority?\n\nA. The bank, because its loan satisfied the financing contingency in the contract of sale.\nB. The bank, because its note is secured by a purchase money mortgage.\nC. The seller, because the bank had actual knowledge of the seller's note.\nD. The seller, because he retained a vendor's lien that was first in time.\n"

This is based on the principle that a lender cannot claim ignorance of a prior interest of which they were actually aware.\n\nGiven the facts presented, option C seems most appropriate:\n\nC. The seller, because the bank had actual knowledge of the seller's note.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the specific laws and court decisions in the jurisdiction where the property is located would ultimately determine the outcome. In some jurisdictions, the bank's purchase money mortgage might still take priority due to specific statutory provisions or case law. Therefore, it's crucial to consult with a local attorney who specializes in real estate law to understand how these issues would be resolved in the relevant jurisdiction."
