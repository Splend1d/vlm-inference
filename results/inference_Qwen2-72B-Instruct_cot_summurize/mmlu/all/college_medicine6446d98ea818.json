Let's look at each option:\n\nA. 5\u2019 \u2013 GCATCCTCATG \u2013 3\u2019\nThis sequence has a point mutation (G -> C) but no deletion.\n\nB. 5\u2019 \u2013 TGATCCCAG \u2013 3\u2019\nThis sequence shows a point mutation (G -> T) and a deletion of several nucleotides (A, TC). However, it's not clear which nucleotides were deleted originally because the change is too drastic to match the original sequence with just a single point mutation and a deletion.\n\nC. 5\u2019 \u2013 GGTCCTCATC \u2013 3\u2019\nThis sequence has a point mutation (A -> T) and no deletion.\n\nD. 5\u2019 \u2013 GGATCCATG \u2013 3\u2019\nThis sequence shows a deletion of the TCA sequence and no point mutation, which matches the description of a single point mutation (which didn't occur here) and a deletion.\n\nThe question specifies that there should be both a point mutation and a deletion. The only answer that fits this description is D, as the deletion of 'TCA' can be seen, but technically, it does not show a point mutation. However, given the options provided, and assuming a slight error in the question's requirement for a point mutation, D is the closest match to a deletion event.\n\nSo the correct answer based on the deletion criteria alone would be:\n\nD. 5\u2019 \u2013 GGATCCATG \u2013 3\u2019"
