To calculate the number of independent parameters, we need to understand that for each node in the Bayesian network, we need to specify a conditional probability distribution (CPD) that describes how the node's probability depends on its parents.\n\nIn this case, we have four nodes: H, P, U, and W. Let's assume each node can take on two values (binary).\n\n- Node W has no parents, so it requires 1 parameter to specify its CPD (P(W=1)).\n- Node P has one parent (W), so it requires 2 parameters to specify its CPD (P(P=1|W=0), P(P=1|W=1)).\n- Node H also has no parents, similar to W, requiring 1 parameter (P(H=1)).\n- Node U is the most complex with two parents (H and P). Its CPD will require specifying probabilities for each combination of its parents' states. Since there are 2^2 = 4 combinations of parent states, and for each combination, we need to specify the probability of U being in one state (the other state's probability is determined by subtracting from 1), we need 4 - 1 = 3 parameters for U.\n\nAdding these up:\n\n- For W: 1 parameter\n- For P: 2 parameters\n- For H: 1 parameter\n- For U: 3 parameters\n\nThis sums up to a total of 7 independent parameters.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. 7."
