Hence, Statement 1 is False.\n\nThe VC (Vapnik-Chervonenkis) dimension of a line in a plane is indeed 3, as any three points that are not collinear cannot be shattered by lines. However, the statement seems to suggest that the VC dimension should be at most 2 because it presents an example of 3 points that cannot be shattered by any line. This is not how the VC dimension is defined; rather, the VC dimension is the largest number of points that can be shattered. Therefore, Statement 2 is also False, but for a different reason than what the statement implies.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\nB. False, False"
