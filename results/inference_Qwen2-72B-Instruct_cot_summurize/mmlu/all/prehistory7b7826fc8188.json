The Upper Paleolithic was characterized by long-distance trade networks that facilitated the exchange of high-quality raw materials, such as flint and obsidian, over large areas. In contrast, during the Mesolithic period, trade networks were generally shorter and less extensive, with a focus on local resources and smaller-scale exchanges. However, it's important to note that trade patterns could vary widely depending on the specific region and time period being considered."
