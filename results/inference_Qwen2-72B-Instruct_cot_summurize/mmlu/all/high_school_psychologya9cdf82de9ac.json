Among the options you've provided, the components attributed to the collective unconscious are:\n\nB. Complexes - Although complexes can be part of an individual's personal unconscious, they can also emerge from the collective unconscious when archetypal contents become constellated around a particular theme or issue.\n\nC. Archetypes - These are the primary elements of the collective unconscious according to Jung. They are inherited potentials for certain types of experiences and behaviors that are common to all humans.\n\nOptions A (fictional finalisms) and D (feelings of inferiority) are not specifically associated with the collective unconscious as described by Jung. Fictional finalisms are more closely associated with Alfred Adler's concept of the creative self, while feelings of inferiority could be part of an individual's personal unconscious or ego complex rather than the collective unconscious."
