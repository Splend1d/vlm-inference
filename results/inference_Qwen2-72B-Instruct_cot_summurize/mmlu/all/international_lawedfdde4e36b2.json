A State may suspend particular rights by means of a derogation in circumstances that threaten its existence\n\nDerogations refer to the right of states under international law to temporarily suspend certain human rights obligations during a state of emergency, such as war or natural disaster, that threatens the life of the nation. This is usually done through a formal declaration to the relevant international body. However, even during such times, not all rights can be suspended, and the measures taken must be strictly required by the exigencies of the situation.\n\nOptions B and D are incorrect because they do not accurately describe what a derogation is in the context of international human rights law. Option B describes the process of individual complaint mechanisms which allow individuals to bring claims against states for alleged violations of their rights. Option D refers to enforcement mechanisms within human rights treaties, but this does not define what a derogation is."
