This does not directly give us information about the probability of both rain and sun occurring simultaneously. However, we can use the information given to find the probability.\n\nFirst, let's establish what we know:\n\n- The probability of rain (and implicitly, no sun) = 0.30.\n- The probability of no rain = 0.40.\n\nSince the probabilities must sum up to 1, the probability of rain (including both scenarios where it rains with or without sun) plus the probability of no rain should equal 1. We already have the probability of rain (which includes rain without sun), so we need to determine the probability of rain and sun together.\n\nLet's denote:\n- P(Rain and No Sun) = 0.30\n- P(No Rain) = 0.40\n- P(Sun) = P(No Rain) + P(Rain and Sun) since sunny days can occur either when it doesn't rain or when it rains but is still sunny.\n\nWe also know that:\n- P(Rain) = P(Rain and No Sun) + P(Rain and Sun)\n- P(Rain) + P(No Rain) = 1\n\nGiven that P(No Rain) = 0.40, then P(Rain) = 1 - 0.40 = 0.60.\n\nSince P(Rain) = 0.60 and P(Rain and No Sun) = 0.30, then:\n- P(Rain and Sun) = P(Rain) - P(Rain and No Sun) = 0.60 - 0.30 = 0.30\n\nSo, the probability of both rain and sun is 0.30, which corresponds to answer choice C. However, this assumes that \"rain\" and \"sun\" can occur simultaneously in the same scenario, which might be a stretch depending on how one interprets weather conditions. Typically, if it's raining, it wouldn't be considered sunny. But based on the question as posed and the logic applied, the answer is C. 0.30."
