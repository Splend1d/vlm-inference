This does not automatically make the conclusion false (untrue), nor does it guarantee that the conclusion is true. The material truth of the syllogism (whether the conclusion is actually true or false given the premises) is independent of its formal validity. Thus, an invalid syllogism might lead to a true conclusion by chance (option B) or to a false conclusion (option C)."
