In Christian usage, however, \"ecclesia\" refers to the community of believers, the Church as a whole, or a local congregation.\n\nNone of the options given directly match this definition, but option B comes closest. An ecclesia could be understood as a church organized around voluntary membership because the Christian church, especially in Protestant denominations, is often characterized by voluntary association of believers. However, it's important to note that the concept of an ecclesia encompasses more than just voluntary membership\u2014it also includes the idea of a gathered body of believers with shared beliefs and practices.\n\nTherefore, while none of the options perfectly define \"ecclesia,\" the most accurate choice would be:\n\nB. a church organized around voluntary rather than compulsory membership\n\nThis answer is the closest to capturing the essence of what an ecclesia represents in Christian theology, although it does not fully capture the historical or theological depth of the term."
