Therefore, people who provide us with more positive experiences (reinforcement) and fewer negative ones (punishment) are more likely to be attractive to us. However, it's worth noting that Byrne's theory has been criticized for oversimplifying the complex factors that contribute to attraction, and other theories have since emerged to provide a more nuanced understanding of this phenomenon."
