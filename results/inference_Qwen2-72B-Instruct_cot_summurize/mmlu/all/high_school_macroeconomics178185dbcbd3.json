It is inversely related to the price level because as prices rise (inflation), the same amount of money buys fewer goods and services, thus reducing the purchasing power of the currency. Conversely, when prices fall (deflation), the purchasing power of the currency increases because the same amount of money buys more goods and services.\n\nA. This option is incorrect because the purchasing power of a currency actually decreases with an increase in the cost of living, which is the opposite of varying directly.\nB. The purchasing power of a currency is not directly related to the savings rate. Savings rates may influence interest rates and investment levels, but they do not have a direct impact on purchasing power.\nD. While economic growth can lead to increased demand for goods and services, which might affect purchasing power indirectly through inflation or deflation, purchasing power does not vary directly with economic growth. Economic growth could potentially lead to both higher wages and higher prices, and the net effect on purchasing power would depend on the specific circumstances."
