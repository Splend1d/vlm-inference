                    "text": "The normal boiling point of a molecule is influenced by its molecular weight and the strength of intermolecular forces it experiences. The intermolecular forces include London dispersion forces (which increase with molecular size), dipole-dipole interactions, and hydrogen bonding.\n\nComparing the given options:\n\nA. CH\u2083CH\u2082CH\u2082CH\u2083 (Butane) - This is a nonpolar molecule with only London dispersion forces between its molecules. It has no additional functional groups that could lead to stronger intermolecular attractions.\n\nB. CH\u2083CH\u2082CH\u2082CH\u2082OH (1-Butanol) - This molecule is polar due to the presence of the hydroxyl group (-OH). It can form hydrogen bonds with other molecules of 1-butanol, which significantly increases the boiling point compared to butane.\n\nC. CH\u2083CH\u2082CH\u2082CH\u2082Cl (1-Chlorobutane) - This molecule is polar because of the chlorine atom, which creates a dipole moment. However, the intermolecular forces here are mainly London dispersion forces and weaker dipole-dipole interactions since chlorine does not form hydrogen bonds.\n\nD. CH\u2083CH\u2082CH\u2082CH\u2082Br (1-Bromobutane) - Similar to 1-chlorobutane, this molecule is polar due to the bromine atom, which also creates a dipole moment. Like 1-chlorobutane, it will have London dispersion forces and dipole-dipole interactions, but these forces will be stronger than in 1-chlorobutane because bromine is heavier than chlorine, leading to stronger London dispersion forces.\n\nIn summary:\n- Butane (A) has only London dispersion forces.\n- 1-Butanol (B) has hydrogen bonding capabilities in addition to London dispersion forces.\n- 1-Chlorobutane (C) has dipole-dipole interactions and London dispersion forces.\n- 1-Bromobutane (D) has dipole-dipole interactions and stronger London dispersion forces than 1-chlorobutane.\n\nHydrogen bonding is generally stronger than dipole-dipole interactions or London dispersion forces. Therefore, the molecule with the highest normal boiling point would be:\n\n**B. CH\u2083CH\u2082CH\u2082CH\u2082OH (1-Butanol)** due to its ability to form hydrogen bonds."
