US expansion was based on markets rather than territory post-1865\n\nAfter the Civil War (which ended in 1865), the focus of U.S. expansion shifted from acquiring new territories, as it had during the period of Manifest Destiny, to expanding economic influence through trade and commerce. This era saw an increased emphasis on building markets and economic relationships, both within the newly reunited country and abroad. The late 19th century is often characterized by the rise of industrialization, which fueled a need for both raw materials and markets for manufactured goods. This period also saw the emergence of American business interests in Asia and Latin America."
