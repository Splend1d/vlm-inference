The gut/brain signalling pathway controls energy intake to within 2% of requirements, even in people who are morbidly obese\nC.

Obesity occurs because gut hormone secretion becomes deranged and PYY (Peptide YY) secretion fails to give a satiety signal.\n\nThis statement highlights the importance of gut hormones in regulating appetite and how their dysfunction can contribute to obesity. Peptide YY is a hormone produced by the cells lining the small intestine and colon. It plays a crucial role in signaling fullness or satiety to the brain, thereby influencing food intake. In obesity, the regulation of such hormones can be disrupted, leading to a decreased sensation of fullness and increased calorie consumption.\n\nWhile statement D also touches upon an important aspect of obesity, namely the influence of palatable foods on eating behavior, it does not directly address the role of the intestine in obesity as comprehensively as statement A does. Statements B and C oversimplify the complex mechanisms underlying obesity, which involve a combination of genetic, hormonal, behavioral, and environmental factors."
