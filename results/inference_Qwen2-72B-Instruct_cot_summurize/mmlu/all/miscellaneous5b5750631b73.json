The SAE program is designed to complement classroom instruction by providing practical, hands-on learning experiences that reinforce agricultural education concepts and principles. Through SAE activities, students can develop and refine their skills in areas such as production, processing, marketing, and management, while also gaining valuable work experience and learning about entrepreneurship and leadership. While earning money and winning awards may be potential outcomes of participating in an SAE program, these are not the primary goals of the program."
