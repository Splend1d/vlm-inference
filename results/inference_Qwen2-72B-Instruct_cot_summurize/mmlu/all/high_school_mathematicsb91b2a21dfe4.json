The initial cost is a one-time expense of $800,000. The daily costs include operational costs of $250 and labor costs of $400, which together amount to $650 per day. If the restaurant has been open for \"D\" days, then the total daily costs are 650 * D. Adding this to the initial cost gives the total cost as 800,000 + 650 D."
