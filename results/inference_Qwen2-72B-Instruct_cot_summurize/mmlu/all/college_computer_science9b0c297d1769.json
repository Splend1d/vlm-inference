Two negative numbers (both with a sign bit of 1) are added and the result is positive (sign bit of 0).\n\nLet's examine each pair:\n\nA. `11111111` (which is -1 in decimal) + `00000001` (which is 1 in decimal)\n   - Adding these two numbers results in `00000000` (-1 + 1 = 0), which does not cause an overflow.\n\nB. `00000001` (which is 1 in decimal) + `10000000` (which is -128 in decimal)\n   - Adding these two numbers results in `10000001` (1 - 128 = -127), which does not cause an overflow.\n\nC. `11111111` (which is -1 in decimal) + `10000001` (which is -127 in decimal)\n   - Adding these two numbers results in `10000000` (-1 - 127 = -128), which does not cause an overflow.\n\nD. `10000001` (which is -127 in decimal) + `10101010` (which is -86 in decimal)\n   - Adding these two numbers results in `00101011` (-127 - 86 = -213, but in 8-bit two's complement, this wraps around to become 43 in decimal), which does cause an overflow because we started with two negative numbers and ended up with a positive number.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **D**."
