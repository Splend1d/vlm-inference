Cynical, enthusiastic\n\nDickens's description of the French Revolution in \"A Tale of Two Cities\" is filled with paradoxes and contrasts, highlighting the extreme conditions of the time. His tone can be seen as cynical because he emphasizes the contradictory nature of the events, suggesting that the revolution brought out both the best and the worst in people, and that the outcomes were uncertain and potentially disastrous.\n\nOn the other hand, Wordsworth's line from \"The Prelude,\" \"Bliss was it in that dawn to be alive. But to be young was very heaven,\" expresses an optimistic and enthusiastic view of the French Revolution. He sees the period as a time of great hope and possibility, especially for the youth who were witnessing the birth of a new era. The word \"bliss\" and the phrase \"very heaven\" convey a sense of joy and idealism that is absent from Dickens's more complex and conflicted portrayal."
