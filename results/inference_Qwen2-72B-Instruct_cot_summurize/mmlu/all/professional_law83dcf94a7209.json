Most of the coastline is privately owned by persons who have permanent or vacation residences on their coastal lands. A man purchased a two-acre tract of littoral (i. e. , coastal) land in the state. When the man bought the property, there was a narrow concrete walkway (about 20 feet in length and 5 feet in width) adjoining the land. The walkway, which was designed to provide pedestrian access to the beach, was owned by the State Coastal Commission. When the man moved into his beach house, he noticed that the walkway was rarely used. As a result, the man decided to enclose the walkway and construct a paddle ball court over the entire area. He did so without notifying the State Coastal Commission. He has continued to use this area in excess of the period required for adverse possession. In an appropriate action brought by the man to establish title to the walkway area, which of the following must he establish if he is to prevail?\n\nA. Real property interests can be abandoned by a governmental entity without an official vote.\nB. Lack of use of the walkway by the state created an irrevocable license in him.\nC. Real property interests can be lost by a state by adverse possession.\nD. Due to a defect in the chain of title, the state does not own this piece of land.\n"

This means that the man must show that he has continuously, openly, and exclusively used the property for a statutory period, typically defined by state law, without the permission of the owner. Thus, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Real property interests can be lost by a state by adverse possession.\n\nIt's important to note that adverse possession against a government entity is generally more difficult and may require a longer period of possession than against a private party. Additionally, some states have laws that specifically prohibit adverse possession claims against public property. The man would also have to ensure that no other legal principles, such as easements or public trust doctrines, protect the state's interest in the walkway."
