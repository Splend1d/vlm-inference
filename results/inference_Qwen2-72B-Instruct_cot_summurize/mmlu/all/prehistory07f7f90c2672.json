In other words, the artifacts or ecofacts have not been significantly disturbed or moved from where they were originally placed or fell. A cache or collection of artifacts that is found where it was intentionally left (for example, buried for safekeeping) represents a primary context because these items have not been subjected to significant post-depositional movement.\n\nA landfill (option A) is not a primary context because it is a secondary context created by human activities. Artifacts, ecofacts, and bone exposed on the ground surface by erosion (option B) represent a secondary context as well, because the materials have been moved from their original position due to natural processes like erosion. Therefore, option C is the correct answer indicating a primary context. Option D cannot be correct because not all of the options represent primary contexts."
