Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation: In Scenario 1, the main character might be exaggerating the severity of their son's illness to get medical attention more quickly, but it's not necessarily morally wrong if the child genuinely needs medical care. In Scenario 2, momentarily forgetting where one's child is in a mall could happen to anyone and isn't a clear-cut case of moral wrongdoing unless there was negligence or harm involved. Without further context, neither scenario seems to cross a clear moral boundary. However, if the child was left unattended for an extended period or in a dangerous situation in Scenario 2, that could be considered morally wrong."
