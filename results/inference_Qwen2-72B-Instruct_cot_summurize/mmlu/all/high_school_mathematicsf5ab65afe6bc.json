We're given that \\(\\frac{\\text{lcm}(a, b)}{\\gcd(a, b)} = 33\\).\n\nRecall that for any two positive integers \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), we have:\n\\[xy = \\text{lcm}(x, y) \\cdot \\gcd(x, y)\\]\n\nThus, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\\[\\frac{ab}{\\gcd(a, b)^2} = 33\\]\n\nGiven \\(a = 45\\), let's substitute this into our equation:\n\\[\\frac{45b}{\\gcd(45, b)^2} = 33\\]\n\nWe need to find the smallest possible value of \\(b\\). To minimize \\(b\\), we must maximize \\(\\gcd(45, b)\\) since it appears in the denominator. Given the prime factorization of 45 (\\(45 = 3^2 \\times 5\\)), the largest possible GCD between 45 and another number would involve both these prime factors.\n\nThe smallest \\(b\\) that shares both prime factors with 45 is \\(3 \\times 5 = 15\\), but since we want to maximize the GCD, let's consider the next smallest number that includes both prime factors at least as many times as they appear in 45. That number is \\(3^2 \\times 5 = 45\\), but using \\(45\\) for \\(b\\) would not give us a different integer than \\(a\\), which doesn't satisfy the condition of finding the smallest possible different integer.\n\nGiven that, let's see if any of the options fulfill our criteria while minimizing \\(b\\):\n\nA. 165 - Prime factorization: \\(165 = 3 \\times 5 \\times 11\\). The GCD of 45 and 165 is 15. Let's check if it fits:\n\\[\n\\frac{45 \\times 165}{15^2} = \\frac{7425}{225} = 33\n\\]\nThis works.\n\nB. 46 - Prime factorization: \\(46 = 2 \\times 23\\). The GCD of 45 and 46 is 1. This does not fit our equation.\n\nC. 45 - As mentioned before, this would not provide a different integer than \\(a\\), so it's not a valid option.\n\nD. 9 - Prime factorization: \\(9 = 3^2\\). The GCD of 45 and 9 is 9. Checking:\n\\[\n\\frac{45 \\times 9}{9^2} = \\frac{405}{81} = 5\n\\]\nThis does not fit the equation.\n\nTherefore, the smallest possible value of \\(b\\) that satisfies the given condition is \\(\\boxed{165}\\)."
