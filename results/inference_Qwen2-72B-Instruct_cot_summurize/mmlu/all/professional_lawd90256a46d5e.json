The parking attendant directed the defendant to leave her keys in the car, and he handed her a receipt as she left. Following dinner, the defendant went back to the parking lot and handed her receipt to the attendant who informed her that the parking charge would be $14. Visibly irate, she told the attendant that $14 was much too high for a two-hour parking fee. The parking attendant responded that unless she paid the $14, he could not return her car. She adamantly refused to pay the $14, and her friend, with whom she was having dinner, drove the defendant home in her car. Later that same night, the defendant decided to regain possession of her car with a spare set of keys. She returned to the lot and drove her car home. If the defendant is subsequently charged with larceny, she will most likely be found\n\nA. guilty, because she failed to pay the $14 before regaining possession of her car.\nB. guilty, because she was under a binding contractual obligation to pay the parking fee.\nC. not guilty, because the $14 charge was excessively high.\nD. not guilty, because the defendant cannot be charged with larceny of her own motor vehicle.\n"

Since the car in question belongs to the defendant, she cannot be charged with larceny for taking her own property. While there may have been a contractual dispute over the parking fee, this does not convert the act into larceny. The defendant's refusal to pay the fee and subsequent retrieval of her car do not meet the legal definition of larceny."
