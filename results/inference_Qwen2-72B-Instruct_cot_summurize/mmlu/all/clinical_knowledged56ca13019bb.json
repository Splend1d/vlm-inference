Unilateral fixed dilated pupil.\n\nThis can be indicative of a IIIrd cranial nerve palsy, which innervates most of the muscles controlling eye movement and the constriction of the pupil (through the Edinger-Westphal nucleus). A unilateral fixed dilated pupil may indicate increased intracranial pressure or an aneurysm, both of which are neurosurgical emergencies."
