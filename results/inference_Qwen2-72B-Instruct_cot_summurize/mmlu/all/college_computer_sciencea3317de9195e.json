Finding a minimum spanning tree in an undirected graph with positive-integer edge weights - This is correct, as Kruskal's or Prim's algorithms can be used, which are both greedy algorithms.\n\nII. Finding a maximum clique in an undirected graph - This is incorrect, as the maximum clique problem is NP-complete, meaning there is no known polynomial-time solution, including a greedy algorithm.\n\nIII. Finding a maximum flow from a source node to a sink node in a directed graph with positive-integer edge capacities - This is incorrect, as the Ford-Fulkerson method is typically used to find maximum flow, which is not a greedy algorithm but rather an augmenting path algorithm.\n\nSo the answer is A.
