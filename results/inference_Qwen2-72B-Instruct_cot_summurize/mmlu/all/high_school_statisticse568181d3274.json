In other words, we need to find the z-score corresponding to the 25th percentile and then convert that z-score back into an actual mass using the mean and standard deviation.\n\nThe z-score for the 25th percentile is -0.674 (since 25% of the data falls below this point in a normal distribution).\n\nThe formula to convert from a z-score to a raw score (x) is:\n\n\\[ x = \\mu + (z * \\sigma) \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( \\mu \\) is the mean,\n- \\( \\sigma \\) is the standard deviation, and\n- \\( z \\) is the z-score.\n\nGiven:\n- \\( \\mu = 45 \\) g\n- \\( \\sigma = 4 \\) g\n- \\( z = -0.674 \\)\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula gives:\n\n\\[ x = 45 + (-0.674 * 4) \\]\n\\[ x = 45 - 2.696 \\]\n\\[ x = 42.304 \\]\n\nRounding to one decimal place, the 25th percentile of the masses of all the eggs is approximately 42.3 g.\n\nSo the correct answer is B. 42.3 g."
