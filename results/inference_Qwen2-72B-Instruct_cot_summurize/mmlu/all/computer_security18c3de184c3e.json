By overwriting the return address to point to the location of that code\n\nIn a buffer overflow attack, an attacker can input more data than a program's buffer can handle. This excess data overflows the buffer and spills into adjacent memory locations. If this overflow occurs on the stack, it can overwrite the return address that is saved by the function call. By overwriting the return address with the address of the attacker-injected code, the program will execute that code when it returns from the function, thus allowing the attacker to run arbitrary code on the system."
