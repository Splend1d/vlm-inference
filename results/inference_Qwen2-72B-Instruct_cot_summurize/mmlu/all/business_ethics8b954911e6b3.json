Globalisation, Cultural, Legal, Accountability\n\nGlobalisation is a key driving force shaping the current and future state of business ethics, in particular regarding cultural, legal, and accountability-related issues. As businesses expand across borders, they encounter diverse cultural norms and legal systems, which can create ethical dilemmas. The need for companies to be accountable to multiple stakeholders, including shareholders, employees, customers, and communities, becomes more complex in a global context. This requires businesses to develop robust ethical standards that can be applied consistently across different regions while respecting local customs and regulations."
