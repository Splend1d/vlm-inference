This refers to the Northwest Ordinance of 1787, which established a process for the orderly expansion of the United States into new territories and the eventual admission of those territories as states. It also set aside land for public education and banned slavery in the Northwest Territory. The Northwest Ordinance was a significant accomplishment because it provided a blueprint for the future expansion of the country and helped to resolve issues related to land claims by individual states."
