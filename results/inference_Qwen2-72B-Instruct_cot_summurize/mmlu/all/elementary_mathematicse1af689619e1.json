There are 2 cups in a pint.\n\nErin made 12 pints of juice, so in cups that would be:\n\\[12 \\text{ pints} \\times 2 \\text{ cups/pint} = 24 \\text{ cups}\\]\n\nErin drinks 3 cups of juice each day. To find out how many days it will take her to drink all the juice, we divide the total amount of juice by her daily consumption:\n\n\\[\\frac{24 \\text{ cups}}{3 \\text{ cups/day}} = 8 \\text{ days}\\]\n\nSo, Erin will take 8 days to drink all of the juice she made.\n\nThe correct answer is C. 8 days."
