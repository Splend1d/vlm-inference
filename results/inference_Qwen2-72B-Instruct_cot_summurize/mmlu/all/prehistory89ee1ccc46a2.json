In contrast, while individual Mayan city-states could be sizable, with some estimates suggesting that Tikal, for example, may have had a population of around 10,000 to 90,000 during its peak, it's unlikely any single Mayan city-state would have rivaled the size of Mohenjo-daro.\n\nThe other options do not fit the description of Mayan city-states:\n\nA. The Mayan civilization was indeed comprised of autonomous dynasties that ruled over city-states.\n\nB. While there are differences, there are also similarities between the political organization of Mayan city-states and ancient Egyptian communities, both of which featured strong centralized authority and religious significance for rulers.\n\nC. Mayan city-states were supported by large agricultural hinterlands, often centered around maize cultivation."
