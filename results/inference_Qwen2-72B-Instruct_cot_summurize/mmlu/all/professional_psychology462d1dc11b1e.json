It involves heightened suggestibility and responsiveness to suggestions made by the hypnotist. While there may be some physiological changes during hypnosis, such as a decrease in heart rate or respiration, these are not the defining characteristics of hypnosis. Increased compliance to situational demands can occur, but it is the alteration in mental states that is most central to the experience of hypnosis. The term \"artificial sleep\" is a historical misnomer and does not accurately describe the state of hypnosis."
