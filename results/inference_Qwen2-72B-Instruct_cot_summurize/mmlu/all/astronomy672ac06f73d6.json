                    "text": "The correct answer is D. As the cloud shrank, its gravitational potential energy was converted to kinetic energy and then into thermal energy. This process is known as gravitational contraction, and it is the primary mechanism by which the solar nebula heated up as it collapsed to form the Sun and the planets. Collisions among planetesimals (option A) could have contributed to heating in specific regions of the nebula, but the overall heating was due to the conversion of gravitational potential energy into heat. Radiation from other nearby stars (option B) or a shock wave from a nearby supernova (option C) could have provided some additional heating, but these were not the primary causes of the solar nebula's heating."
