They can also be used for urostomies, but it's less common because urine is usually very fluid and may require a drainable pouch for better management. In the immediate post-operative period, closed pouches might be used to monitor output and ensure there are no leaks from the stoma. Therefore, options A, B, C, and D could all potentially be correct depending on the specific circumstances, but the most common use case would be option A, where the patient has a semi-formed or liquid output."
