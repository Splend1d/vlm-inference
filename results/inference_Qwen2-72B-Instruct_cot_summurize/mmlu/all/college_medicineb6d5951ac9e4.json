                    "text": "The correct answer is B. Maintains alveoli in an open state.\n\nSurfactant, produced by type II alveolar cells, plays a crucial role in maintaining the stability of the alveoli by reducing surface tension at the air-liquid interface within the lungs. By doing so, it prevents the collapse of the alveoli during exhalation and ensures that they remain open for gas exchange. This is particularly important in premature infants whose lungs may not have reached full maturity and thus do not produce enough surfactant on their own. Without sufficient surfactant, the alveoli can collapse, leading to respiratory distress and impaired oxygenation, as seen in Neonatal Respiratory Distress Syndrome (NRDS)."
