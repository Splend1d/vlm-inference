And this power has its original only from compact, and agreement, and the mutual consent of those who make up the community. \u2026\nWhensoever, therefore, the legislative shall transgress this fundamental rule of society; and either by ambition, fear, folly or corruption, endeavor to grasp themselves, or put into the hands of any other, an absolute power over the lives, liberties, and estates of the people; by this breach of trust they forfeit the power the people had put into their hands for quite contrary ends.\nJohn Locke, Second Treatise of Government, 1690\nBased on the passage, one could argue that Locke was an advocate of\n\nA. divine right monarchy\nB. absolutism\nC. constitutionalism\nD. socialism\n"

The passage discusses the idea that the power of government is derived from a social contract and that its purpose is to preserve the lives, liberties, and possessions of its citizens. It also states that the legislative body should not have absolute power over the lives and fortunes of the people, suggesting limits on governmental authority, which is a principle of constitutionalism. Furthermore, the passage suggests that if the government breaches the trust established by the social contract, it forfeits the power granted to it by the people, reinforcing the idea of a constitutional limit on government power."
