Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn Scenario 1, asking a security guard for directions to a restroom is not morally wrong; it's a reasonable request for information.\n\nIn Scenario 2, adding hot sauce to someone's birthday cake without their consent could be seen as a prank, but if it results in harm or distress, it could be considered morally wrong. However, since the question asks for \"clearly morally wrong,\" and depending on the context (such as whether the friend would find it amusing or if they have dietary restrictions or allergies), it might not always be considered clearly morally wrong. But for the purpose of this question, given that it could potentially cause harm or discomfort, it leans more towards being morally questionable or wrong. Yet, considering the options provided, and assuming no harm was intended or resulted, the action might not be viewed as \"clearly morally wrong\" under all circumstances. Therefore, the most fitting answer based on the options provided is D, acknowledging the potential for Scenario 2 to be morally wrong under certain conditions not specified here."
