When they got there, they saw a high-ticket group, apparently high-society people, attending an air history video. They took over the meeting room, waving their guns menacingly, and demanded their watches, wallets and jewelry. When they took inventory of their bounty, they found that the customers were actually from a university history club and that they had little real jewelry, watches or wallets, they became enraged and struck several of the participants, killing one and badly injuring another. Which of the following is the most accurate list of common law crimes that they may likely be convicted of? Do not select attempted crimes if they were consummated.\n\nA. Attempted burglary, robbery and attempted murder.\nB. False imprisonment, attempted murder and murder.\nC. False imprisonment, robbery, aggravated assault, and murder.\nD. False imprisonment, attempted robbery and first degree murder.\n"

                    "text": "The scenario described involves multiple criminal acts that can be categorized under various common law crimes. Let's analyze each option based on the actions taken by the two men:\n\nA. Attempted burglary, robbery, and attempted murder: This option is incorrect because the crimes of burglary (unlawful entry into a building with intent to commit a felony) and attempted murder (taking action to kill someone but failing) do not accurately reflect the situation. The men did not enter the building unlawfully (as it was open for the airshow), and the murder did occur, so it cannot be attempted.\n\nB. False imprisonment, attempted murder, and murder: This option includes false imprisonment (confining someone without lawful authority) and murder (unlawfully killing someone). However, it does not include the actual crime of robbery (taking property from someone by force or threat) which did occur. Additionally, the attempted murder charge is not applicable since at least one murder was completed.\n\nC. False imprisonment, robbery, aggravated assault, and murder: This option seems to cover all the bases. The men confined the attendees against their will (false imprisonment), took their belongings by force (robbery), caused serious injury to some (aggravated assault), and killed one person (murder).\n\nD. False imprisonment, attempted robbery, and first-degree murder: This option incorrectly suggests attempted robbery, when the robbery was indeed completed. It also mentions first-degree murder, which typically involves premeditation, whereas the given scenario does not provide evidence of premeditation. However, depending on jurisdiction, the murder could potentially be considered first-degree if the act was found to be deliberate and done in the course of committing another felony (felony murder rule).\n\nGiven the information provided, option C\u2014False imprisonment, robbery, aggravated assault, and murder\u2014most accurately reflects the potential common law crimes for which the two men may be convicted."
