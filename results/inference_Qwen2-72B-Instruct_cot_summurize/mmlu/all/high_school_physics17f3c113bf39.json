Since the disk starts from rest and has a constant angular acceleration, we can use the equation for the angular displacement (\\(\\theta\\)) as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\theta = \\frac{1}{2} \\alpha t^2\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\alpha\\) is the angular acceleration (2.0 rad/s\\(^2\\)) and \\(t\\) is the time (4.0 s).\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\n\\[\n\\theta = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 2.0 \\times (4.0)^2 = 16.0 \\text{ rad}\n\\]\n\nThe total distance \\(d\\) traveled by a point on the rim of the disk is equal to the circumference of the circle traced out by that point, which is equal to the radius of the disk times the angle through which the point moves (in radians). Therefore:\n\n\\[\nd = r\\theta\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(r\\) is the radius of the disk (0.1 m) and \\(\\theta\\) is the angular displacement (16.0 rad).\n\nSubstituting the known values:\n\n\\[\nd = 0.1 \\times 16.0 = 1.6 \\text{ m}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. 1.6 m."
