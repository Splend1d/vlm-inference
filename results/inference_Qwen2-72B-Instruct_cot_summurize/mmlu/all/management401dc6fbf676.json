To operate the organisation's status system.\n\nDrucker's five guiding principles of management are:\n1. The purpose of business is to create a customer.\n2. The two functions of management are marketing and innovation.\n3. The goal of a business is not profit, but rather to stay in business (profit is a necessary condition for staying in business).\n4. The responsibility of management is to balance the claims of all stakeholders: stockholders, employees, customers, suppliers, the local community, and the government.\n5. The focus of management should be on making people's strengths effective and their weaknesses irrelevant, enhancing the ability of people to contribute, and integrating people in a common venture by thinking through, setting and exemplifying the organizational objectives, values, and goals. \n\nNote that the last principle is a combination of three separate ideas that Drucker emphasized throughout his work, but it is often presented as a single principle."
