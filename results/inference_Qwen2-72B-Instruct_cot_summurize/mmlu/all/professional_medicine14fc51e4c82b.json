The symptoms began after returning from a camping trip in New Mexico. He appears ill and lethargic and can barely answer questions. His temperature is 39.2\u00b0C (102.5\u00b0F), pulse is 120/min, respirations are 22/min, and blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg. Physical examination shows generalized scattered black maculae. Examination of the right upper extremity shows an erythematous, solid, tender mass on the underside of the upper extremity just above the elbow; the mass is draining blood and necrotic material. The most effective antibiotic for this patient\u2019s disorder will interfere with which of the following cellular processes or enzymes?\n\nA. DNA helicase\nB. Glucuronosyltransferase\nC. Proteasomal degradation\nD. Ribosomal assembly\n"

The most effective antibiotics for treating plague are aminoglycosides (such as streptomycin) and tetracyclines (such as doxycycline). These antibiotics work by inhibiting protein synthesis in bacterial cells, specifically by binding to the bacterial ribosome and interfering with its function. Therefore, the correct answer is D: Ribosomal assembly."
