Societies that are able to adapt to changing conditions, whether they be environmental, economic, or social, are more likely to survive than those that cannot. This includes the ability to end warfare, manage resources effectively, and make necessary changes to societal structures and practices. However, it is ultimately the society's response to these challenges that determines its fate."
