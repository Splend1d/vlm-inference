Apply the punitive damage rule in California since that is where the accident occurred.\n\nIn this situation, the court would typically apply the law of the place where the injury occurred, which is known as the lex loci delicti (the law of the place of the wrong). Since the accident took place in California, the court would likely apply California's law on punitive damages, even though the case is being heard in a federal district court in Washington. This is because federal courts sitting in diversity jurisdiction (where the parties are from different states) apply the substantive law of the state in which they sit, but in cases involving choice of law issues, they apply the conflict of laws rules of the forum state (in this case, Washington). However, in tort cases, the law of the place where the injury occurred is often given precedence."
