A zamindar who paid revenue to the Mogul was clearly in a position of dependence, and if he wished to establish a claim to sovereignty, the first step was to refuse, or omit to pay revenue. Such an omission might, however, arise from various other causes, and it is probable that in Rajputana, Central India, and Chota Nagpur there were numerous chiefs and tribes occupying what constitutional lawyers would regard as an anomalous position, sometimes paying the stipulated revenue, sometimes in open rebellion, and sometimes enjoying practical independence because the Mogul authorities found it inconvenient to undertake active measures of coercion.\"\nW.H. Moreland, India at the Death of Akbar, 1920\nZamindars had an ability \"to establish a claim to sovereignty\" largely due to the Mughal Empire's policy of\n\nA. religious toleration\nB. universal taxation\nC. martial law\nD. suffrage\n"

This suggests that the Mughal Empire's policy of universal taxation (Option B) was not being enforced strictly enough to prevent such claims to sovereignty. However, the direct reason for their ability to claim sovereignty is not explicitly attributed to any of the options provided except for the fact that they could stop paying revenue. But looking at the context and the options given, none directly correlate with the reason mentioned. If we have to choose from the given options, Option B (universal taxation) seems the closest but in a reversed logic: the lack of strict enforcement of universal taxation allowed them to make such claims.\n\nHowever, if we consider the spirit of the question and the historical context, the correct answer would be something along the lines of the Mughal Empire's policy of decentralization or leniency in tax collection, which is not listed among the options. The closest match in the list provided would be Option B, but it's important to note that this is a somewhat indirect inference based on the information given. The Mughal Empire's vast size and complex administrative structure meant that local autonomy was often tolerated, especially when it came to tax collection and enforcement. This leniency could be seen as a form of decentralization, allowing local rulers like zamindars to exert more control over their territories and potentially assert their independence."
