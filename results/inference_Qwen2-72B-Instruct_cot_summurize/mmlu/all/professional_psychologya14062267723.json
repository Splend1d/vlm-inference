This approach focuses on helping individuals recognize and challenge the ways in which societal norms and expectations, particularly gender roles, limit their choices and opportunities. It aims to empower individuals to take control of their lives and make choices that align with their own values and desires, rather than conforming to external pressures. In this case, Fara may benefit from exploring how traditional gender roles have influenced her experiences and beliefs about household responsibilities and working towards a more equitable distribution of labor within her family. However, it's worth noting that all four options listed (Self In Relation, Feminist Object Relations, Empowerment Therapy, and Household Responsibilities) could potentially be relevant to feminist therapy, depending on the specific goals and focus of the therapeutic work."
