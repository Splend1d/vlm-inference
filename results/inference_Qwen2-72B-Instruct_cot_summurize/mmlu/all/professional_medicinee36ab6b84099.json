The patient's history of excessive energy, decreased need for sleep, distractibility, and labile affect are all indicative of a manic episode, which is a hallmark of bipolar disorder. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is C. Bipolar disorder.\n\nAntisocial personality disorder is characterized by a pervasive pattern of disregard for, and violation of, the rights of others. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder is characterized by persistent symptoms of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity that interfere with functioning or development. Borderline personality disorder is characterized by a pervasive pattern of instability in interpersonal relationships, self-image, and affects, and marked impulsivity. These disorders do not fit the patient's presentation as well as bipolar disorder does."
