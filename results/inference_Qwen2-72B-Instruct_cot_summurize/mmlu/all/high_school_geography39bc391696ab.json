It greatly improved crop yields in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nThe Green Revolution, which took place primarily during the 1960s and 1970s, did indeed change traditional farming methods (A), was an effort to increase food production to feed a growing global population (B), and focused on increasing yields of major crops like rice, wheat, and maize (C). However, it is not accurate to say that it greatly improved crop yields in sub-Saharan Africa (D). While the Green Revolution had significant success in parts of Asia and Latin America, its impact in sub-Saharan Africa was more limited due to various factors including inadequate infrastructure, lack of access to improved seeds and fertilizers, and political instability."
