All organisms use essentially the same genetic code.\n\nThis is the piece of evidence that most strongly supports the common origin of all life on Earth because it indicates that there is a fundamental unity at the molecular level among all living things, from bacteria to humans. The fact that all known life forms use the same genetic code suggests that they share a common ancestor that had this code. This shared genetic code is a powerful indicator of a common evolutionary history."
