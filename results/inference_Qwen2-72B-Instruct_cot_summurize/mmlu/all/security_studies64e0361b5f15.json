Isolation of the effect that the threat of force or the limited use of force, in a given case is dependent on the sufficiency of the \"stick\" for success. The question to ask is whether the stick employed was sufficient to produce compliance.\nB. Success is an independent function from the amount of coercion required to produce compliance. Ideally, coercion should be required to solve all disputes. If the threshold from persuasion to coercion is crossed, the degree of success is equated to the production intended outcome: to stop or undo an action.\nC. In protracted diplomatic affairs involving a series of inconclusive exchanges which results in tactical/temporary successes followed by new acts of non-compliance, the production of the intended outcome (compliance and ceasing of actions) is regarded as a success from a policy goal perspective.\nD. Coercive diplomacy success resulting from the use of threats and sanctions (inducements may, but need not, be employed) are classified as cheap successes. Successes resulting from the use of limited force count as costly ones. Compliance can only be considered a success if the outcome is lasting.\n"

                    "text": "Defining coercive diplomacy success is problematic for several reasons:\n\nA. Isolation of the effect of the threat of force or the limited use of force: It is difficult to isolate the impact of coercion from other factors influencing the outcome of a diplomatic situation. The success of coercive diplomacy may also depend on the credibility of the threat, the perception of the target state, and the balance of power between the parties involved.\n\nB. Success as an independent function from the amount of coercion: While it might seem ideal for coercion to resolve all disputes, the reality is more complex. The amount of coercion required to achieve compliance may have unintended consequences, such as escalation, backlash, or damage to long-term relationships. Moreover, the use of excessive coercion could undermine the legitimacy of the coercing party and create international backlash.\n\nC. Protracted diplomatic affairs and temporary successes: In cases where there are multiple rounds of negotiations and periods of non-compliance, it becomes challenging to determine when a true success has been achieved. A temporary cessation of non-compliant actions may not necessarily lead to a lasting resolution of the underlying issues. This makes it difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of coercive diplomacy in such situations.\n\nD. Cheap versus costly successes: Classifying successes based on the resources expended (cheap or costly) does not fully capture the complexity of coercive diplomacy outcomes. The costliness of a success may be offset by strategic gains, while a cheap success may be short-lived or have negative long-term consequences. Additionally, the classification of a success as cheap or costly does not account for the potential human and economic costs associated with the use of force.\n\nIn summary, defining coercive diplomacy success is problematic due to the difficulty in isolating the effects of coercion, the complexity of measuring success independently from the amount of coercion used, the challenges of evaluating success in protracted diplomatic affairs, and the limitations of classifying successes based on resource expenditure."
