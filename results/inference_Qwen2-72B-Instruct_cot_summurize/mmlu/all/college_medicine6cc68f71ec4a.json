The increase in the number of women participating in sports has led to a larger pool of talented athletes, which has contributed to the improvement in world record performances. Additionally, advancements in training techniques, nutrition, and sports science have also played a significant role in enhancing women's athletic performance. While it is true that women have started training at an earlier age, this alone does not account for the rapid improvement in world record performances. And there is no scientific evidence to support the claim that women have evolved a greater muscle mass or that they can now run faster than men."
