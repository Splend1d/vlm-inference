Three weeks after the robbery, a defendant was arrested and charged with the crime. At trial, the prosecuting attorney seeks to introduce evidence that the defendant had previously committed a robbery wearing a yellow ski mask, goggles, and a fluorescent yellow jumpsuit. Upon objection by the defendant's attorney, the proffered evidence should be\n\nA. admissible as circumstantial evidence that the defendant committed the crime as charged.\nB. admissible, to show the identity of the defendant.\nC. inadmissible, because the probative value of the evidence is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.\nD. inadmissible, because it constitutes improper character evidence.\n"

However, such evidence can also be highly prejudicial, leading the jury to conclude that the defendant is likely guilty simply because they have committed a similar crime in the past, rather than on the basis of evidence directly linking them to this specific crime.\n\nRule 404(b) of the Federal Rules of Evidence generally prohibits the admission of evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts to prove a person's character in order to show action in conformity therewith. However, such evidence may be admissible for other purposes, such as proving motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, absence of mistake, or lack of accident.\n\nIn this case, the evidence could be admissible under Rule 404(b) for the purpose of showing identity due to the unique and distinctive nature of the clothing worn during both the prior crime and the current charge. However, under Rule 403 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, even if evidence is relevant, it may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusing the issues, misleading the jury, undue delay, wasting time, or needlessly presenting cumulative evidence.\n\nGiven the highly distinctive nature of the attire used in both crimes, which makes it more likely that the same person committed both, the evidence might be deemed admissible to show identity. However, the court must carefully consider whether the probative value of this evidence is outweighed by the risk of unfair prejudice. If the court determines that the risk of unfair prejudice is too great, then the evidence would be ruled:\n\nC. inadmissible, because the probative value of the evidence is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.\n\nHowever, without knowing the specifics of the case and the context in which the evidence would be presented, it is impossible to definitively determine how a judge would rule. The decision would depend on the specific circumstances of the case and the judge's interpretation of the rules of evidence."
