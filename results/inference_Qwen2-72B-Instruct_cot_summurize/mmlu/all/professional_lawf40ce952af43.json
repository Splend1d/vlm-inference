The bakery sued the mill in a federal court in State A for breach of contract, seeking $100,000 in damages. The contract between the bakery and the mill contained a clause designating State B courts as the sole venue for litigating disputes arising under the contract. Under precedent of the highest court in State A, forum-selection clauses are unenforceable as against public policy; under U.S. Supreme Court precedent, such clauses are enforceable. The mill has moved to transfer the case to a federal court in State B, citing the forum-selection clause in the parties' contract and asserting the facts that the flour was produced in State B and that the majority of likely witnesses are in State B. Is the court likely to grant the mill's motion?\n\nA. No, because State A law treats forum- selection clauses as unenforceable.\nB. No, because the mill should have instead filed a motion to dismiss for improper venue.\nC. Yes, because federal common law makes the forum-selection clause controlling.\nD. Yes, because federal law governs transfers of venue, and it would be more convenient for the witnesses and parties to litigate the claim in State B.\n"

Yes, because federal law governs transfers of venue, and it would be more convenient for the witnesses and parties to litigate the claim in State B.\n\nIn this scenario, the federal court will consider the forum-selection clause in the contract, which is generally enforceable under federal common law as per U.S. Supreme Court precedent. The fact that State A considers such clauses unenforceable does not override federal law in this context. The court will also take into account the convenience of the witnesses and the location where the flour was produced, which supports transferring the case to State B. Therefore, the court is likely to grant the mill's motion to transfer the case to a federal court in State B."
