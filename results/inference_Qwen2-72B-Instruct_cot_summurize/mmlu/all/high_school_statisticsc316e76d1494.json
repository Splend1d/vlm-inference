                    "text": "The correct answer is B. If Ha is true, the probability of failing to reject H0 is 0.2.\n\nExplanation:\n\n- A Type I error occurs when you reject a true null hypothesis (H0). The probability of committing a Type I error is given by the significance level (\u03b1), which is not provided in this question. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the probability of committing a Type I error is 0.1 from the information given.\n  \n- Power of a test is defined as the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when it is false (i.e., when the alternative hypothesis Ha is true). In this case, the power of the test is 0.8 when Ha: p = 0.7 is true. This means that if the alternative hypothesis is true, there is an 80% chance that the test will correctly reject the null hypothesis. The complement of the power (1 - power) is the probability of committing a Type II error (\u03b2), which is failing to reject the null hypothesis when it is false. So, \u03b2 = 1 - power = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2. This implies that if Ha is true, the probability of failing to reject H0 is indeed 0.2.\n\n- The probability of committing a Type II error is 0.2 (not 0.3), as explained in the previous point.\n\nTherefore, option B is the only valid conclusion based on the information provided. Option D is incorrect because not all of the statements are valid conclusions."
