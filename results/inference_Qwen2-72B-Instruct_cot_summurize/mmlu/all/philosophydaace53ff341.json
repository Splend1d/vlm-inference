Desiring something that goes against the natural order of the universe (like immortality for mortals) would be seen as an attachment to something that is not within our control, which Stoics believe leads to suffering. Instead, Stoics advocate for focusing on what is within our control\u2014our own thoughts, actions, and responses to events."
