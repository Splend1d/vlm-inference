The most liquid measure of money is M1.\n\nM1 includes the most liquid components of the money supply, such as physical currency, demand deposits (like checking accounts), and other highly liquid assets that can be quickly converted to cash. This makes it the most liquid measure of money in the U.S. The other options are not accurate:\n\nA. The money supply is not backed by gold reserves; the U.S. abandoned the gold standard in 1971.\nB. M2 is more inclusive than M1 but less liquid because it includes savings deposits, small time deposits, and non-institutional money market funds, which are not as liquid as M1 components.\nC. M1 is not larger than M3; M3 is a broader measure that includes all components of M2 plus large time deposits, institutional money market funds, and other large liquid assets."
