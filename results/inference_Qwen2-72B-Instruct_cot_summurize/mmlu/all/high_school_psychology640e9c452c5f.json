However, after volunteering at the soup kitchen, she realized that her situation was better than many others, thus shifting her adaptation level. This experience helped her appreciate what she had, leading to an increase in her happiness level. The other options do not fit as well into this scenario. \n\nRelative deprivation (A) refers to the feeling of being deprived of something to which one believes they are entitled to have. In this case, it doesn't explain why Tamika feels happier after volunteering.\n\nYerkes-Dodson arousal (C) theory deals with the relationship between performance and arousal levels. It does not explain changes in happiness based on social comparison or appreciation.\n\nDiathesis-stress model (D) refers to the theory that psychological disorders are caused by the interaction of an inherited vulnerability (diathesis) and stressful life events. This theory does not apply to Tamika's increased happiness."
