Compare AVC to MR.\n\nIn the short run, a competitive firm should consider shutting down if the price (which is also the marginal revenue, MR) falls below the average variable cost (AVC). This is because the firm would be unable to cover its variable costs and continuing production would result in greater losses than simply paying fixed costs while shut down. If the price is above or equal to AVC, the firm should continue operating in the short run, even if it cannot cover all its total costs (including fixed costs), as it can at least cover its variable costs and some portion of its fixed costs."
