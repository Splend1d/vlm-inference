Two years later, at trial, the defense called another doctor as an expert witness. The expert witness testified that the patient's death was a freak accident and that the surgeon's performance met the highest standards for medical care. On cross-examination, the plaintiff's attorney brings out the fact that, one week before trial, the expert witness and the surgeon signed an agreement to become partners in an outpatient plastic surgery clinic. The plaintiff's attorney suggests that the expert's testimony was awfully convenient and likely motivated by his desire to maintain a good relationship with the defendant. The defendant then calls another surgeon at the hospital as a witness. He is asked to tell the jury about a conversation he had with the expert inunediately following the patient's death. The witness stated that \"the expert told me the patient's death was a textbook example of a freak accident and there was nothing anyone could have done to prevent it. \"On objection to this testimony, defendant's attorney seeks a ruling on the admissibility of this question and answer. The trial judge should\n\nA. sustain the objection, because the testimony is hearsay.\nB. overrule the objection, because a witness's veracity may be rehabilitated by a prior consistent statement.\nC. sustain the objection, because a prior consistent statement cannot be used to rehabilitate a witness's testimony.\nD. overrule the objection, because the expert's statement is a statement against interest.\n"

Prior consistent statements can be used for rehabilitation purposes when a witness's credibility has been challenged on the basis of alleged recent fabrication or improper influence or motive. The statement is not being offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted (that the patient's death was a freak accident), but rather to show that the expert's opinion was held before any potential bias or motive arose, thus supporting the witness's credibility."
