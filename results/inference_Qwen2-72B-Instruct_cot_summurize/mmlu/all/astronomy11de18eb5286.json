Solar eclipses would be much more frequent.\n\nIf the Moon's orbital plane were exactly the same as the ecliptic plane, the Moon would pass directly in front of the Sun (as seen from Earth) every month during the new moon phase, resulting in a solar eclipse each time. Currently, solar eclipses do not occur every month because the Moon's orbit is inclined about 5 degrees relative to the ecliptic plane, so it usually passes above or below the Sun as seen from Earth. If the two planes were aligned, solar eclipses would happen with every new moon, making them much more frequent."
