The probabilities of all possible values of X must add up to one.\n\nIn any probability distribution, including discrete ones, the sum of the probabilities of all possible outcomes must be equal to 1. This is a fundamental property that ensures the completeness of the probability space.\n\nA. The expected value of X = np is true for a binomial distribution but not necessarily for all discrete probability distributions.\nB. The sum of all possible values of X being equal to one is not a general rule for probability distributions; it's the sum of their probabilities that must equal one.\nD. The probability distribution being bell-shaped and symmetric is characteristic of the normal distribution, not all discrete probability distributions."
