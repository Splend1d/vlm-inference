                    "text": "The correct answer is D. Combination of the killed and live vaccines.\n\nWhile attention to sewage control and hygiene (option A) can certainly help in controlling the spread of poliovirus, they alone cannot eradicate the disease. Both the killed polio vaccine (IPV, option B) and the live polio vaccine (OPV, option C) have been instrumental in reducing the incidence of polio worldwide. However, it's the combination of these two types of vaccines that has been most effective in eradicating polio from many parts of the world.\n\nThe killed polio vaccine provides protection against polio without any risk of causing vaccine-associated paralytic polio (VAPP), but it does not provide the same level of immunity as the live vaccine. The live polio vaccine stimulates a stronger immune response, including mucosal immunity, which helps prevent the virus from replicating in the gut and being shed in the stool. This is important for interrupting transmission in areas where polio is still endemic. However, there is a very small risk of VAPP with the live vaccine.\n\nThe Global Polio Eradication Initiative uses both vaccines in different strategies depending on the polio situation in each country. In areas where polio is endemic or where outbreaks occur, OPV is used to quickly stop transmission. In countries that have eliminated polio, IPV is used to maintain immunity in the population without the risk of VAPP associated with OPV. The ultimate goal is to switch completely to IPV once wild poliovirus is eradicated globally, to eliminate all risks associated with the live vaccine."
