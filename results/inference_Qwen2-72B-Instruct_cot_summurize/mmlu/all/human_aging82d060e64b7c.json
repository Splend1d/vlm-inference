Mortality - There is some evidence to suggest that higher levels of neuroticism can be associated with increased mortality, possibly due to the impact of chronic stress and related health problems.\nC. Cognitive decline - Higher levels of neuroticism have been linked to an increased risk of cognitive decline and dementia in older adults.\nB. Loss of social support - Individuals with high levels of neuroticism may experience more interpersonal difficulties and conflicts, which could lead to a loss of social support over time.\n\nD. Independence is not typically predicted by an increase in neuroticism. In fact, higher levels of neuroticism might be associated with decreased independence due to potential health issues and social difficulties.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer would be a combination of A, B, and C, but if you have to choose one, the question's context might favor one more than the others. Given the options, cognitive decline (C) is often considered a particularly significant concern for older adults, making it perhaps the most direct answer in this context. However, all three outcomes (A, B, and C) can be influenced by increases in neuroticism."
