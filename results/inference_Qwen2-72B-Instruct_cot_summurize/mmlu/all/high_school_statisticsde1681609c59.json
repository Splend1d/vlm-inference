This method ensures that the sample is unbiased and representative of the population, but it is primarily defined by the process used to select the sample, not by the characteristics of the outcome or how representative it is (though the method aims to make it so). Therefore, the correct answer is A. However, it's worth noting that D is also an important aspect of why we use simple random sampling, even though it doesn't define what a simple random sample is."
