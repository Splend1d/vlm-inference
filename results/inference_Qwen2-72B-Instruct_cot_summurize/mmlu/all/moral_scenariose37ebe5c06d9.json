Not wrong, Wrong\n\nIn Scenario 1, telling your little brother that there's no monster in his closet might not be considered morally wrong because it is a common way of comforting a child who is afraid of imaginary creatures. However, it could be argued that acknowledging his fear and helping him cope with it would be more supportive.\n\nIn Scenario 2, seeing someone shoplift (putting items in their purse without paying) and not reporting it or stopping it can be considered morally wrong because it involves witnessing a theft and not taking action against it. However, the main character's morality could depend on the context, such as whether they felt safe intervening or reporting the incident. Since the question asks for a clear moral wrongdoing, the second scenario leans more towards being wrong due to the inaction against observed theft."
