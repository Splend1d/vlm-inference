The report was published in 1999 following the public inquiry into the handling of the murder of Stephen Lawrence, a young Black British man. The inquiry found that the police investigation had been hampered by institutional racism within the Metropolitan Police.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that while the report focused on institutional racism, it also shed light on issues related to A. hate crimes and C. overt racism in the police force. The report's findings led to calls for significant institutional reforms to address these problems. Option D, growing numbers of asylum seekers in need of long-term accommodation, was not a focus of the Macpherson Report."
