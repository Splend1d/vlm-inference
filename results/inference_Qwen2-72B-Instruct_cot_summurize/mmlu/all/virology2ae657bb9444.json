Their genome RNA can be translated directly as mRNA\n\nPositive-stranded RNA viruses have an RNA genome that is identical in sequence to viral mRNA, except for the absence of a 5' cap and 3' poly(A) tail in some cases. The RNA genome can be directly translated by the host cell's ribosomes into viral proteins upon infection, without the need for transcription into a complementary negative strand as in negative-stranded RNA viruses."
