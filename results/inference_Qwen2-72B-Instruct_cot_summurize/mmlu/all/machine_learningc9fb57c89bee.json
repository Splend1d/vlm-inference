False, True\n\nExplanation:\nStatement 1 is false because boosting combines multiple weak learners to create a strong learner whose decision boundary can have a more complex functional form than that of the individual weak learners. For example, if each weak learner is a simple decision stump (a one-level decision tree), the combined classifier can make more complex decisions than any individual weak learner could.\n\nStatement 2 is true because cross-validation can indeed be used to tune hyperparameters, including the number of iterations in boosting algorithms. By evaluating the model's performance on a validation set at each iteration, you can determine the optimal number of iterations before the model begins to overfit the training data. This can help prevent overfitting and improve the generalization ability of the boosted model."
