If a psychological attribute is genetically influenced, then identical twins are more likely to share this attribute than are fraternal twins and other siblings. This is because identical (monozygotic) twins share 100% of their genes, while fraternal (dizygotic) twins share on average about 50% of their segregating genes, similar to other siblings. By comparing the similarity of traits between identical and fraternal twins, researchers can estimate the genetic contribution to those traits."
