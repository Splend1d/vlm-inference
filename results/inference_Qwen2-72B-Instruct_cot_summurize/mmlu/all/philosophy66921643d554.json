Baier was an influential moral philosopher who argued that genuine moral rules should consider the interests and well-being of all sentient beings, not just human beings. This perspective aligns with a broader ethical consideration that extends moral concern beyond humans to include animals capable of experiencing pleasure and pain. However, it's important to note that Baier's specific philosophical stance might not perfectly fit any single provided option, but option B comes closest to capturing her views on moral rules."
