Let's substitute the expressions for $x$ and $y$ in terms of $k$ and $l$ into this equation:\n\n\\[x^2 + xy + y^2 + n = (7k + 3)^2 + (7k + 3)(7l - 3) + (7l - 3)^2 + n\\]\n\nExpanding the squares and products, we get:\n\n\\[= 49k^2 + 42k + 9 + 49kl - 21k + 21l - 9 + 49l^2 - 42l + 9 + n\\]\n\nSimplifying further:\n\n\\[= 49(k^2 + kl + l^2) + 42(k + l) + 9 + n\\]\n\nNotice that $49(k^2 + kl + l^2)$ and $42(k + l)$ are already multiples of $7$. Therefore, we need to find an $n$ such that $9 + n$ is also a multiple of $7$.\n\nThe next multiple of $7$ after $9$ is $14$, so we need:\n\n\\[9 + n = 14\\]\n\nSolving for $n$, we find:\n\n\\[n = 14 - 9 = 5\\]\n\nTherefore, the smallest positive integer $n$ for which $x^2 + xy + y^2 + n$ is a multiple of $7$ is $\\boxed{5}$, which corresponds to option D."
