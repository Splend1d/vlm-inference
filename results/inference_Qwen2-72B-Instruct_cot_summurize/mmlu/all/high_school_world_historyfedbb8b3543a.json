If I have commanded that the tribute offerings sent by you, O King, are to be accepted, this was solely in consideration for the spirit which prompted you to dispatch them from afar. . . . As your Ambassador can see for himself, we possess all things. I set no value on objects strange or ingenious, and have no use for your country's manufactures. It behooves you, O King, to display even greater devotion and loyalty in future, so that, by perpetual submission to our Throne, you may secure peace and prosperity.\nWhat was the impact of European demand for Chinese goods?\n\nA. The Portuguese increased their international power and prestige.\nB. The British shifted their focus for trade and colonization to Japan.\nC. The bulk of the world's silver supply moved to China.\nD. The British sought control of the Malacca Strait.\n"

The bulk of the world's silver supply moved to China.\n\nThe passage indicates that China had no need for European goods, implying that they were self-sufficient and not interested in European manufactured items. However, European demand for Chinese goods such as tea, silk, and porcelain was high. This imbalance in trade led to a significant outflow of silver from Europe to China, as Europeans paid for Chinese goods with silver due to the lack of goods that could be traded back to China. This resulted in a large portion of the world's silver supply moving to China during this period."
