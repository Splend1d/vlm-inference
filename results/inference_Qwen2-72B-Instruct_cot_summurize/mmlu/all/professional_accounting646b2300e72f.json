The basis carried over to each asset is determined based on the partner's basis in the partnership interest before the distribution, reduced by any cash received.\n\nIn this case, Gulde has a $26,000 basis in Chyme Partnership. Upon receiving a liquidating distribution, Gulde receives $12,000 cash and land with an adjusted basis to Chyme of $10,000 and a fair market value of $30,000.\n\nFirst, we subtract the cash received ($12,000) from Gulde's initial basis ($26,000), leaving $14,000 of basis to allocate to the land. This is because the cash received reduces the partner's basis in the partnership, which then gets allocated to the remaining property received.\n\nThus, Gulde's basis in the land would be $14,000, which is option C.\n\nThis rule is outlined in IRC Section 732(a), which states that if a partner receives property in a liquidating distribution, the partner's basis in the property is the lesser of (1) the partner's basis in the partnership interest immediately before the distribution, reduced by the amount of money received, or (2) the partnership's adjusted basis in the property. In this scenario, since the partnership's adjusted basis in the land is less than Gulde's remaining basis after accounting for the cash received, Gulde's basis in the land is $14,000."
