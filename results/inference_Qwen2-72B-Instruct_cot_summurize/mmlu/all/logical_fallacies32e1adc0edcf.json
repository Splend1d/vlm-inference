This can be problematic because the supposed authority may not actually exist, may not be an expert in the relevant field, or may have biases or ulterior motives that affect their judgment. Therefore, it's important to critically evaluate claims and seek out concrete evidence rather than relying solely on appeals to anonymous authority."
