Binocular cues require the use of both eyes working together, while monocular cues can be perceived with one eye. These cues help us understand the spatial relationships between objects and their distance from us. Examples of binocular cues include retinal disparity and convergence, while examples of monocular cues include relative size, interposition, linear perspective, and texture gradient."
