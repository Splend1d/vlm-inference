The rehabilitation and upbuilding of our countries will have little meaning. Our revolutions will not be allowed to run their course. What can we do? We can do much! We can inject the voice of reason into world affairs. We can mobilize all the spiritual, all the moral, all the political strength of Asia and Africa on the side of peace. Yes, we! We, the peoples of Asia and Africa, 1.4 billion strong.\nIndonesian leader Sukarno, keynote address to the Bandung Conference, 1955\nThe passage above is most associated with which of the following developments?\n\nA.

The formation of the non-aligned movement\n\nThe passage from Indonesian leader Sukarno's keynote address to the Bandung Conference in 1955 is most closely associated with the development of the non-aligned movement. This conference was a significant moment in the history of international relations, particularly during the Cold War era, as it brought together countries from Asia and Africa who were seeking to maintain their independence and avoid alignment with either of the two superpowers, the United States or the Soviet Union. The emphasis on preserving peace, independence, and the role of Asian and African nations in global affairs aligns with the principles of the non-aligned movement."
