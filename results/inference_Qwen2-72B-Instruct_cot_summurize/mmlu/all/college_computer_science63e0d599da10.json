The closest match in terms of simplification and maintaining the spirit of the question would be **D. 1.1:1** if we consider that the seek time and latency time are constant regardless of the block size, and the transfer and OS overhead times are significantly reduced due to larger block sizes. This would make the overall time shorter for version 2 compared to version 1, but the exact calculation does not perfectly align with any option. However, D is the closest in terms of indicating that version 2 is faster than version 1, but not drastically so, which aligns with our calculations showing a reduction in time but not to the extent suggested by A, B, or C."
