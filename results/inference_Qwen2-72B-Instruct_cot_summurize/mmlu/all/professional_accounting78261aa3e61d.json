Then, we will determine the contribution margin needed to achieve a 20% target contribution margin ratio.\n\nTotal variable costs = $12 (manufacturing) + $3 (selling & admin.) = $15\n\nTotal fixed costs = $8 (manufacturing) + $5 (selling & admin.) = $13\n\nLet's denote the selling price as \\( P \\). The contribution margin per unit is the difference between the selling price and the total variable costs per unit, so:\n\n\\[ Contribution\\ Margin\\ per\\ Unit = P - Total\\ Variable\\ Costs \\]\n\nThe contribution margin ratio is the contribution margin per unit divided by the selling price, and it's given that this should be 20%, or 0.2. So:\n\n\\[ Contribution\\ Margin\\ Ratio = \\frac{Contribution\\ Margin\\ per\\ Unit}{P} = 0.2 \\]\n\nSubstituting the formula for the contribution margin per unit, we get:\n\n\\[ \\frac{P - Total\\ Variable\\ Costs}{P} = 0.2 \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{P - 15}{P} = 0.2 \\]\n\nMultiplying both sides by \\( P \\) to clear the denominator:\n\n\\[ P - 15 = 0.2P \\]\n\nBringing all terms involving \\( P \\) to one side gives us:\n\n\\[ P - 0.2P = 15 \\]\n\n\\[ 0.8P = 15 \\]\n\nDividing both sides by 0.8:\n\n\\[ P = \\frac{15}{0.8} = 18.75 \\]\n\nTherefore, the target selling price of Duct is $18.75.\n\nThe correct answer is B. $18.75."
