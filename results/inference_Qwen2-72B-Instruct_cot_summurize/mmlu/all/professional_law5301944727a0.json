One day that employee came uninvited into the owner's office brandishing a loaded shotgun, approached the owner's desk and raised the weapon. The owner, however, was secretly waiting for the opportunity. As the employee began to press on the trigger, the owner pulled a gun from her drawer and killed him. The owner admitted she felt malice toward her enemy. The authorities charged her with murder. Can she be convicted?\n\nA. No, because she acted in self-defense.\nB. No, because these facts constitute justifiable homicide.\nC. Yes, because she had been lying in wait for the victim.\nD. Yes, because the owner cannot claim self-defense when her motive is evil.\n"

No, because these facts constitute justifiable homicide.\n\nThe key factor in this scenario is that the owner was facing an imminent threat to her life. The former employee entered the office uninvited, brandished a loaded shotgun, and attempted to shoot the owner. This situation would typically meet the criteria for self-defense, as the owner was responding to a clear and present danger to her life. Her premeditation or malice toward the former employee does not negate the fact that she was acting in self-defense at the moment of the shooting.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the specifics of self-defense laws can vary widely by location. Some jurisdictions may consider the owner's state of mind or whether she provoked the confrontation as factors in determining whether the use of deadly force was justified. Therefore, while the general principle supports option B, the actual outcome could depend on the interpretation of local laws and the evidence presented at trial."
