Malicious processes can make changes to the system, such as modifying system files, installing backdoors, or creating persistence mechanisms that allow them to re-infect the system upon reboot. To fully mitigate the threat, it may be necessary to perform a thorough cleanup, which can include replacing infected files and removing any malicious modifications. In severe cases, wiping the entire disk and reinstalling the operating system may be the only way to ensure complete removal of the malware."
