The rule of thumb is that for a chi-square test to be valid, the expected frequency count in each cell should be 5 or greater. However, some statisticians suggest that as long as no more than 20% of the cells have expected frequencies less than 5 and all individual expected frequencies are 1 or greater, the chi-square test is still valid.\n\nII. This statement is false. While it's true that a chi-square test requires at least one degree of freedom to be calculated, there's no minimum requirement of 2 degrees of freedom. A 2x2 contingency table, for instance, has 1 degree of freedom.\n\nIII. This statement is true. The formula for calculating degrees of freedom in a chi-square test for independence is (r - 1) * (c - 1), where r is the number of rows and c is the number of columns. For a 4x2 table, this would be (4 - 1) * (2 - 1) = 3."
