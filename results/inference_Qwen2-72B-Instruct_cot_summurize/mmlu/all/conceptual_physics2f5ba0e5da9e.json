                    "text": "When two charged particles are released from rest, their accelerations will depend on the force between them according to Newton's second law (\\(F=ma\\)). The force between two charges is given by Coulomb's law:\n\n\\[F = k \\frac{|q_1 q_2|}{r^2}\\]\n\nwhere \\(k\\) is Coulomb's constant, \\(q_1\\) and \\(q_2\\) are the magnitudes of the charges, and \\(r\\) is the distance between them.\n\nThe direction of the force depends on the signs of the charges:\n- If the charges have the same sign (both positive or both negative), they repel each other.\n- If the charges have opposite signs (one positive and one negative), they attract each other.\n\nIf both particles increase in acceleration immediately after being released, this means that the force acting on each particle must be increasing in magnitude. This can happen if the distance between them decreases (since \\(F \\propto 1/r^2\\)), but it also requires that the force is in the direction that would cause an increase in acceleration for both particles. \n\nFor this to occur simultaneously for both particles, the forces must act in such a way that both particles move towards each other or away from each other with increasing speed. This is only possible when the particles repel each other because if they attract each other, the particle initially closer to the other would experience a greater force and thus a greater acceleration, causing it to catch up and reduce the overall force as the distance decreases.\n\nTherefore, for both particles to experience an increase in acceleration immediately after release, they must repel each other, which means they must have the same sign.\n\nSo, the answer is A. the same."
