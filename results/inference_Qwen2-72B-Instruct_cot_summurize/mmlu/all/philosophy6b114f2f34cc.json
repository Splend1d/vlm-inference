This concept is often referred to as eudaimonia, which can be translated as happiness, flourishing, or well-being. Aristotle believed that understanding and defining this ultimate end or goal of human existence is essential for determining how one should act ethically. Once the aim of human life is established, one can then determine the virtues and actions that lead to achieving that aim."
