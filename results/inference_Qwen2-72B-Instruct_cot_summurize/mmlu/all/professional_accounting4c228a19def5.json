This transaction directly affects the balance sheet but does not involve any change in debt.\n\n1. **Total Debt to Total Assets Ratio**: This ratio is calculated as Total Liabilities divided by Total Assets. Since issuing additional capital stock increases equity and not liabilities, and assuming the cash received is added to assets, both the numerator (total liabilities) and denominator (total assets) do not change proportionally due to this transaction. However, since only the denominator (total assets) increases, the ratio decreases. This indicates that the company has become less leveraged, which is generally considered a positive outcome in terms of financial risk.\n\n2. **Working Capital**: Working capital is defined as Current Assets minus Current Liabilities. Issuing additional capital stock for cash increases cash, which is a current asset. There is no corresponding increase in current liabilities from this transaction. Therefore, working capital increases.\n\nGiven these effects:\n\n- Total Debt to Total Assets Ratio: Decreases\n- Working Capital: Increases\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\n**C. Decrease Increase**"
