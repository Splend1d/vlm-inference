                    "text": "The correct answer is D. glycolysis is activated at the onset of exercise.\n\nWhen you start exercising, your muscles require more energy than they can get from aerobic metabolism alone, especially during high-intensity activities. This leads to an increase in anaerobic glycolysis, which is the breakdown of glucose without sufficient oxygen. As a result of this process, lactate is produced as a byproduct. Lactate production helps to regenerate NAD+ so that glycolysis can continue and provide ATP for muscle contractions. \n\nWhile it's true that lactate production can also occur when oxygen supply is insufficient (option A), the question asks for what specifically increases lactate production, and the initiation of exercise (option D) is directly related to an increase in glycolytic activity, leading to higher lactate production. Options B and C are not accurate because pyruvate can still be formed from glucose breakdown even under anaerobic conditions, and while a decrease in muscle pH can be a consequence of lactate accumulation, it is not a direct cause of increased lactate production."
