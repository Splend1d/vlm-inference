This is because in the long run, all inputs are variable and firms can adjust their scale of production to achieve the lowest possible cost. Thus, the LRAC curve represents the lowest possible average cost that can be achieved for any level of output, and it will touch each SRAC curve at its lowest point, where the firm is operating most efficiently given its current size and technology."
