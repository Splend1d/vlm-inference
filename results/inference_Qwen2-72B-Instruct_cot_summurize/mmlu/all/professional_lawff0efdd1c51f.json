Which of the following states the probable legal consequences of the correspondence between theparties?\n\nA. There is no contract, because the parties attached materially different meanings to the price term.\nB. There is no enforceable contract, because the buyer is entitled to rescission due to a mutual mistake asto a basic assumption.\nC. There is a contract formed at a price of $2,000 per acre, as the buyer intended.\nD. There is a contract formed at a price of $2,200 per acre, regardless of the buyer's true intention.\n"

There is a contract formed at a price of $2,200 per acre, regardless of the buyer's true intention.\n\nThe general rule is that a contract is formed when an offer is accepted as presented, without any modifications. In this case, the buyer made an offer to purchase the land at $2,200 per acre, and the seller accepted that offer. The fact that the buyer may have intended to offer $2,000 per acre is not relevant once the offer was clearly communicated and accepted by the seller. The buyer's mistake does not automatically entitle them to rescind the contract unless it can be shown that there was a mutual mistake regarding a material fact, which is not the case here since the price range for comparable land was known and the mistake was unilateral. Therefore, the most likely outcome is that a binding contract has been formed at the offered price of $2,200 per acre."
