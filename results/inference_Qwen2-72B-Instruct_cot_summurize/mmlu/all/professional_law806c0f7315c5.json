The claim was based on erroneous information, found on the website of a nonprofit consumer advocacy group, that the airline assumed to be true. The airline was charged under the state law for making a false statement. No federal statute applies. Which of the following best supports the airline in a defense based on the First Amendment?\n\nA. Its statement about the safety record was made without malice.\nB. Its statement about the safety record was protected noncommercial speech.\nC. The state law is a prior restraint.\nD. The state law is overbroad.\n"

While the statement was indeed false, it pertained to a matter of public concern\u2014the safety records of airlines\u2014and was not made with actual malice (knowledge of its falsity or reckless disregard for the truth). Noncommercial speech, particularly on matters of public concern, receives the highest level of protection under the First Amendment. This protection is not absolute, but the government must show a compelling interest and use the least restrictive means to regulate such speech.\n\nOption A is not as strong because the lack of malice is relevant to a defamation case but does not necessarily protect against all forms of speech regulation. Option C is incorrect because the law is not a prior restraint\u2014it does not prevent the speech from occurring but rather penalizes it after the fact. Option D could also be a viable argument if the law is so broad that it restricts more speech than necessary, but the primary focus should be on the nature of the speech itself as protected under the First Amendment."
