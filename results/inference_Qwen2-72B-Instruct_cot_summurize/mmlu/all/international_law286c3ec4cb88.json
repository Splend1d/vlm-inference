This means that they should not engage in tactics that would undermine the negotiation process or prevent a resolution from being reached. However, there is no obligation for states to find a solution to the dispute through negotiations, nor are they required to inform the UN Secretary-General about the progress of their negotiations unless they choose to do so."
