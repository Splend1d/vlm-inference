Increase Revenue\n\nBetter environmental performance can lead to increased revenue through several avenues:\n\n1. **Better Access to Certain Markets**: As more countries and regions implement environmental regulations and standards, companies that meet or exceed these standards can gain access to new markets. For example, if a company's products are certified as eco-friendly, it may be able to sell them in markets where such certifications are required or preferred.\n\n2. **Differentiation of Products**: By offering products that have a lower environmental impact, companies can differentiate themselves from competitors. This can attract environmentally conscious consumers who are willing to pay a premium for products that align with their values.\n\n3. **Sale of Pollution-Control Technology**: Companies that develop and sell pollution control technologies can tap into a growing market as industries around the world seek to reduce their environmental footprint. This not only includes the direct sale of technology but also services related to its installation, maintenance, and operation.\n\nIn summary, by improving environmental performance, companies can open up new revenue streams and potentially increase sales in existing markets by appealing to a broader customer base that values sustainability."
