Genetic drift occurs when a new population is formed by a very small number of individuals from the original population, resulting in a random change in allele frequencies. This is often referred to as the founder effect. Since the new population is established by a small group of birds, their gene pool may not be representative of the entire original population's genetic diversity, leading to different allele frequencies in the new colony."
