This means that the natural increase (CBR - CDR) equals zero and the net migration equals zero as well. So the correct answer would be:\n\nB. Births + immigration = deaths + emigration.\n\nHowever, option A could also be correct if we assume that \"5\" is meant to represent \"=\" (which is common in text-based formats). Thus, option A could be interpreted as \"CBR - CDR = 0\", which is true for ZPG.\n\nOption D, \"Replacement fertility is achieved\", can also lead to ZPG over time. Replacement fertility is the number of children a couple must have on average for the population to replace itself without taking into account migration. In most developed countries, this is around 2.1 children per woman.\n\nOption C, \"Total fertility = 3\", does not necessarily lead to ZPG because it does not take into account the death rate or migration. If the total fertility rate is higher than the replacement level, the population will grow unless there are offsetting factors such as higher death rates or emigration."
