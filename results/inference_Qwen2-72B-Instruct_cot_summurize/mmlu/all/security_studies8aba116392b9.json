When the general public is not convinced of the legitimacy of the proposed threat: Securitization theory posits that for an issue to be successfully securitized, it must be perceived as an existential threat by the audience. If the general public does not believe that the issue poses a significant enough threat, they will not support the securitization process.\n\nC. When the securitizing actor is not granted the special right to implement extraordinary measures: Even if the threat is perceived as legitimate, the actor attempting to securitize the issue (the securitizing actor) must be granted the authority to take extraordinary measures to address the threat. If the audience does not trust the actor or does not believe they should have such powers, securitization will fail.\n\nD. When the audience is convinced via the speech act or by the securitizing actor but fails to grant that actor the special rights requested in order to address the proposed threat: This scenario is similar to option C but emphasizes that even if the audience is convinced of the threat's severity, they might still refuse to grant the necessary authority to the securitizing actor. This could be due to concerns over the potential misuse of power, skepticism about the actor's intentions, or other political reasons.\n\nOption B does not directly describe a failure condition for securitization. It describes a stage in the securitization process where, after the discursive element, extraordinary measures would typically be implemented. However, it does not specify why these measures might not be implemented, which is necessary to identify a failure in the securitization process. Thus, while it is part of the process, it does not clearly define a condition for failure as succinctly as A, C, and D do."
