When the boy's mother inquired about the lipstick stains, the boy said that his teacher had kissed him. The mother then contacted the police, who subsequently conducted an investigation and arrested the teacher, charging her with two felony counts of child molestation. In accord with state law, a preliminary hearing was scheduled. After the boy was subpoenaed to testify at the preliminary hearing, the prosecution filed a motion to exclude the teacher from the courtroom during the boy's appearance. The motion, with supporting affidavits from a child psychologist, claimed that having the boy and the teacher in the same room would cause irreparable emotional and psychological harm to the alleged victim. The judge should\n\nA. deny the motion, because a pretrial proceeding is an early stage of trial, and a defendant has a constitutional right of confrontation at every stage of the trial.\nB. deny the motion, because the teacher's exclusion from the courtroom would have prejudicial impact on receiving effective assistance of counsel.\nC. grant the motion, because the teacher's attorney still has an opportunity to cross-examine the witness despite the teacher's absence from the courtroom.\nD. grant the motion, because cross-examination at a preliminary hearing is not required by the confrontation clause of the Sixth Amendment.\n"

                    "text": "The judge should consider the constitutional rights of both the defendant (the teacher) and the alleged victim (the boy). The confrontation clause of the Sixth Amendment guarantees the right of the accused to confront the witnesses against them. However, this right is not absolute and can be limited under certain circumstances, particularly when there is a compelling interest to protect the welfare of a child witness.\n\nIn this case, the motion to exclude the teacher from the courtroom during the boy's testimony at the preliminary hearing is supported by affidavits from a child psychologist, indicating that the presence of the teacher could cause irreparable emotional and psychological harm to the alleged victim. This concern for the child's welfare presents a compelling interest that may justify limiting the teacher's right to confrontation.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer, given the context provided, would be:\n\nC. grant the motion, because the teacher's attorney still has an opportunity to cross-examine the witness despite the teacher's absence from the courtroom.\n\nThis option balances the rights of the defendant with the need to protect the child witness from potential trauma. The teacher's right to confront the witness is not entirely denied, as her attorney will still be present to conduct cross-examination on her behalf."
