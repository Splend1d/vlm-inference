This type of syllogism involves three categorical propositions: a major premise, a minor premise, and a conclusion. Each of these propositions contains two of the three terms involved in the argument. Thus, each term appears exactly twice in the entire syllogism.\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\nB. Categorical"
