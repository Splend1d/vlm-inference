Working class communities tended to form in the inner cities, often in areas with older and less desirable housing, while the middle classes moved out to the suburbs where newer homes and better amenities were available. This pattern of residential segregation by class was particularly evident in mid-twentieth century Britain. Gentrification, mentioned in option A, typically refers to a later phenomenon where middle-class individuals move into previously working-class neighborhoods, often leading to displacement of the original residents. Option C does not accurately reflect historical patterns, as both the middle and working classes have historically lived in urban areas, though in different parts of the city. Option D might be true to some extent, but it is not as directly related to the specific pattern of class segregation described in the question as option B is."
