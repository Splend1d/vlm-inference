The concept of \"Sant-Sipahi\" or \"Saint-Soldier\" reflects this ideal, encouraging Sikhs to lead an active life as householders while maintaining spiritual discipline and devotion to God. This includes earning an honest living, sharing with others, and serving the community.\n\nFaith in God (Ik Onkar) is central to Sikh beliefs, and liberation is achieved through devotion to the divine name and remembrance of God. The Guru Granth Sahib, the holy scripture of Sikhism, teaches that by meditating on God's name and following the path of righteousness, one can attain liberation from the cycle of birth and death (samsara).\n\nAscetic renunciation (C) is not emphasized in Sikhism, as it goes against the teachings of the Gurus who advocated for an engaged life in society. While individual Sikhs may choose to live a more austere lifestyle, the religion does not require or encourage monasticism or withdrawal from the world. Instead, it promotes a life of active service and participation in the community (A)."
