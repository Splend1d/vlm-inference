In this case, we have 27 observations and 3 parameters being estimated ($\\beta_1$, $\\beta_2$, and $\\beta_3$), so the degrees of freedom (df) are:\n\\[ df = n - k = 27 - 3 = 24 \\]\n\nThe critical value for a two-sided t-test at the 5% significance level can be found using the t-distribution table or a statistical software package. Since it's a two-sided test, you'll look up the value that corresponds to 2.5% in the upper tail and 2.5% in the lower tail.\n\nUsing a t-table or statistical software, the critical value for a t-distribution with 24 degrees of freedom at the 2.5% level in each tail is approximately 2.064.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. 2.06\n\nThis means that if the calculated t-statistic from your regression is less than -2.06 or greater than 2.06, you would reject the null hypothesis that $\\beta_3 = 1$ at the 5% level of significance."
