The teachers want more money, and the district, claiming, as always, budget constraints, wants to pay as little as possible. The district, like most, has a large number of moderately paid teachers and a few highly paid administrators. The salaries of all teachers and administrators are included in trying to figure out, on average, how much the professional staff currently earn. Which of the following would the teachers' union be most likely to quote during negotiations?\n\nA. The mean of all the salaries.\nB. The mode of all the salaries.\nC. The standard deviation of all the salaries.\nD. The median of all the salaries.\n"

This is because the median represents the middle value of the salary distribution when all the salaries are arranged in order. Since there are a large number of moderately paid teachers and only a few highly paid administrators, the median would give a better representation of the typical salary earned by the majority of the professional staff (the teachers) and would not be influenced by the few high salaries at the top. Therefore, option D is the correct answer."
