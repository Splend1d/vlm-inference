The rest of the statements provide reasons why this conclusion should be accepted. Specifically, the argument suggests that abolishing capital punishment would lead to overcrowded prisons, which would require building more prisons, and the argument asserts that this is an undesirable outcome. Therefore, the conclusion is that we should not abolish capital punishment."
