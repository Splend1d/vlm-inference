We seem bent upon saving the Vietnamese from Ho Chi Minh even if we have to kill them and demolish their country to do it. As the native people survey bombed-out villages, women and children burned by napalm, rice crops destroyed and cities overrun with our military personnel, they are doubtless saying secretly of the Vietcong guerillas and of the American forces, \"A plague on both your houses.\" \u2026 Stop the bombing, north and south, end search and destroy offensive sweeps, and confine our military action to holding operations on the ground. Bombing the north has failed to halt or seriously check the flow of troops to the south and may, in fact, have prompted a much greater war effort by Hanoi.\n\u2014Senator George McGovern, \"The Lessons of Vietnam,\" April 25, 1967\nPolitical discord during the Vietnam War most closely resembled the political dissensions during which of the following?\n\nA. The Spanish-American War\nB. The Mexican War\nC. World War I\nD. World War II\n"

Both conflicts were characterized by significant public opposition and debate over the necessity and morality of the wars. In both cases, there were divisions within the United States regarding the justification for going to war and the methods used in prosecuting the war. However, it is important to note that none of the options listed perfectly matches the level of domestic dissent and anti-war sentiment that characterized the Vietnam era. Nonetheless, the Mexican War saw considerable opposition, particularly from those who believed it was an unjustified and aggressive land grab, making it the closest comparison among the provided choices."
