He argues that justice corresponds to what he calls \"perfect duties,\" which are absolute and admit no exceptions. These duties are owed directly to others and are not merely general obligations to promote overall happiness. In contrast, \"imperfect duties\" are more flexible and involve actions that promote well-being but do not have the same strictness as perfect duties. Imperfect duties can be fulfilled in various ways and at different times, depending on the circumstances."
