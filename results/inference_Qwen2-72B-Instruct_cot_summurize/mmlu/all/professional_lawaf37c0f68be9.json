Dashing to the car, the husband then drove his wife and ailing son to the nearest hospital. On the way to the hospital, the son had a seizure and stopped breathing. Seconds later, the car went out of control despite the husband's reasonable efforts, swinging across the center line into oncoming traffic, where it collided wit. I1 a car driven by a driver who was driving in the opposite direction. In this jurisdiction, a statute makes it a misdemeanor for any motor vehicle to travel to the left of the center line of any two-way highway, road, or street. If the driver asserts a claim against the husband, the most likely result is that the plaintiff will\n\nA. prevail, because the husband is strictly liable for violating the statute.\nB. prevail, because the statute was designed to protect motorists such as the driver.\nC. not prevail, because the driver had the last clear chance to avoid the accident.\nD. not prevail, because the husband was acting reasonably in an emergency.\n"

Here, the husband's actions were motivated by the immediate need to get his son medical attention after he had a severe reaction to ingested medicine. The loss of control of the car and the subsequent collision occurred while attempting to manage the medical emergency, which can be seen as an unforeseeable and urgent situation.\n\nAdditionally, if the driver of the other vehicle had the last clear chance to avoid the accident but failed to do so, this could also be used as a defense for the husband. However, the primary defense here would likely be the emergency doctrine, which excuses conduct that would normally be considered negligent if it is done in response to an emergency not caused by the actor and when there is no time to consider alternatives."
