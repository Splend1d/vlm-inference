This condition implies that R is a simple ring, because a simple ring is defined as a ring that has no nontrivial ideals (i.e., its only ideals are the ring itself and the zero ideal).\n\nNow let's analyze each statement:\n\nI. R is commutative.\nThis is not necessarily true. There are non-commutative simple rings. For example, matrix rings over fields can be simple but not commutative. So, this statement does not have to be true based on the given information.\n\nII. R is a division ring.\nThis is indeed true. A simple ring with a unity that is not commutative is a division ring if it satisfies the condition that every nonzero element has a multiplicative inverse. The reason is that if there were a nonzero element without an inverse, then the set of all finite sums of products of that element by any other element would form a nontrivial right ideal, contradicting the simplicity of R. Since R is simple and has a multiplicative identity, and we know it has more than just the trivial right ideals if it's not a division ring, then being a division ring is a necessary condition for having exactly two right ideals.\n\nIII. R is infinite.\nThis is not necessarily true. There are finite simple rings that are also division rings. For example, the field \\(\\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z}\\) for a prime p is a finite division ring (also known as a Galois field). Therefore, the finiteness or infiniteness of R cannot be determined solely from the given information.\n\nThus, among the options provided, only statement II must be true.\n\nThe correct answer is B. II only."
