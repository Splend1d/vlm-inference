The defendant moved to dismiss the action, and the court granted the motion in an order that stated: \"The defendant's motion to dismiss is granted, and this action is dismissed with prejudice.\" The court accordingly entered judgment for the defendant. The plaintiff then filed the same claim against the defendant in federal court, invoking diversity jurisdiction. The defendant has asserted the defense of res judicata (claim preclusion) in its answer. Should the federal court give preclusive effect to the state court judgment?\n\nA. No, because the judgment was entered by a state court, not a federal court.\nB. No, because the state court did not rule on the merits in its dismissal.\nC. Yes, because a dismissal with prejudice operates as a judgment on the merits.\nD. Yes, because a judgment for failure to prosecute operates as a judgment on the merits under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n"

Yes, because a dismissal with prejudice operates as a judgment on the merits.\n\nUnder the principle of res judicata, or claim preclusion, a final judgment on the merits by a court of competent jurisdiction precludes any future lawsuits between the same parties or their privies on the same cause of action or any part of it. A dismissal with prejudice is considered a final judgment on the merits for the purposes of res judicata, even if the court did not actually rule on the substantive issues of the case. Therefore, the federal court should give preclusive effect to the state court judgment. It's worth noting that option D might seem plausible but is less accurate because the question pertains to the recognition of a state court judgment in federal court, which is governed by the Full Faith and Credit Clause and relevant Supreme Court decisions, rather than the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure directly."
