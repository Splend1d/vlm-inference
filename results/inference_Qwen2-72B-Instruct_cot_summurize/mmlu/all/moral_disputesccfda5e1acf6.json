Sandel's reasoning does not rule out the use of moderate, worthwhile genetic transformation.\n\nKamm argues that Sandel's critique of genetic enhancement does not necessarily condemn all forms of it. According to Kamm, there can be a distinction made between extreme forms of genetic manipulation that could potentially harm or objectify children and more moderate enhancements aimed at preventing diseases or improving health. Thus, Kamm believes that Sandel's argument doesn't fully rule out the possibility of using genetic enhancement in a responsible and ethical manner."
