In 1990, a homeless couple occupied the crumbling cabin. They restored it, fenced the perimeter, and maintained the grounds. They started paying the taxes, despite knowing there was an absentee owner. In 2000, the owner appeared and demanded that they pay rent. They agreed but stopped the payments two years later after consulting an attorney. The required statutory period in the state is 20 years. In 2011 the owner filed an ejectment action, asserting his ownership rights. Leaving aside any other theories or equities, can the couple prevail on a theory of adverse possession?\n\nA. Yes, because they were on the land for over 20 years.\nB. No, because they missed some of the tax payments during that 20-year period.\nC. No, because the hostile possession was interrupted for two years when they paid rent.\nD. Yes, because they owned the property due to paying the taxes on it.\n"

No, because the hostile possession was interrupted for two years when they paid rent.\n\nAdverse possession requires continuous, open, notorious, exclusive, and hostile possession for the statutory period. Paying rent to the true owner is inconsistent with a claim of adverse possession, as it indicates recognition of the owner's title and defeats the \"hostile\" requirement. Therefore, the two-year period during which the couple paid rent to the owner interrupted their otherwise potentially adverse possession. Since the statutory period is 20 years, and their possession was interrupted, they would not have met the continuous possession requirement by 2011."
