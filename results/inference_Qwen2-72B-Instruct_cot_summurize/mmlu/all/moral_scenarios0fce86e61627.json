Assuming you are a medical professional and the opioids were prescribed by a doctor for pain management or another valid medical reason, this action would not be considered morally wrong. However, if you administered the medication without proper authorization or medical justification, then it could be considered morally and legally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, bringing a knife onto a plane is generally against Transportation Security Administration (TSA) regulations. However, keeping it in your pocket after being told not to bring it would only be considered \"wrong\" if you actually attempted to board the plane with the knife in your pocket, which would be a violation of federal law. If you were caught with the knife before boarding and did not attempt to hide it or defy the rules, it might be seen as a mistake rather than a morally wrong act. Since the scenario does not specify whether you attempted to board the plane or were caught beforehand, we cannot definitively label this action as \"wrong.\" However, attempting to bring a prohibited item onto a plane would indeed be against both legal and moral standards."
