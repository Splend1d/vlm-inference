The formula for the fringe separation in this case is:\n\n\\[ \\Delta y = \\frac{\\lambda D}{d} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\(\\Delta y\\) is the separation between adjacent bright fringes,\n- \\(\\lambda\\) is the wavelength of the light,\n- \\(D\\) is the distance from the slits to the screen,\n- \\(d\\) is the separation of the slits.\n\nGiven that the initial separation of the bright fringes is 1.0 mm (or 1.0 \u00d7 10\\(^{-3}\\) m) with a slit separation of 0.5 \u03bcm (or 0.5 \u00d7 10\\(^{-6}\\) m), we can express the initial relationship as:\n\n\\[ 1.0 \\times 10^{-3} = \\frac{\\lambda D}{0.5 \\times 10^{-6}} \\]\n\nWhen the frequency of the laser light is doubled, the wavelength is halved (\\(\\lambda' = \\lambda / 2\\)), because frequency (\\(f\\)) and wavelength (\\(\\lambda\\)) are inversely proportional (i.e., \\(f = c / \\lambda\\), where \\(c\\) is the speed of light).\n\nThus, the new separation of the bright fringes becomes:\n\n\\[ \\Delta y' = \\frac{\\lambda' D}{d} = \\frac{(\\lambda / 2) D}{0.5 \\times 10^{-6}} \\]\n\nSince \\(\\lambda' = \\lambda / 2\\), we can substitute the value of \\(\\lambda\\) from the first equation into the second equation to find the new separation:\n\n\\[ \\Delta y' = \\frac{(1.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\times 0.5 \\times 10^{-6}) / D}{0.5 \\times 10^{-6}} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1.0 \\times 10^{-3}}{2} = 0.5 \\times 10^{-3} \\]\n\nTherefore, the separation of the bright fringes when the frequency of the laser light is doubled will be:\n\n\\[ \\Delta y' = 0.5 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ m} = 0.5 \\text{ mm} \\]\n\nSo the answer is:\n\nB. 0.5 mm"
