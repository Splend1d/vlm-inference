The receptors in the retina are responsible for converting light energy into electrical signals that can be interpreted by the brain as visual information. In contrast, the receptors in the cochlea transduce mechanical energy (sound waves) into electrical signals that the brain interprets as auditory information.\n\nThe other options are not necessarily distinguishing factors between the two types of receptors:\n\nA. The magnitude of the resting potentials of their membranes might vary, but this is not the primary functional difference.\nB. The ions involved in their action potentials could also differ, but again, this is not the main distinction.\nD. The number of axons each cell possesses is not a defining characteristic that distinguishes one type of receptor from the other based on function."
