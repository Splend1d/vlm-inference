                    "text": "The velocity of an electron after being ejected (also known as the photoelectron) can be determined by the kinetic energy it gains upon ejection. According to the photoelectric effect, the kinetic energy (\\(KE\\)) of the ejected electron is given by:\n\n\\[ KE = h\\nu - \\phi \\]\n\nwhere \\(h\\) is Planck's constant, \\(\\nu\\) is the frequency of the incident photon, and \\(\\phi\\) is the work function, which is essentially the ionization energy needed to remove the electron from the atom.\n\nThe work function or ionization energy varies with the shell and subshell from which the electron is removed. The closer the electron is to the nucleus (lower principal quantum number \\(n\\)), the higher its binding energy (or ionization energy), meaning more energy is required to remove it. Conversely, the further the electron is from the nucleus (higher \\(n\\)), the lower its binding energy.\n\nGiven that the photons have enough energy to eject electrons from all subshells mentioned, the electron that comes from the shell closest to the nucleus (the 1s subshell) will have the highest kinetic energy upon ejection because it has the highest binding energy (work function). This is due to the fact that the higher binding energy leads to a greater difference when subtracted from the total photon energy, resulting in more kinetic energy for the ejected electron.\n\nTherefore, the electrons originally from the **1s** subshell would have the highest velocity after being ejected.\n\nCorrect answer: **A. 1s**"
