Higher interest rates can \"crowd out\" private investment as the cost of borrowing increases. To prevent this, central banks might implement expansionary monetary policy, such as lowering interest rates or buying government bonds, to keep interest rates low and encourage private investment. This combination helps maintain low interest rates and supports both government spending and private sector investment, potentially reducing the crowding out effect."
