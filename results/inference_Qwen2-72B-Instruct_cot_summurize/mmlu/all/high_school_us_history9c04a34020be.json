Both works address issues of racial inequality and advocate for the potential and humanity of people of color. While the other options also deal with important social issues, they do not specifically address racial equality in the same way as Wheatley's poem and King's speech. The Declaration of Independence and the Seneca Falls Declaration of Rights and Sentiments focus more broadly on human rights and women's rights, respectively, while Jonathan Edwards's sermon deals with religious themes and the fear of hell."
