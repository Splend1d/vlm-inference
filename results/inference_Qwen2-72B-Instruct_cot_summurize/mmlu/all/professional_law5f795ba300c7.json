With the man sitting in the passenger seat, the friend pulled the car over. They were feeling drunk and aggressive from the drinks. After discussing it, they decided it was a safe bet to enter the home and see what they could take. They broke in and took several bags of jewelry. While driving away, they were stopped and arrested for burglary. The passenger used the defense that he was too intoxicated to form the specific intent to enter the home for the purpose of committing a felony therein. Do the facts described here indicate that the defense will likely prevail at a trial on the merits?\n\nA. Yes, because he was in fact too intoxicated to form the intent needed to prove burglary.\nB. No, because intoxication is never a defense to the commission of a felony.\nC. No, because the facts indicate that he wasn't too intoxicated to form the necessary intent for burglary.\nD. Yes, because the feeling of being drunk and aggressive were not his natural mental state and therefore mens rea was defeated.\n"

No, because the facts indicate that he wasn't too intoxicated to form the necessary intent for burglary.\n\nIn this scenario, the man and his friend discussed and made a decision to enter the home and commit theft while they were both feeling drunk and aggressive. This discussion and decision-making process suggest that they were capable of forming the specific intent required for burglary despite their intoxication. The fact that they targeted a home with its lights out also indicates some level of planning and awareness, further undermining the defense of being too intoxicated to form the necessary intent. Therefore, based on the information provided, it is unlikely that the defense of intoxication would prevail in negating the specific intent element of burglary."
