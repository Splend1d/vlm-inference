This action could be seen as a responsible response to witnessing violence or harm being inflicted upon others.\n\nIn Scenario 2, committing a bank robbery is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. Robbery involves stealing and breaking the law, which is generally considered immoral. The act of wearing a bulletproof vest to protect oneself during the commission of the crime does not change the fact that the act itself is wrong."
