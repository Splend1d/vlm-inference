Cost of equity will likely decrease.\n\nHowever, this decrease in the cost of equity could also lead to an increase in the stock price as the company becomes more attractive to investors due to its higher relative return. But the question specifically asks for the effect on the company's cost of equity, not its stock price.\n\nThus, the most accurate answer to the question as stated would be C. Cost of equity will likely decrease. However, it's worth noting that this could indirectly lead to an increase in the stock price over time."
