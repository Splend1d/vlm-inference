In Scenario 1, there is no indication that any harm or deceit was involved in the transaction between you and Joe. Buying and reselling items is a common practice and not inherently morally wrong unless there are specific circumstances not mentioned here that would make it so (such as fraud or breaking a contract).\n\nIn Scenario 2, giving someone a gift that does not harm them is generally considered a kind gesture. Since the gift given is a bouquet of cookies, which is safe for Annie given her allergy to flowers, this action is also not morally wrong. It could be seen as thoughtful that you chose a gift that wouldn't trigger her allergies."
