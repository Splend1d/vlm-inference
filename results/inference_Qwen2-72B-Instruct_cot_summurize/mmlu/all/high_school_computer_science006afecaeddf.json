Interchanging line 1 and line 2\n\nThis change would not affect the number of operations, but it would not affect the functionality either since both `count` and `sum` are initialized before they are used.\n\nB. Interchanging line 5 and line 6\n\nThis would change the order in which `count` is incremented and `sum` is updated. This would lead to incorrect results because `sum` would be increased before `count`, leading to an incorrect calculation of the average on every iteration except the last one. This is not a valid solution.\n\nC. Interchanging line 6 and line 7\n\nIf we interchange lines 6 and 7, the new sequence inside the loop would look like this:\n```\nLine 5: count \u2190 count + 1\nLine 7: average \u2190 sum / count\nLine 6: sum \u2190 sum + value\n```\n\nIn this case, `average` would be calculated before adding the current `value` to `sum`. This means that on every iteration except the last one, `average` would be calculated based on the previous `sum` and `count` values. However, since the final average is only displayed after the loop has completed, this does not affect the final output. The final average will still be correct because the loop will have executed the correct number of times, and `sum` and `count` will have their final values when the loop ends. This change reduces the number of times the division operation is performed because the division (`sum / count`) would now occur once per iteration instead of twice (once as an assignment to `average` and once when calculating the next value for `average`).\n\nD. Interchanging line 7 and line 8\n\nInterchanging these lines would not reduce the number of operations and could potentially cause a runtime error if the loop was somehow exited prematurely, attempting to display `average` before it was assigned a value.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **C**. Interchanging line 6 and line 7 reduces the number of operations performed while maintaining the correctness of the program."
