The error involves a loss accrual that should have been recognized in the financial statements for the years ended December 31, year 1 ($40,000) and December 31, year 2 ($50,000).\n\nSince the error relates to the year 1 financial statements, the company must adjust the December 31, year 1, IFRS statement of financial position to reflect the $40,000 loss accrual that should have been recorded in that period.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. $40,000"
