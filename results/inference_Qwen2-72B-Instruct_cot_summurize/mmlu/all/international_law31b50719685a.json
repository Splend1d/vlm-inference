No, even though all peremptory norms set out obligations erga omnes, the latter may also spring from treaties regulating objective regimes or unilateral acts\n\nObligations erga omnes, which are duties owed to the international community as a whole, can indeed arise not only from peremptory norms (jus cogens) but also from other sources of international law. Treaties that regulate objective regimes (such as the law of the sea or international trade) and unilateral acts by states (such as declarations or statements) can create obligations that affect all states, even those not party to the treaty or not directly involved in the unilateral act. However, it is important to note that the obligations erga omnes created through these means do not have the same binding force as those derived from jus cogens norms, which are recognized as fundamental principles from which no derogation is permitted."
