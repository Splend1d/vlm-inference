The closest options from your list would be:\n\nA. violates human dignity.\nC. is tantamount to asserting that you are infallible.\n\nMill argues that suppressing an opinion assumes that the suppressor is certain of their own truth, which is a form of intellectual arrogance or infallibility (option C). He also believed that individuals have a right to express their opinions and to hear the opinions of others, as this is essential for personal growth and the discovery of truth (option A).\n\nOption D, \"is a risk worth taking if the speech is dangerous enough,\" does not align with Mill's view. While he acknowledges that there may be cases where speech can cause direct harm and should be limited (such as yelling \"fire\" in a crowded theater when there is no fire), he generally opposes censorship of ideas, even those that might be considered dangerous, because of the potential for truth within them and the danger of stifling progress and understanding."
