This capsid protects the genetic material inside the virus and helps it to remain intact during transmission from one host cell to another. In some viruses, this protein coat may be further enclosed in a lipid envelope derived from the host cell membrane.\n\nWhile bacteria (option B), eukaryotes (option C), and archaea (option D) all have cell walls or membranes that surround them, these structures are not specifically referred to as \"protein coats\" in the same way that the capsid is for viruses. Bacterial cell walls are primarily composed of peptidoglycan, eukaryotic cells have a plasma membrane with various proteins embedded in it, and archaeal cell walls can vary but often contain pseudopeptidoglycan or other unique components."
