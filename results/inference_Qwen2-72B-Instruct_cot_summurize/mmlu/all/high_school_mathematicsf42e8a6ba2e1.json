This means that for any point $(x, y)$ on the original graph, there exists a corresponding point $(x+2, 2y)$ on the shifted and stretched graph.\n\nLet's denote the transformed function as $g(x)$. According to the problem, $g(x) = 2f(x-2)$. However, since the transformed graph is identical to the original graph, this implies that $f(x) = g(x) = 2f(x-2)$ for all $x$.\n\nWe are given that $f(0) = 0.1$. We need to find $f(10)$. \n\nTo do so, let's apply the property $f(x) = 2f(x-2)$ repeatedly:\n\n- $f(2) = 2f(0) = 2 \\times 0.1 = 0.2$\n- $f(4) = 2f(2) = 2 \\times 0.2 = 0.4$\n- $f(6) = 2f(4) = 2 \\times 0.4 = 0.8$\n- $f(8) = 2f(6) = 2 \\times 0.8 = 1.6$\n- $f(10) = 2f(8) = 2 \\times 1.6 = 3.2$\n\nTherefore, $f(10) = 3.2$, which corresponds to option D."
