She was smoking marijuana, blowing it out the open window, and not sharing it with the driver. The driver fell asleep, causing the car to veer off the highway and go into a ditch where it landed upside-down. Both the driver and passenger were seriously injured. She sued the operator for negligence. The operator filed a counterclaim asking for damages against the passenger by arguing that the passenger was herself negligent by \"smoking weed\" and causing him to fall asleep. Is the court likely to grant the passenger's motion to dismiss the counterclaim?\n\nA. Yes, because the passenger was not actively participating in a joint enterprise and did not do enough to contribute to the cause of the accident.\nB. Yes, because a vehicle operator is always liable and a passenger cannot be made liable for the driver's actions under any circumstances.\nC. No, because the driver has properly alleged a joint enterprise situation where the passenger is liable for her share of the negligence in causing the accident.\nD. No, because the passenger was breaking the law, making her negligent per se.\n"

Yes, because the passenger was not actively participating in a joint enterprise and did not do enough to contribute to the cause of the accident.\n\nIn this scenario, the passenger's actions of smoking marijuana could potentially be seen as contributing to the driver's state, but it is not clear that she had any control over the vehicle or was actively participating in the operation of the vehicle. Therefore, it would be difficult for the driver to prove that the passenger's actions directly caused him to fall asleep and crash the car. Additionally, the concept of joint enterprise requires that both parties have an equal say in the operation of the vehicle and benefit from its use, which does not seem to be the case here. Thus, the court is likely to grant the passenger's motion to dismiss the counterclaim based on the lack of evidence that she contributed to the cause of the accident in a significant way. However, this answer assumes that the jurisdiction does not have specific laws that might hold a passenger responsible for distracting or impairing the driver, which could potentially change the outcome."
