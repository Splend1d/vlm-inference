Neurologic examination shows no other abnormalities. A skull x-ray shows a linear, nondepressed basal skull fracture. Two weeks later, the patient develops polyuria and polydipsia. Laboratory studies show a serum glucose concentration within the reference range, increased serum osmolality, and decreased urine osmolality. Following the administration of desmopressin, urine osmolality increases. The beneficial effect of this drug is most likely due to activation of which of the following?\n\nA. Adenylyl cyclase\nB. Ca2+ channels\nC. Janus kinase\nD. Serine kinase\n"

Desmopressin is a synthetic analog of vasopressin (antidiuretic hormone, ADH) that acts on V2 receptors in the kidney's collecting ducts, leading to increased water reabsorption and decreased urine output. Activation of these receptors by desmopressin stimulates adenylyl cyclase, which converts ATP to cyclic AMP (cAMP), leading to the insertion of aquaporin-2 water channels into the apical membrane of principal cells in the collecting ducts. This process facilitates water reabsorption in response to the increased serum osmolality detected by the hypothalamic osmoreceptors."
