The phrase \"8 and 2 over 4\" can be written as \\(8\\frac{2}{4}\\).\n\nFirst, convert the whole number (8) into a fraction with the same denominator as the fractional part (which is 4). Since there are 4 parts in a whole when considering quarters, 8 wholes are equivalent to \\(\\frac{8 \\times 4}{4} = \\frac{32}{4}\\).\n\nNext, add this to the fractional part of the mixed number:\n\\[\n\\frac{32}{4} + \\frac{2}{4} = \\frac{34}{4}\n\\]\n\nHowever, this answer isn't in simplest form yet. Both the numerator (34) and the denominator (4) can be divided by 2, which is their greatest common divisor:\n\\[\n\\frac{34 \\div 2}{4 \\div 2} = \\frac{17}{2}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the improper fraction in simplest form for \"8 and 2 over 4\" is \\(\\boxed{\\text{A. 17 over 2}}\\)."
