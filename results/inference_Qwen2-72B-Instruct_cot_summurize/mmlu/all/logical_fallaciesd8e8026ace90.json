Hypostatization: This fallacy involves treating an abstract concept as if it were a concrete reality.\nC. Question begging epithets: This fallacy involves using emotionally charged language to bias the audience's perception of an argument.\nD. Style over substance: This refers to prioritizing the presentation or style of an argument over its content or validity."
