When the friend refused to return the card during a later conversation in a bar, the man pointed a handgun at the friend, held his finger on the trigger, and said, \"Give it back!\" A bystander screamed and threw a beer bottle at the man. The bottle struck the man's hand and caused the gun to discharge, killing the friend instantly. The man was convicted of murder in a jurisdiction that follows the common law of homicide. On appeal, he argues that the evidence, which essentially set out the facts above, was insufficient to support a verdict of murder. Should the man's conviction be reversed?\n\nA. No, because the evidence was sufficient to support a verdict of depraved-heart murder.\nB. No, because the evidence was sufficient to support a verdict of felony murder.\nC. Yes, because the evidence showed that the man did not intentionally pull the trigger.\nD. Yes, because the evidence showed that the man's intent was not to kill the friend, but to take property from him under a claim of right.\n"

No, because the evidence was sufficient to support a verdict of felony murder.\n\nUnder the felony murder rule, a person can be convicted of murder if they cause death while committing or attempting to commit certain felonies, even if they didn't intend to kill anyone. In this case, the man committed armed robbery (by using force to take back his property) and during the commission of that felony, the friend was killed. Therefore, the man can be convicted of felony murder.\n\nA depraved-heart murder (also known as second-degree murder) requires that the defendant acted with extreme recklessness or indifference to human life, but the evidence doesn't necessarily show that here since the man wasn't actively trying to kill his friend.\n\nThe fact that the man did not intentionally pull the trigger or that his intent was to take property under a claim of right does not absolve him of responsibility for the death that occurred during the commission of the felony. Therefore, options C and D are incorrect."
