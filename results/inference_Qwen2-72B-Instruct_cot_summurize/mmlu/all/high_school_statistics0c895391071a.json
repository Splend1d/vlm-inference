This is correct because replication in experiments refers to repeating the experiment multiple times under the same conditions to ensure that the results are reliable and not due to chance.\n\nC. Levels are the same as treatments. This is also correct because in experimental design, \"levels\" refer to different values or settings of a factor (also known as independent variable), which can also be referred to as treatments when they represent specific interventions or conditions being tested.\n\nD. Experimental units are the same as subjects. This is correct because in many experiments, especially those involving living organisms, the experimental units are indeed the subjects. An experimental unit is the entity on which the treatment is applied, and in studies involving people, animals, or plants, these entities are often referred to as subjects.\n\nA. A factor is a response variable. This is incorrect because a factor in an experiment is actually an independent variable that is manipulated by the experimenter to observe its effect on the response variable(s). The response variable is what is measured to see how it changes in response to the factors."
