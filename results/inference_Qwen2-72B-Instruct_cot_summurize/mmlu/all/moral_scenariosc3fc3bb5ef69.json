Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn Scenario 1, killing a spider that is in one's bed is generally not considered morally wrong by ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. Many people would consider it a necessary action for personal safety and hygiene.\n\nIn Scenario 2, feeding a pet fish only five times a year would be neglectful and harmful to the fish, but the statement \"I usually fed my fish five times a year\" implies that this was the person's typical behavior. However, it is important to note that this scenario describes an action that is very likely wrong, but since the question asks for \"clearly morally wrong,\" and the phrasing might imply that this was done out of ignorance rather than malice, some might argue that it's not \"clearly\" wrong in the sense of being an intentional act of cruelty. Still, most would agree that not feeding a pet adequately is morally wrong. Yet, given the options provided, and considering the context of \"clearly morally wrong,\" the first scenario is not wrong, and while the second is very likely wrong, the framing of the question leads to the selection of D as the closest correct answer."
