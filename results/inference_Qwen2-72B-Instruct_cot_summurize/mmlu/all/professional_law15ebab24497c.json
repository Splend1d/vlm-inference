At trial the prosecution offered evidence that the man was convicted of two prior sexual assault charges against two other women, both occurring about two years earlier. The allegations and the man's modus operandi in those convictions were almost identical to the instant case. Defense counsel objected to the evidence on the basis that its highly prejudicial effect outweighed its probative value. Based on the Federal Rules of Evidence, what will the court most likely rule regarding this issue?\n\nA. The evidence is too prejudicial and must be excluded.\nB. The evidence is inadmissible because it is not relevant to the present charges and has a low probative value.\nC. The evidence is admissible because present public policy strongly favors the apprehension and prosecution of sexual predators.\nD. The evidence is admissible due to the factual similarity with the present charge, which gives the evidence strong probative value.\n"

The evidence is admissible due to the factual similarity with the present charge, which gives the evidence strong probative value.\n\nUnder Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b), evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts may be admissible for purposes such as proving motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, absence of mistake, or lack of accident. In this case, the fact that the defendant was convicted of two prior sexual assaults with a similar modus operandi could be relevant to show a pattern of behavior that is pertinent to the current charges. However, the court must also consider whether the probative value of the evidence is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice under Rule 403. Given the factual similarity and the nature of the crime, the court may find that the probative value is high enough to justify admitting the evidence despite its potential prejudicial effect."
