This principle rules out actions that treat people merely as tools for achieving some other purpose without regard for their own ends and goals.\n\nIn this context:\n\nA. Selling one of our teeth might be permissible under certain circumstances (e.g., if doing so would help someone in need and it doesn't harm us significantly), but it's not directly addressed by Kant's humanity formulation unless it involves treating oneself or another person merely as a means.\n\nB. Engaging in prostitution is more clearly impermissible according to Kant's humanity formulation, as it typically involves using one's body solely for the pleasure of another, thereby treating oneself as a mere means to an end rather than an end in themselves.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nB. Engage in prostitution.\n\nHowever, since the question allows for multiple options, and depending on the specific circumstances surrounding option A, the broader interpretation could be:\n\nC. Both A and B\n\nBut based on Kant's direct arguments and the typical understanding of his formulations, option B is the clearer example of something made impermissible by the humanity formulation of the categorical imperative."
