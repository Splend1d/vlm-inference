This condition can occur when certain strains of Staphylococcus aureus produce toxins that can lead to high fever, rash, and low blood pressure, among other symptoms. TSS has been linked to the use of highly absorbent tampons in menstruating women, although it can also affect men, children, and postmenopausal women."
