OCI includes items that are not included in net income but are included in equity, such as unrealized gains or losses on available-for-sale securities and foreign currency translation adjustments.\n\nNet income = $11,000\n\nThe cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle is reported as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the statement of changes in equity, so it does not affect comprehensive income.\n\nUnrealized loss on available-for-sale securities = -$3,000 (This is a negative item for OCI)\n\nForeign currency translation adjustment = $2,000 (This is a positive item for OCI)\n\nThe increase in common stock does not affect comprehensive income because it's a result of transactions with owners, not operating or financing activities.\n\nThus, comprehensive income would be calculated as follows:\n\nComprehensive Income = Net Income + OCI\n= $11,000 + (-$3,000) + $2,000\n= $10,000\n\nSo, the correct answer is B. $10,000."
