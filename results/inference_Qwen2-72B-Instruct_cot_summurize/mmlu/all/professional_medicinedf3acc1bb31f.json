PID is often caused by bacterial infections, such as Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, which can ascend from the cervix to the upper genital tract, causing inflammation and pain.\n\nGiven her history of unprotected sex with multiple partners and the presence of lower abdominal pain and fever, it is prudent to treat for both Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. These bacteria are common causes of PID and are typically treated with antibiotics that cover both organisms.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae"
