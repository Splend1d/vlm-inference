The formula for the F-ratio is:\n\n\\[ F = \\frac{MS_{between}}{MS_{within}} \\]\n\nwhere \\(MS_{between}\\) is the mean square for between-group variability, and \\(MS_{within}\\) is the mean square for within-group variability.\n\nThe denominator term in the F-ratio is \\(MS_{within}\\), which represents the average variability within each group. To reduce the magnitude of this denominator term, we need to decrease the within-group variability (\\(MS_{within}\\)).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Decreasing within-group variability.\n\nThis would make the denominator smaller, thereby increasing the overall value of the F-ratio, which can lead to a more significant result in hypothesis testing if the between-group variability remains unchanged or increases."
