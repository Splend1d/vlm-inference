Premature infants have less mineralized skeletons and lower stores of calcium and phosphorus compared to full-term infants. They also have immature renal function, which affects the activation of vitamin D. As a result, they are at risk for vitamin D deficiency rickets, which can lead to hypocalcemia and convulsions. The use of diuretics like frusemide can exacerbate this by increasing the loss of calcium and other electrolytes. Additionally, if the mother has vitamin D deficiency, it can contribute to the development of rickets in the premature infant."
