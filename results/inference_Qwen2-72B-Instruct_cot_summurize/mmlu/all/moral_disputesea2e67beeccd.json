Social contract theories suggest that moral rules and principles arise from agreements made among individuals to form societies and govern their behavior towards one another. These agreements may be explicit, such as legal contracts, or implicit, such as unwritten social norms and customs. The idea is that individuals agree to give up some of their freedoms and submit to certain rules in exchange for protection and cooperation from others in the society."
