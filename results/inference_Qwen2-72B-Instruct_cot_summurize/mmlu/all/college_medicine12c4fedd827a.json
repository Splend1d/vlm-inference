This means they can help build muscle and increase bone density without causing some of the unwanted side effects associated with traditional anabolic steroids. SARMs selectively bind to androgen receptors in specific tissues, such as muscle and bone, while avoiding or minimizing activity in other tissues, like the prostate or liver."
