Given that her thyroid function studies and ECG are normal, it's less likely that these symptoms are due to an underlying medical condition.\n\nAmong the options provided:\n\nA. Lithium carbonate is used primarily for bipolar disorder and not typically for anxiety disorders.\n\nB. Methylphenidate is a stimulant used for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and would not be appropriate for treating anxiety.\n\nC. Olanzapine is an atypical antipsychotic that may be used off-label for anxiety, but it is not a first-line treatment for panic disorder.\n\nD. Paroxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) and is commonly used for the treatment of anxiety disorders, including panic disorder.\n\nGiven the information provided, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient would be **D. Paroxetine**. However, it's important to note that treatment decisions should always be made in consultation with a healthcare provider who can take into account the full clinical picture and any potential contraindications."
