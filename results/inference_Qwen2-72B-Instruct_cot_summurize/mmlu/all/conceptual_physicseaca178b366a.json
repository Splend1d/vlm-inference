This means that whatever current flows into a component must also flow out of it. Therefore, if the current in the filament of a lamp is 3 A, the current in the connecting wire, assuming it's part of the same closed circuit and not branching off, will also be 3 A. This principle is known as Kirchhoff's Current Law."
