Postmodernism often critiques the grand narratives and universal truths that underpin modernist thought, including those related to Enlightenment ideals such as individual rights, equality, and justice. This critique does not necessarily mean that postmodernists do not care about these issues, but rather that they question the ability of any single narrative or framework to fully capture or address them."
