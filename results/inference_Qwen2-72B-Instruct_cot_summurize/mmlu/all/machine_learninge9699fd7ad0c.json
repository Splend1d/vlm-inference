The second hidden layer has $10$ activations. The output is a scalar representing the house price. Assuming a vanilla network with affine transformations and with no batch normalization and no learnable parameters in the activation function, how many parameters does this network have?\n\nA. 111021\nB. 110010\nC. 111110\nD. 110011\n"

It seems there might be a minor typo or misinterpretation in the options given. If we look closely at the options, the closest one to our calculation is:\n\nB. 110010\n\nBut based on the calculation, the correct number of parameters should be 111,011. There seems to be a discrepancy between the calculated answer and the provided options. Given the calculation, none of the options A through D exactly matches the correct number of parameters, but B is the closest if we consider rounding or potential typo issues. However, strictly speaking, the precise answer based on the question's parameters is not listed among the choices."
