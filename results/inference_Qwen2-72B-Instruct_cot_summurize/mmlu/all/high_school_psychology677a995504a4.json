This includes aspects such as physical traits and innate tendencies, which are collectively referred to as temperament. Temperament encompasses an individual's natural inclinations toward certain behaviors or emotional responses, which can influence personality development. The other options (environment, culture, and learning) are more closely associated with the \"nurture\" side of the debate, which focuses on the role of external factors in shaping an individual."
