It is the way a brand is perceived by consumers based on various sensory and emotional cues. Brand repositioning refers to changing the perception of a brand in the minds of consumers, brand stretching involves extending a brand into new product categories, and brand equity refers to the value a brand adds to a product beyond its functional attributes."
