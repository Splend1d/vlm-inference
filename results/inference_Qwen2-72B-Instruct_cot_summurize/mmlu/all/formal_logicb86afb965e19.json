We will assume that all propositions are true and then check if there is any contradiction.\n\nLet's assume that all propositions are true:\n1. A \u2283 (~B \u2228 C) is true\n2. C \u2283 D is true\n3. A \u2228 (B \u00b7 ~D) is true\n4. A \u2261 (B \u2283 D) is true\n\nFrom proposition 4, we can deduce that:\n- If A is true, then (B \u2283 D) must also be true.\n- If A is false, then (B \u2283 D) must also be false.\n\nNow let's check each option:\n\nOption B: Consistent valuation when A and D are true and B and C are false\n- Proposition 1 is true because ~B is true.\n- Proposition 2 is true because C is false.\n- Proposition 3 is true because A is true.\n- Proposition 4 is true because (B \u2283 D) is true since B is false.\n\nSo, option B is consistent.\n\nOption C: Consistent valuation when A, B, and D are true and C is false\n- Proposition 1 is true because ~B is false and C is false.\n- Proposition 2 is true because C is false.\n- Proposition 3 is true because A is true.\n- Proposition 4 is true because (B \u2283 D) is true since B and D are true.\n\nSo, option C is consistent.\n\nOption D: Consistent valuation when C and D are true and A and B are false\n- Proposition 1 is true because A is false.\n- Proposition 2 is true because C and D are true.\n- Proposition 3 is true because A is false.\n- Proposition 4 is true because A is false and (B \u2283 D) is true since B is false.\n\nSo, option D is consistent.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\nC. Consistent. Consistent valuation when A and D are true and B and C are false\nD. Consistent. Consistent valuation when C and D are true and A and B are false\nE. Consistent. Consistent valuation when A, B, and D are true and C is false\n\nHowever, since there is no option E, the correct answer is:\nB. Consistent. Consistent valuation when A and D are true and B and C are false\nC. Consistent. Consistent valuation when A, B, and D are true and C is false\nD. Consistent. Consistent valuation when C and D are true and A and B are false"
