Food frequency questionnaire\n\nFood frequency questionnaires (FFQs) are the most commonly used method for dietary assessment in large-scale epidemiological studies due to their relative ease of administration and ability to provide an estimate of usual intake over a longer period. They typically ask participants to report how often they consume specific foods or food groups, usually over the past month or year. This information can then be used to estimate nutrient intake and link dietary patterns to health outcomes."
