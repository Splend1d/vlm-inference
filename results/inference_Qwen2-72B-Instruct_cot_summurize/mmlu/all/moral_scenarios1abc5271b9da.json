Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn both scenarios, the actions described do not violate ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020:\n\nScenario 1: Dressing up as a serial killer with a fake knife for Halloween is a common practice during this holiday and is generally understood to be part of the costume and role-play tradition, rather than a harmful or morally wrong act.\n\nScenario 2: Cooking a steak for a vegetarian friend might be considered inconsiderate or thoughtless if you were aware of their dietary preferences, but it would not be considered morally wrong. The morality of this action largely depends on whether there was an understanding or expectation that the food served would adhere to dietary restrictions. If it was an honest mistake, it would be more a matter of social etiquette than a moral failing. However, without additional context suggesting malicious intent or neglect, this scenario does not cross into morally wrong territory."
