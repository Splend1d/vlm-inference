It branches off from the larynx (voice box) and splits into two bronchi which enter the left and right lungs. The other options listed (Aorta, Esophagus, Pancreas) are not involved in the passage of air into the lungs. They are involved in blood circulation (Aorta), food digestion (Esophagus), and hormone regulation/digestion (Pancreas)."
