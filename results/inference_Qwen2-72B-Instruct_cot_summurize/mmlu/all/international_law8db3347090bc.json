Under international law, particularly the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), port states have the right to exercise criminal jurisdiction over foreign ships in their ports under certain circumstances. This usually pertains to serious crimes that may have an impact on the port state's interests, such as drug trafficking, human trafficking, piracy, and serious pollution incidents. However, this does not mean that they enforce jurisdiction in all cases, nor are they limited to just customs laws or disruptions to peace and public order. The extent of enforcement can vary depending on the specific circumstances and the laws of the individual state."
