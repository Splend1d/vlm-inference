                    "text": "The correct answer is B. Steps 1 and 2 are endothermic, and step 3 is exothermic.\n\nExplanation:\n\nIn the formation of a solution, energy changes occur at each step due to intermolecular forces being broken or formed.\n\nStep 1: Separating solvent molecules requires energy because it breaks the intermolecular forces between them (such as hydrogen bonds, van der Waals forces, etc.). This is an endothermic process.\n\nStep 2: Similarly, separating solute molecules also requires energy to overcome their intermolecular forces. This is also an endothermic process.\n\nStep 3: When the separated solute and solvent molecules come together, new intermolecular forces are established between them. This process releases energy, making it an exothermic process.\n\nOverall, whether a solution forms spontaneously depends on the net energy change, which is determined by the balance between the endothermic processes of breaking apart solvent and solute molecules and the exothermic process of forming new interactions between solvent and solute molecules. A solution will form if the total energy released in step 3 is greater than the total energy absorbed in steps 1 and 2."
