Among the options you've provided, the most directly related distinction to the killing/letting die debate in the context of euthanasia is:\n\nC. Active/passive euthanasia\n\nActive euthanasia involves taking deliberate action to cause a patient's death, such as administering a lethal dose of medication. Passive euthanasia involves withholding or withdrawing life-sustaining treatment, allowing the patient to die from their underlying condition.\n\nThe killing/letting die distinction argues that there is a moral difference between actively causing someone's death and passively allowing them to die by not preventing their death. This distinction has been debated among ethicists, with some arguing that there is no significant moral difference between the two, while others maintain that there is a crucial ethical distinction.\n\nIt's important to note that the other distinctions you've mentioned (murder vs. killing, physician vs. patient, and involuntary vs. nonvoluntary euthanasia) are also morally relevant in different contexts but are not directly tied to the killing/letting die distinction in the same way that active/passive euthanasia is."
