Since the thickness requirement is only one brick, we only need to consider the length and width of the brick for calculating the area it covers when laid flat. Thus, the area covered by one brick:\n\\[ \\text{Area}_{\\text{brick}} = 4 \\, \\text{inches} \\times 6 \\, \\text{inches} = 24 \\, \\text{square inches} \\]\n\nNow, to find the total number of bricks needed, divide the patio area by the area covered by one brick:\n\\[ \\text{Total Bricks} = \\frac{\\text{Area}_{\\text{patio}}}{\\text{Area}_{\\text{brick}}} = \\frac{17,280 \\, \\text{square inches}}{24 \\, \\text{square inches}} = 720 \\]\n\nHowever, this calculation does not match any of the options provided. This discrepancy arises because the question asks for the greatest number of bricks the salesman could sell under these conditions, but our calculation seems to suggest a much smaller number.\n\nUpon reevaluation, the provided answer choices seem to be based on an incorrect calculation or understanding of the problem. Given the dimensions and the requirement to cover the patio with a single layer of bricks, the correct number of bricks required would indeed be 720. However, none of the answer choices reflect this.\n\nGiven the provided options, it's clear that either the question has been misinterpreted or there's a misunderstanding in the setup. Based on the direct calculation and the given options, the closest and largest possible number of bricks that could potentially fit within the context of the problem (considering potential misinterpretations) is:\n\nA. 5,760\n\nThis choice doesn't directly align with a logical interpretation of the given information but is the greatest number among the options. However, based on the straightforward calculation, the answer should be 720, which is not listed among the choices."
