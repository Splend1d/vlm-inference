That quantum jump would have to be made before the various scientific, technological, agricultural, and industrial revolutions on which our post-quantum-leap world rests. It could only be accomplished by exploiting the ecosystems, mineral resources, and human assets of whole continents outside the lands of the society making the jump. Western Europe did just that by means of its brutality and guns and, more important, by geographical and ecological luck.\"\nCopyright \u00a9 2015 Cambridge University Press.\nAlfred Crosby, historian, Ecological Imperialism, 2004\nWhich of the following would best support the author's assertion regarding the \"quantum jump\" that would help Western Europe achieve global hegemony between 1450 and 1750 C.E.?\n\nA. The colonization of the interior of Africa\nB. The conquest of the Aztec Empire\nC. The reformation of Catholic Christianity\nD. The isolationism of Tokugawa Japan\n"

The conquest of the Aztec Empire\n\nThis event allowed for the exploitation of vast amounts of silver and other resources, which fueled the economies of European powers and contributed to their ability to expand and dominate other regions around the world. This conquest was part of a larger process of colonization and exploitation of the Americas, which played a crucial role in the rise of Western Europe during this period."
