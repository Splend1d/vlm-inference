Goitrogens are substances that may interfere with the function of the thyroid gland by inhibiting iodine uptake or thyroid hormone production. However, it's important to note that these effects are typically seen at very high intakes, and cooking brassicas can reduce their goitrogenic activity. For most people, the benefits of eating these nutrient-rich vegetables far outweigh any potential risks."
