The husband's wife now brings an action to recover damages for loss of society and companionship. The wife testified that she and her husband had a close relationship and that they were happily married for over 15 years. Then on cross-examination, defendant's counsel asked her if she \"was aware of the affair that her husband was having with his passenger?\"The wife's attorney immediately objected to this question. The judge should rule that the question is\n\nA. objectionable, because the question is beyond the scope of direct examination.\nB. objectionable, because it was highly prejudicial.\nC. unobjectionable, because plaintiff's knowledge of such an affair was probative of the value to be placed on her loss.\nD. unobjectionable, because it was relevant on the issue of negligence.\n"

While the information about the affair might be relevant to the emotional state of the wife or the nature of the marriage, introducing such a detail could unfairly prejudice the jury against the wife by implying that her loss is less significant due to her husband's infidelity. This could distract from the central issues of the case, which are the defendant's liability for the accident and the damages suffered by the wife as a result of her husband's death. Moreover, the question goes beyond the scope of direct examination, which focused on the closeness of their relationship and the duration of their marriage, not on any potential conflicts or issues within the marriage."
