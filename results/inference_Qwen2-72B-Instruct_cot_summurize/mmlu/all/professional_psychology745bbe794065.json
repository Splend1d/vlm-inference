This is because the brain associates the new stimuli with the original event and elicits a similar emotional response.\n\nHere's why the other options are not correct:\n\nB. Higher-order conditioning involves one conditioned stimulus triggering another conditioned response through association with an original conditioned stimulus. In this case, there is no indication of a chain of conditioned stimuli leading to the anxiety response.\n\nC. Latent learning refers to learning that occurs without reinforcement and is not demonstrated until there is a need for it. The anxiety response in this scenario does not fit the criteria for latent learning.\n\nD. Response shaping involves reinforcing successive approximations of a desired behavior. Anxiety induced by reading about an accident does not involve the reinforcement of behavior approximations toward a goal."
