The hypothalamus releases gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), which stimulates the anterior pituitary gland to release follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). These hormones then act on the testes to regulate the production of testosterone and sperm. Oxytocin, on the other hand, is primarily associated with social bonding, childbirth, and lactation."
