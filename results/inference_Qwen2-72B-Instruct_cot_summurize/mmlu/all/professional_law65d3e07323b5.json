In 2000, the railroad decided to discontinue operating its trains over the strip conveyed in 1955. By 2004, the growth of a nearby town had made the 300-acre cattle ranch valuable as a potential site for homes or for an industrial park. However, as of January 1, 2005, the governing body of the county (in which the ranch sits) took appropriate action, in accordance with Texas statutes, to zone the 300-acre cattle ranch as single-family residential property with a minimum lot size of one acre. The ordinance provided that the exclusion of ranching operations and industrial development was necessary to protect the health of county residents by limiting the extent of waste disposal and preventing pollution of air and the nearby river, the county's major water supply. The state's power authority has now taken appropriate action to condemn half of the 300-acre cattle ranch, which will be flooded as a result of construction of a dam for a proposed hydroelectric facility. The 150 acres taken includes the 20-acre strip described in the deed to the railroad. Is the railroad entitled to any compensation from the state's power authority?\n\nA. Yes, because if all the leased land is condemned for the full balance of the lease term, the lessee is entitled to compensation for the taking of the leasehold estate.\nB. Yes, because the holder of an easement benefit is entitled to compensation for the value lost.\nC. No, because by discontinuing its operation of trains, the railroad's determinable, feeterminated.\nD. No, because the holder of an easement is not entitled to compensation when the servient tenement is extinguished by condemnation.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is C. No, because by discontinuing its operation of trains, the railroad's determinable fee terminated.\n\nWhen the rancher conveyed the 20-acre strip to the railroad, he did so with the condition that it would be used for railroad purposes. This created a determinable fee, meaning that the railroad's interest would automatically terminate upon the cessation of the use specified in the conveyance. When the railroad decided to discontinue operating its trains over the strip in 2000, the condition was no longer being met, and the railroad's interest in the property came to an end. Therefore, the railroad is not entitled to any compensation from the state's power authority since it no longer holds any interest in the property.\n\nIt is important to note that the daughter and her husband received the remainder interest in the property after the rancher's death, and they would be the ones entitled to compensation for the taking of their property by the state's power authority. However, the question specifically asks about the railroad's entitlement to compensation, which is none due to the termination of their interest."
