Replacement level\n\nThe replacement level fertility is the number of children a woman must have on average to replace herself and her partner, taking into account the sex ratio at birth and the survival rate up to reproductive age. This is usually around 2.1 children per woman in developed countries. However, this number can vary depending on mortality rates and other factors. In some developing countries with higher mortality rates, the replacement level might be higher."
