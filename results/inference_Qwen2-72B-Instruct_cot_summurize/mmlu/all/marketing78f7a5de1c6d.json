This is a one-time, transactional exchange where the focus is on the immediate purchase or sale of a product or service. Relationship marketing, on the other hand, focuses on building long-term relationships with customers, while service mix refers to the combination of services offered by a company, and service failure refers to a situation where a service does not meet customer expectations."
