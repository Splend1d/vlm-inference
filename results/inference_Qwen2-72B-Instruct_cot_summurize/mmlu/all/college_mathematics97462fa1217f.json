However, an easier way to solve this problem is by considering the fact that the vector from the origin to the closest point on the plane will be perpendicular to the plane.\n\nThe normal vector to the plane \\(2x + y + 3z = 3\\) is \\(\\mathbf{n} = \\langle2, 1, 3\\rangle\\). The closest point to the origin on the plane lies along the line passing through the origin and having direction \\(\\mathbf{n}\\).\n\nLet's parameterize this line as:\n\\[\n\\mathbf{r}(t) = t\\mathbf{n} = t\\langle2, 1, 3\\rangle = \\langle2t, t, 3t\\rangle.\n\\]\n\nSubstitute the parametric equations into the equation of the plane:\n\\[\n2(2t) + t + 3(3t) = 3,\n\\]\nwhich simplifies to:\n\\[\n4t + t + 9t = 3,\n\\]\n\\[\n14t = 3,\n\\]\n\\[\nt = \\frac{3}{14}.\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\(t = \\frac{3}{14}\\) back into the parametric equations gives us the coordinates of the point:\n\\[\n\\left(2\\left(\\frac{3}{14}\\right), \\left(\\frac{3}{14}\\right), 3\\left(\\frac{3}{14}\\right)\\right) = \\left(\\frac{6}{14}, \\frac{3}{14}, \\frac{9}{14}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{3}{7}, \\frac{3}{14}, \\frac{9}{14}\\right).\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **B. (3/7, 3/14, 9/14)**."
