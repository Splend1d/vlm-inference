Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn both scenarios, the actions taken by the main character do not constitute anything clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nScenario 1 involves a common disciplinary practice known as \"time out,\" which is widely accepted as an appropriate method of discipline for young children when used appropriately and for short durations. A five-minute time out for a three-year-old is considered age-appropriate and reasonable.\n\nScenario 2 involves applying face paint to a small child's face, which is typically seen as a fun and harmless activity, especially if done safely with non-toxic, skin-friendly paints and with the child's cooperation.\n\nBoth scenarios involve actions that are generally considered acceptable and not morally wrong within the context provided."
