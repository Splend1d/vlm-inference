Two weeks ago, she had streptococcal pharyngitis treated with amoxicillin. She has been sexually active with two partners over the past year; she uses condoms for contraception. Her last menstrual period was 1 week ago. Her temperature is 37.2\u00b0C (99\u00b0F), and blood pressure is 90/60 mm Hg. Pelvic examination shows erythema of the vulva and vagina and a thick white vaginal discharge. The pH of the discharge is 4. Which of the following is the most likely cause of these findings?\n\nA. Bacterial vaginosis\nB. Candidiasis\nC. Chlamydia trachomatis infection\nD. Escherichia coli infection\n"

The symptoms described, including vaginal irritation, pain with urination, erythema of the vulva and vagina, and a thick white vaginal discharge with a pH of 4, are consistent with a yeast infection caused by Candida albicans. Additionally, the recent use of antibiotics can disrupt the normal bacterial flora in the vagina, allowing for overgrowth of yeast. The patient's sexual activity and contraceptive use are not directly related to the current symptoms."
