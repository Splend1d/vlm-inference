It suggests that one should only act according to maxims (principles or rules of action) that could be willed to become universal laws. This formulation does not consider the consequences of actions or an individual's desires but instead focuses on the consistency and logical coherence of the maxim when applied universally. If a maxim leads to a contradiction when universalized, then acting on that maxim is considered morally impermissible."
