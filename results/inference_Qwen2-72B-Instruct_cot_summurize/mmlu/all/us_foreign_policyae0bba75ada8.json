Foreign policies of other states: The actions and reactions of other countries can limit the options available to the US in international relations. For instance, if multiple countries form an alliance or take a unified stance on an issue, it could restrict the US's ability to act unilaterally.\n\nB. International law: The US is a signatory to various international treaties and agreements that outline rules for conduct in international affairs. These legal frameworks can constrain US actions, particularly in areas such as human rights, trade, war, and diplomacy.\n\nC. Intergovernmental organizations: Organizations like the United Nations, World Trade Organization, or NATO have rules and norms that member states, including the US, are expected to follow. These organizations can limit US policy choices through collective decision-making processes or by imposing sanctions or penalties for non-compliance."
