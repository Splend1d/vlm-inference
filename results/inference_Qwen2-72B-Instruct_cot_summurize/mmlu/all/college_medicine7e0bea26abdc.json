I and IV.\n\nTo calculate the Doppler shift in perceived sound frequency, you need to know the speed of sound in the medium (I) and the frequency of the emitted sound (IV). The speed of sound is used to determine the wavelength of the sound waves, which is crucial for calculating the Doppler effect. The frequency of the emitted sound is also necessary to find the change in frequency due to the relative motion between the source and the observer.\n\nThe time of interaction between the sound source and detector (II) and the distance between the source and detector (III) are not directly required for the calculation of the Doppler shift, although they can affect the intensity and duration of the sound heard by the observer. The Doppler shift formula does not explicitly use these values. However, it's worth noting that if the source or observer is moving, the distance will change over time, which could impact the calculation if the interaction lasts long enough for this change to be significant. Still, in the context of the given options, I and IV are the essential variables for determining the Doppler shift."
