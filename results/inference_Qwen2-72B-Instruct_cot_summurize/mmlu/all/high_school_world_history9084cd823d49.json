It is surrounded by mountains and can be approached from one side only; it has no crops, trees, or water, but has reservoirs in which rainwater is collected. The Arabs often cut off the inhabitants from their supply of drinking-water until the they buy them off with money and pieces of cloth. It is an exceedingly hot place. It is the port of the Indians, and to it come large vessels from Kinbayat [Cambay], Kawlam [Quilon], Calicut and many other Malabar ports [on the south-west coast of India]. There are Indian merchants living there, as well as Egyptian merchants. Its inhabitants are all either merchants, porters, or fishermen. Some of the merchants are immensely rich, so rich that sometimes a single merchant is sole owner of a large ship with all it contains, and this is a subject of ostentation and rivalry amongst them. In spite of that they are pious, humble, upright, and generous in character, treat strangers well, give liberally to devotees, and pay in full the tithes due to God.\"\nIbn Battuta, ca. 1325\u20131354 C.E.\nThe views expressed in this journal passage are best seen as evidence of which of the following concerning medieval Islamic societies?\n\nA. The absence of religious orthodoxy\nB. Hostility toward outsiders\nC. Limited economic opportunities\nD. The supremacy of piety\n"

Despite the descriptions of wealth and commerce, Ibn Battuta highlights the religious devotion of the inhabitants of 'Aden, noting their piety, humility, uprightness, generosity, hospitality to strangers, support for devotees, and faithful payment of tithes to God. This suggests that religious values were held in high regard and played a significant role in their society."
