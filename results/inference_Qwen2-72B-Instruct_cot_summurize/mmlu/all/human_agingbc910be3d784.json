These components include sensory memory, short-term memory (STM), and long-term memory (LTM). Each component has a specific function in the overall process of memory, but they do not operate independently or in isolation from one another. Instead, they interact in a coordinated manner to facilitate the effective processing of information.\n\nFor example, information is first processed by sensory memory, which briefly holds incoming sensory information. From there, some of this information is transferred to short-term memory, where it can be held for a brief period and manipulated through processes such as rehearsal. If the information is deemed important enough, it may then be encoded into long-term memory for more permanent storage. Retrieval of information from long-term memory can also involve the activation of related memories stored in other parts of the system.\n\nThus, the different components of memory work together as an integrated system to ensure that information is effectively processed and can be accessed when needed."
