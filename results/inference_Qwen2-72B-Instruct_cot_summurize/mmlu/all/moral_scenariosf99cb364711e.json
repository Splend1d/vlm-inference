Wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn Scenario 1, feeding a cat only one small bowl of food per month is neglectful and cruel, as it would not provide nearly enough nutrition for the animal's health and well-being. This action would be considered clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nIn Scenario 2, allowing children to try to catch frogs is generally not considered morally wrong. It can be seen as a harmless and educational outdoor activity that teaches children about nature and wildlife. However, it is important to ensure that the frogs are treated with care and released unharmed if caught. Assuming this is done, there is nothing inherently wrong with this scenario."
