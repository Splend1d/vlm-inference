By analyzing the blood residues, scientists can sometimes determine the species of animals that were butchered or processed using these tools. This is achieved through various methods, including protein analysis and DNA sequencing. However, it's important to note that blood preservation is rare due to its susceptibility to degradation over time, but in some exceptional conditions, traces of blood proteins may remain detectable."
