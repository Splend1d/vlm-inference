Acceptance of a client relationship.\n\nQuality control policies and procedures in a CPA (Certified Public Accountant) firm's auditing practice include criteria for the acceptance of new clients, which ensures that the firm has the necessary expertise and resources to perform the audit engagement effectively. This process also helps the firm to assess the integrity of potential clients and the risks associated with the engagement. The other options listed do not directly relate to the quality control policies and procedures applicable to a CPA firm's auditing practice. Professional skepticism is an attitude maintained by auditors throughout the audit process, computer information processing relates to IT systems used by the client or auditor, and efficiency of organizational structures is more related to general business management than to specific auditing practices."
