It carries the instructions an organism needs to grow, develop, function, and reproduce. RNA (ribonucleic acid) plays a role in protein synthesis but is not the primary component of our genetic material. Proteins are essential molecules in our bodies, but they are not considered genetic material. The term \"dinitronucleic acid\" does not exist in biology."
