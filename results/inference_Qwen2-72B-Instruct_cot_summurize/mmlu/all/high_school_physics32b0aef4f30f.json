The small block is most likely to slide off when the original block is at the equilibrium position, but will not slide off as long as the coefficient of static friction between the blocks is greater than kA/[(M+m)g].\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe force that could cause the small block to slide off is the horizontal component of the force exerted by the spring on the original block. This force is proportional to the displacement of the block from its equilibrium position (Hooke's law). At maximum displacement, the force is greatest, but it is also perpendicular to the interface between the two blocks, so it does not contribute to sliding. When the block passes through the equilibrium position, this force is zero, but it changes direction, creating a sudden change in acceleration that can cause the small block to slide if the friction between the two blocks is not sufficient.\n\nThe maximum acceleration experienced by the system is given by \\(a_{max} = \\frac{kA}{m}\\), where \\(A\\) is the amplitude of oscillation. For the small block to remain stationary relative to the original block, the static frictional force must be able to provide this acceleration. The maximum static frictional force is given by \\(f_s = \\mu_s N\\), where \\(\\mu_s\\) is the coefficient of static friction and \\(N\\) is the normal force, which is equal to the total weight of the two blocks, or \\((M + m)g\\).\n\nEquating the acceleration force to the frictional force gives:\n\\[m \\cdot a_{max} = f_s\\]\n\\[\\frac{kA}{m} \\cdot m = \\mu_s (M + m)g\\]\nSolving for \\(\\mu_s\\) yields:\n\\[\\mu_s > \\frac{kA}{(M + m)g}\\]\n\nTherefore, the small block will not slide off as long as the coefficient of static friction between the blocks is greater than \\(\\frac{kA}{(M + m)g}\\), and it is most likely to slide off when the original block is at the equilibrium position due to the sudden change in acceleration."
