Instead, it claims that audiences selectively interpret what they want to hear (option A) and that social interaction reinforces the ideas and images that audiences select (option D). Content analysis can be a useful tool for identifying the themes covered by the media (option B), but it is not a central claim of the media-themes model. Therefore, options A and D are the most accurate statements regarding the media-themes model of media influence. However, since you asked for a single answer, I would choose option A as the most representative statement of the model's core claim."
