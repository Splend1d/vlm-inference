By tradition and precedent, a simple majority is required to confirm a presidential nominee to the Supreme Court. Since the Senate has 100 members, a simple majority would be 51 votes, assuming all senators are present and voting. However, in case of a tie, the Vice President can cast the deciding vote, making it possible for a nominee to be confirmed with just 50 votes if the Vice President supports the nomination. In recent years, the Senate has changed its rules regarding the number of votes required to end debate on a Supreme Court nominee (known as invoking cloture), which used to require 60 votes but was lowered to a simple majority in 2017. This change made it easier for nominees to advance to a final confirmation vote."
