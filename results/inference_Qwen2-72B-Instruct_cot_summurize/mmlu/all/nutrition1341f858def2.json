Insufficient rainfall for agriculture is considered a basic cause, as it relates to broader issues of environmental conditions and resource availability that underpin access to food and other necessities. The underlying causes identified by the UNICEF model include inadequate access to food (B), inadequate care for mothers and children (C), and insufficient health services and unhealthy environment (D). These factors directly contribute to the immediate causes of malnutrition, such as dietary intake and disease."
