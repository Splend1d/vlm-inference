A discriminatory effect.\n\nTo prove intentional discrimination in a legal context, one must typically show that there was a discriminatory intent or motive (option D), that the law itself is discriminatory on its face (option A), or that a facially neutral law has been applied in a discriminatory manner (option B). However, a discriminatory effect alone (option C) is not sufficient to prove intentional discrimination; it may only suggest disparate impact, which is a different legal standard."
