Cortisol does play a role in this process, especially during prolonged exercise, but the immediate trigger for glycogenolysis in muscle cells is often attributed to changes in intracellular energy status (like a drop in ATP levels) and the activation of other hormones like epinephrine (adrenaline). Insulin generally promotes glycogen synthesis, not breakdown, and increased pH (alkalinity) is not typically associated with the activation of glycogen breakdown. Therefore, the most direct answer in the context of exercise physiology would be related to hormonal and metabolic changes rather than any single hormone listed. However, among the options given, cortisol is the closest correct answer."
