The Soviet Union's Venera program was the first to successfully land probes on Venus, with Venera 7 achieving the first successful landing in 1970. The United States' Mariner program also included flyby missions to Venus, but it was not until the Viking program in the late 1970s that the U.S. successfully landed probes on the planet. However, only the U.S.S.R. achieved multiple successful landings and surface operations on Venus."
