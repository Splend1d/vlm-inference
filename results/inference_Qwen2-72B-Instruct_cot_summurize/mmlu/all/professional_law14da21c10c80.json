The minor paid $2000 down and agreed to pay the remaining $4000 in installments over the next two years. The minor had to have the car for work because he had no other means of support. The minor later crashed the car in an accident. He disaffirmed the contract, returned the damaged car, and demanded his down payment back. Does the seller have a right to obtain any consideration in this matter?\n\nA. No the seller must return the down payment because the minor has declared his disaffirmance of the contract.\nB. The seller cannot keep the down payment and cannot obtain any other benefit from the transaction.\nC. The seller can sue the minor for misrepresentation and fraud in not revealing his age prior to buying the car.\nD. The seller can obtain only the reasonable value of the use of the car in a restitution action.\n"

The seller can obtain only the reasonable value of the use of the car in a restitution action.\n\nWhen a minor disaffirms a contract, they generally have the right to return the goods and get their money back, as minors are typically not bound by contracts. However, the seller may be entitled to recover the reasonable value of the use of the property while it was in the minor's possession, which is often referred to as restitution. This would compensate the seller for the time during which the minor benefited from using the car. The exact amount would depend on factors such as how long the minor used the car and its condition before and after the use. The seller cannot, however, keep the entire down payment or sue for the full price of the car since the contract is voidable at the option of the minor. Additionally, there is no evidence of misrepresentation or fraud in the scenario provided, so option C does not apply."
