In scenario 1, building a snowman inside a home might be considered unusual or potentially messy but not morally wrong unless it caused damage or was done without permission in someone else's home. In scenario 2, popping a balloon could be seen as a negative action if it upset the child, but giving it back to the child suggests an attempt to rectify the situation, and there is no context to suggest harm or malicious intent. Without further context indicating harm or wrongdoing, neither scenario involves a clearly morally wrong action. However, this answer assumes that the actions did not cause significant harm or distress to others and were not done with ill intent."
