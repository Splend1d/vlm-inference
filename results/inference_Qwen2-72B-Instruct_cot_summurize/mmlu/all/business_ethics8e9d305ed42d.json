However, you didn't provide the list (1, 2, 3, 4) you're referencing. Based on the common understanding of fiduciary duties, I can infer what those points might be:\n\n1. Act in good faith and with loyalty to the shareholders.\n2. Exercise due diligence in making business decisions.\n3. Disclose any conflicts of interest.\n4. Protect and preserve company assets.\n\nIf these are the points you're referring to, then all of them (1, 2, 3, 4) are correct and part of the fiduciary responsibilities of managers and directors. However, since you're asking for a selection from A to D, and without knowing the exact list you're referring to, I cannot give you an exact answer. If the list I provided is accurate, then the correct answer would include all four points.\n\nFor future questions, please provide the full context or list so that I can give a more precise response."
