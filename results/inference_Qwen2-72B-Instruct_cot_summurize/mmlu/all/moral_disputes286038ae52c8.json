In Rescue I, an agent must push a heavy man off a bridge onto a trolley track to stop a runaway trolley from killing five people further down the line. In Rescue II, an agent must choose whether to let a dam burst and flood a village, knowing that the water will eventually be diverted and save lives downstream. The cases highlight the ethical debate surrounding the principle of double effect and the moral weight given to action versus omission."
