O(1), which represents constant time complexity, meaning that the running time of the algorithm does not increase with the size of the input data set.\n\nHere's a brief explanation of each option:\n\nA. O(1) - Constant time complexity: The running time of the algorithm does not depend on the size of the input data set. It's the best possible time complexity.\n\nB. O(n) - Linear time complexity: The running time of the algorithm increases linearly with the size of the input data set. This means that if the input size doubles, the running time will also double.\n\nC. O(n^2) - Quadratic time complexity: The running time of the algorithm increases quadratically with the size of the input data set. If the input size doubles, the running time will increase by a factor of four.\n\nD. O(log n) - Logarithmic time complexity: The running time of the algorithm increases logarithmically with the size of the input data set. This is faster than linear time complexity but slower than constant time complexity. For example, if the input size doubles, the running time might only increase by one additional step."
