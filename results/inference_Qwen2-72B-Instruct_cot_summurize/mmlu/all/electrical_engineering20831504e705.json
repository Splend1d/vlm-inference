When the coil moves, it disturbs the magnetic field around the permanent magnet which results in the production of eddy currents in the metallic (often aluminum) frame or eddy current disk. These eddy currents produce their own magnetic fields that oppose the motion of the coil, thus providing damping. \n\nHowever, some high-precision instruments might use a damping vane in an airtight chamber (option D), where the vane resists the air flow as the coil moves, thereby providing damping.\n\nBoth methods can be used, but eddy current damping (option C) is more common in moving coil meters."
