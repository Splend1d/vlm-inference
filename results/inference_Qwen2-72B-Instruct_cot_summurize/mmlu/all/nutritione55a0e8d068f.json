It can be calculated as the product of the incidence rate and the duration of the disease. If the survival time with the disease increases, it means that the duration of the disease is longer, which leads to an increase in the number of existing cases and thus an increase in the prevalence of the disease. All other factors being equal, this is the scenario that would lead to an increase in prevalence."
