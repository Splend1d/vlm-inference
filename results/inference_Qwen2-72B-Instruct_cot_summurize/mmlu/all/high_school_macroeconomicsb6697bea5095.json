Inflation erodes the purchasing power of the dollar both domestically and internationally. As a result, the dollar tends to depreciate (or weaken) against other currencies because each dollar buys fewer goods and services compared to those currencies. This is a simplified explanation, but it captures the general relationship between inflation and currency value."
