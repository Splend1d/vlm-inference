During the operation, moderate hemorrhaging requires ligation of several vessels in the left side of the neck. Postoperatively, serum studies show a calcium concentration of 7.5 mg/dL, albumin concentration of 4 g/dL, and parathyroid hormone concentration of 200 pg/mL. Damage to which of the following vessels caused the findings in this patient?\n\nA. Branch of the costocervical trunk\nB. Branch of the external carotid artery\nC.

The parathyroid glands are usually located near the posterior surface of the thyroid gland, and their blood supply is derived from branches of the inferior thyroid artery, which arises from the thyrocervical trunk. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nC. Branch of the thyrocervical trunk\n\nDamage to this vessel could result in decreased blood flow to the parathyroid glands, leading to their dysfunction and subsequent hypocalcemia."
