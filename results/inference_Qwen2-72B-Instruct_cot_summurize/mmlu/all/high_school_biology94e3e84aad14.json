Genetic drift\n\nGenetic drift refers to changes in the frequency of alleles (different versions of genes) within a population due to random sampling effects. In small populations, genetic drift can have a significant impact because each generation's gene pool can be quite different from the previous one simply due to chance events. This can lead to the fixation of certain alleles and the loss of others, even if they are not advantageous or disadvantageous.\n\nIn contrast, in large populations, genetic drift has less of an effect because there are more individuals carrying each allele, making it less likely that any given allele will be lost or fixed purely by chance. Thus, genetic drift is a process that operates more strongly in small populations."
