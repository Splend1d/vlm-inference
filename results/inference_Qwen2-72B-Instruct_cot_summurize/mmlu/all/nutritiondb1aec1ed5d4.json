It will have negative impacts in most developing countries because of the increased frequency of droughts, storms, and floods.\n\nClimate change is expected to negatively impact food security in many parts of the world, particularly in developing countries that rely heavily on rain-fed agriculture. Increased temperatures, changing rainfall patterns, and extreme weather events can lead to reduced crop yields, loss of livestock, and damage to agricultural infrastructure. These factors can exacerbate existing vulnerabilities and contribute to food shortages, higher food prices, and increased hunger and malnutrition.\n\nWhile it's true that higher levels of CO2 can stimulate plant growth under controlled conditions (C), this effect may not necessarily translate into increased crop yields under field conditions, especially if other factors such as water availability, temperature stress, and nutrient deficiencies limit plant growth. Additionally, the benefits of CO2 fertilization may be offset by the negative impacts of climate change on agricultural systems.\n\nThe statement about drier weather leading to fewer malaria cases (B) does not directly address food security and is not a widely accepted theory regarding the impacts of climate change on agricultural productivity. Moreover, the relationship between climate and malaria transmission is complex and depends on various factors, including temperature, humidity, and the presence of mosquito vectors.\n\nThere is indeed a strong scientific consensus (D) that climate change is happening and that human activities, primarily the burning of fossil fuels, are contributing significantly to global warming. This consensus includes projections about future climate changes and their likely impacts on various sectors, including agriculture and food security."
