Infants born to vegan mothers may therefore be at an increased risk of vitamin B12 deficiency if the mother's diet does not include fortified foods or supplements. This can lead to serious health problems in infants, including developmental delays and anemia. It is important for vegan mothers to ensure they are getting enough vitamin B12 through fortified foods or supplements to prevent deficiency in themselves and their infants."
