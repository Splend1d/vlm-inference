Women and children\n\nMedicaid provides health coverage to millions of Americans, including eligible low-income adults, children, pregnant women, elderly adults, and people with disabilities. While the elderly can also benefit from Medicaid, especially for long-term care services, the majority of Medicaid spending goes toward providing healthcare for women (including pregnancy-related services) and children. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, as of 2021, about half of Medicaid enrollees are children and nearly one-third are non-elderly adults, most of whom are women."
