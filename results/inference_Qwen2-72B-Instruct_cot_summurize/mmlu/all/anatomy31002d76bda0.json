Therefore, if a malignant tumor is damaging this nerve, the patient will most likely experience:\n\nC. loss of taste and somaesthetic sensation over the posterior third of the tongue.\n\nIt is important to note that the glossopharyngeal nerve does not innervate the muscles of the tongue, so paralysis of the muscles of the tongue would not be a direct result of damage to this nerve. The muscles of the tongue are primarily innervated by the hypoglossal nerve (CN XII)."
