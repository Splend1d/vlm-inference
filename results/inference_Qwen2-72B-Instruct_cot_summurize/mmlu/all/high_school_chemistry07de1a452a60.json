In this type of crystal, atoms are connected by strong covalent bonds in a three-dimensional network that extends throughout the entire material. This results in very hard and strong materials, which makes them suitable for use in applications such as grinding wheels where high hardness and abrasion resistance are required.\n\nIonic crystals consist of positive and negative ions held together by electrostatic forces (ionic bonds), while metallic crystals are formed by metal atoms bonded through delocalized electrons. Molecular crystals are composed of discrete molecules held together by weak intermolecular forces like van der Waals forces or hydrogen bonds. Neither of these types of crystals would typically exhibit the extreme hardness seen in silicon carbide."
