This is likely due to the fact that aerobic exercise increases blood flow and oxygen to the brain, which can help maintain and even improve cognitive function as we age. While other activities like lifting weights or practicing tai chi may have health benefits for older adults, they have not been shown to specifically reduce the reaction time difference between younger and older adults to the same extent as aerobic exercise. Consuming large quantities of vitamins also does not have a direct impact on reducing the reaction time difference between younger and older adults."
