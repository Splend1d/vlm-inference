The potential difference necessary to stop the emitted electrons (stopping potential) is a linear function of the frequency above the threshold frequency.\n\nThis prediction is based on the concept that the energy of the photons (light particles) is proportional to their frequency, and this energy must be greater than or equal to the work function of the metal (the minimum energy required to remove an electron from the metal's surface) for the photoelectric effect to occur. The excess energy above the work function is given to the electron as kinetic energy, which can be converted into electrical potential energy when the electron moves through an electric field. Thus, the stopping potential required to bring these electrons to rest is directly related to the excess energy, which in turn is linearly dependent on the frequency of the incident light above the threshold frequency."
