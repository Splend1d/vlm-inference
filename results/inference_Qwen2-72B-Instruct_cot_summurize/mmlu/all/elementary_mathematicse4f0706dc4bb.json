Yes, because \\(38 \\div 2 = 19\\), which is a whole number.\n\nB. 3 - Is 3 a factor of 38? No, because \\(38 \\div 3\\) does not result in a whole number.\n\nC. 4 - Is 4 a factor of 38? No, because \\(38 \\div 4\\) does not result in a whole number.\n\nD. 8 - Is 8 a factor of 38? No, because \\(38 \\div 8\\) does not result in a whole number.\n\nSo, the only number from the given options that is a factor of 38 is A. 2."
