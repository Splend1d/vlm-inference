However, if you have to choose only one statement that is true about an open systems model of public relations in an organization, then the most accurate answer would be:\n\nA. It adapts to changing organizational environments.\n\nThis is because an open systems model recognizes that organizations exist within a dynamic environment that is constantly changing. Therefore, it emphasizes the need for organizations to be flexible and responsive to their external environment to maintain their viability and effectiveness. This requires ongoing monitoring and assessment of environmental factors, as well as the development of strategies to address changes and opportunities as they arise."
