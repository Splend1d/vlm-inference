The plaintiff was severely injured in the reservoir when he dove from a boat into what he thought was deep water and hit an unmarked submerged island. The plaintiff alleges that the company was negligent in failing to mark the submerged island. At trial, the plaintiff has called an engineer and qualified him as plaintiff has called an engineer and qualified him as an expert in managing reservoirs. Which of the following opinions by the plaintiff's expert is the court most likely to admit?\n\nA. \"The accident probably occurred in the manner shown by this computer-animated film I made.\"\nB. \"The company could have marked the island in a day and at a cost of $300.\"\nC. \"The company was required by federal law to mark the island.\"\nD. \"The plaintiff was not contributorily negligent.\"\n"
