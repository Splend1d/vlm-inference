He did, however, come across a secluded mountain cabin, in which he decided to take shelter for the night. Since the door to the cabin was locked, he broke a window and entered the structure. Once inside, he fell asleep on the sofa. When he awoke the next morning he was hungry. The defendant then found some food in the refrigerator, which he cooked and ate. Before leaving the cabin, the defendant looked around to see if there was anything worth stealing. He opened the door to the bedroom and found a gold watch on the nightstand. He placed the watch in his pocket and left the cabin. The defendant was later arrested and charged with burglary. The defendant's strongest defense would be that\n\nA. he was drunk when he broke into the cabin.\nB. the crime was not completed until the morning hours.\nC. he did not have the requisite intent at the time of the breaking and entering.\nD. the cabin was empty when he entered it.\n"

                    "text": "The defendant's strongest defense would be C. he did not have the requisite intent at the time of the breaking and entering.\n\nIn criminal law, burglary typically requires the prosecution to prove that the defendant had the intent to commit a felony or theft upon entry into a building or dwelling. In this case, the defendant initially entered the cabin seeking shelter, not with the intent to commit theft or any other felony. The intoxication might also play a role in establishing that the defendant lacked the capacity to form the necessary intent at the time of the breaking and entering. However, it is important to note that voluntary intoxication is generally not a defense to criminal intent, but it may be relevant to whether the defendant actually formed the requisite intent in this specific context.\n\nOption A (he was drunk when he broke into the cabin) is related to option C, but it does not directly address the lack of intent at the time of the breaking and entering.\n\nOption B (the crime was not completed until the morning hours) is incorrect because burglary is complete upon unlawful entry with the requisite intent, regardless of when additional crimes such as theft occur.\n\nOption D (the cabin was empty when he entered it) is irrelevant to the charge of burglary, as the presence or absence of people inside the cabin does not affect the fact that the defendant entered without permission and with the potential intent to commit a crime later."
