                    "text": "The correct answer is B. When branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) are deaminated in muscle, the ammonia produced is primarily converted into alanine and glutamine and then released from the muscle. This process is part of the transamination pathway where the nitrogen group is transferred to another molecule, typically an alpha-keto acid, forming non-essential amino acids like alanine. Glutamine also acts as an ammonia transporter, helping to shuttle excess nitrogen to the liver for further processing."
