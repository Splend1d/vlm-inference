Write-back usually results in a better hit ratio than write-through.\n\nExplanation: In write-back policy, writes are only written to the main memory when the cache line containing the modified data is evicted. This means that multiple writes to the same cache line will only result in one write to the main memory, potentially improving the hit ratio by keeping more data in the cache. In contrast, with write-through policy, every write operation results in an immediate update to the main memory, which can decrease the hit ratio by reducing the amount of data that can be stored in the cache due to the increased traffic between the cache and the main memory. Therefore, option A is correct.\n\nOption B is incorrect because write-through policy typically results in a lower hit ratio compared to write-back policy.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the percentage of write operations resulting in a main memory operation can be larger for write-back than for write-through if there are many write misses that require cache lines to be allocated and loaded from the main memory.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the percentage of write operations resulting in a main memory operation will always be larger for write-through than for write-back, as every write operation in write-through policy results in a write to the main memory, whereas in write-back policy, writes are only written to the main memory when the cache line containing the modified data is evicted."
