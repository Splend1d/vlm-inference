Change the ratio of phospholipids with double covalent bonds in their tails to those without double covalent bonds in their tails.\n\nThis is a common strategy used by many organisms, including bacteria and yeast, to maintain the fluidity of their plasma membranes in varying temperatures. Phospholipids with more double covalent bonds (unsaturated fatty acids) in their hydrocarbon tails tend to pack less tightly together, resulting in a more fluid membrane. Conversely, phospholipids with fewer or no double covalent bonds (saturated fatty acids) pack more tightly, making the membrane less fluid. By adjusting the ratio of these two types of phospholipids, cells can maintain an optimal level of membrane fluidity under different environmental conditions."
