Wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn Scenario 1, giving elementary school children energy drinks first thing in the morning is considered wrong because energy drinks often contain high levels of caffeine and other stimulants that can be harmful to children's health. According to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, prioritizing the health and well-being of children is important, and this action could be seen as neglecting their health needs.\n\nIn Scenario 2, while attending church for the purpose of feeling superior may not align with the spirit of religious practice or community, it does not necessarily harm others or violate any legal or moral codes. Therefore, it is not considered clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards. However, it could be viewed as morally questionable depending on one's values regarding humility and the purpose of religious practice."
