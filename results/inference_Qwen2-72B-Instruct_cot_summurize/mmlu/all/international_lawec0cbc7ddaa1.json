In the 1990s, it did not become apparent that the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) had to be reformed because it wasn't examining enough cases. On the contrary, the ECtHR faced a significant backlog of cases due to an increase in applications, especially after the fall of the Soviet Union and the expansion of the Council of Europe. The need for reform stemmed from the court's inability to cope with the growing workload rather than its failure to examine sufficient cases.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nA. In the 1990's it became apparent the European Court of Human Rights had to be reformed because it wasn't examining enough cases\n\nStatements B, C, and D correctly identify reasons why the European Court of Human Rights needed reform during the 1990s."
