                    "text": "The correct answer is D. glycolysis is activated at the onset of exercise.\n\nWhen you start exercising, your muscles need more energy and begin to break down glucose through a process called glycolysis. This process occurs in the absence of sufficient oxygen (a state called anaerobic respiration) and results in the production of lactate. As the intensity of exercise increases, so does the rate of glycolysis, leading to increased lactate production. This lactate production is a normal part of metabolism during high-intensity exercise and helps to provide additional fuel for the muscles and other tissues under conditions of high energy demand.\n\nOptions A, B, and C are not accurate in the context of increased muscle lactate production:\n\nA. Oxygen being readily available would actually decrease lactate production because it allows for aerobic respiration, where pyruvate can enter the Krebs cycle and be fully oxidized for energy production without forming lactate.\n\nB. Pyruvate can always be formed from glucose breakdown; however, under anaerobic conditions, pyruvate is reduced to lactate rather than being further metabolized in the Krebs cycle.\n\nC. The pH of the muscle falling (becoming more acidic) is a consequence of increased lactate production, not a cause of it. Lactate production contributes to the lowering of pH in muscles during intense exercise."
