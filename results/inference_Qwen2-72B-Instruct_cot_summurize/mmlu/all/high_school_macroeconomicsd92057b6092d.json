Here's how it works:\n\n1. **The FED buys bonds**: The FED purchases government bonds from banks or other financial institutions in the secondary market. It pays for these bonds by crediting the seller's account with new reserves.\n\n2. **Reserves increase**: The bank that sold the bond now has additional reserves on its balance sheet. These reserves were created by the FED and did not exist before the transaction.\n\n3. **Money creation**: Banks can lend out a portion of their reserves. When they do so, this lending process creates more money in the economy through the money multiplier effect. For every dollar of reserves added, multiple dollars can be created as loans, which then become deposits in other banks, leading to further lending and deposit creation.\n\n4. **Increase in money supply**: This process ultimately results in an increase in the money supply, as there is more money circulating in the economy.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. The money supply will increase."
