Raise the amount of the product sold domestically, because they make imported goods more expensive or limit their quantity, thus encouraging consumers to buy more domestically produced goods.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that this is not always the case and can depend on various factors including the elasticity of demand for the product, the efficiency of domestic producers, and the level of the tariff or quota imposed. Tariffs and quotas can also lead to higher prices for consumers and may result in trade wars, which can negatively affect the domestic economy in other ways."
