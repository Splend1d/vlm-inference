It is used to influence the way an organization is perceived by various groups of stakeholders, including customers, employees, investors, partners, the media, and the general public. PR professionals use a variety of tactics to shape public perception, such as press releases, media relations, crisis management, social media engagement, and community outreach. Unlike advertising, which is paid media, PR relies on earned media to get the message out through third-party endorsements or coverage in news outlets."
