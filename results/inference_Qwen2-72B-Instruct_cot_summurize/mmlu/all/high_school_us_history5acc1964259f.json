Men who are honorable in their dealings with their white neighbors will cheat a Negro without feeling a single twinge of their honor. To kill a Negro they do not deem murder; to debauch a Negro woman they do not think fornication; to take the property away from a Negro they do not consider robbery. The people boast that when they get freedmen affairs in their own hands, to use their own classic expression, 'the niggers will catch hell.'\n\"The reason of all this is simple and manifest. The whites esteem the blacks their property by natural right, and however much they may admit that the individual relations of masters and slaves have been destroyed by the war and the President's emancipation proclamation, they still have an ingrained feeling that the blacks at large belong to the whites at large, and whenever opportunity serves they treat the colored people just as their profit, caprice or passion may dictate.\"\n\u2014Congressional testimony of Col. Samuel Thomas, Assistant Commissioner, Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen and Abandoned Lands, 1865\nWhich of the following factors did Alexander Hamilton believe was a source for the problems in the excerpt from Federalist #15?\n\nA. economic class divisions among the American people that prevented them from forging a unified vision.\nB. a failure of American policy-makers to abandon mercantilist principles and to embrace a laissez-faire approach to trade.\nC. a weak central government without the powers to address pressing issues.\nD. an unhealthy obsession among the American people with religion and individual salvation, at the expense of interest in solving practical national problems.\n"

However, based on the context given, it seems that the passage is discussing the treatment of African Americans during the Reconstruction era after the Civil War. If we were to make an educated guess about which factor Alexander Hamilton might have believed contributed to societal problems based on his views expressed in Federalist #15, it would be:\n\nC. a weak central government without the powers to address pressing issues.\n\nIn Federalist #15, Alexander Hamilton argues for the need for a strong federal government capable of addressing the various crises that could threaten the union. He believed that a weak central government would lead to disunity and chaos, as each state pursued its own interests at the expense of the nation as a whole. This perspective aligns with the challenges faced by the United States during Reconstruction, where a lack of strong federal intervention allowed for continued abuses against African Americans."
