Therefore, to be included in the U.S. GDP, production must occur within the geographical boundaries of the United States.\n\nLet's evaluate each of the options:\n\nI. The market value of movies made in Africa by U.S. citizens - This would not be included in U.S. GDP because the production did not take place within the U.S. borders.\n\nII. The market value of olive oil made in Italy and sold in the United States - This would also not be included in U.S. GDP. The production occurred outside the U.S., so it contributes to Italy's GDP, not the U.S.'s.\n\nIII. The market value of blue jeans made in the United States and sold in Japan - This would be included in U.S. GDP because the production took place within the U.S. It does not matter where the final product is sold.\n\nIV. The market value of wine made in the United States by Canadian citizens - This would also be included in U.S. GDP. The fact that the producers are Canadian citizens does not affect the calculation; what matters is that the production took place within the U.S.\n\nThus, the correct answer is D. III and IV only."
