She says that her medical condition has declined so much that she no longer wishes to go on living; she is nearly blind and will likely require bilateral leg amputations. She reports that she has always been an active person and does not see how her life will be of value anymore. She has no family and most of her friends are sick or deceased. On mental status examination, she is alert and cooperative. She accurately describes her medical history and understands the consequences of refusing insulin. There is no evidence of depression. She dismisses any attempts by the physician to change her mind, saying that the physician is too young to understand her situation. She says, \"I know I will die, and this is what I want.\" Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?\n\nA. Discharge the patient after she has signed an \"against medical advice\" form\nB. Seek a court order to appoint a legal guardian\nC. Offer insulin but allow the patient to refuse it\nD. Admit to the psychiatric unit\n"

Offer insulin but allow the patient to refuse it.\n\nRespecting the autonomy of patients is a fundamental principle in medical ethics. The patient appears to be competent, as evidenced by her accurate description of her medical history and understanding of the consequences of refusing treatment. She has made a clear decision regarding her treatment based on her own values and circumstances, and there is no indication of depression or other mental health issues that might impair her judgment. Therefore, her wishes should be respected.\n\nOption A (discharging the patient against medical advice) may not be safe given her current medical condition, and option B (seeking a court order to appoint a legal guardian) would likely be inappropriate since the patient is competent to make her own decisions. Option D (admitting to the psychiatric unit) is not indicated as there is no evidence of a psychiatric disorder. \n\nIt is important to continue discussions with the patient about her decision, ensuring she understands all implications and exploring any possible sources of support or comfort, but ultimately respecting her autonomy. Palliative care consultation may also be beneficial to ensure the patient's comfort and dignity during her remaining time."
