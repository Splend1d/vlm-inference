We also need to account for the actual returns from previous months which have been returned during the current month ($5,000). These returns reduce the net sales revenue further.\n\nSo, the net sales revenue for the month would be:\n$190,000 (adjusted sales) - $5,000 (returns from previous months) = $185,000\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. $185,000"
