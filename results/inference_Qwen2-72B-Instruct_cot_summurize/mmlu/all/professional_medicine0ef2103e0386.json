The patient's daughter, who is visiting the patient, says he has had increased lethargy for the past day and decreased ambulation during the past 6 months. She also says that there are times during the day when his tremors increase in severity, although he continues to care for himself at home. Medical history is also remarkable for hypertension. Medications include hydrochlorothiazide, atenolol, levodopa, and carbidopa. He is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 78 kg (172 lb); BMI is 28 kg/m2 . Vital signs are temperature 38.9\u00b0C (102.0\u00b0F), pulse 60/min supine and 68/min standing, respirations 22/min, and blood pressure 100/60 mm Hg supine and 80/50 mm Hg standing. The patient appears ill and older than his stated age. He is fully oriented but lethargic. Auscultation of the chest discloses rhonchi in the right mid lung field. Abdominal examination discloses no abnormalities. Neurologic examination discloses masked facies, bradykinesia, and cogwheel rigidity; gait was not assessed on admission. Chest x-ray shows a right lower lobe infiltrate. ECG shows no abnormalities. Appropriate intravenous antibiotic therapy is initiated. Prior to discharge, which of the following is the most appropriate step?\n\nA. Obtain CT scan of the chest\nB. Obtain a swallowing evaluation\nC. Place a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube\nD. Prescribe fludrocortisone\n"

                    "text": "The most appropriate step prior to discharge for this patient would be D. Prescribe fludrocortisone. This medication can help address the orthostatic hypotension (drop in blood pressure upon standing) that the patient is experiencing, which can lead to dizziness and falls. Fludrocortisone works by increasing the body's ability to retain sodium and water, thus increasing blood volume and improving blood pressure.\n\nRegarding the other options:\nA. A CT scan of the chest may not be necessary if the chest X-ray has already identified the pneumonia and there are no additional symptoms or findings suggesting another underlying condition that requires further imaging.\nB. A swallowing evaluation might be considered if there were concerns about the patient's ability to swallow safely, but based on the information provided, there is no indication that this is an issue.\nC. Placement of a PEG tube is typically reserved for patients who cannot maintain adequate nutrition or hydration by mouth due to severe dysphagia or other conditions. There is no information provided to suggest that this patient is unable to eat or drink adequately.\n\nGiven the context, addressing the orthostatic hypotension is crucial for preventing falls and improving the patient's overall safety and well-being."
