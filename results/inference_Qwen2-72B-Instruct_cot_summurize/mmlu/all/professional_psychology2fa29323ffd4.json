Postpone the evaluation and advise the defendant to contact his attorney.\n\nIt's important to note that while the evaluation may be court-ordered, forensic psychologists must still respect the rights and dignity of the individuals they assess. If the defendant refuses to cooperate, the psychologist should not force the issue but instead inform the defendant of the implications of non-cooperation and encourage communication with legal counsel. The psychologist should also report this refusal to the court as required."
