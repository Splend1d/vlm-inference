This diversity displays the unsearchable depth of the divine judgment, and is without doubt subordinate to God's purpose of eternal election. But if it is plainly owing to the mere pleasure of God that salvation is spontaneously offered to some, while others have no access to it, great and difficult questions immediately arise, questions which are inexplicable, when just views are not entertained concerning election and predestination[,] . . . the grace of God being illustrated by the contrast, viz., that he does not adopt all promiscuously to the hope of salvation, but gives to some what he denies to others.\n\u2014John Calvin, from The Institutes of Christian Religion, Book 3: Chapter 21, 1545\nWhich of the following justifications used by Protestant reformers such as Calvin is alluded to above?\n\nA. They believed that their church should not be subordinate to the state.\nB. The corruption of the Roman Catholic Church and its leaders meant that reform was needed.\nC. Religion was used to challenge the authority of earthly monarchs.\nD. The concept that salvation comes from faith alone rather than through good works is supported.\n"

The concept that salvation comes from faith alone rather than through good works is supported.\n\nIn the first excerpt, Calvin discusses how people are condemned by God due to their corruption and sin, suggesting that only righteousness, innocence, and purity are acceptable to God. This aligns with the Protestant emphasis on faith as the means of achieving salvation rather than through good works or deeds. In the second excerpt, Calvin talks about the covenant of life not being preached equally to all and how this is related to God's purpose of eternal election, further emphasizing the role of faith and predestination in salvation."
