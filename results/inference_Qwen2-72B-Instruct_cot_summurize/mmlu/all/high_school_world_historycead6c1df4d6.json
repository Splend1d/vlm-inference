Prosperity ripened the principle of decay; the causes of destruction multiplied with the extent of conquest; and, as soon as time or accident had removed the artificial supports, the stupendous fabric yielded to the pressure of its own weight. . . . The victorious legions, who, in distant wars, acquired the vices of strangers and mercenaries, first oppressed the freedom of the republic, and afterwards violated the majesty of the purple. The emperors, anxious for their personal safety and the public peace, were reduced to the base expedient of corrupting the discipline which rendered them alike formidable to their sovereign and to the enemy; the vigour of the military . . . was relaxed . . . ; and the Roman world was overwhelmed by a deluge of Barbarians.\n\u2014Adapted from Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, by Edward Gibbon\nThe author of the above passage claims: \"Prosperity ripened the principle of decay; the causes of destruction multiplied with the extent of conquest.\" What does he mean by this?\n\nA. The rulers became too rich and thus were overthrown.\nB. The empire became too large to control effectively.\nC. Decay begins the minute something begins to grow.\nD. Conquest and prosperity are mutually exclusive.\n"

This is because:\n\nB. The empire became too large to control effectively.\n\nAs the empire expanded through conquests, it grew larger and more complex, making it increasingly difficult to govern and defend. This expansion also led to the assimilation of foreign influences, which eroded traditional Roman values and weakened the cohesion of the society. Additionally, the need to maintain a large military presence across vast territories strained resources and contributed to the decline of discipline within the army. These factors, combined with the challenges of managing a sprawling empire, set the stage for its eventual collapse under the weight of internal decay and external pressures from invading barbarian groups."
