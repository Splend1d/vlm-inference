The only way onto or off the island where he lived was a ferry. The last ferry was getting ready to leave for the night when the report came in to the police. Without attempting to get a warrant, the police stopped all the cars waiting for the ferry. In one vehicle, the police noticed three women fidgeting rather nervously. Upon searching their auto, the police found the victim's stolen property hidden under the front seat. The defendants were immediately placed under arrest. At their trial for armed robbery, the defendants move to suppress the use of the property confiscated by the police as evidence. Their motion should be\n\nA. granted, because the police did not have a warrant to search their car.\nB. granted, because the police did not have probable cause to suspect that their car contained evidence of the crime.\nC. denied, because the police had probable cause to search their car and, under the circumstances, no warrant was required.\nD. denied, because even though the detention was unlawful, the police had reasonable suspicion to believe that their car contained evidence of the crime since they observed the women fidgeting nervously.\n"

Under these circumstances, which included an exigency (the need to act quickly to prevent suspects from fleeing the island), the police were justified in conducting a warrantless search. Therefore, the motion to suppress the evidence would likely be denied."
