While standing in line at a concession stand, he got into an argument with three men ahead of him in the line. The three men were friends attending the game together. One of the men punched the sports fan in the mouth. A fight ensued. During the fracas, one of the other three men hit the sports fan over the head with a bottle, which caused him to suffer a serious concussion. The sports fan does not know for certain which of the three men struck him with the bottle. If the sports fan asserts a claim against the man who punched him in the mouth to recover damages for the head injury, will the sports fan prevail?\n\nA. Yes, because the man who punched him in the mouth was the instigator who struck the first blow that started the fracas.\nB. Yes, because the man who punched him in the mouth and the other men were acting in concert.\nC. No, because the man who punched him in the mouth did not actually strike the sports fan with the bottle.\nD. No, because the sports fan cannot offer proof as to which of the men struck the sports fan over the head with the bottle.\n"

Yes, because the man who punched him in the mouth and the other men were acting in concert.\n\nIn this scenario, the sports fan may be able to hold all three men liable for his injuries under the legal theory of concerted action or acting in concert. This means that even though only one of the men actually struck the sports fan with the bottle, all three men can be held liable if they acted together with a common purpose or plan. Since the three men were friends attending the game together and got into an argument with the sports fan, it can be argued that they acted in concert when the fight broke out. Therefore, the sports fan may be able to recover damages from all three men, including the one who initially punched him in the mouth. However, the specifics of the case and applicable law would need to be examined to determine the likelihood of success in court."
