After one half-life, 50% of the isotope remains. After two half-lives, 25% of the original amount remains (because half of 50% is 25%). After three half-lives, 12.5% of the original amount remains (half of 25% is 12.5%). This means that 87.5% of the isotope has decayed, leaving 12.5% still intact."
