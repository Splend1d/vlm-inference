At trial, the customer shows the court a printed statement from a printer's association defining the minimum standard of skill for the printing industry in the community. The customer asks the court to take judicial notice that the printed statement constitutes the applicable standard of care for printing companies in the area. The court should\n\nA. grant the request, because it promotes expeditious and economical disposition of the proceedings.\nB. grant the request, because the standard of care is amply supported by information supplied to the court.\nC. deny the request, because judicial notice cannot be taken of matters that are ultimate issues in the case.\nD. deny the request if the judge determines that the statement is subject to reasonable dispute.\n"

The standard of care in a particular industry may be subject to interpretation and dispute, and therefore, may not be appropriate for judicial notice. The court would likely require expert testimony or other evidence to establish the standard of care for the printing industry in the community."
