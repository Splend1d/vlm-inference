True: Without the ability to pass file descriptors between processes, it would indeed be impossible for services to receive a TCP connection to the client web browser directly. In the OKWS (Oxford Kernel Web Server) design, the main server process (okd) accepts incoming connections and passes the associated file descriptors to child processes (services) that handle specific requests. If file descriptor passing was not supported, this mechanism would break, and services would not be able to communicate with the client web browser over an existing TCP connection.\n2. False: The capability of okd running as a non-root user is not dependent on file descriptor passing. Instead, it depends on the system's permission model and the use of capabilities or privileges required by the server and its services. A well-designed service can still function as a non-root user without the need for file descriptor passing. However, it may require alternative methods for communication and resource sharing between processes."
