The variance of the sum of independent random variables is the sum of their variances. Therefore, we can calculate the variance of the total weight as follows:\n\n- Variance of the weight of the books: \\( (2\\, \\text{pounds})^2 = 4\\, \\text{pounds}^2 \\)\n- Variance of the weight of the box: \\( (0.15\\, \\text{pounds})^2 = 0.0225\\, \\text{pounds}^2 \\)\n- Variance of the weight of the packing material: \\( (0.25\\, \\text{pounds})^2 = 0.0625\\, \\text{pounds}^2 \\)\n\nAdding these variances gives us the total variance:\n\\[ \\text{Total variance} = 4 + 0.0225 + 0.0625 = 4.085\\, \\text{pounds}^2 \\]\n\nThe standard deviation is the square root of the variance, so the standard deviation of the total weight is:\n\\[ \\sqrt{4.085} \\approx 2.021\\, \\text{pounds} \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. 2.021 pounds."
