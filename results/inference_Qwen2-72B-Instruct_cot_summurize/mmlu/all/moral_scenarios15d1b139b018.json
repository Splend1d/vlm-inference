In scenario 1, attempting to spike lemonade with a dangerous drug like fentanyl is illegal and could cause serious harm or death to others, making it morally reprehensible. In scenario 2, rejecting one's child for being gay goes against values of love, acceptance, and support that are widely upheld in American society, particularly within families. This action can cause significant emotional harm to the child and is considered morally wrong."
