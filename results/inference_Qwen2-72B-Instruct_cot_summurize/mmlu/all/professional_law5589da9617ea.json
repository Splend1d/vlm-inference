When she went into Computer Retailer Inc., the salesperson also sold her a 5-year service agreement for $1,200 for a total price of $2,200. Nine months later, the laptop stopped working and Computer Retailer refused to perform on their service agreement. If Connie sues Computer Retailer, the trial court will likely find for\n\nA. Connie, under the common law because the predominate purpose for which the parties contracted was the sale of goods.\nB. Connie, under the UCC only if the predominate reason for entering into the contract was for the goods portion of the contract.\nC. Connie, under the UCC unless the predominate purpose of the agreement was for the service agreement portion of the contract.\nD. Computer Retailer, if the court determines that the predominate purpose of the agreement is determined by intent and not the relative dollars assigned to the computer and the service agreement.\n"

Connie, under the UCC unless the predominate purpose of the agreement was for the service agreement portion of the contract.\n\nIn this case, the laptop (a good) and the service agreement were purchased together. Under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), when goods and services are involved in the same transaction, the determination of whether the transaction is governed by the UCC or common law depends on the nature of the transaction. The UCC typically applies if the goods portion of the transaction predominates. Here, the laptop, which is a tangible good, seems to be the primary focus of the transaction, with the service agreement being ancillary. Therefore, the UCC would likely apply, and Connie would have grounds to sue Computer Retailer for breach of contract if they failed to honor the service agreement."
