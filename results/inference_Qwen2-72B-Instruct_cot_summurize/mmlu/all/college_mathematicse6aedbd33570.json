                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to understand how trailing zeros are formed in the factorial of an integer \\(k\\). Trailing zeros are created by the product of 2 and 5. Since there are always more factors of 2 than 5 in any given factorial (because every other number is divisible by 2, but only one out of five numbers is divisible by 5), the number of trailing zeros is determined by the number of times 5 divides into \\(k!\\).\n\nThe formula for calculating the number of trailing zeros in \\(k!\\) is:\n\\[ \\text{Trailing Zeros} = \\left\\lfloor\\frac{k}{5}\\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor\\frac{k}{5^2}\\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor\\frac{k}{5^3}\\right\\rfloor + \\cdots \\]\n\nWe want to find the values of \\(k\\) such that \\(k!\\) ends in exactly 99 zeros. This means we're looking for \\(k\\) where:\n\\[ \\left\\lfloor\\frac{k}{5}\\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor\\frac{k}{5^2}\\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor\\frac{k}{5^3}\\right\\rfloor + \\cdots = 99 \\]\n\nSince \\(99\\) is a relatively large number, we can estimate that \\(k\\) should be around \\(400\\) because:\n\\[ \\left\\lfloor\\frac{400}{5}\\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor\\frac{400}{5^2}\\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor\\frac{400}{5^3}\\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor\\frac{400}{5^4}\\right\\rfloor = 80 + 16 + 3 + 0 = 99 \\]\n\nHowever, we need to check for all \\(k\\) near \\(400\\) to see if they give us exactly \\(99\\) zeros.\n\n- For \\(k=400\\), the formula gives \\(99\\) zeros.\n- As \\(k\\) increases from \\(400\\), the number of trailing zeros will increase when \\(k\\) hits multiples of \\(5^2\\), \\(5^3\\), etc., which means at \\(k=405\\), \\(k=425\\), \\(k=450\\), \\(k=475\\), and so on.\n\nLet's calculate the exact number of zeros for a few values of \\(k\\) near \\(400\\):\n- For \\(k=400\\): \\(99\\) zeros (as calculated above).\n- For \\(k=401\\): Still \\(99\\) zeros (since \\(401\\) does not add a new factor of \\(5\\)).\n- ...\n- For \\(k=404\\): Still \\(99\\) zeros.\n- For \\(k=405\\): More than \\(99\\) zeros (since \\(405\\) adds another factor of \\(5\\)).\n\nThus, we have \\(400\\) as the first value that gives us \\(99\\) zeros. The next value that would give us more than \\(99\\) zeros is \\(405\\), meaning that \\(401, 402, 403,\\) and \\(404\\) also give us \\(99\\) zeros.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. Four positive integers \\(k\\) exist such that \\(k!\\) ends in exactly 99 zeros: \\(k = 400, 401, 402, 403, 404\\), but since \\(405\\) does not count as it starts adding more than \\(99\\) zeros, the correct count is four."
