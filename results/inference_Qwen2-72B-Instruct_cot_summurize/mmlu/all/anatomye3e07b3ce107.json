This structure is located between the sphenoid bone and the occipital bone.\n\nAlthough it does not directly influence the position of the viscerocranium (option B), which consists of the bones forming the face, it does affect the cranial base and thus has an indirect impact on the overall craniofacial complex.\n\nThe spheno-occipital synchondrosis typically fuses or ossifies around the age of 18 to 25 (not 7 years as option C suggests). This fusion is important for stabilizing the skull base.\n\nIn patients with acromegaly (option D), where there is excessive production of growth hormone, this synchondrosis may indeed be reactivated, leading to continued growth and potential deformities of the skull base and facial structures. Acromegaly can cause delayed closure of growth plates, including the spheno-occipital synchondrosis, resulting in increased skull size and altered facial features."
