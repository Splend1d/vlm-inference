Lower Lower\n\nDuring periods of inflation, the Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) method results in lower ending inventory values and lower income before taxes compared to the First-In, First-Out (FIFO) method. This is because with LIFO, the cost of goods sold (COGS) includes the costs of the most recently acquired inventory, which are typically higher due to inflation. As a result, the COGS is higher under LIFO, leading to lower taxable income and thus lower income tax payable."
