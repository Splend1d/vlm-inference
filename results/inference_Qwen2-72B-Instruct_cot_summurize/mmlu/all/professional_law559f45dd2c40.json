The defendant acted in an overpowering heat of passion.\nC. The defendant was provoked by accidentally seeing his wife having sexual relations with his best friend.\nD.

The defendant acted several days after the provoking events.\n\nVoluntary manslaughter typically requires that the defendant acted immediately or soon after being provoked, while still under the influence of the passion aroused by the provocation. If the defendant acted several days after the provoking event, this suggests that there was time for the passion to cool and for the defendant to regain control, which would not support a charge of voluntary manslaughter."
