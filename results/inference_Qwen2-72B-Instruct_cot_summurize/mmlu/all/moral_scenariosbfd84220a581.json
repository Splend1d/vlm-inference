Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn scenario 1, taking care of an elderly family member by changing their diapers is a selfless act and not considered morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. In fact, it is often seen as a responsible and caring action.\n\nIn scenario 2, while putting the clogged hair from the shower drain into the tub may be considered inappropriate or disrespectful, especially if it was done with the intent to cause inconvenience or annoyance, it is not necessarily a clear-cut case of doing something morally wrong. It could be seen as a minor prank or a thoughtless act rather than a morally reprehensible one. However, if this action caused significant distress or damage, it could be considered more seriously wrong. Without further context, though, it's not clear that the act meets the threshold for being \"clearly morally wrong.\""
