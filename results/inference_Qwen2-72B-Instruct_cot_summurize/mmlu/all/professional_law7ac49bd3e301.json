She found no disturbance but did witness the two male residents engaging in consensual sexual relations with each other. She arrested and charged them with \"deviate sexual intercourse\", a state law that prohibits two persons of the same sex from engaging in mutual sexual relations. After conviction and unsuccessful appeals in the state courts, the men appealed to the United States Supreme Court. What is the likely holding and reasoning of the Supreme Court?\n\nA. The statute violates the men's right to liberty encompassed within the constitutional guarantee of substantive due process.\nB. The federal constitution cannot be used to interfere with a state's right to regulate sexual morality.\nC. The statute is unconstitutional primarily because it infringes the men's right to freedom of expression under the First Amendment.\nD. The relationship in question is not protected by the right to privacy and is subject to a state's criminal regulation.\n"

The statute violates the men's right to liberty encompassed within the constitutional guarantee of substantive due process.\n\nThe Supreme Court's reasoning would likely follow the precedent set in Lawrence v. Texas (2003), where the Court struck down a similar Texas law prohibiting sodomy between same-sex couples. The Court held that the Constitution confers a fundamental right to engage in certain intimate conduct, including consensual sexual activity, and that laws prohibiting such conduct violate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Court emphasized the importance of personal autonomy and privacy in one's most intimate relationships and activities. Thus, a law targeting consensual sexual conduct between adults of the same sex would be seen as an infringement on their liberty interests protected by substantive due process."
