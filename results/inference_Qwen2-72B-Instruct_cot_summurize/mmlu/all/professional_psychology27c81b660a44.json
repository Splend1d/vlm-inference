The psychologist should consider the constructs being measured, the relevance of the tests to those constructs, and how changes in scores might reflect improvements or changes in the children's outcomes related to the program's goals. Reliability and validity of the measures are also important considerations, but they should not be the sole determinants in selecting the dependent variables."
