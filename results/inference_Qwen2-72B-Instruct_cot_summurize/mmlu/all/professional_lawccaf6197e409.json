A famous rock group was scheduled to perform at the local civic center and the owner featured the band's records in a special sale for the two weeks prior to the concert. In order to promote his sale, the owner installed loudspeakers on the outside of his store window so that he could play the band's records for people walking by to hear. It was the owner's hope that when they heard the records, the passersby would turn into customers and buy the band's records. Subsequently, the owner was cited for violating a city ordinance which provides that:\"An owner of property located within the city limits shall not permit to be used on his property any device which causes sounds, other than clock chimes, to be heard upon the street or sidewalk. Violation of this ordinance shall subject the property owner to a fine of $50. 00 for each occurrence. \"If the owner is successful in challenging this ordinance in court, the court would most likely reason that\n\nA. the ordinance violates equal protection because some sounds are permitted, while others are not.\nB. the ordinance violates the owner's rights of freedom of speech, because there is not valid interest to support the ordinance.\nC. the ordinance violates the owner's rights of freedom of speech, because a municipality may not regulate the use of sound amplification equipment.\nD. the ordinance violates the owner's rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments, because it is vague in defining unpermitted sounds.\n"

The Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause requires laws to have clear standards so that individuals know what conduct is prohibited. The ordinance's prohibition of \"sounds, other than clock chimes\" may be considered too vague and overbroad, as it does not specify what types of sounds are prohibited beyond excluding clock chimes. This lack of specificity could lead to arbitrary enforcement and potentially infringe upon protected speech. Additionally, the ordinance does not provide a clear rationale for why certain sounds are allowed (clock chimes) while others are not, which could also contribute to a finding that the law is unconstitutional. However, the specific reasoning may depend on the details of the case and the arguments presented in court."
