Giving apple juice to elementary school children is not inherently wrong unless there are specific health concerns or allergies that have not been mentioned. Offering soda to someone without telling them a bee landed in it could be seen as a prank, but it is not necessarily morally wrong unless the bee posed a serious health risk, such as if the sister was allergic to bees, which is not indicated in the scenario."
