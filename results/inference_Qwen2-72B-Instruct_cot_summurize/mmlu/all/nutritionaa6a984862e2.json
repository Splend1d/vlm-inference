This approach addresses both dietary habits and physical activity, which are key factors in managing obesity. It's also important for children to eat more fruits and vegetables (option D), but this should be part of a broader strategy that includes reducing overall calorie consumption and increasing physical activity. Eating the same as the rest of the family (option B) might not lead to weight loss if the family's diet is high in calories, while following a completely different diet (option A) can be socially isolating and may not teach healthy eating habits in the long term."
