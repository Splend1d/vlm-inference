Rank-size rule\n\nThe rank-size rule is the description that best fits an urban hierarchy model where the population of a city is inversely proportional to its rank in the hierarchy. According to this rule, if you list the cities in a country or region by their size (population), the largest city will have about twice as many people as the second-largest city, three times as many as the third-largest, and so on. This relationship is often represented mathematically as \\(P_r = \\frac{K}{r}\\), where \\(P_r\\) is the population of the city ranked \\(r\\), and \\(K\\) is a constant."
