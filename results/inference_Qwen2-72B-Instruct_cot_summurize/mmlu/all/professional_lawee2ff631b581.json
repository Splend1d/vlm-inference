There is a purchasemoney mortgage on the property for which the four signed a promissory note as security. The loan was not satisfied at the time of the conveyance. The conveyance is a deed in fee simple to the adult child. The adult child then takes over the mortgage payments. The adult child stops making the payments and conveys the property to a bona fide purchaser who does not do a title search. The purchaser sues his grantor to get an order compelling him to pay the mortgage and remove the lien from his property. Will the court more than likely grant the motion to dismiss made by the defendants?\n\nA. Yes, that is the risk the purchaser took; he cannot go to closing without a title search and a title company making arrangements for payment of the outstanding mortgage by the seller at closing.\nB. Yes, because the court can only force the original four owners to clear the mortgage by paying it in full.\nC. No, the court will order the original four owners to come into court and defend on behalf of the adult child, who has no legal responsibility for the mortgage.\nD. No, the court will order the adult child to resume paying on the mortgage and to obtain a loan to pay it off within a reasonable time.\n"

The bona fide purchaser did not conduct a title search, which is typically a critical step in the purchasing process to ensure there are no liens or encumbrances on the property. By not conducting a title search, the purchaser assumed the risk of any existing liens or mortgages. In this case, since the adult child did not satisfy the mortgage before conveying the property, the lien remains and the purchaser would have been responsible for discovering and addressing this issue prior to closing. The court may not compel the original owners or the adult child to pay off the mortgage, as the purchaser should have protected themselves through proper due diligence."
