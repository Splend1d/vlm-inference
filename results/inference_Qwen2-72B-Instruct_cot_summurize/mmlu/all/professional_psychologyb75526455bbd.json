Bartering is ethical and acceptable if it is not clinically contraindicated and not exploitative.\n\nThis position acknowledges that bartering can be an appropriate form of exchange under certain circumstances, as long as it does not harm the therapeutic relationship or exploit the client. It also recognizes that there may be situations where bartering could be beneficial for both parties involved. However, it emphasizes the importance of ensuring that bartering does not interfere with the therapeutic process or create an imbalance of power between the psychologist and the client."
