Minimize the likelihood of associating with clients whose management lacks integrity.\n\nQuality control policies and procedures for accepting or continuing a client relationship are primarily aimed at assessing the integrity of the client's management, as well as the client's financial stability and the compatibility of the client with the firm's expertise and resources. This helps to minimize the risk of the firm being associated with fraudulent activities or financial misstatements by the client. While options A, C, and D are all important aspects of an audit or accounting practice, they do not directly relate to the specific purpose of these quality control measures in the context of client acceptance and continuance."
