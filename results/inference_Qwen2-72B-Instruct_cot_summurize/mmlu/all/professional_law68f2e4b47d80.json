No other kinds of posters or literature are subject to this prohibition, nor are any other types of commercial establishments in the state subject to similar prohibitions. Is this law constitutional?\n\nA. No, because it treats barbershops differently from other commercial establishments.\nB. No, because it imposes a restriction on the content or subject matter of speech in the absence of any evidence that such a restriction is necessary to serve a compelling state interest.\nC. Yes, because it leaves political candidates free to communicate their campaign messages to voters by other means.\nD. Yes, because the operation of a licensed barbershop is a privilege and therefore is subject to any reasonable restriction imposed by the state.\n"

No, because it imposes a restriction on the content or subject matter of speech in the absence of any evidence that such a restriction is necessary to serve a compelling state interest.\n\nThis law would likely be unconstitutional as it specifically targets speech related to political campaigns in a particular type of establishment (barbershops) without applying equally to all types of establishments or providing a compelling state interest that justifies this content-based restriction. The First Amendment protects against such content-based restrictions unless they serve a compelling government interest and are narrowly tailored to achieve that interest. In this case, there is no apparent compelling interest that justifies singling out barbershops for this restriction."
