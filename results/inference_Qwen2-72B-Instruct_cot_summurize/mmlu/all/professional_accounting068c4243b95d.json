                    "text": "To find out how much the company paid for the new machine, we can use the information about the payback period and the net cash flow generated by the machine.\n\nThe annual revenue from the machine is $35,000, and the annual operating expenses (excluding depreciation) are $7,000 - $4,000 = $3,000. Therefore, the annual net cash flow (cash inflow minus cash outflow) before depreciation is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Net Cash Flow} = \\$35,000 - \\$3,000 = \\$32,000 \\]\n\nSince the depreciation is non-cash expense, it does not affect the net cash flow calculation. The payback period is the time it takes to recover the initial investment through the net cash inflows. Given the payback period is 5.2 years, we can calculate the initial investment as follows:\n\n\\[ \\text{Initial Investment} = \\text{Net Cash Flow} \\times \\text{Payback Period} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Initial Investment} = \\$32,000 \\times 5.2 = \\$166,400 \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. $166,400"
