According to historical records and surveys conducted around that time, the level of support for such programs was quite high. However, without access to precise polling data from 1935, it's difficult to give an exact figure.\n\nHowever, we can infer based on historical context. The Social Security Act was passed with substantial majorities in both houses of Congress, which suggests strong political support, and by extension, likely public backing as well. Given this, options A (90%) or B (70%) seem more plausible than C (50%) or D (30%). \n\nIt's also worth noting that the Social Security Act was a response to the severe economic hardships of the Great Depression, and there was a widespread demand for government intervention to provide relief, recovery, and reform. This context supports the idea that a large majority of Americans were in favor of the Act.\n\nTherefore, while I cannot provide an exact number, it is reasonable to estimate that a significant majority of Americans, perhaps around 70% to 90%, were in favor of the Social Security Act when it was enacted in 1935. So, the answer would be either A or B, with B being a more conservative estimate."
