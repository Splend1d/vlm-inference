This process creates a tree where each node is connected to its parent by the edge that was traversed to reach it first.\n\n1. **Preorder Traversal**: Visits a node before its children. Thus, `pre(u) < pre(v)` implies that u was visited before v during the DFS. This can happen if:\n   - u is an ancestor of v in T.\n   - u and v are in different subtrees, but u's subtree was explored before v's.\n\n2. **Postorder Traversal**: Visits a node after its children. `post(u)` will be greater than `post(v)` if u is an ancestor of v because all descendants of u (including v) must be visited and their post values recorded before u's post value is set. However, if u and v are in different subtrees and u's subtree is explored before v's, `post(u)` could still be less than `post(v)` because the entire subtree rooted at u would have been explored and backtracked before exploring v's subtree.\n\n### Analyzing the Statements\n\n**Statement I: post(u) < post(v)**\n\nThis statement is not necessarily true. As explained above, if u and v are in different subtrees and u's subtree is explored first, then even though `pre(u) < pre(v)`, `post(u)` could still be less than `post(v)`. Therefore, Statement I does not have to be true.\n\n**Statement II: u is an ancestor of v in T**\n\nGiven that `pre(u) < pre(v)`, this could mean that u is indeed an ancestor of v in T, but it also holds true if u and v are in separate branches of T explored in sequence. However, since we're considering a connected graph and a DFS tree, if there is an edge between u and v not included in T, and pre(u) < pre(v), then u must have been explored before v started being explored, implying that u is indeed an ancestor of v unless they are in disconnected components, which cannot be the case here since G is connected. Therefore, Statement II must be true.\n\n**Statement III: If w is the lowest common ancestor of u and v in T, then w = u.**\n\nIf u is an ancestor of v (as deduced from Statement II), then the lowest common ancestor of u and v in T must be u itself because any other ancestor of both u and v would also be an ancestor of u, making u the closest common ancestor to v. Therefore, Statement III is also true.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe correct answer is **D. II and III**. These statements are true based on the given conditions and understanding of how DFS trees and traversal orders work in connected undirected graphs."
