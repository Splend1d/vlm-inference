                    "text": "The correct answer is A. Hemoglobin's affinity for O2 decreases as blood pH decreases.\n\nThis phenomenon is known as the Bohr effect, which describes the reciprocal relationship between hemoglobin's oxygen-binding affinity and acidity (or hydrogen ion concentration). When the pH of the blood decreases (becomes more acidic), hemoglobin releases more oxygen, decreasing its affinity for O2. This occurs because the binding of hydrogen ions to hemoglobin facilitates the release of oxygen, as hemoglobin changes conformation in response to these changes in pH. In exercising muscle tissue where there is increased CO2 production and a decrease in pH, this mechanism allows for more efficient oxygen delivery to the tissues where it is needed most."
