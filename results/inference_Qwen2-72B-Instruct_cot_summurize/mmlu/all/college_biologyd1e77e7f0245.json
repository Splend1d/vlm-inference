These conditions include:\n\nA. a large population size, to minimize the effects of genetic drift.\nC. random mating, where individuals mate without preference for particular genotypes.\nD. absence of selection, meaning that all genotypes have equal fitness.\n\nHowever, one of these conditions is NOT assumed in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium:\n\nB. genetic drift. Genetic drift is actually one of the factors that can disrupt Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. It involves random fluctuations in allele frequencies that occur more frequently in small populations.\n\nSo the correct answer is B. genetic drift."
