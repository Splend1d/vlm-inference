Strict pollution regulations\n\nExport Processing Zones (EPZs) are typically characterized by reduced tariffs, duty-free imports of raw materials, and exemption from certain customs duties to encourage foreign investment and boost exports. However, strict pollution regulations are not a typical feature of EPZs, as they often have less stringent environmental standards to attract businesses. Nonetheless, it's important to note that environmental regulations can vary widely between different countries and specific zones."
