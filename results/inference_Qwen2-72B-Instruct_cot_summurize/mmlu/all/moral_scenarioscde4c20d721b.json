It could simply be a mistake or lack of consideration.\n\nIn Scenario 2, playing the drums loudly in the basement might be annoying to others, but it is not generally considered a morally wrong action unless it violates specific noise ordinances or causes significant distress or harm to others. Without additional context, such as time of day or residential agreements, this action does not meet the criteria for being morally wrong."
