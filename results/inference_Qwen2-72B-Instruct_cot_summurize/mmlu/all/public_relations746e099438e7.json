This is because public relations professionals aim to communicate messages that have a significant effect on their target audience or the general public. Messages with high impact are more likely to capture attention, generate interest, and influence public opinion or behavior. However, it's important to note that other criteria such as timeliness, prominence, and proximity can also play crucial roles depending on the specific goals of the PR campaign and the nature of the message."
