If the inverse of \\(-i\\) were \\(1\\), then \\((-i) \\cdot 1 = 1 \\cdot (-i) = -i\\), which does not equal \\(1\\). So, \\(1\\) is not the inverse of \\(-i\\).\n\nB. If the inverse of \\(-i\\) were \\(-1\\), then \\((-i) \\cdot (-1) = (-1) \\cdot (-i) = i\\), which does not equal \\(1\\). So, \\(-1\\) is not the inverse of \\(-i\\).\n\nC. If the inverse of \\(-i\\) were \\(i\\), then \\((-i) \\cdot i = i \\cdot (-i) = -i^2\\). Since \\(i^2 = -1\\), then \\(-i^2 = -(-1) = 1\\). This means that \\(i\\) is indeed the inverse of \\(-i\\).\n\nD. If the inverse of \\(-i\\) were \\(-i\\), then \\((-i) \\cdot (-i) = (-i)^2 = -1\\), which does not equal \\(1\\). So, \\(-i\\) is not its own inverse.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. i"
