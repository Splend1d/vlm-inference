Stress and loss of social support\n\nThe phenomenon where a surviving spouse dies shortly after their partner is often attributed to stress and the loss of social support. This can lead to neglect of their own health, depression, and in some cases, an increased risk of mortality due to factors like heart disease. This is sometimes referred to as the \"widowhood effect.\" While genetics and shared lifestyle factors may play a role, the immediate and significant impact is more often linked to the emotional and social changes that occur after the loss of a spouse."
