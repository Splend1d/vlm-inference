Political parties conduct primaries, and the winning candidates in each office may have their names placed on the ballot. However, nominees of political bodies or any independent candidate may only have their names placed on the ballot if they file a nominating petition signed by not less than 7% of those eligible to vote at the last election for the offices that they are seeking. The time for circulating the petition is 180 days, which is also the deadline governing party candidates in party primaries. An independent candidate, who desires to be listed on the ballot for the office of governor, challenges the constitutionality of this election law. The court will most likely declare this statute\n\nA. unconstitutional, because it is a violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments' rights of free speech.\nB. unconstitutional, because it is a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause.\nC. unconstitutional, because it violates the Fifteenth Amendment's voting provisions.\nD. constitutional, because the election code is nonviolative of the equal protection clause.\n"

In this case, the distinction between political parties and political bodies is based on past electoral success, which is a rational basis for distinguishing between groups with different levels of support. The requirement for independent candidates or political bodies to gather signatures through a nominating petition serves the state's interest in ensuring that candidates have a minimum level of support before being placed on the ballot, which helps prevent frivolous candidacies and ensures that the election process is not overwhelmed with an excessive number of candidates.\n\nWhile the requirement may present a higher burden for independent candidates or political bodies, it does not violate the First and Fourteenth Amendments' rights of free speech or the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause. It also does not violate the Fifteenth Amendment's voting provisions, as these provisions concern discrimination based on race, color, or previous condition of servitude, which is not at issue here. The time frame for circulating the petition is the same for all candidates, and the percentage of signatures required is not so high as to be deemed an unreasonable restriction.\n\nTherefore, the court is likely to find that the statute is constitutional under the equal protection clause because it does not arbitrarily discriminate against independent candidates or political bodies and serves a legitimate state interest."
