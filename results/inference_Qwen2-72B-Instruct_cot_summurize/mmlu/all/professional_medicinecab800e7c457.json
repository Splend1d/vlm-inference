He\u00a0says that he has been constipated for the past 5\u00a0days and denies hematochezia and melena. He\u00a0says that he usually has loose stools during final exam week. Vital signs are normal. Physical examination\u00a0reveals mild diffuse abdominal tenderness, and the remainder of the findings are normal.

This region includes the celiac ganglion and the superior mesenteric plexus, which provide sympathetic innervation to the abdominal organs, including the colon.\n\nThe other options can be excluded as follows:\n\nA. C1-C2: These cervical segments primarily innervate the head and neck.\nB. T1-T4: These thoracic segments contribute to the sympathetic innervation of the thoracic organs, such as the heart and lungs.\nD. L3-L5: These lumbar segments contribute to the innervation of the lower limbs and perineum."
