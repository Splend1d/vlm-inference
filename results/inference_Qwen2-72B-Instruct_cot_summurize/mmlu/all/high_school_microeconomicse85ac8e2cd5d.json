A superstar basketball player's $40 million earnings.\n\nTransfer earnings refer to the compensation someone receives for their work, which is in line with their opportunity cost or the next best alternative use of their skills. In this context, the superstar basketball player's $40 million earnings could be considered a transfer earning if it represents the market value of his talent and labor, i.e., what he could earn by playing basketball elsewhere or using his skills in another occupation. However, it's worth noting that such high earnings often include economic rents (earnings above opportunity costs) due to the player's unique talents and the demand for professional athletes. The other options are examples of transfers but not transfer earnings: B and C are government transfers, and D is an example of normal earnings, not specifically related to the concept of transfer earnings."
