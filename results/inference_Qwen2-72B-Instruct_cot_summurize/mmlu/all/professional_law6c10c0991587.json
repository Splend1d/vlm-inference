The leasehold agreement between the landlord and tenant provided that the latter was not permitted \"to assign this lease to anyone except a corporation with an \u0080\u0098A' credit rating from a well- known credit rating company. \" On February 1 of the following year, the tenant leased the premises to a corporation that did not have the required credit rating. The tenant \u0080\u0094corporation lease was for a period of five years, with a rental of $15,000 per month, payable by the corporation to the tenant. In addition, the corporation agreed to abide \"by all of the terms and conditions of the lease between the landlord and the tenant. \"One year later, the corporation leased the premises to a health club for the balance of the term of the corporation \u0080\u0094tenant lease. The health club owner took possession of the said premises on February 1, the same day that the corporation vacated its occupancy. Pursuant to the corporation \u0080\u0094health club leasehold agreement, the latter was obligated to pay a monthly rental of $17,500 directly to the corporation. The health club has a \u0080\u0098B' credit rating with the well-known credit rating company. For one year, the health club paid $17,500, each month directly to the corporation. During that same period, the corporation continued to pay $15,000 each month to the tenant, while the latter paid $10,000 (each month) to the landlord. The landlord knew about the leases to the corporation and the health club and protested promptly, but took no further action, apparently satisfied as long as he received his $10,000 per month from the tenant. Thereafter, the health club abandoned the premises and stopped paying rent to the corporation. After the health club discontinued paying rent, the corporation stopped paying rent to the tenant. When the tenant failed to receive his rent, he, too, stopped paying rent to the landlord. If the landlord brings suit to recover for past rent due, which of the following is most accurate?\n\nA. The landlord may recover against the tenant for past rent due.\nB. The landlord may recover against the corporation for past rent due.\nC. The landlord may recover against the health club for past rent due.\nD. The landlord may recover against the corporation and the health club, jointly and severally,for past rent due.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is A. The landlord may recover against the tenant for past rent due.\n\nExplanation: The primary relationship in question is between the landlord and the original tenant, who signed a 20-year lease agreement with the landlord. This tenant then subleased the property to a corporation that did not meet the specified credit rating requirement, and this corporation further sublet the property to a health club. However, the subleases do not relieve the original tenant of their obligations under the primary lease with the landlord.\n\nWhen the health club stopped paying rent to the corporation, the chain reaction led to the original tenant also stopping payments to the landlord. Despite the subleasing, the original tenant remains liable to the landlord for the full rent due under the terms of their lease agreement. Therefore, the landlord can sue the original tenant for the past rent due.\n\nThe other options (B, C, and D) are not as accurate because the landlord's direct contractual relationship is with the original tenant, not with the corporation or the health club. While the landlord might have grounds to challenge the validity of the subleases or seek damages from the corporation or health club under certain circumstances, such as if they violated the terms of the original lease by not having the proper credit rating, the primary obligation for rent payment falls on the original tenant."
