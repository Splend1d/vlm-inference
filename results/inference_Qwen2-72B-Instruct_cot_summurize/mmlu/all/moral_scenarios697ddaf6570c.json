In Scenario 2, taking a sip from a drink intended for someone else could be unhygienic or against health codes, but if there is no harm caused and it was an unintentional act quickly rectified (such as by providing a new drink), it might not be seen as clearly morally wrong in the same way as Scenario 1. However, if this action is done with malicious intent or leads to harm, then it could also be considered morally wrong. For the purposes of this answer, we're assuming the action was minor and unintentional."
