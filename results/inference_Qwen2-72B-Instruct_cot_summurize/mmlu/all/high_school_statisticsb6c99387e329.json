This is known as the family-wise error rate.\n\nThe probability of not making a type I error in a single test when the null hypothesis is true is \\(1 - \\alpha\\). In this case, with \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\), the probability of not making a type I error in a single test is \\(0.95\\).\n\nFor 10 independent tests, the probability of not making any type I errors across all tests is:\n\\[P(\\text{No Type I Errors in 10 Tests}) = (1 - \\alpha)^{10} = 0.95^{10}\\]\n\nThus, the probability of making at least one type I error in 10 tests is the complement of the probability of not making any type I errors in those tests:\n\\[P(\\text{At Least One Type I Error in 10 Tests}) = 1 - P(\\text{No Type I Errors in 10 Tests}) = 1 - 0.95^{10}\\]\n\nCalculating this gives:\n\\[1 - 0.95^{10} = 1 - 0.5987369 = 0.4012631\\]\n\nRounding to the nearest option provided, the correct answer is:\n\nB. 0.40"
