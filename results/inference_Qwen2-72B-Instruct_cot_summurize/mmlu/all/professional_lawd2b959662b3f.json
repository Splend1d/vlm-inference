After paying the sale price and taking occupancy, the buyer experienced drainage and interior flooding problems with the home. The city issued citations against the owner for not following code regulations regarding construction on a flood-prone slope. The buyer asked the seller to repair all of the defects at his own expense but the seller refused. The buyer brought an action in court alleging breach of warranty against the builder-seller. Will the court hold the builderseller liable to live up to any warranties in favor of the buyer?\n\nA. No, the buyer had an obligation to make a full inspection and discover any defects prior to paying the full price and taking occupancy.\nB. No, the law regarding a building purchase is based on the premise \"Let the buyer beware.\"\nC. Yes, every builder-seller warrants that a newly constructed home is built in a good and workmanlike manner.\nD. Yes, the seller has strict liability to the buyer for any defects that arise within one year of the sale.\n"

Yes, every builder-seller warrants that a newly constructed home is built in a good and workmanlike manner.\n\nIn most jurisdictions, when a builder-sells a newly constructed home, there is an implied warranty that the home was constructed in a good and workmanlike manner, and that it complies with applicable building codes. This warranty exists regardless of whether it is explicitly stated in the contract. Therefore, if the home has defects such as drainage and interior flooding issues that result from non-compliance with code regulations, the builder-seller can be held liable under this implied warranty. The fact that the city issued citations against the owner for not following code regulations further supports the buyer's case that the home was not constructed properly."
