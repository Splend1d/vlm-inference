However, this can lead to faulty reasoning because what may seem self-evident to one person may not be so to another, and what is obvious in one context may not hold up in another. Therefore, it's important to provide clear evidence and logical reasoning to support any claim, rather than relying solely on assertions of its self-evidence."
