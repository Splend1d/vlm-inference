This concept refers to the increasing interconnectedness of markets across national borders, where businesses from different countries compete with each other for market share, customers, and resources on a global scale. While globalization (option D) is a broader term that encompasses many aspects of international integration, including trade, capital flows, and cultural exchange, global competition specifically highlights the competitive dynamics between firms operating in multiple countries."
