It occurs when a program writes more data to a block of memory, or buffer, than it is supposed to hold. The excess data overflows into adjacent memory locations, potentially overwriting other important data or instructions. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code, gain unauthorized access, or cause the system to crash."
