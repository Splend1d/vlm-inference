When the payload is dropped, it continues to move with the same horizontal velocity as the plane (100 m/s north) because of the principle of inertia. In the vertical direction, when the payload is dropped, it begins to accelerate downward due to gravity at approximately 9.8 m/s^2. \n\nTo find the vertical component of its velocity after 4 seconds, we use the formula:\n\\[v = gt\\]\nwhere \\(g\\) is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately \\(9.8 \\, \\text{m/s}^2\\)) and \\(t\\) is time (4 seconds). Thus,\n\\[v = 9.8 \\times 4 = 39.2 \\, \\text{m/s}\\]\nwhich rounds to 40 m/s down.\n\nSince the payload maintains its horizontal velocity of 100 m/s north and gains a vertical velocity of 40 m/s down over 4 seconds, its total velocity relative to the plane is 100 m/s north and 40 m/s down."
