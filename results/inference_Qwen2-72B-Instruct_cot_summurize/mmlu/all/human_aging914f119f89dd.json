For older adults, this can complicate medical care and make it more challenging for healthcare providers to diagnose and treat their conditions effectively. Each condition can influence the symptoms, progression, and treatment of the others, making it hard to determine which condition is causing specific symptoms. Additionally, the medications used to treat one condition may interact negatively with those used to treat another, further complicating treatment plans."
