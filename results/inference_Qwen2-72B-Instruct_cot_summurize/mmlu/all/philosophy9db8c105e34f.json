This principle holds that we should give equal weight to the interests of all beings capable of suffering. Therefore, complying with this principle would require:\n\nD. Drastic changes to both our personal habits and to our society.\n\nSinger's views suggest that we need to radically alter how we treat animals, how we distribute resources globally, and how we structure our economic systems to ensure they do not perpetuate unnecessary suffering or inequality. This goes beyond mere personal habit changes and necessitates broader societal reforms."
