However, in general, it tends to decline in a complex manner that can often be approximated as geometrically declining for large lags.\n\nThe Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF) cuts off after lag p for the AR component, meaning it will be zero for lags greater than p.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer would be:\n\nB. An ACF that declines geometrically and a PACF that is zero after p lags.\n\nOption C is incorrect because it's the ACF that should cut off (or at least show significant decay) after q lags for the MA part of the model, not the PACF. Options A and D do not accurately describe the behavior of either the ACF or PACF for an ARMA(p,q) model."
