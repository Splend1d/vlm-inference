R-selected species typically have a high reproductive rate, small body size, and occupy unstable environments, but they do not usually have a high competitive ability as they often rely on rapid reproduction to outpace competitors rather than directly outcompeting them for resources. K-selected species, in contrast, tend to have higher competitive abilities due to their focus on quality over quantity in reproduction and their tendency to occupy stable environments."
