Centralized and state-directed campaigns of modernization\n\nThe context that best explains the rapid increase in literacy rates among the Russian-speaking population from late Imperial Russia through the Soviet period is the implementation of centralized and state-directed campaigns of modernization. The Soviet government placed a strong emphasis on education as a means to promote social and economic development, which led to significant increases in literacy rates over time. This is evident in the sharp rise in literacy rates following the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917 and the subsequent establishment of the Soviet Union, where the state took an active role in promoting education and literacy as part of its broader goals for modernization and socialist transformation.\n\nThe other options do not adequately capture the historical context of the literacy rate changes:\n\nA. Educational reform in the modern era could be too broad and does not specifically address the role of the state in driving educational improvements.\n\nC. Experimentation with syndicalist forms of socio-economic organization does not align with the historical context of the Soviet Union's centralized approach to governance and education.\n\nD. Second-stage industrialization in the non-Western world is more focused on economic development and may not directly explain the specific focus on literacy and education seen in the Soviet Union during this period."
