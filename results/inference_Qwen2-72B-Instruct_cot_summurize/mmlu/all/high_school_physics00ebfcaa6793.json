For a one-dimensional problem like this, it simply means finding the derivative of \\(U(x)\\) with respect to \\(x\\) and then negating it:\n\n\\[F(x) = -\\frac{dU}{dx}\\]\n\nGiven:\n\\[U(x) = (x-2)^3 - 12x\\]\n\nFirst, let's find the derivative of \\(U(x)\\):\n\\[\\frac{dU}{dx} = \\frac{d}{dx}[(x-2)^3] - \\frac{d}{dx}[12x]\\]\n\nUsing the chain rule for the first term:\n\\[\\frac{d}{dx}[(x-2)^3] = 3(x-2)^2\\cdot\\frac{d}{dx}(x-2) = 3(x-2)^2\\]\n\nSo,\n\\[\\frac{dU}{dx} = 3(x-2)^2 - 12\\]\n\nAnd the force \\(F(x)\\) becomes:\n\\[F(x) = -\\left[3(x-2)^2 - 12\\right] = -3(x-2)^2 + 12\\]\n\nFor equilibrium, \\(F(x) = 0\\), so:\n\\[0 = -3(x-2)^2 + 12\\]\n\nSolving for \\(x\\):\n\\[3(x-2)^2 = 12\\]\n\\[(x-2)^2 = 4\\]\n\\[x-2 = \\pm2\\]\n\nThis gives us two solutions:\n\\[x = 2+2 = 4\\]\n\\[x = 2-2 = 0\\]\n\nSo, the possible positions for equilibrium are \\(x=4\\) and \\(x=0\\).\n\nHowever, to determine if these positions represent stable equilibrium, we need to check the second derivative of the potential energy (\\(\\frac{d^2U}{dx^2}\\)) at these points. A position is a stable equilibrium if the second derivative is positive at that point.\n\nLet's find the second derivative of \\(U(x)\\):\n\\[\\frac{d^2U}{dx^2} = \\frac{d}{dx}\\left[3(x-2)^2\\right] = 6(x-2)\\]\n\nNow, checking the second derivative at \\(x=4\\) and \\(x=0\\):\n\nAt \\(x=4\\):\n\\[\\frac{d^2U}{dx^2} = 6(4-2) = 12 > 0\\]\n\nAt \\(x=0\\):\n\\[\\frac{d^2U}{dx^2} = 6(0-2) = -12 < 0\\]\n\nSince the second derivative is positive at \\(x=4\\), this indicates a stable equilibrium at \\(x=4\\).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. x = 4"
