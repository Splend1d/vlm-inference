He had to go to court to ask the court to compel the adjacent landowner to give him an easement of necessity for ingress and egress to the highway. The court granted the easement of necessity to Landowner. Over a decade later, another access route to the highway opened up through public improvements. The adjacent landowner sued to stop Landowner from continuing to use his land for ingress and egress. What will the court most likely rule in this case?\n\nA. The holder of the easement has a right to insist on its uninterrupted continuance.\nB. The easement continues because its purpose of access to the property still exists.\nC. The easement is terminated because it cannot exceed five years in length, without being formally renewed by both parties.\nD. The equities favor the termination of the easement where another route is available.\n"

The equities favor the termination of the easement where another route is available.\n\nAn easement of necessity is typically granted when there is no other reasonable means of accessing a landlocked parcel of land. Once an alternative route becomes available, the necessity for the original easement may be considered to have ceased. If the new route provides adequate access and is not significantly more burdensome or costly to use than the easement, a court might find that the original justification for the easement no longer exists and terminate it. This decision would balance the rights of both the easement holder and the servient estate owner, considering the principle of fairness (equity) in light of changed circumstances. However, the specifics of the case, including any agreements or conditions under which the easement was originally granted, could also influence the court's decision."
