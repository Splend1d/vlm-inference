Light enters the eye and strikes the photoreceptor cells, known as rods and cones, which are located in the retina.\n2. The rods and cones convert light into electrical signals and pass them to the bipolar cells.\n3. The bipolar cells then transmit these signals to the ganglion cells.\n4. The ganglion cells gather all the signals from the bipolar cells and send them through the optic nerve to the brain for interpretation."
