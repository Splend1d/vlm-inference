Club shaped glycoprotein spikes protrude through a lipid bilayer.\n\nCoronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19), have a distinctive structure. They are enveloped viruses, meaning they have an outer layer composed of a lipid bilayer derived from the host cell's membrane. Embedded within this lipid bilayer are various proteins, including club-shaped glycoprotein spikes, which give the virus its crown-like appearance under an electron microscope (\"corona\" is Latin for \"crown\"). These spikes, also known as S proteins, play a crucial role in binding to receptors on the host cell and facilitating entry of the virus into the cell. Inside the envelope is the viral genome, which is a single-stranded RNA molecule, along with structural proteins that help package the RNA."
