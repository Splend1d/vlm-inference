The name astrovirus comes from the Greek word \"astron\" meaning star, due to the star-like appearance of the virus particles when viewed under electron microscopy with negative staining. This characteristic appearance is due to the presence of spikes or protrusions on the surface of the viral capsid, which give it a radiating, star-like morphology."
