The term literally translates from Spanish as \"chili with meat\". It typically includes ground beef or chunks of beef, along with tomatoes, onions, and chili peppers. Beans may also be added, although their inclusion is a point of contention for some chili purists. Cheese can be used as a topping but it's not part of the basic definition of 'chili con carne'. Chili peppers are indeed an essential ingredient, but they do not define the dish as 'con carne'. So, the correct answer is B. meat."
