The Egyptian system of hieroglyphics did use pictographs, it does not appear to have developed suddenly but rather evolved over time, and it was not the earliest form of writing in the world (that distinction goes to the Sumerian cuneiform script). \n\nTo provide more detail:\nA. Hieroglyphics did use pictographs, which are symbols that represent objects or ideas.\nB. Hieroglyphics did not develop suddenly, but rather evolved over time from simpler forms of writing.\nC. Hieroglyphics was not the earliest form of writing in the world. The oldest known writing system is the Sumerian cuneiform script, which dates back to around 3400 BCE. Hieroglyphics emerged in Egypt around 3200 BCE. \n\nTherefore, none of the options provided is correct."
