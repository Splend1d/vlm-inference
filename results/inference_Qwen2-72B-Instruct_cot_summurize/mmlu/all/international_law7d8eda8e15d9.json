This includes the power to make decisions regarding its internal and external affairs, as well as the ability to enforce those decisions within its territory. While recognition by other states and the ability to enter into treaties and join international organizations like the UN are important aspects of statehood, they do not necessarily define sovereignty in and of themselves. Possessing the right to defend oneself is also an important aspect of sovereignty, but it is not the defining characteristic."
