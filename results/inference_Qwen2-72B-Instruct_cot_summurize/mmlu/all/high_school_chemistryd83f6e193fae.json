Let \\( r_{He} \\) be the rate of effusion of helium and \\( r_x \\) be the rate of effusion of the unknown gas. Let \\( M_{He} = 4 \\, u \\) (atomic mass units) be the molar mass of helium and \\( M_x \\) be the molar mass of the unknown gas. According to Graham's law:\n\n\\[ \\frac{r_{He}}{r_x} = \\frac{\\sqrt{M_x}}{\\sqrt{M_{He}}} = 5.33 \\]\n\n\\[ \\sqrt{M_x} = 5.33 \\cdot \\sqrt{4} = 5.33 \\cdot 2 = 10.66 \\]\n\n\\[ M_x = (10.66)^2 = 113.796 \\, u \\]\n\nNow let's consider the molecular weights of the options provided:\n\nA. \\( M_{CO_2} = 12 + 2(16) = 44 \\, u \\)\n\nB. \\( M_{CH_4} = 12 + 4(1) = 16 \\, u \\)\n\nC. \\( M_{C_5H_{12}} = 5(12) + 12(1) = 60 + 12 = 72 \\, u \\)\n\nD. \\( M_{C_8H_{18}} = 8(12) + 18(1) = 96 + 18 = 114 \\, u \\)\n\nComparing these with the calculated molecular weight of the unknown gas (\\( M_x = 113.796 \\, u \\)), option D, \\( C_8H_{18} \\), with a molecular weight of \\( 114 \\, u \\), is the closest match.\n\nThus, the unknown gas is most likely:\n\nD. \\( C_8H_{18} \\)"
