The selection ratio is typically defined as the ratio of the number of workers needed (or the number of positions to be filled) to the number of applicants available. This ratio is often used in personnel selection to gauge the competitiveness of the hiring process and can help organizations determine how selective they need to be during the selection process. For example, if there are 10 positions to fill and 100 applicants, the selection ratio would be 10/100 or 0.1."
