However, there is a general understanding that treaties and custom hold equal weight as primary sources of international law. When there is a conflict between a treaty and a customary rule, the principle of lex posterior derogat legi priori (the later law abrogates the earlier one) applies, meaning that the more recent rule or agreement takes precedence.\n\nGeneral Principles of Law, which are recognized by civilized nations, serve to fill gaps when neither treaties nor customs provide a clear answer. They do not necessarily supersede treaties or customs but are used in conjunction with them to interpret or supplement the law where necessary.\n\nTherefore, none of the options A through D accurately reflects the complete picture. The closest option would be:\n\nA. There is no hierarchy between the formal sources of international law\n\nThis statement acknowledges that while treaties and custom are generally considered co-equal, the application of these sources depends on the specific circumstances and context of the legal issue at hand."
