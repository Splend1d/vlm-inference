Examples of endotherms include mammals and birds. Ectotherms, on the other hand, rely on external heat sources to regulate their body temperature, and their metabolic rates typically vary with environmental temperatures. Thermophiles are organisms that thrive at high temperatures, but this does not necessarily relate to their ability to maintain a constant metabolic rate under temperature fluctuations. Ascospores are spores produced by fungi during sexual reproduction and are not relevant to the question."
