However, among the options given, the most accurate commonality is:\n\nB. exploitation of new food resources\n\nThis option reflects a significant aspect of human history during the Holocene, as it was a time when humans across various continents started to develop agriculture and exploit new food sources. In Australia, Aboriginal people adapted to changing environments and developed sophisticated knowledge systems for managing and utilizing the continent's unique flora and fauna.\n\nIt is worth noting that while option C (a growth in cultural diversity) is also true for many parts of the world during the Holocene, it is not necessarily a direct result of environmental or resource changes in the same way that the exploitation of new food resources is. Option D (the independent domestication of wheat and cattle) is not applicable to Australia since these species were not independently domesticated there but rather introduced by Europeans much later in history. Option A (drastic environmental changes) occurred globally, including in Australia, but it was the human response to these changes, such as exploiting new food resources, that defines the Holocene more specifically."
