This is not considered morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, \"I called the cops on the man who hit my child,\" you are responding to an act of violence against your child by reporting it to the police. This action is generally considered appropriate and not morally wrong; in fact, it could be seen as fulfilling a moral duty to protect one's child."
