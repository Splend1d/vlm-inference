However, since not all numbers in this set satisfy the condition, it doesn't meet the requirement that *all* values in the set make the inequality true.\n\nD. {2, 3, 4}: All numbers in this set are less than 5.5, so they all satisfy the inequality.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **D. {2, 3, 4}**."
