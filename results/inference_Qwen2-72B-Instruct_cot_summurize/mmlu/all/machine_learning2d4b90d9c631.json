Decreases model bias\n\nAdding more basis functions to a linear model can help capture more complex relationships in the data, which generally reduces the bias of the model by making it more flexible. However, this can also potentially increase the variance due to overfitting if not properly regularized or if the added complexity is not warranted by the underlying data structure."
