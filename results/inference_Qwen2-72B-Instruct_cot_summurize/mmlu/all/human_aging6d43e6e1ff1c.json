This translates to roughly less than 50% of the adult population engaging in regular exercise. However, the exact percentage can vary significantly by country and region. In general, high-income countries tend to have higher rates of physical inactivity due to more sedentary lifestyles. Therefore, the answer to your question is:\n\nA. Less than 50%\n\nHowever, it's important to note that this figure can change as new data becomes available and public health initiatives work to increase physical activity levels globally."
