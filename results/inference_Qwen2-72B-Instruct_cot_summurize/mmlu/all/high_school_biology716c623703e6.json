It requires relatively high parental care of offspring.\n\nOrganisms that have a low reproductive rate (giving birth to only one offspring at a time) and a long lifespan often require more parental investment in their offspring. This is because each offspring represents a significant investment by the parents, and they may need to provide extensive care to ensure the survival and successful development of the offspring. This strategy is often seen in K-selected species, which tend to live in stable environments where resources are limited and competition is high."
