Therefore, it can be justified to limit access to products that are known to cause harm to people's health, such as fatty foods and tobacco products. However, it is important to consider the potential costs and benefits of such prohibitions and to ensure that they are implemented in a way that respects individual autonomy and does not lead to unintended negative consequences."
