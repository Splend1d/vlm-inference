Describe development as a process of growth (gain) and decline (loss)\n\nBaltes\u2019s Selective Optimization with Compensation theory posits that development involves both gains and losses. It suggests that individuals select certain skills or abilities to develop further while optimizing their performance in those areas. At the same time, they compensate for declines in other areas by using alternative strategies or resources. This theory does not focus primarily on psychopathology (option A) and does acknowledge the role of environmental influences on development (making option C incorrect). Therefore, the best answer is B."
