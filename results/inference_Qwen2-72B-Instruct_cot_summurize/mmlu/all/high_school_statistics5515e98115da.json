Using stratified random sampling rather than simple random sampling\n\nThis answer might seem counterintuitive because stratified random sampling can actually help reduce bias by ensuring that specific subgroups within a population are proportionally represented. However, when compared to the other options provided, it is the least likely to universally reduce bias in every context. Following up with non-respondents (A), asking neutral questions (B), and selecting samples randomly (D) are generally more effective strategies for reducing bias across different types of surveys and populations. Stratification can be particularly useful when there are known subgroups that should be represented, but if not used correctly, it could potentially introduce bias if the strata are not defined appropriately."
