This means its value is \\(6 \\times 10^3 = 6,000\\).\n\nWe are looking for a number where the value of the digit 6 is exactly 10 times the value of the digit 6 in the number Andrew wrote. Therefore, we are looking for a digit 6 that has a value of \\(6,000 \\times 10 = 60,000\\).\n\nLet's look at each option:\n\nA. 681,452: The digit 6 is in the hundred-thousands place, so its value is \\(6 \\times 10^5 = 600,000\\), which is not 10 times 6,000.\n\nB. 462,017: The digit 6 is in the ten-thousands place, so its value is \\(6 \\times 10^4 = 60,000\\), which is exactly 10 times 6,000.\n\nC. 246,412: The digit 6 is in the thousands place, so its value is \\(6 \\times 10^3 = 6,000\\), which is not 10 times 6,000.\n\nD. 125,655: The digit 6 is in the hundreds place, so its value is \\(6 \\times 10^2 = 600\\), which is not 10 times 6,000.\n\nThus, the correct answer is B. 462,017, as it is the only number where the value of the digit 6 is exactly 10 times the value of the digit 6 in the number Andrew wrote."
