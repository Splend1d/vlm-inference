This inequality is known as the subadditivity property of entropy.\n\nThe second statement is also false. Moralization of a directed graph typically increases the number of edges in the graph. Moralization involves adding edges between all pairs of nodes that have a common child, which generally results in a more densely connected graph.\n\nSo the answer is B. False, False."
