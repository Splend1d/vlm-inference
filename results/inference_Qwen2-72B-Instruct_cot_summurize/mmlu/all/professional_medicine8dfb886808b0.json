During the operation, plastic reconstruction of facial fractures, and open reduction and internal fixation of the left femur are also done. Thirty-six hours postoperatively, she is awake but not completely alert. She is receiving intravenous morphine via a patient-controlled pump. She says that she needs the morphine to treat her pain, but she is worried that she is becoming addicted. She has no history of substance use disorder. She drinks one to two glasses of wine weekly. Which of the following initial actions by the physician is most appropriate?\n\nA. Reassure the patient that her chance of becoming addicted to narcotics is minuscule\nB. Maintain the morphine, but periodically administer intravenous naloxone\nC. Switch the patient to oral acetaminophen as soon as she can take medication orally\nD. Switch the patient to intramuscular lorazepam\n"

Switch the patient to oral acetaminophen as soon as she can take medication orally\n\nWhile it's important to manage the patient's pain effectively, particularly after such extensive surgeries, transitioning from intravenous opioids like morphine to a non-opioid analgesic like acetaminophen (paracetamol) as soon as safely possible can help mitigate concerns about addiction. This approach is in line with current pain management guidelines which recommend multimodal pain control and minimizing opioid use when alternative therapies are effective.\n\nHowever, it's crucial to note that this decision should be made in consultation with the patient and based on her specific pain levels and ability to tolerate oral medications. If her pain is not adequately controlled with acetaminophen alone, other non-opioid options or lower-potency opioids might be considered before reverting to higher-strength opioids like morphine. Additionally, reassurance regarding the risks of addiction given her lack of history of substance use disorder could be provided, but it should be balanced with a discussion of strategies to minimize these risks and manage her pain effectively. \n\nOptions A, B, and D are less appropriate:\n- Option A may not fully address the patient's concern and could potentially downplay valid worries about opioid use.\n- Option B involves the administration of naloxone, an opioid antagonist used for reversing opioid overdose, which is not indicated for routine use in managing chronic pain or preventing addiction.\n- Option D suggests switching to lorazepam, a benzodiazepine, which is not typically used for pain management and carries its own risk of dependence."
