To enter into a contract with a third party without the consent of the other partners.\n\nIn a general partnership, each partner has the right to participate in management (option A) and to review accounting records (option B). However, they do not have the unilateral right to bind the partnership in contracts without the consent of the other partners. This is because all partners are jointly and severally liable for the actions of any one partner acting within the scope of the partnership business.\n\nOption D is also worth noting, but it's not what the question asks for. In a general partnership, all partners are typically liable for the partnership's debts and obligations, not just their own personal negligence. However, the question seems to be asking about entitlements rather than liabilities, so option D is not the best answer to the question as phrased."
