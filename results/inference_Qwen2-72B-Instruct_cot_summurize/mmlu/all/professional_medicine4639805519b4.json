One week ago, she was treated in the emergency department after she accidentally spilled hot grease on her left leg while working at a fast-food restaurant. Examination of the left lower extremity shows a 7-cm, pink, soft, granular, edematous wound. The formation of this tissue was most likely caused by increased activity of which of the following?\n\nA. Glycosylation-dependent cell adhesion molecule-1\nB. P-selectin\nC. Stromelysin\nD. Vascular endothelial growth factor\n"

Granulation tissue is characterized by its pink, soft, granular appearance and is rich in new blood vessels and connective tissue. It is often accompanied by edema (swelling) due to fluid accumulation.\n\nVascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), option D, plays a critical role in angiogenesis (the formation of new blood vessels) and increases vascular permeability, which contributes to edema. These actions are crucial for the development of granulation tissue during the wound healing process. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Vascular endothelial growth factor"
