All of these options.\n\nFeminist scholars often view the exclusion of women from the military sphere or from armed combat as significant due to several interconnected reasons:\n\nA. Veterans of armed conflict may be rewarded with powerful offices, often in political positions and in state institutions. This means that those who have served in the military, particularly in combat roles, might gain access to influential positions in society. Excluding women from such roles limits their potential to hold power and shape policy, perpetuating gender inequality.\n\nB. Participation in military activity is often regarded as a sign of strength, patriotism, and courage. By excluding women from military service, especially combat roles, society reinforces stereotypes about gender capabilities and values. This can lead to the perception that men are more capable or deserving of respect than women, undermining efforts toward gender equality.\n\nC. The foundations for decisions not to allow female participation are commonly based on arbitrary and discriminatory rationale that can limit women's participation in civil society in other ways. Arguments against women in the military often rely on outdated assumptions about physical strength, emotional resilience, or the role of women in society. These same assumptions can be applied to other areas, such as the workplace, politics, or leadership roles, further marginalizing women and hindering their progress in various aspects of life.\n\nThe exclusion of women from the military sphere or armed combat thus becomes emblematic of broader issues related to gender discrimination and inequality. Feminist scholars argue that addressing this exclusion is crucial for dismantling patriarchal structures and promoting true gender equality."
