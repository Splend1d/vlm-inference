The consumer will continue to consume the good as long as the marginal utility (the additional satisfaction gained from consuming one more unit) is positive. Once the marginal utility becomes zero, the consumer has reached a point where consuming one more unit would not provide any additional satisfaction, and thus, there is no incentive to consume more. This is known as the point of satiation."
