Under the Federal Rules of Evidence, Rule 801(d)(2), a statement made by a party-opponent is not considered hearsay and is admissible as evidence. In this case, the defendant's statement to the FBI investigator can be used against her as a statement of an opposing party. This rule applies regardless of whether the statement was made during negotiations for settlement of a criminal investigation or not. However, it's important to note that the admissibility of evidence is subject to various other rules and considerations, such as relevance, materiality, and potential prejudice."
