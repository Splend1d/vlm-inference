Since we have a write-through policy, every time a write operation occurs, it is immediately written to main memory as well as into the cache.\n\nLet's analyze the accesses:\n- Array A has 256 elements of 4 bytes each, so it occupies 1024 bytes. Given the first element starts at address 4096, and since the cache has an 8-byte block size, the first 8 bytes of A (elements 0 and 1) are mapped to cache line 0, the next 8 bytes (elements 2 and 3) to cache line 1, and so on until the last 8 bytes (elements 254 and 255) which are mapped to cache line 127.\n- Array B has 512 elements of 4 bytes each, so it occupies 2048 bytes. Given the first element starts at address 8192, and again considering the cache's 8-byte block size, the first 8 bytes of B (elements 0 and 1) are also mapped to cache line 0, just like the first 8 bytes of A. Similarly, the rest of B is mapped to the same cache lines as corresponding blocks of A, but shifted by one position because B has twice as many elements as A.\n\nIn this direct-mapped cache, when the loop starts accessing array B, it will cause a miss for every access because B is not in the cache yet. When the first element of B is read into the cache, it will evict the first element of A (which is also mapped to cache line 0). This continues for all elements of B, causing a total of 256 misses (since we're accessing every second element of B).\n\nFor every miss, a new block of B is read into the cache, evicting the corresponding block of A. When the code tries to write back to A, it will find that its data is no longer in the cache due to the eviction caused by reading from B. Thus, each write to A will result in a write-through to main memory, followed by a read from main memory to refill the cache line.\n\nSince there are 256 writes to A, and each write causes a write-through of 4 bytes to main memory, the total number of bytes written to memory will be:\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of writes} \\times \\text{Bytes per write} = 256 \\times 4 = 1024 \\]\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. 1024 bytes."
