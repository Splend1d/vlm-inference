Fragile X syndrome\n\nAnticipation is a genetic phenomenon where the signs and symptoms of a disorder become more severe or appear at an earlier age as the condition is passed from parent to child. This phenomenon is most commonly seen in disorders caused by dynamic mutations, which are changes in the number of repetitive DNA sequences in a gene. Fragile X syndrome, a condition that causes intellectual disability, is one such disorder where anticipation can occur due to expansion of a CGG repeat in the FMR1 gene.\n\nThe other conditions listed (Huntington disease, Marfan syndrome, and cystic fibrosis) do not typically exhibit anticipation in paternal transmission. While Huntington disease does show anticipation, it is not specifically related to paternal transmission, but rather to the expansion of a CAG repeat in the HTT gene regardless of the parent of origin. Marfan syndrome and cystic fibrosis do not generally display anticipation."
