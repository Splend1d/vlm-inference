Wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn Scenario 1, the main character is smuggling illegal substances into a prison and engaging in illicit sales, which is clearly against both legal and moral standards. This action can harm others and contribute to illegal activities.\n\nIn Scenario 2, instructing one's son to turn on the lawnmower before clearing the blades might not be considered morally wrong if it is assumed that the son is old enough and has been properly instructed on how to safely operate and maintain the lawnmower. However, it is generally unsafe to clear the blades while the lawnmower is running, so this could be seen as poor judgment or negligence rather than a moral failing. If the son was not adequately trained, then the parent would be at fault for endangering their child, but this still wouldn't necessarily constitute a moral wrongdoing in the same sense as Scenario 1. The primary concern here would be safety rather than morality."
