Now of fundamental importance to peace studies as a field of research, the creation of journals was not a prominent feature of the peace studies until late in the twentieth century.\n\nThis statement cannot be applied to the initial development of peace studies because the creation of specialized academic journals actually began relatively early in the development of peace studies as an academic discipline. For instance, \"Peace Research Society (International) Newsletter,\" later renamed \"Peace and Change,\" was established in 1976, which is not that late in the twentieth century considering the context of the emergence of peace studies after World War II. Moreover, other journals like \"Journal of Peace Research\" were founded even earlier, in 1964. These publications have played a crucial role in shaping the field by providing a platform for scholars to share their research and engage in academic discourse."
