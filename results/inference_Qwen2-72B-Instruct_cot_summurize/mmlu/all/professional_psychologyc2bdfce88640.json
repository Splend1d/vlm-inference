Erickson was a psychiatrist and psychotherapist known for his innovative use of hypnosis and indirect suggestion in therapy. The technique described in the question could be seen as an example of an \"Ericksonian prescription,\" which often involves giving a patient a seemingly unrelated task to perform in order to indirectly address their problem. In this case, the task of polishing the floors might serve to distract the client from their insomnia and induce physical exhaustion, thereby making it easier for them to fall back asleep. This approach is not necessarily related to the work of Luigia Boscolo, Salvador Minuchin, or Marquis de Sade."
