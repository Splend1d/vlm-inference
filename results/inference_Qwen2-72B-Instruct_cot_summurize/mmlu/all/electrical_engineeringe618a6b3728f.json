This theorem allows us to calculate the response (voltage or current) due to each individual source by considering all other sources as inactive (replacing voltage sources with short circuits and current sources with open circuits), and then summing up these individual responses.\n\nGiven that all the elements in the network are linear, the superposition theorem would hold for any type of excitation. Therefore, it does not matter whether the excitation is direct current (DC), alternating current (AC), or an impulse; the principle will still apply as long as the network's components are linear.\n\nHence, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Either AC or DC\n\nThis also implicitly includes the possibility of an impulse, which could be considered a special case of either AC or DC depending on how one defines the impulse in terms of frequency content and duration. However, the options provided do not explicitly include \"an impulse\" as a separate category from AC and DC. In practical engineering terms, an impulse can indeed be treated using superposition if the network is linear."
