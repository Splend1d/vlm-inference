It is an aptitude test that measures various abilities such as verbal, quantitative, abstract reasoning, spelling, and mechanical comprehension, which can be useful for educational and vocational guidance but is not designed to detect malingering or assess symptom validity.\n\nIn contrast, the other options listed are commonly used in psychological assessments to evaluate whether a person may be exaggerating or fabricating symptoms:\n\nA. Test of Memory Malingering (TOMM) is specifically designed to identify individuals who are feigning memory impairment.\n\nC. Recognition Memory Test (RMT) can also be used to assess the validity of reported memory problems.\n\nD. Personality Assessment Inventory (PAI) includes scales that can help detect over-reporting of symptoms or malingering."
