We are asked to determine which of the provided options (A, B, C, D) must be a factor of the number.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. 4 = \\(2^2\\)\nThis is not necessarily a factor because although 2 is a prime factor of the number, it doesn't necessarily appear more than once in its prime factorization. Hence, 4 may or may not be a factor.\n\nB. 6 = \\(2 \\times 3\\)\nThis cannot be a factor since 3 is not listed among the prime factors of the number.\n\nC. 10 = \\(2 \\times 5\\)\nBoth 2 and 5 are prime factors of the number. Since every number that includes all the prime factors of another number (in this case, 2 and 5) as its factors will also be divisible by that other number, 10 must be a factor of the number.\n\nD. 15 = \\(3 \\times 5\\)\nThis cannot be a factor since 3 is not listed among the prime factors of the number.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **C. 10**."
