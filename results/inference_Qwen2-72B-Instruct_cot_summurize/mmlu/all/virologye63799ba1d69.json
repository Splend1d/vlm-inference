Both MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) and SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) are coronaviruses that have caused thousands of deaths around the world as emergent viruses. However, it's worth noting that the most recent and deadly emergent coronavirus is SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19 and has resulted in millions of deaths globally since it was first identified in late 2019. OC43 and HKU1 are also human coronaviruses, but they typically cause only mild respiratory illness in humans and have not been associated with large-scale outbreaks or significant mortality."
