When the investor's title search revealed the above language in the grantee section of the deed to the woman, the investor refused to close the transaction. The contract was silent as to the woman's title obligation. The woman has sued the investor for specific performance. Who is likely to prevail?\n\nA. The investor, because the woman cannot sell the land during the 10-year period specified in the deed.\nB. The investor, because the woman's heirs did not join in the contract.\nC. The woman, because the contract did not obligate her to provide marketable title.\nD. The woman, because the deed's restraint on transfer is void as a matter of law.\n"

The woman, because the deed's restraint on transfer is void as a matter of law.\n\nRestraints on alienation (the right to transfer property) are generally disfavored in law. A provision that completely prohibits the sale or transfer of property for a specific period may be considered void as an unreasonable restraint on alienation. The courts often hold that such restraints violate public policy because they interfere with the free transferability of property. Therefore, the clause in the deed that attempts to prevent the woman from selling the land for 10 years is likely unenforceable, and the woman can sue for specific performance against the investor who refuses to close the transaction based on that clause."
