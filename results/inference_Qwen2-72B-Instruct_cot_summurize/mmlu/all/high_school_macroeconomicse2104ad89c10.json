It does not include cyclical unemployment, which is caused by fluctuations in the business cycle. However, it's important to note that during periods of economic stability, the natural rate of unemployment can be considered as including structural, frictional, and a minimal level of cyclical unemployment. The answer D might seem correct based on this broader interpretation, but according to traditional economic theory, the natural rate of unemployment is primarily attributed to structural and frictional factors."
