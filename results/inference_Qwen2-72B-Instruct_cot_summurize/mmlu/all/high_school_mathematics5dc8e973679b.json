There are 3 ways to do this.\n\nAfter selecting one of these, John needs to choose 3 more marbles from the remaining 9 (since he started with 12 and has already chosen 1). The number of ways to choose 3 marbles from 9 is given by the combination formula \\(C(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\\), where \\(n\\) is the total number of items to choose from, \\(k\\) is the number of items to choose, and \"!\" denotes factorial, which is the product of all positive integers up to that number.\n\nSo, the number of ways to choose 3 marbles from 9 is:\n\n\\[C(9, 3) = \\frac{9!}{3!(9-3)!} = \\frac{9!}{3!6!} = \\frac{9 \\times 8 \\times 7}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 84\\]\n\nSince there are 3 ways to choose one of the special marbles and for each of those choices, there are 84 ways to choose the other 3 marbles, the total number of ways John can choose 4 marbles with exactly one being red, green, or blue is:\n\n\\[3 \\times 84 = 252\\]\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. 252."
