Which of the following statement best explains how the resistant mosquitoes arose?\n\nA. Some mosquitoes experienced a mutation after being exposed to DDT that made them resistant to the insecticide. Then their population expanded because these moquitoes had no competition.\nB. Some mosquitoes were already resistant to DDT when DDT was first sprayed. Then their population expanded because all the susceptible mosquitoes had been exterminated.\nC. DDT is generally a very effective insecticide. One can only conclude that it was manufactured improperly.\nD. Although DDT is effective against a wide range of insects, it is not effective against mosquitoes.\n"

Then their population expanded because all the susceptible mosquitoes had been exterminated.\n\nThis explanation aligns with the concept of natural selection. Before the introduction of DDT, there would have been a small number of mosquitoes with a genetic variation that provided resistance to DDT. When DDT was sprayed, it killed off the majority of the mosquito population that lacked resistance, leaving behind mostly those mosquitoes that were resistant. These resistant mosquitoes then bred and passed on their resistant genes, leading to an increase in the proportion of resistant individuals in the population."
