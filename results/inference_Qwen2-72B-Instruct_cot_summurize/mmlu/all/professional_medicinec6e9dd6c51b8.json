The pain began after the patient lifted a heavy box onto his truck. He rates his current pain as an 8 on a 10-point scale. He has been unable to find a comfortable position and has been sleeping in a recliner. Medical history is unremarkable and he takes no medications. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for the past 25 years, and he drinks a six-pack of beer on Friday and Saturday nights. BMI is 27 kg/m2 . He appears uncomfortable and stands during the physical examination. Vital signs are normal. Straight-leg raise test is positive on the right, with loss of right ankle reflex. The remainder of the physical examination discloses no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for this patient\u2019s symptoms?\n\nA. Displacement of the nucleus pulposus\nB. Hypertrophy of the facet joints\nC. Osteophyte formation\nD. Spondylolisthesis\n"

This condition can cause severe lower back pain that radiates down the leg, often due to compression or irritation of a spinal nerve root. The straight-leg raise test being positive and the loss of right ankle reflex also support this diagnosis. The other options listed (hypertrophy of the facet joints, osteophyte formation, and spondylolisthesis) can also cause back pain, but they typically do not present with such a clear pattern of radicular pain and neurological deficits."
