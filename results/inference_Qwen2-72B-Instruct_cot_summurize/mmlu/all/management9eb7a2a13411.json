The primary skills involved in planning as a management function include conceptual skills, analytical skills, and communication skills. These enable managers to understand complex situations, analyze information effectively, and communicate plans and strategies to their team. IT and computing skills might aid in data analysis or using software tools but are not fundamental to the planning process itself."
