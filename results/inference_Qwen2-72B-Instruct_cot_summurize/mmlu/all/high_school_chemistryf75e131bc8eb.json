Oxygen, chromium: Oxygen is in Group 16 and Period 2, while chromium is in Group 6 and Period 4. Oxygen is further right and higher up than chromium, so oxygen has a higher electronegativity.\n\nB. Chlorine, iodine: Both chlorine and iodine are in Group 17, but chlorine is in Period 3 and iodine is in Period 5. Since electronegativity decreases as you move down a group, chlorine has a higher electronegativity than iodine.\n\nC. Calcium, cesium: Both calcium and cesium are in Group 2, but calcium is in Period 4 and cesium is in Period 6. Again, since electronegativity decreases as you move down a group, calcium has a higher electronegativity than cesium.\n\nD. Sulfur, nitrogen: Sulfur is in Group 16 and Period 3, while nitrogen is in Group 15 and Period 2. Although sulfur is further right than calcium (in C), nitrogen is higher up and further left than sulfur. Since nitrogen is both higher up and to the left of sulfur, it actually has a higher electronegativity due to its position being closer to the top right corner of the periodic table where electronegativity is highest.\n\nThus, the pair with the second element having the larger electronegativity based on its position in the periodic table is:\n\nD. Sulfur, nitrogen"
