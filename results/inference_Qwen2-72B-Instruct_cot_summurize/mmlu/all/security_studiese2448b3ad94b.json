While it's true that within the Historical Materialism (HM) or Marxist paradigm, social class is a crucial concept, it would be an oversimplification to state that \"the only form of class that matters is social class.\" HM recognizes different forms of class divisions based on one's relationship to the means of production. For instance, there are distinctions made between the bourgeoisie (capitalist class), proletariat (working class), and other classes like the petty bourgeoisie. Moreover, within HM, class analysis also takes into account the historical development of these classes and their relationships. Therefore, while social class is indeed central, it is not the only form of class that matters."
