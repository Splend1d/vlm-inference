In a collision, the forces experienced by both objects are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction (Newton's third law). Therefore, if the truck has double the mass of the car, then for the same force applied during the collision, the acceleration of the less massive object (the car) will be greater than that of the more massive object (the truck). Specifically, since the truck's mass is double the car's mass, the car will experience an acceleration that is double that of the truck's, but in the opposite direction due to the opposing forces.\n\nSo the correct answer is:\n\nB. double the magnitude and in the opposite direction"
