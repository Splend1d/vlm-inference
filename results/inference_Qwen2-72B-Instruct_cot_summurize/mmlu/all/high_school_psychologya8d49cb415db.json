In Alzheimer's disease, there is a significant loss of cholinergic neurons, leading to reduced levels of acetylcholine in the brain. This has been implicated in the cognitive deficits seen in patients with Alzheimer's disease. While acetylcholine also plays a role in other neurological conditions, the strongest association with a deficiency of this neurotransmitter is with Alzheimer's disease."
