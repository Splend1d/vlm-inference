The contract stipulated that the work had to be completed by December 1 (the anticipated opening date for the resort), and that the electrician would be paid $5,000 upon completion of the job. Before accepting the job, the electrician had inspected the property and determined that 500 lighting fixtures would be needed to adequately light the pathways. By November 15, the electrician had installed 150 lighting fixtures. That evening, the owner inspected the property and discovered that the lighting fixtures installed by the electrician did not provide adequate lighting. The next day, the owner immediately discharged the electrician and hired a lighting specialist to complete the installation work at $20 per fixture. The lighting specialist installed the remaining 350 fixtures, completing the work on December 1. The electrician filed suit against the owner. If it is determined that the owner was legally justified in discharging the electrician, which of the following is the electrician's proper measure of recovery?\n\nA. $7,000. 00\nB. $3,500. 00\nC. Quantum meruit for the reasonable value of his services rendered in installing the 150 fixtures.\nD. Nothing, because the electrician did not complete performance of the entire job.\n"

                    "text": "If the owner was legally justified in discharging the electrician due to the electrician's failure to meet the contractual requirements for the quality of the work performed, the electrician would typically be entitled to compensation for the work actually done that has some value, but not necessarily the full contract price. This principle is known as quantum meruit, which is Latin for \"as much as he deserves.\" Quantum meruit allows a party to recover the reasonable value of their services when a contract has been terminated or where no contract exists.\n\nIn this case, the electrician installed 150 lighting fixtures before being discharged. He may be entitled to compensation for those fixtures based on their reasonable value, even if he did not complete the job as specified in the original contract. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Quantum meruit for the reasonable value of his services rendered in installing the 150 fixtures.\n\nThe exact amount of this compensation would depend on the determination of what is considered the reasonable value of the services provided, which might involve assessing the cost of materials used, labor involved, and any other relevant factors. It could potentially be less than the proportionate share of the total contract price ($5,000) since the work did not meet the contract specifications, but it would likely be more than nothing, as option D suggests. Without specific information on the cost per fixture or the value of the electrician's labor, we cannot calculate the exact amount, so options A and B are not applicable."
