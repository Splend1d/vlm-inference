This is a normal process that occurs in the body. However, excess free radicals can damage cells and contribute to aging and health problems such as cancer and heart disease. Vitamins A and C are actually antioxidants that help to neutralize free radicals, so excess consumption of these vitamins would not increase free radical production. Lack of sunlight and a weakened immune system do not directly lead to increased free radical production."
