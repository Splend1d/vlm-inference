                    "text": "The emission spectrum of an atom is determined by the energy levels of its electrons. The energy of an electron in the nth level of a hydrogen-like atom can be given by the formula:\n\n\\[E_n = -\\frac{RZ^2}{n^2}\\]\n\nwhere \\(R\\) is the Rydberg constant, \\(Z\\) is the atomic number, and \\(n\\) is the principal quantum number.\n\nFor hydrogen (\\(Z=1\\)) and doubly ionized lithium (\\(Z=3\\)), the energy levels will be related by the factor \\(Z^2\\). Since the energy difference between two levels determines the wavelength of the emitted photon (with higher energy corresponding to shorter wavelengths), we can see how the wavelengths compare.\n\nIf we take the ratio of the wavelengths for hydrogen (\\(\\lambda_H\\)) and lithium (\\(\\lambda_{Li}\\)):\n\n\\[\\frac{\\lambda_H}{\\lambda_{Li}} = \\frac{\\frac{hc}{E_{nH}}}{\\frac{hc}{E_{nLi}}} = \\frac{E_{nLi}}{E_{nH}} = \\frac{\\frac{R(3)^2}{n^2}}{\\frac{R(1)^2}{n^2}} = \\frac{9}{1} = 9\\]\n\nThis means that for the same transition between energy levels, the wavelength in hydrogen is 9 times longer than in doubly ionized lithium. Therefore, the wavelengths in the emission spectrum of doubly ionized lithium are decreased by a factor of 9 compared to hydrogen.\n\nSo the correct answer is:\n\nA. decreased by a factor of 9"
