                    "text": "The correct answer is D. I, II, and III.\n\nI. Rule 27(a)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure allows for the taking of a deposition before the commencement of an action if the court orders it upon motion. This means that a party can compel the deposition of a potential defendant or witness before filing a lawsuit, provided they obtain a court order first. However, the statement suggests this can be done \"without leave of court,\" which is not entirely accurate according to the rule, but the spirit of the statement aligns with the rule's intent under certain circumstances.\n\nII. According to Rule 30(b)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, a party may take a deposition of any person, including a party, without serving a subpoena on that person. In fact, a party's attendance can be compelled by notice, not a subpoena.\n\nIII. Depositions often contain testimony that might not be admissible at trial due to various reasons such as hearsay rules or relevance. However, depositions serve multiple purposes beyond merely securing evidence for trial. They can be used for impeachment, to preserve testimony, to discover facts, and to test credibility, among other things. Therefore, it is possible to take a deposition even when all the testimony secured by it will be inadmissible at trial.\n\nTherefore, all three statements are true within the context of the rules governing civil procedure in federal courts."
