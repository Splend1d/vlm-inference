Transform data to zero mean\n\nPrincipal Component Analysis (PCA) and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) are related techniques used for dimensionality reduction and data analysis, but they operate under different assumptions and conditions. When applying PCA, it is essential to center the data (make its mean equal to zero) before performing the decomposition. This step ensures that the covariance matrix accurately represents the variance and covariance structure of the data.\n\nIn contrast, SVD can be applied directly to the data matrix without requiring prior centering. However, when using SVD for PCA-like projections, it's common practice to center the data first, making option A correct. By doing so, the first left singular vector of the SVD corresponds to the direction of maximum variance in the centered data, which aligns with the goal of PCA."
