It would have involved compromising opposition to slavery.\n\nAbraham Lincoln opposed the southward expansion of the United States because it would have meant the expansion of slavery, which he and many in the Republican Party were strongly against. The issue of slavery was a major point of contention between the North and South leading up to the Civil War. Lincoln believed that allowing slavery to expand into new territories would make it more difficult to eventually abolish the institution altogether. Therefore, his opposition to the expansion of the US southward was rooted in his commitment to limiting the spread of slavery."
