Therefore, the correct answer would be:\n\nC. a moral sense that is universal in our species.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that Hume's view of morality is complex and involves both sentiment and reasoning. He suggests that while reason plays a role in guiding us to act morally by informing us about the facts of situations, our approval or disapproval of actions ultimately comes from sentiment or feeling. This sentiment is what he refers to as the \"moral sense,\" which he believes is shared by all humans and allows for the possibility of objective moral judgments based on shared human sentiments."
