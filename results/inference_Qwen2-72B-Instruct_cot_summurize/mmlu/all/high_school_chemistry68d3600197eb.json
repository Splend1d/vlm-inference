One method begins by heating a solid or liquid in a flask to produce a gaseous product. The gas passes through a tube and displaces water in an inverted, water-filled bottle. The mass of the starting material is measured, along with the volume of the displaced water and the temperature of the system. The pressure in the inverted water-filled bottle is equal to the external pressure. Once the barometric pressure has been recorded, what other information is needed to finish the experiment?\n\nA. The heat of formation of the gas\nB. The density of the water\nC. The mass of the displaced water\nD. The vapor pressure of the water\n"

The vapor pressure of the water.\n\nTo determine the molecular mass of the gas produced, you need to know the number of moles of the gas and its mass. The volume of the gas can be determined from the volume of the water it displaced, but to find the number of moles of the gas, you need to apply the ideal gas law:\n\n\\[PV = nRT\\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\(P\\) is the pressure,\n- \\(V\\) is the volume,\n- \\(n\\) is the number of moles,\n- \\(R\\) is the gas constant,\n- \\(T\\) is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nThe pressure inside the bottle will be the sum of the atmospheric pressure (barometric pressure) and the vapor pressure of the water at the given temperature. This is because the gas and the water vapor in the bottle are in equilibrium, so the total pressure is due to both the gas and the water vapor. Therefore, you need to subtract the vapor pressure of the water from the barometric pressure to get the partial pressure of the gas alone.\n\nOnce you have the partial pressure of the gas, the volume of the gas, and the temperature, you can use the ideal gas law to calculate the number of moles of the gas. Knowing the mass of the starting material allows you to calculate the mass of the gas produced (assuming you know the stoichiometry of the reaction), and then you can divide the mass of the gas by the number of moles to find the molar mass."
