President Abraham Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation, issued on January 1, 1863, declared free only those slaves who were living in the areas still in rebellion against the United States during the Civil War. This proclamation did not immediately free any slaves in the border states that remained loyal to the Union or in the areas already under Union control. It was a war measure designed to weaken the Confederacy and to prevent European nations from recognizing or assisting the Confederate cause."
