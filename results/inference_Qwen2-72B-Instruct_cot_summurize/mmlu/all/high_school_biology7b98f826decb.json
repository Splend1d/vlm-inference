The individual with type B blood has either BB or BO as their genotype (with BO being more likely since type O is the most common blood type). The individual with type AB blood has an AB genotype.\n\nTo have a child with type O blood, both parents must pass on an O allele to the child. However, the parent with type AB blood does not carry an O allele, so they cannot pass one on to the child. Therefore, it's impossible for this couple to have a child with type O blood.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nA. 0%"
