The woman's sister owns parcel \"C,\" which lies the lowest on the mountain. Parcel \"B\" lies between Parcels \"A\" andIn 2000, the woman who originally owned all three parcels of land constructed a private drainage system. This system consisted of an underground pipeline that extended across all three parcels of land. Sewage from parcel \"A\" drained through the system to a municipal sewer, which was located at the bottom of the mountain. In 2005, the sister purchased parcel \"C\" from the woman. The deed to the sister did not contain any mention of the woman's drainage system. Located on each of the parcels are large ranch-style homes occupied by the respective owners. A portion of the sister's unimproved land began to subside over the drainage system. This was because of an especially pliable soil condition of which the woman was unaware prior to construction of the drainage system. In an action brought by the sister against the woman to recover property damage for the subsidence of her land, judgment should be for whom?\n\nA. The sister, because she is entitled to lateral support for her land in its natural condition.\nB. The sister, because she is entitled to subjacent support for her land in its natural condition.\nC. The sister, because she is entitled to support for her land in its improved condition.\nD. The woman, unless she sister proves that the woman was negligent in constructing the drainage system.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer would be A. The sister, because she is entitled to lateral support for her land in its natural condition.\n\nLateral support refers to the right of a landowner to have their land supported laterally by adjacent lands. When a landowner excavates or alters their land in a way that causes damage to the adjacent land due to lack of support, they may be liable for damages. In this case, the sister's land has begun to subside due to the construction of the drainage system by the woman, which has affected the natural support structure of the soil. Since the sister's deed did not contain any mention of the drainage system, it can be argued that she was not aware of the potential impact on her land and is therefore entitled to recover damages for the subsidence caused by the lack of lateral support. \n\nIt is important to note that the answer may vary depending on the specific laws and legal precedents in the jurisdiction where the properties are located. However, based on the information provided in the question, option A appears to be the most likely answer."
