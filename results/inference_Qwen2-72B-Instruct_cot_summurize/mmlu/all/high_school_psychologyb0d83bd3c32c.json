This theory would reasonably explain options A, B, and C since each describes a scenario where an individual is motivated by a need (thirst, hunger) to perform an action (drink water, eat cookies, skip lunch).\n\nHowever, option D presents a scenario where drive-reduction theory might not provide a reasonable explanation. Kezia is already full after eating dinner, so her decision to order dessert does not seem to be driven by a need to reduce hunger. Instead, her decision could be explained by other factors, such as the desire for pleasure, social reasons, or psychological motivations. Therefore, drive-reduction theories would not provide a reasonable explanation for this scenario.\n\nThe answer is:\n\nD. Kezia is very full after eating dinner but decides to order the strawberry cheesecake anyway."
