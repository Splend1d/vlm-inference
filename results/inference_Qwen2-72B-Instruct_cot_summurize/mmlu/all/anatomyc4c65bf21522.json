This action prevents food and liquid from entering the airway and ensures that they pass into the esophagus instead. The upward movement of the epiglottis is part of the pharyngeal phase of swallowing, which is a complex process involving multiple muscles and coordinated movements to ensure safe passage of food to the stomach."
