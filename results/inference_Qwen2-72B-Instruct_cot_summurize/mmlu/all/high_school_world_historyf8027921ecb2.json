That quantum jump would have to be made before the various scientific, technological, agricultural, and industrial revolutions on which our post-quantum-leap world rests. It could only be accomplished by exploiting the ecosystems, mineral resources, and human assets of whole continents outside the lands of the society making the jump. Western Europe did just that by means of its brutality and guns and, more important, by geographical and ecological luck.\"\nCopyright \u00a9 2015 Cambridge University Press.\nAlfred Crosby, historian, Ecological Imperialism, 2004\nCrosby's argument in the passage is most likely a response to which of the following developments of the period 1450\u20131750 C.E.?\n\nA.

The colonization of North and South America by Western Europeans\n\nCrosby's argument about exploiting the ecosystems, mineral resources, and human assets of whole continents aligns with the colonization and exploitation of the Americas by Western Europeans during the period from 1450 to 1750 C.E. This era saw the establishment of colonies, the extraction of vast amounts of gold and silver, and the use of indigenous and African slave labor to cultivate cash crops like sugar, tobacco, and cotton. These activities significantly contributed to the wealth and power of European nations, enabling them to make the \"quantum leap\" in productivity that Crosby describes."
