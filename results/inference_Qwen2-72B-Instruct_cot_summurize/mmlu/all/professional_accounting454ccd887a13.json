Perform alternative procedures to verify account balances.\n\nUpon discovering that a material portion of the accounts receivable was not confirmed during the audit, the CPA should first perform alternative audit procedures to verify the accuracy and completeness of the account balances. This could include reviewing subsequent cash receipts, examining sales invoices and shipping documents, and performing analytical procedures. Once the additional testing has been completed, the CPA can then determine if there are any necessary adjustments to the financial statements and discuss these findings with client management. If the issue is significant enough, the CPA may need to consider the implications for the audit opinion and communicate with the board of directors or audit committee. However, the immediate action should be to perform additional audit procedures to assess the impact of the omitted confirmations."
