These attributes combine to determine how much attention an organization should pay to a particular stakeholder or group of stakeholders. Power refers to the perceived ability of a stakeholder to influence organizational action; legitimacy refers to whether the organization perceives the stakeholder's actions as desirable, proper, and appropriate; and urgency refers to the immediacy of attention the stakeholder claims require. The combination of these attributes determines the overall salience of the stakeholder to the organization."
