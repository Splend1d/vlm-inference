While the woman was away on a vacation, there was a burglary at her home, and her favorite painting was stolen. Although the painting was insured for $1,000,000 by an insurance company, it had a market value of over $1,500,000. When the woman returned from vacation, she met with a detective employed by the insurance company to investigate the theft. During their meeting, the woman told the detective that she would pay him an extra $50,000 if he recovered the paihting. For the next three weeks, the detective investigated the theft as part of his job responsibilities with the insurance company. Within the course of this investigation, the detective learned who was responsible for the burglary. As a consequence, the culprit was apprehended, and the painting was recovered and returned to the woman. The detective then requested the $50,000 that the woman had promised to pay him. After the woman refused to make the payment, the detective sued the woman for breach of contract. Who is most likely to prevail?\n\nA. The woman, because her promise was gratuitous.\nB. The woman, because the insurance company owed her a pre-existing duty to find the painting.\nC. The detective, because he did the act necessary to constitute an acceptance of the woman's offer.\nD. The detective, because the market value of the painting exceeded its insured value, so there was sufficient consideration to support the woman's promise.\n"

                    "text": "The detective is most likely to prevail in this case. The reason being that the detective took specific action in reliance on the woman's promise to pay him an additional $50,000 if he recovered the painting. By successfully recovering the painting, the detective fulfilled the condition set forth in the woman's offer, which constitutes an acceptance of that offer. Therefore, a binding contract was formed between the woman and the detective, and the woman is obligated to fulfill her end of the bargain by paying the detective the promised amount.\n\nOption C is the closest answer, but it can be argued that option D also supports the detective's position since the market value of the painting exceeding its insured value could be seen as additional benefit or consideration accruing to the woman, which might have influenced her decision to offer the extra payment. However, the primary reason for the detective's likely success in the lawsuit is his fulfillment of the condition set by the woman's offer, making option C the most accurate choice."
