The group was traversing a mountainous path when a mountain lion suddenly appeared. The defendant, who was carrying a loaded gun, knew that mountain lions and coyotes were in the area. The defendant saw that the mountain lion was about to attack one of the hikers. Although the defendant could have easily shot and killed it, he did nothing. The wild animal pounced on the hiker. As she was being savaged, the defendant and the other members of the group ran to safety.\nB. A defendant, a registered nurse, asked her friend out to lunch. While eating, the friend suddenly began choking on a chicken bone. The defendant did nothing to help her friend. The friend choked to death.\nC. A defendant, a physician, was walking home from his office one afternoon when he saw a car hit a man who was trying to cross the street. The victim was knocked to the ground and seriously injured, while the car sped away. The defendant, who could have saved the man's life if he had treated him, continued walking home without rendering assistance. The man died from loss of blood.\nD. A defendant took his four-year-old daughter out in the yard to play. As they were playing catch, the telephone began to ring. The defendant ran into the house to answer the phone. While he was inside, the daughter's ball rolled into the street. As she went to retrieve it, the daughter was struck and killed by a car.\n"

In this scenario, the defendant, the father, had a duty of care towards his young daughter, and his negligence in leaving her unsupervised in an environment where she could come to harm (near a street) resulted in her death. This negligence can be considered gross enough to warrant a charge of manslaughter.\n\nIn contrast:\n- In situation A, the defendant may not be guilty of manslaughter because he had no legal duty to protect the hiker from a wild animal attack, and his decision not to shoot the mountain lion does not rise to the level of criminal negligence.\n- In situation B, the defendant may not be guilty of manslaughter because there is no legal duty for a person to save another's life in a non-professional setting unless there is a special relationship or the defendant created the peril.\n- In situation C, the defendant may not be guilty of manslaughter because, although it would have been ethical for the physician to stop and help, there is generally no legal duty for a medical professional to provide emergency care outside of their professional capacity unless there is a specific law requiring it or the physician created the peril. However, some jurisdictions do have Good Samaritan laws that might impose such a duty under certain circumstances."
