The balanced budget multiplier\n\nThe balanced budget multiplier refers to the situation where an increase in government spending is exactly offset by an increase in taxes. In this scenario, the overall effect on the economy is neutral, and the multiplier is equal to one. This means that if the government increases spending by $1 and also increases taxes by $1, the net effect on the aggregate demand will be zero, assuming no other changes occur.\n\nA. The elasticity of the long-run aggregate supply curve is not equal to one; it is typically considered vertical or perfectly inelastic.\nB. The spending (or expenditure) multiplier is greater than one because it reflects the cumulative impact of an initial change in spending through subsequent rounds of spending.\nC. The money (or banking) multiplier is also generally greater than one because it reflects how an initial deposit can lead to a larger final increase in the total money supply through the fractional-reserve banking system."
