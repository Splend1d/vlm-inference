Whenever it is impossible to determine whether a change in accounting estimate or a change in accounting principle has occurred, the change should be considered a change in estimate.\n\nThis is because changes in accounting estimates are typically accounted for prospectively, meaning that they affect the financial statements from the date of the change forward, whereas changes in accounting principles may require retrospective application, affecting prior periods' financial statements. When it's unclear whether the change is due to a new estimate or a new principle, it's treated conservatively as a change in estimate, which does not require restating prior periods."
