Spending time working on important documents is not generally considered a morally wrong act.\n\nIn scenario 2, shooting a hole in a man's ear during gun practice would be considered morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. This action could cause serious harm or even death and is not an acceptable outcome of gun practice. It is important to note that this answer assumes that the shooting was not accidental and that the person who pulled the trigger did so with intent or reckless disregard for the safety of others. If the shooting was accidental and all proper safety protocols were followed, then the situation may be more complex and could potentially involve issues of negligence rather than intentional harm. However, based on the information provided in the scenario, it seems that the action would be considered morally wrong."
