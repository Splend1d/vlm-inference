Shows a logical progression from egocentric thought to broad moral principles\n\nAccording to Lawrence Kohlberg's theory of moral development, morality does indeed develop through a series of stages that progress from more egocentric and self-focused reasoning to broader, more socially-oriented principles. This progression is not necessarily independent of outside influence (option A is incorrect), as the stages are influenced by socialization and experiences. Kohlberg also believed that morality can be rationalized at each stage (making option B incorrect) and did not necessarily view it as completely independent from emotion (making option C incorrect). However, his primary focus was on the cognitive aspects of moral reasoning rather than the emotional components."
