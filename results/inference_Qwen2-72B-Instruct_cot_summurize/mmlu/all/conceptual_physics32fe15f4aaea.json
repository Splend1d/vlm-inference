In its basic form, a galvanometer is used to measure electric current. To measure voltage, it needs to be connected in series with a high resistance known as a \"voltage multiplier\" or \"resistance box.\" This configuration turns the galvanometer into a voltmeter.\n\nSo the correct answer is:\n\nC.
