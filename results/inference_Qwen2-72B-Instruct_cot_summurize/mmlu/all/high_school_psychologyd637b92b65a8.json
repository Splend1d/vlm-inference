This is due to a phenomenon called color opponent processing, which is part of how our visual system works. Essentially, after staring at a bright color for an extended period, the photoreceptors in the retina that are sensitive to that color become fatigued. When you look away, your brain compensates by producing the complementary color (green in this case for yellow) as an afterimage."
