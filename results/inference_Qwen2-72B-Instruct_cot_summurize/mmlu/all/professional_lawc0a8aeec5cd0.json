A group of five demonstrators who wanted to protest inadequate state funding for children's services applied for a permit to march single file on the sidewalk surrounding the capitol building. Each demonstrator planned to carry a two-foot-square sign that would read, \"Our lawmakers do not care about our children.\" The group's permit application was denied pursuant to the state law, and the group has filed an action challenging the law's constitutionality. Should the court uphold the law's constitutionality?\n\nA. No, because even though the sidewalk at issue is not a public forum, the prohibition against the display of signs is more restrictive than needed to serve a legitimate government interest. government interest.\nB. No, because the sidewalk at issue is a public forum, and the prohibition against the display of signs is not narrowly tailored to serve a substantial government interest.\nC. Yes, because even though the sidewalk at issue is a public forum, the prohibition against the display of signs is necessary to serve a compelling public interest.\nD. Yes, because the sidewalk at issue is not a public forum, and the prohibition against the display of signs is reasonable.\n"

No, because the sidewalk at issue is a public forum, and the prohibition against the display of signs is not narrowly tailored to serve a substantial government interest.\n\nThe sidewalk surrounding the capitol building is considered a traditional public forum where individuals have a strong First Amendment right to engage in expressive activities, including demonstrations and the use of signs. For a content-neutral restriction on speech in a public forum to be constitutional, it must be narrowly tailored to serve a significant government interest and leave open ample alternative channels for communication. The law in question appears to be a blanket prohibition without regard to time, place, and manner considerations, which could be seen as overly broad and not narrowly tailored to achieve the state's goal of preserving the appearance and accessibility of the capitol building. Therefore, the court should likely find the law unconstitutional as it stands."
