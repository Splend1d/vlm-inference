While it is true that the Supreme Court receives a large number of petitions for writs of certiorari each year and grants a relatively small percentage of them, typically fewer than 5%, the other statements are not accurate:\n\nB. The Supreme Court does often grant writs of certiorari to resolve circuit splits (disagreements between different federal circuit courts on a point of law), but this is not the only reason they do so. They may also take cases to address important constitutional questions or to review decisions that conflict with established precedent.\n\nC. Denial of a writ of certiorari by the Supreme Court does not overturn the lower court's ruling; rather, it leaves the lower court's decision in place as the final ruling in the case.\n\nD. Anyone can petition for a writ of certiorari; it is not exclusive to the solicitor general. However, the solicitor general does represent the federal government in cases before the Supreme Court and may file briefs expressing the government's position on whether certiorari should be granted in certain cases."
