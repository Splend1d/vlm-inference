It is a restriction enzyme extracted from E. coli.\n\nEcoR1 (also written as EcoRI) is a type of restriction enzyme that is isolated from the bacteria Escherichia coli. It is widely used in molecular biology and genetic engineering to cut DNA at specific sequences known as recognition sites. The enzyme is particularly useful for cloning purposes because it generates sticky ends that can be ligated together with other DNA fragments that have compatible ends."
