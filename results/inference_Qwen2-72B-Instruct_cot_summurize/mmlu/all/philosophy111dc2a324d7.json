Firstly, it may not be practical to provide every participant with all the detailed information about the study due to complexity or sheer volume of data (Option A). Secondly, in some cases, researchers may choose to withhold certain pieces of information if revealing them could influence the study's outcomes, such as if participants alter their behavior knowing they are being observed (Option C). This is known as the Hawthorne effect. Additionally, withholding details like the exact duration of an interview might be necessary to prevent influencing participants' responses or behaviors (Option B). However, it is crucial to balance these considerations with ethical standards, ensuring that no critical information that could affect a participant's decision to consent is withheld without strong justification."
