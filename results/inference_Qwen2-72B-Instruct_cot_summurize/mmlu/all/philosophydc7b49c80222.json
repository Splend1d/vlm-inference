Hare was a proponent of prescriptivism in meta-ethics, which holds that moral statements are prescriptions or recommendations, not factual claims. According to Hare's view, once two people agree on the meaning of \"ought,\" their disagreements over what one ought to do would be reducible to disagreements over the facts of the situation, not over the meaning of the moral terms themselves. This is because Hare believed that moral terms like \"ought\" have universal meanings and are not merely expressions of personal preferences or inclinations."
