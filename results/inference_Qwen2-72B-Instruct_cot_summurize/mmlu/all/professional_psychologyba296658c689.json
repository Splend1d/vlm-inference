This concept is often referred to as the \"four-fifths rule\" in employment testing, where if the rate of selection for any race, sex, or ethnic group is less than four-fifths (or 80%) of the rate for the group with the highest rate of selection, this may be evidence of adverse impact. However, it's important to note that absence of adverse impact doesn't necessarily mean the test is free from bias or that it's fair, but rather that it appears neutral based on these results."
