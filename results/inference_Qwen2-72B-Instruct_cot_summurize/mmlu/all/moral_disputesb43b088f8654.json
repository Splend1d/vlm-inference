It is the recognition that some things matter morally and should be taken into account when making ethical decisions. Moral permissibility refers to whether an action is morally acceptable or not, while viability refers to the ability of something to survive or be successful. Neither of these concepts directly relate to the idea of having moral standing. Therefore, the correct answer is A. moral standing."
