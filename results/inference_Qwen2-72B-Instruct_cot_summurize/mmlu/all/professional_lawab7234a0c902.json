C. training, the student was required to spend three weeks at a camp for Marine Corps. summer field exercises. While at the camp, the student was given a new synthetic helmet to wear during her basic training. An agency purchased the new high-technology helmets for the Army and Marine Corps. to replace the old \"steel pot\" headgear worn for decades by U. S. soldiers. These new synthetic helmets were manufactured by a corporation and were made of Kevlar, an extremely tough fiber material with high energy-absorbing qualities that made it stronger in some ways than steel. When the student received her helmet from the Marine Corps. , it was packaged in the original carton supplied by the corporation. On the box, there was a picture that depicted an off-duty marine wearing the helmet while riding a bicycle. One afternoon after training, the student decided to take a ride on her bicycle. Believing that it could be used as a bicycle helmet, the student decided to use it for that purpose. During the ride, the student hit a deep pothole that caused her to be thrown headfirst from the bicycle. As she was flying through the air, the strap from her helmet came loose, and the helmet fell off her head. The student landed on a lawn and was temporarily knocked unconscious. She suffered serious head injuries. If the student asserts a claim against the corporation to recover damages for her injuries, she will most likely\n\nA. prevail, because under the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur negligence can be inferred from the fact that the helmet came off the student's head.\nB. prevail, because the original package depicted a picture of a cyclist wearing the helmet.\nC. not prevail, because the student was not using the helmet for its intended purpose.\nD. not prevail, because the helmet had been properly designed by the corporation for its intended use by the Army and Marine Corps.\n"

The helmet was designed and manufactured specifically for military use, not as a bicycle helmet. The depiction of an off-duty marine wearing the helmet while riding a bicycle on the packaging does not constitute a representation that the helmet is suitable for civilian cycling or that it meets safety standards for such use.\n\nTherefore, option C is the correct answer: \"not prevail, because the student was not using the helmet for its intended purpose.\" The manufacturer cannot be held liable for injuries resulting from misuse of their product, especially if the product was designed and tested for specific conditions and uses, which in this case would be military combat scenarios rather than civilian cycling.\n\nIt is also worth noting that even if the helmet was intended for military use, the manufacturer might still have a duty to ensure that the product performs safely under normal use conditions. However, using the helmet as a bicycle helmet goes beyond the scope of its intended use, and the manufacturer cannot reasonably anticipate or control how individuals might choose to repurpose their products."
