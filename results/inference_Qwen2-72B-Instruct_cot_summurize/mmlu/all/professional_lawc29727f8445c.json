While he was watching television in his hotel room, a thief picked the lock on the hotel room door, entered, hit the traveler over the head, and stole his wallet. The traveler, who suffered a concussion, was hospitalized for three days. The lock on the hotel room door fully complied with a local ordinance that prescribed minimum security standards for hotel locks. If the injured traveler asserts a claim against the hotel for damages for his injury and loss of his wallet, the traveler will\n\nA. prevail, if the lock was defectively designed.\nB. prevail, because he was a business visitor on the hotel's property.\nC. not prevail, because the thief's act was an intervening cause.\nD. not prevail, if the hotel used reasonable care in selecting the lock.\n"

The criminal act of the third party (the thief) is generally considered a superseding cause that relieves the hotel of liability unless the hotel had reason to know of the likelihood of such an event occurring and failed to take appropriate precautions. Since the question states that the lock was compliant with local regulations, it implies that the hotel took reasonable care in securing the room, which would make option D the most likely answer. However, it's important to note that the specifics of the case and jurisdiction could affect the outcome."
