A DNA sequence that replicates via an RNA intermediate\n\nRetrotransposons are genetic elements that move or replicate within the genome through an RNA intermediate, similar to the mechanism used by retroviruses such as HIV. They are transcribed into RNA, which is then reverse transcribed back into DNA and inserted elsewhere in the genome. This process is known as \"copy-and-paste\" because it results in additional copies of the element being inserted into new locations in the genome."
