As a therapist, it is important to maintain confidentiality and respect the privacy of your client. You should not share any information about Leticia's therapy sessions with her mother without Leticia's consent. Instead, you can suggest that Mrs. Lopez talk to Leticia directly about how she can support her and encourage open communication between them. If Mrs. Lopez would like to be more involved in Leticia's therapy, you could also suggest option D, but only after discussing it with Leticia and obtaining her consent."
