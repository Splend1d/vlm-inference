A diversified and developed economy.\n\nWhile semi-periphery countries may not have economies as diversified or developed as core countries, they usually have more diversified economies than periphery countries, which tend to rely heavily on the export of a single primary commodity. Therefore, option C is the most appropriate choice among the given options."
