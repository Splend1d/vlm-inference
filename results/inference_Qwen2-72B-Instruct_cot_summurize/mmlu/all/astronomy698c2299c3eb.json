The Moon's rotational and orbital periods are equal.\n\nThis phenomenon is called synchronous rotation, which means that the Moon rotates on its axis in the same amount of time it takes to complete one orbit around the Earth. This results in the same side of the Moon always facing the Earth, while the other side always faces away from us. It's important to note that this is not due to the shape of the Moon's orbit or its lack of rotation, but rather the result of gravitational forces between the Earth and the Moon over billions of years."
