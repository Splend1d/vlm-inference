All the above\n\nVoltage Controlled Oscillators (VCOs) are indeed used in all of the applications you've listed:\n\n1. **Pulse Modulators**: VCOs can be used in pulse modulators to create pulses with varying frequencies or to synchronize the pulse repetition rate.\n\n2. **Frequency Modulators**: A VCO is a key component in frequency modulation where the output frequency is varied in accordance with the modulating signal.\n\n3. **Phase-Locked Loops (PLL)**: VCOs are integral to phase-locked loop circuits, which are widely used for frequency synthesis, demodulation, and clock recovery in digital communication systems. The VCO in a PLL adjusts its frequency to match the reference input frequency under the control of the error signal generated by the phase detector.\n\nIn summary, VCOs have versatile applications across various electronic systems due to their ability to vary frequency in response to an input voltage."
