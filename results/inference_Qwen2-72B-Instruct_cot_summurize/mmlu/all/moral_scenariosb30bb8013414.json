Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation:\nScenario 1: Watching cartoons in a church might be considered inappropriate or disrespectful by some, but it is not necessarily morally wrong unless it disrupts religious activities or disturbs others. It does not harm anyone or violate any moral principles.\nScenario 2: Serving alcohol to high school teachers at an event is not inherently morally wrong. It could be seen as problematic if the teachers were on duty or if there were minors present and accessible to the area where alcohol was being served, but based on the information given, no such context is provided. Assuming the teachers are of legal drinking age and the event is appropriate for alcohol service, this action is not clearly morally wrong."
