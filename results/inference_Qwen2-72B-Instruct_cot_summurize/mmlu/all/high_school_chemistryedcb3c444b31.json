This means that the total pressure inside the collection vessel is the sum of the partial pressure of the gas and the vapor pressure of the water. To accurately determine the pressure of the gas alone, you must subtract the vapor pressure of the water at the given temperature from the total pressure. This correction is necessary for calculating the volume of the gas using the ideal gas law or similar equations, as these calculations require knowing the pressure of the gas without the influence of water vapor."
