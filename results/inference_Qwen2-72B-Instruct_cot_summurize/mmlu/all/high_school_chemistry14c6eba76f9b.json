This suggests that the reaction is first-order with respect to A.\n\nTo see why, consider the simplified rate law for reactant A:\n\n\\[ \\text{Rate} = k[A]^n \\]\n\nIf we triple the concentration of A (\\([A]_2 = 3[A]_1\\)), and the rate also triples (\\(\\text{Rate}_2 = 3\\text{Rate}_1\\)), then we can write:\n\n\\[ 3\\text{Rate}_1 = k(3[A]_1)^n \\]\n\n\\[ 3\\text{Rate}_1 = k3^n[A]_1^n \\]\n\nFor this equation to hold true, the exponent \\(n\\) must equal 1 (since \\(3^1 = 3\\)).\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\nA. 1"
