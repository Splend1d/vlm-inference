In other words, it is a good that has value only because others lack it or have less of it. Based on this definition, the answer to your question would be:\n\nA. being at least six feet tall (in a population where this is above average)\n\nThis is because being taller than average can confer certain advantages, such as being more physically imposing or attractive, which can lead to better job prospects or social status. However, if everyone were at least six feet tall, then this advantage would disappear, and height would no longer be a positional good.\n\nOption B is not a positional good because having an IQ of at least 150 is not dependent on the distribution of IQs in the population. It is a fixed characteristic that does not change based on what others have.\n\nOption C is also not a positional good because being at least six feet tall in a population where this is the average does not confer any relative advantage over others."
