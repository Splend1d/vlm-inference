For example, the dihedral group D_4 (which is the group of symmetries of a square) has order 8 and is solvable, but there are also solvable groups like the symmetric group S_3, which has order 6 (2 * 3) and is also solvable.\n\nStatement 2 is true. According to a theorem in group theory, every group of prime-power order is indeed solvable. This theorem states that if G is a group of order p^n for some prime p and integer n > 0, then G is solvable.\n\nSo the correct answer is:\n\nD. False, True"
