Which of the following correctly states which phase of cellular respiration harvests the most energy and the correct explanation why?\n\nA. The most energy is released during the Krebs cycle because it is here that pyruvate is completely broken down into CO2.\nB. The most energy is released during the Krebs cycle because in addition to the production of ATP, both FADH2 and NADH are produced. Each of those molecules will release 2 ATPs and 3 ATPs, respectively.\nC. The most energy is released during oxidative phosphorylation because in addition to the phosphorylation of ADP into ATP, all the potential energy held in NADH and FADH is transferred to ATP.\nD. The most energy is released during oxidative phosphorylation because H2O is completely broken down into H+ and O2.\n"

The most energy is released during oxidative phosphorylation because in addition to the phosphorylation of ADP into ATP, all the potential energy held in NADH and FADH is transferred to ATP.\n\nExplanation: Oxidative phosphorylation is the stage where the majority of ATP is produced during cellular respiration. It occurs in the inner mitochondrial membrane and involves the electron transport chain (ETC) and chemiosmosis. The high-energy electrons carried by NADH and FADH2, which are produced in the Krebs cycle and glycolysis, are transferred through the ETC, creating a proton gradient that drives the synthesis of ATP via ATP synthase. This process yields a significant amount of ATP compared to the other stages of cellular respiration."
