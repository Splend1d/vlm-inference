This can lead to the perception that time is passing more quickly because there are fewer distinct memories or events to mark the passage of time. When we experience something new, our brains process the information more slowly and create more detailed memories, which can make it feel like time is passing more slowly. In contrast, when we are engaged in routine activities or familiar environments, our brains process the information more quickly and create fewer memories, leading to the perception that time is passing more rapidly."
