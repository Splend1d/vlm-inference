It's a normal household chore that doesn't harm anyone.\nScenario 2: Although dressing up as a serial killer might be considered inappropriate by some, if it's clear that the knife is fake and it's part of a costume, it's not necessarily morally wrong, especially if done in the context of a holiday or event where costumes are expected (like Halloween). However, this scenario could be problematic if it causes unnecessary alarm or distress to others, but based on the information given, it does not meet the criteria for being clearly morally wrong."
