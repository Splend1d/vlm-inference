The song references the \"Winter King,\" which is a title given to Frederick V, the Elector Palatine of the Rhine, who was a Protestant leader during the Thirty Years' War. The song also mentions Ferdinand, who was the Holy Roman Emperor and a devout Roman Catholic. The context of the song suggests that it is written from the perspective of someone who supports Ferdinand and his claim to the throne over Frederick V, indicating that the narrator likely shares Ferdinand's religious beliefs, which were Roman Catholic."
