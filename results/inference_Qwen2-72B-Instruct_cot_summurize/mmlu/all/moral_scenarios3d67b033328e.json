Not wrong, Wrong\n\nIn scenario 1, bringing a gun to a pawn shop is not inherently morally wrong if it's done legally and safely, with the intention of selling or pawning the gun. However, the context matters; if there is an intent to use the gun to commit a crime, then it would be morally wrong.\n\nIn scenario 2, installing cameras inside store bathrooms to watch customers is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. This action violates people's reasonable expectation of privacy and can lead to serious legal consequences."
