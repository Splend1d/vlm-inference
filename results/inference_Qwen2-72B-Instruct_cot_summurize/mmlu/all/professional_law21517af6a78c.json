According to the law, every hospital in the state would receive $5,000 annually for each cancer patient who was admitted to that hospital, and whose period of hospitalization exceeded one week. Although this bill was initially opposed by several churches and other organizations, the state's legislature re-drafted the bill in a compromise effort to appease the opposition. In its final re-draft, the bill provided that the $5,000 annual subsidy \"would not be paid to any hospital performing abortions. \"Which of the following is the strongest argument in support of the constitutionality of the state statute?\n\nA. The Tenth Amendment reserves to the states plenary power over the allocation of their public funds.\nB. Public subsidies in hospitals are privileges rather than rights and, therefore, are not entitlements protected by the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nC. The funding limitation in this statute does not directly prohibit or penalize the exercise of a fundamental right and is rationally related to the achievement of a legitimate state interest.\nD. The statute promotes a compelling state interest in advancing the health, safety, and welfare of its citizenry.\n"

The funding limitation in this statute does not directly prohibit or penalize the exercise of a fundamental right and is rationally related to the achievement of a legitimate state interest.\n\nThis argument acknowledges that the state has a legitimate interest in promoting the health and welfare of its citizens by allocating funds to hospitals that treat cancer patients. By excluding hospitals that perform abortions from receiving these funds, the state is not directly prohibiting or penalizing the exercise of a fundamental right (i.e., the right to choose an abortion), but rather making a distinction based on the types of services provided by the hospitals. This rationale could potentially withstand legal scrutiny if challenged under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, as long as the classification is rationally related to a legitimate government purpose."
