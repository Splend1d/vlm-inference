By measuring the maximum altitude of the Sun in two cities at different latitudes at the same time on the same day.\n\nEratosthenes used the difference in the angle of the Sun's rays at two different locations to estimate the circumference of the Earth. He knew that at noon on the summer solstice, the Sun shone directly down a well in the city of Syene (now Aswan, Egypt), which meant the Sun was directly overhead there. In Alexandria, about 500 miles north of Syene, he measured the angle of the Sun's rays by observing the shadow cast by a vertical stick. The difference in angle between the two locations allowed him to calculate the fraction of the Earth's circumference that lay between them, and thus estimate the full circumference of the Earth."
