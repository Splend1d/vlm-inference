Logical behaviorism asserts that mental states can be fully understood in terms of observable behavior and dispositions to behave in certain ways, which conflicts with the intuitive belief that mental states have an independent existence and causal power over behavior. However, since the question asks for the primary point of contention, option A best captures the core disagreement, as logical behaviorism denies that mental states have any causal efficacy beyond their behavioral manifestations."
