In the case of a sinusoidal signal, it smoothly transitions through all possible values between its maximum positive amplitude and its maximum negative amplitude. This continuous variation over time is a hallmark of analog signals, distinguishing them from digital signals which are discrete and quantized. While options B, C, and D describe aspects of a sinusoidal signal's behavior, they do not specifically address why it is considered an analog signal. Option A directly addresses this criterion."
