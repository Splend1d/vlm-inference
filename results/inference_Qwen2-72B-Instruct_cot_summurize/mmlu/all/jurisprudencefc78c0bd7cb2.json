Its principal concern is with moral or political values.\n\nNormative legal theory deals with questions about how laws ought to be, often grounded in moral or political philosophy. It explores principles and values that should guide the creation and interpretation of laws. While other options touch on aspects of legal theory, they do not as accurately summarize normative legal theory as option A does. Option B refers specifically to legal positivism, which is one theory within the broader field of legal theory; option C relates more to the concept of legal norms than to normative legal theory itself; and option D conflates descriptive analysis with normative concerns."
