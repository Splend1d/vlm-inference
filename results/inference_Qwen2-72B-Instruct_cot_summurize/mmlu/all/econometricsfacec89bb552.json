For example, a house cannot be priced at $500,000.34567... with an infinitely long decimal. In practice, prices are often rounded to a certain number of decimal places (like dollars and cents), making them discrete values. However, some might argue that in the context of mathematical description, if considering the potential for any arbitrary decimal precision, it could be treated as a continuous variable. But given the options provided, \"Discrete\" is the most appropriate choice. The other options refer to different types of data:\n\nB. Cardinal numbers are used to count (\"three apples\").\nC. Ordinal numbers indicate position or order (\"first place\").\nD. Nominal numbers are used for naming or identifying (e.g., a jersey number)."
