She does not recall any sick contacts. She had chickenpox at the age of 7 years. Her most recent examination 1 year ago included PPD skin testing and showed no abnormalities. She takes a daily multivitamin and an herbal weight-loss preparation. She received all appropriate immunizations during childhood but has not received any since then. She does not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. There is no family history of serious illness. She appears lethargic. Her temperature is 39.1\u00b0C (102.4\u00b0F), pulse is 112/min, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 100/68 mm Hg. Examination shows diffuse petechiae. Kernig and Brudzinski signs are present. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. A lumbar puncture is performed. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis shows numerous segmented neutrophils and a decreased glucose concentration. A Gram stain of the CSF shows gram-negative cocci. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy?\n\nA. Ceftriaxone\nB. Clindamycin\nC. Erythromycin\nD. Metronidazole\n"

Given the presence of gram-negative cocci, the most likely pathogen is Neisseria meningitidis.\n\nThe treatment for bacterial meningitis should be initiated as soon as possible to reduce morbidity and mortality. Third-generation cephalosporins such as ceftriaxone are considered first-line therapy for suspected or confirmed bacterial meningitis due to their excellent penetration into the CSF and broad-spectrum activity against common pathogens including N. meningitidis.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy in this case is:\n\nA. Ceftriaxone\n\nIt is also important to consider administering adjunctive dexamethasone in suspected or confirmed cases of bacterial meningitis, which can help reduce inflammation and improve outcomes. However, the specific medication choice was not listed among the options provided."
