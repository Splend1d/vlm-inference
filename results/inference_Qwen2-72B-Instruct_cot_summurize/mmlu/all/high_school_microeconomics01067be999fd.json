David was willing to pay $175 for two hours of tutoring but only paid $125. So his consumer surplus is:\n\\[ \\text{Consumer Surplus} = \\$175 - \\$125 = \\$50 \\]\n\nProducer Surplus: This is the difference between what Elsa received and what she would have been willing to accept. Elsa values her time at $50 per hour, so for two hours, that's $100. She received $125, so her producer surplus is:\n\\[ \\text{Producer Surplus} = \\$125 - (\\$50 * 2) = \\$125 - \\$100 = \\$25 \\]\n\nNow, let's compare these two figures:\n- Consumer Surplus: $50\n- Producer Surplus: $25\n\nThe difference between consumer and producer surplus is $50 - $25 = $25.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. The difference between consumer and producer surplus is $25."
