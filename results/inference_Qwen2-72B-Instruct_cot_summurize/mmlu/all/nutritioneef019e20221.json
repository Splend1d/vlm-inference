While there have been some improvements in reducing hunger in certain regions, such as East Asia and Southeast Asia, globally the progress has not been sufficient to meet this target. In fact, according to reports from the United Nations, the number of undernourished people in the world has fluctuated over time due to various factors including conflicts, economic downturns, climate change, and more recently, the COVID-19 pandemic, which has exacerbated food insecurity for millions around the world. As of recent data, the number of food insecure people has actually been on the rise since 2015."
