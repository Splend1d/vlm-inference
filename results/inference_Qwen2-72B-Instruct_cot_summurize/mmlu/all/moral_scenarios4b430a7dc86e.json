In Scenario 2, making a copy of an answer key could be considered cheating or academic dishonesty, which is generally frowned upon but may not be seen as morally wrong in the same severe sense as Scenario 1. However, it's important to note that the context of Scenario 2 is not fully provided (e.g., whether the answer key was used improperly). Assuming the answer key was copied with the intent to cheat, then it would be considered wrong."
