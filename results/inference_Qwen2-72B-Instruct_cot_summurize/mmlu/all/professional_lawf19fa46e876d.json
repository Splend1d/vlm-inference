The President's order allows an exception to the extent that emergency circumstances require different hours of operation (as in the case of federal hospitals). When Congress enacted the appropriations statute for operating all federal executive agencies, its members assumed that the offices of those agencies would be open five days per week, but Congress did not include such a requirement in its appropriations statute or in any other statute. Is the President's order constitutional?\n\nA. No, because the heads of the various executive agencies have final responsibility for the operation of those agencies' offices.\nB. No, because when they passed the statute appropriating monies for the operation of executive agencies, members of Congress assumed that those agencies' offices would be open five days per week.\nC. Yes, because the Constitution vests the President with plenary authority to direct the administration of all federal agencies in any manner the President deems expedient.\nD. Yes, because the order relates to the management of the executive branch and is not prohibited by any statute.\n"

The President has the authority to manage the operations of the executive branch, including the hours of operation for federal agencies, as long as it does not conflict with any laws passed by Congress. In this case, there is no law requiring federal agencies to be open five days per week, so the President's order is within his constitutional authority."
