Olmec.\n\nThe Maya civilization developed a complex writing system and advanced mathematical concepts, but these were not derived directly from the Mesopotamians, Chavin, or Chinese. Instead, it is believed that the Maya writing system and some elements of their culture have roots in the earlier Olmec civilization, which was one of the earliest known Mesoamerican cultures. The Olmecs are often considered the \"mother culture\" of Mesoamerica, and they had a significant influence on later civilizations, including the Maya. However, it's important to note that the Maya writing and numerical systems evolved significantly beyond what the Olmecs had developed."
