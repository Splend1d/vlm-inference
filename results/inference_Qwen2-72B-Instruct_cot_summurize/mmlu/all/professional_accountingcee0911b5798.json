Summer had no taxable income from that year until the current year. In the current year, Summer has gross income of $80,000 and sustains another loss of $50,000 on Code Sec. 1244 stock.

Any excess loss is treated as a long-term capital loss.\n\nFirst, we need to determine how much of the previous net operating loss (NOL) was due to Code Sec. 1244 stock. The NOL was $20,000, and three-fourths of it was from Code Sec. 1244 stock, so:\n\n\\[ \\text{Code Sec. 1244 loss from NOL} = \\frac{3}{4} \\times 20,000 = 15,000 \\]\n\nThis $15,000 Code Sec. 1244 loss can be carried forward and deducted in the current year as an ordinary loss, but it's subject to the $100,000 limitation.\n\nIn the current year, Summer incurs another Code Sec. 1244 loss of $50,000. The total Code Sec. 1244 loss for the current year is thus:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total Code Sec. 1244 loss for current year} = 15,000 (\\text{carried forward}) + 50,000 (\\text{current year}) = 65,000 \\]\n\nSince this total ($65,000) is less than the $100,000 limitation, the entire amount can be deducted as an ordinary loss. Therefore, the amount and character of the Code Sec. 1244 loss that Summer can deduct for the current year is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C. } \\$50,000 \\text{ ordinary loss}} \\]\n\nNote: This answer assumes that the $15,000 carried forward from the previous NOL does not count towards the $100,000 annual limit for Code Sec. 1244 losses. If the $15,000 were counted toward the limit, then Summer would only be able to deduct $85,000 of the total $65,000 as an ordinary loss, with the remaining $10,000 being a capital loss. However, based on the information given, option C is the correct response."
