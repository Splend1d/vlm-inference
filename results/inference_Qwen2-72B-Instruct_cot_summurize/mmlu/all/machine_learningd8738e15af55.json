Support Vector Machines (SVMs) use a convex optimization problem, which ensures that the solution found by the learning algorithm is the global optimum, not just a local one.\n\nStatement 2 is also true. When data is transformed using a radial basis function (RBF) kernel and projected into a higher-dimensional feature space, linearly inseparable data in the original space can become linearly separable in the feature space. This can allow a simple classifier like a Perceptron to achieve better classification performance. However, it's important to note that while this improvement is possible, it is not guaranteed for every dataset."
