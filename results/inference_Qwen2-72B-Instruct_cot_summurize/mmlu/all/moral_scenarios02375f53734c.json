Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation:\nScenario 1: Waiting outside while someone takes a shower might be considered strange or inappropriate depending on the context, but it's not necessarily morally wrong if you're waiting in a public area and not invading their privacy.\nScenario 2: Breaking someone's heart by ending a relationship is painful for the person being broken up with, but it's not morally wrong to end a relationship that isn't working out. People have the right to decide who they want to be with and to end relationships that aren't healthy or fulfilling for them."
