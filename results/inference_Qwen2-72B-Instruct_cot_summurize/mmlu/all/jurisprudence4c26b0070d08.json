A morality of aspiration.\n\nFuller's \"inner morality of law\" is not a positivist view, which focuses solely on the social facts that constitute law, nor is it an Aquinian concept of natural law, which is based on moral absolutes derived from divine authority. It is also not a rejection of the 'harm principle', which is a concept in liberal political philosophy that suggests the only reason for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others.\n\nInstead, Fuller's \"inner morality of law\" is a set of principles that he argues should guide the creation and application of laws. These principles include such things as clarity, non-retroactivity, and consistency, and they are aimed at making laws more effective and just. In this sense, Fuller's \"inner morality of law\" can be seen as a morality of aspiration, in that it represents an ideal toward which legal systems should strive."
