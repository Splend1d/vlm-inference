                    "text": "The correct answer is D. According to Newton's third law, when the heavier person (100 kg) pushes on the lighter one (50 kg) with a force F, the lighter person will push back on the heavier person with the same force F but in the opposite direction. This means that both people experience equal and opposite forces.\n\nThe acceleration of each person can be calculated using Newton's second law, \\( F = ma \\), where \\( F \\) is the force, \\( m \\) is the mass, and \\( a \\) is the acceleration. Since the force is the same for both people but their masses are different, we can set up the equations:\n\nFor the heavier person: \\( F = 100a_h \\)\n\nFor the lighter person: \\( F = 50a_l \\)\n\nSolving for acceleration in each case gives us:\n\n\\( a_h = \\frac{F}{100} \\)\n\n\\( a_l = \\frac{F}{50} \\)\n\nComparing the two accelerations:\n\n\\( \\frac{a_l}{a_h} = \\frac{\\frac{F}{50}}{\\frac{F}{100}} = \\frac{100}{50} = 2 \\)\n\nThus, the magnitude of the acceleration of the lighter person will be twice the magnitude of the acceleration of the heavier person, making option D the correct answer."
