                    "text": "The weight of an object decreases as you move away from the center of the Earth due to the inverse square law of gravity. The formula for calculating the force of gravity (weight) at a certain distance from the center of the Earth is:\n\n\\[ F = G \\frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2} \\]\n\nwhere \\(F\\) is the force of gravity, \\(G\\) is the gravitational constant, \\(m_1\\) and \\(m_2\\) are the masses of the two bodies (in this case, the Earth and the textbook), and \\(r\\) is the distance between their centers.\n\nGiven that the textbook weighs 30 N at sea level, we can find the force of gravity at sea level and compare it to the force of gravity at the top of the mountain. However, since we don't have all the specific values needed for the full calculation (like the mass of the textbook or the exact value of \\(G\\)), we will use a simplified approach based on ratios and proportions.\n\nLet's denote:\n- \\(r_E\\) as the Earth's radius in meters (\\(6400 \\times 10^3 = 6400000\\) m),\n- \\(h\\) as the height of the mountain peak above sea level (6000 m),\n- \\(F_{sea}\\) as the force of gravity (weight) at sea level (30 N),\n- \\(F_{peak}\\) as the force of gravity (weight) at the mountain peak.\n\nAt sea level, the distance from the center of the Earth to the textbook is \\(r_E\\). On the mountain peak, the distance is \\(r_E + h\\).\n\nWe can set up a proportion based on the inverse square law:\n\n\\[ \\frac{F_{sea}}{F_{peak}} = \\left(\\frac{r_E + h}{r_E}\\right)^2 \\]\n\nSubstitute the given values:\n\n\\[ \\frac{30}{F_{peak}} = \\left(\\frac{6400000 + 6000}{6400000}\\right)^2 \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{30}{F_{peak}} = \\left(\\frac{6406000}{6400000}\\right)^2 \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{30}{F_{peak}} = \\left(\\frac{6406}{6400}\\right)^2 \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{30}{F_{peak}} = \\left(1.00125\\right)^2 \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{30}{F_{peak}} = 1.0025015625 \\]\n\n\\[ F_{peak} = \\frac{30}{1.0025015625} \\approx 29.95 \\]\n\nSo, the weight of the textbook on the mountain peak would be approximately 29.95 N, which is very close to its weight at sea level. This is because the change in altitude (6000 m) is small compared to the Earth's radius (6400000 m), so the decrease in weight is negligible.\n\nThe closest answer choice to 29.95 N is:\n\nC. 30 N"
