Higher interest rates can attract foreign investors seeking higher returns on their investments, leading to an increased demand for the nation's currency. This increased demand can cause the currency to appreciate, making the nation's goods more expensive to foreign consumers and potentially decreasing net exports. However, it is important to note that the relationship between borrowing, deficits, and currency value can be complex and influenced by many factors."
