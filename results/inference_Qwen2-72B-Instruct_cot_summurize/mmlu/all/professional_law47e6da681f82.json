Toward the end of the seventh year of the term, a violent storm blew off several of the roof shingles. The tenant noticed a leak through the roof where the shingles had blown off, but didn't make any repairs. A month later, a severe rain storm occurred, and water leaked through the roof, causing damage to the valuable parquet floors in the two rooms below. Before the term of his lease ended, the tenant discovered that the landlord had not paid his taxes on the property, so he purchased the property through a sheriff's sale. The tenant refuses to make any further rental payments on the property. If the landlord brings suit against the tenant for payment of rent in arrears, he would most likely\n\nA. succeed, because the tenant is estopped to deny the landlord's title.\nB. succeed, because of his security interest in the property.\nC. fail, because the purchase by the tenant vitiated any further contractual obligations.\nD. fail, because the landlord was under a duty to keep the demised premises in reasonably good repair.\n"

When the roof shingles were blown off and the leak was noticed, it became the landlord's responsibility to address the issue promptly. Since the landlord did not fulfill this duty, they cannot hold the tenant responsible for damages resulting from their neglect or for withholding rent as a result of the landlord's failure to maintain the property.\n\nAdditionally, the fact that the tenant purchased the property at a sheriff's sale due to the landlord's failure to pay taxes complicates matters further. This could potentially release the tenant from any further contractual obligations under the lease, although that argument might be less central to the immediate issue of the landlord's failure to maintain the property."
