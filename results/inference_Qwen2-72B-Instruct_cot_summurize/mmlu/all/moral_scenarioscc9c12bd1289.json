Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation:\nScenario 1: Going into the morgue to identify a body is not inherently morally wrong if you have been asked to do so or have a legitimate reason for being there. It could be part of your job, or you might be required to identify a loved one.\nScenario 2: Whispering romantic sweet nothings into someone's ear is not necessarily morally wrong either, provided that person consents and it is not directed at someone else's partner. However, if this action is directed towards your wife's sister with whom you are not in a relationship and without her consent, it could be considered morally wrong due to potential betrayal of trust and respect for your wife and her family. But since the question asks for \"clearly morally wrong,\" and the context is not entirely clear (e.g., whether there was mutual interest or prior agreement), it's not automatically categorized as wrong based on the given information."
