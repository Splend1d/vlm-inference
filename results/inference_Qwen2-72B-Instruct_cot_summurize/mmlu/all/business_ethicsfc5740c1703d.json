While the other options listed are important aspects of running a business, they are not the primary objective. Procuring resources, communicating with shareholders, and mediating between the organization and the environment are all necessary for the success of a business, but they ultimately serve the overarching goal of generating profits. Profitability is essential for a business to sustain itself, invest in growth, and provide returns to its investors."
