The concept of Shabad is central to Sikh theology and refers to the divine sound or word that was present at the creation of the universe and is believed to be the embodiment of God's will and wisdom. The Sikh holy scripture, the Guru Granth Sahib, is considered the eternal Guru and is composed of hymns and writings that are regarded as the Shabad, or divine word, revealed to the Gurus and other saints."
