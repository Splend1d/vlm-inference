Memory cells\n\nWhen a person is exposed to a pathogen, such as a flu virus, for the first time, their immune system produces antibodies and memory cells specific to that pathogen. These memory cells can quickly recognize and respond to the pathogen if it is encountered again, leading to a faster and stronger immune response. This is why the man experienced fewer symptoms and recovered more quickly the second time he contracted the same flu strain."
