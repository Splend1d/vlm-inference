This concept is particularly relevant in service industries where employees must display certain emotions to customers, even if they do not genuinely feel them. For example, flight attendants are expected to be friendly and attentive, regardless of their personal feelings at any given moment. Emotion work can also apply to personal life, where individuals may need to regulate their emotions to conform to social norms or expectations in various settings."
