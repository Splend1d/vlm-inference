This was the period when Japan had a policy of Sakoku (\u9396\u56fd), which means \"closed country,\" during which it isolated itself from most of the Western world, including European countries and Christianity, with very limited exceptions. This period ended with the arrival of Commodore Matthew Perry's fleet in 1853, which forced Japan to open its ports to trade with the West."
