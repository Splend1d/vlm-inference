Kinetic energy of fission fragments.\n\nThis is because the majority of the energy released during fission (approximately 80-90%) comes from the kinetic energy of the two smaller nuclei (fission fragments) that result from the splitting of the original uranium nucleus. However, it's important to note that a significant portion of the energy is also released as gamma radiation and kinetic energy of ejected neutrons. So while B is the primary source of energy release, D could also be considered correct if interpreting \"about equally\" less strictly, since all three forms contribute significantly to the total energy released. But for the most part, the bulk of the energy comes from the kinetic energy of the fission fragments."
