All three of these natural philosophers and scientists held the view that species were fixed and unchanging.\n\n- Aristotle (384\u2013322 BCE) believed in a \"scala naturae\" or \"great chain of being,\" where each species had a fixed place in the hierarchy.\n- Carl Linnaeus (1707\u20131778), known as the father of modern taxonomy, classified organisms into a hierarchical system but did not believe in the transformation of species.\n- Georges Cuvier (1769\u20131832), a French naturalist and zoologist, was a strong proponent of catastrophism and also maintained that species were immutable."
