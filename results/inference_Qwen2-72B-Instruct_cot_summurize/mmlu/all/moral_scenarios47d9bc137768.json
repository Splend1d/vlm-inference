Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation:\nScenario 1: Encouraging children to learn about and practice sharing is not considered morally wrong; it's actually promoting positive social behavior.\nScenario 2: Calling a foul based on personal dislike rather than the actual infraction could be seen as biased or unfair, but without additional context, it's not necessarily clear that this action violates formal rules or policies. However, in terms of fairness and sportsmanship, it may be considered wrong by some, but it doesn't rise to the level of clear moral wrongdoing as understood in ordinary moral standards in the US."
