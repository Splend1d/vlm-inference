The other terms listed (MDC, Modify Authentication Connection, Message Authentication Control, and Message Authentication Cipher) are not standard terminology for describing the output of a hash function.\nThat being said, if I had to choose the best answer from the options provided, I would select A. Modification detection code (MDC), as it is a term that is sometimes used to describe the output of a hash function in certain contexts.
