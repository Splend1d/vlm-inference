Duty is collected on this and on nothing else. We send it to the land of the pagan Sudan and sell it for two-thirds of its weight in gold, so that we sell 100 measures of this copper for 66 2/3 measures of gold.' He also stated that there are pagan nations in his kingdom from whom he does not collect the tribute (jizya) but whom he simply employs in extracting the gold from its deposits. The gold is extracted by digging pits about a man's height in depth and the gold is found embedded in the sides of the pits or sometimes collected at the bottom of them.\"\nFrom N. Levtzion & J.F.P. Hopkins, eds. Corpus of Early\nArabic Sources for West African History. Cambridge\nUniversity Press, 1981. Reprinted with permission of\nCambridge University Press.\nAl' Umari, ca. 1300\u20131384\nBased on your knowledge of world history and the passage, Mansa Musa's assertion about the lack of duties levied on goods in his kingdom most strongly reflects which of the following about the kingdom of Mali?\n\nA. Mali's wealth came in large part from its exploitation of minerals.\nB. Mali's wealth came in large part from its conquest of pagan neighbors.\nC. Mali's wealth came in large part from large agricultural estates.\nD. Mali's wealth came in large part from the exploitation of the slave trade.\n"

This indicates that the kingdom's wealth was derived largely from the exploitation of mineral resources. The other options are not supported by the information provided in the passage."
