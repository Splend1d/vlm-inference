Examination shows a mild hearing loss of the right ear. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\n\nA. Acoustic neuroma\nB. Benign positional vertigo\nC.

Meniere's disease is characterized by recurrent episodes of vertigo, fluctuating hearing loss, tinnitus, and a feeling of fullness in the affected ear.\n\nAcoustic neuroma (Option A) can cause similar symptoms but usually presents with progressive unilateral hearing loss and tinnitus rather than episodic symptoms.\n\nBenign positional vertigo (Option B) typically causes brief episodes of intense vertigo triggered by specific head movements and does not involve hearing loss or tinnitus.\n\nBrain stem transient ischemic attacks (Option C) can cause vertigo, but they do not typically present with the constellation of symptoms related to the inner ear as seen in this case. They also do not include tinnitus or a sense of fullness in the ear.\n\nTherefore, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is Meniere's disease."
