The widgets had to have the buyer's logo imprinted on them. The manufacturer ordered the raw material and made a new widget mold that contained buyer's logo. The buyer wanted quick delivery of at least 10,000 right away. The manufacturer rushed the order and sent 10,000 conforming widgets two days later. The buyer paid for the widgets but rejected delivery on the remaining 90,000 widgets. The manufacturer filed suit and claimed damages for breach of contract. Defendant buyer filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on the basis that the statute of frauds was violated in that it was a contract for over $500 that was unenforceable under state law. Will the court likely grant the motion to dismiss?\n\nA. Yes, the statute of frauds must be enforced when it involves goods over $500.\nB. Yes, the manufacturer did not protect its interests by agreeing to an oral contract and it must pay for its bad business practices.\nC. No, because there is an exception for goods that are specially made for a buyer.\nD. No, the law will enforce the \"benefit of the bargain\" rule.\n"

No, because there is an exception for goods that are specially made for a buyer.\n\nUnder the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), which has been adopted by most states, there is an exception to the statute of frauds for goods that are specially manufactured for a particular buyer and cannot be sold to others in the ordinary course of the seller's business. This exception applies even if the contract is not in writing. In this case, since the widgets were specially made with the buyer's logo and cannot be sold to other customers, the exception would likely apply, and the court would not grant the motion to dismiss based on the statute of frauds."
