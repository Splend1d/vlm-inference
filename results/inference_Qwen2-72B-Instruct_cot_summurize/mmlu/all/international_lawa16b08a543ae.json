The courts may, but will seldom, stay proceedings in cases of extra-territorial abduction\n\nThe English courts have discretion to stay proceedings if there has been an abuse of process, which could include cases of extra-territorial abduction. However, they will consider various factors before deciding to do so, including whether staying the proceedings would prevent the administration of justice. Therefore, while extra-territorial abduction can be a ground for refusal of jurisdiction, it is not an automatic reason for a stay of proceedings."
