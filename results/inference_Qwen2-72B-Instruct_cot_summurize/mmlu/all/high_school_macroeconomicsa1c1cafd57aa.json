Increases in the interest rate\n\nWhile all of the options listed can have complex effects on economic growth, an increase in interest rates is generally considered a monetary policy tool used by central banks to slow down an overheating economy or combat inflation. Higher interest rates make borrowing more expensive, which can discourage investment and spending by both consumers and businesses, potentially leading to slower economic growth. The other options (spending on education and training, increases in capital, and expenditures on research and development) are typically associated with promoting long-term economic growth."
