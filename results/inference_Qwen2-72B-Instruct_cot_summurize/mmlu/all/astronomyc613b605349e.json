Genetic testing has shown that the last universal common ancestor (LUCA) shared many characteristics with modern bacteria and archaea, including a simple cellular structure and the ability to metabolize using chemicals rather than sunlight.\n\nTherefore, the living organisms that most resemble the common ancestor of all life according to genetic testing would be bacteria such as E. coli (option B), as well as organisms living deep in the oceans around seafloor volcanic vents and in hot springs (option C). These organisms are often referred to as extremophiles and can survive in harsh environments that are similar to those present on early Earth. However, since the question asks for the option that most resembles the common ancestor, bacteria such as E. coli might be considered a closer match due to their simpler cellular structure compared to some extremophiles. \n\nSo, if you have to choose one answer, it would be:\n\nB. bacteria such as E. coli\n\nHowever, it's important to note that extremophiles also play a crucial role in understanding the origins of life due to their ability to survive in conditions similar to those found on early Earth."
