After an unanticipated zoning change increased the land's fair market value to $150,000 during the executory period, the owner refused to close. Wishing to avoid a lawsuit, the buyer assigned the contract (which the contract did not forbid) in an arm's-length transaction to an investor, who is experienced in buying and selling real estate. The investor paid the buyer $25,000. The investor knew of the owner's refusal to close, and the owner continued to refuse to close despite the investor's demands that he do so. The investor has sued the owner for specific performance. Who will likely prevail?\n\nA. The investor, because an assignee of the original party purchaser in a real estate contract is entitled to specific performance under these circumstances.\nB. The investor, because she has elected to waive the owner's lack of marketable title caused by the zoning change.\nC. The owner, because the investor is not a bona fide assignee without notice, and thus does not have clean hands.\nD. The owner, because the investor, who is experienced in buying and selling real estate, is entitled to money damages but not to specific performance.\n"

The investor, because an assignee of the original party purchaser in a real estate contract is entitled to specific performance under these circumstances.\n\nIn this situation, the original buyer had a valid contract with the landowner to purchase the property at a set price. When the owner refused to close, the buyer assigned the contract to the investor. Since the contract did not forbid assignment, the investor now stands in the shoes of the original buyer and can enforce the terms of the contract. The investor is seeking specific performance, which is typically available as a remedy in real estate transactions when monetary damages would not adequately compensate the injured party. The fact that the investor knew about the owner's refusal to close does not necessarily bar them from seeking specific performance, especially since the contract was still valid and enforceable at the time of the assignment."
