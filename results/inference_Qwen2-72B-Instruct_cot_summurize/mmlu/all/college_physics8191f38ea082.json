                    "text": "When an organ pipe is open at both ends, it can produce all harmonics in the harmonic series (1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.). However, when one end of the pipe is closed, it becomes a \"closed pipe,\" which can only produce odd harmonics because a standing wave requires a pressure antinode at the open end and a pressure node at the closed end.\n\nThe fundamental frequency (1st harmonic) for a pipe open at both ends is given by:\n\\[ f_1 = \\frac{v}{2L} \\]\nwhere \\( v \\) is the speed of sound and \\( L \\) is the length of the pipe.\n\nFor a pipe closed at one end, the fundamental frequency is given by:\n\\[ f'_1 = \\frac{v}{4L} \\]\n\nThus, the fundamental frequency of a closed pipe is half that of an open pipe of the same length, and its harmonics occur at odd multiples of this fundamental frequency (\\( f'_1, 3f'_1, 5f'_1, ... \\)).\n\nGiven the harmonics produced by the open pipe (50 Hz, 100 Hz, 150 Hz, 200 Hz, 250 Hz), we can see that the fundamental frequency is 50 Hz. When the pipe is closed at one end, it can still produce the frequencies that are odd multiples of this fundamental frequency, i.e., 50 Hz (1st harmonic), 150 Hz (3rd harmonic), and 250 Hz (5th harmonic).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nA. 50 Hz, 150 Hz, and 250 Hz only"
