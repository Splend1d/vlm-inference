Identify internal control activities that are likely to prevent or detect material misstatements.\n\nDuring a review engagement, an accountant does not perform an in-depth examination of internal controls as they would in an audit. The primary focus is on inquiries and analytical procedures, not on testing internal controls. Therefore, identifying internal control activities is less likely to be performed during a review engagement compared to the other options listed which are more typical for such engagements."
