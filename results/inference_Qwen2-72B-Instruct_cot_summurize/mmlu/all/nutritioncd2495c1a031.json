May be effected through the epigenetic effects of intrauterine nutritional inadequacy\n\nPrenatal programming refers to the concept that the environment in the womb, including nutrition and stress, can have long-lasting effects on the health of the child later in life. This can occur through epigenetic mechanisms, which alter gene expression without changing the DNA sequence itself. While prenatal programming can influence the risk of obesity and high blood pressure, it is not limited to low birth weight children and may not necessarily cause these conditions in young children but rather increase the susceptibility to them in later life. Therefore, option B is the most accurate statement provided."
