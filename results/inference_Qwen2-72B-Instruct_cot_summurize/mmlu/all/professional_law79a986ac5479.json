The prosecutor stated that the visitor knew the child personally, which is why the child went with him, and that the perpetrator knew the child's parents had money. The prosecutor called a witness to testify that the perpetrator told the witness \"I am looking forward to visiting with the child and his parents. They have a wonderfully luxurious house that I will enjoy staying in.'' The defense objected to the proposed testimony. Will the court likely sustain the objection?\n\nA. No, the statement is admissible to impeach the accused and establish he is lying on cross, if he takes the stand.\nB. No, the statement can come in as impeachment if the accused takes the stand, and as a party admission to show the material facts of knowing the child and that the family had money.\nC. Yes, the prejudice of the statement will greatly outweigh its probative value.\nD. Yes, the statement is irrelevant to the issue of guilt or innocence.\n"

No, the statement can come in as impeachment if the accused takes the stand, and as a party admission to show the material facts of knowing the child and that the family had money.\n\nThe statement made by the perpetrator to the witness is potentially relevant because it could be used to show the perpetrator's intent or motive, which is a material fact in a kidnapping case. It suggests that the perpetrator had knowledge of the child and the child's parents, and that he had an interest in their wealth, which could be linked to a motive for kidnapping. Additionally, if the defendant chooses to testify and denies having any connection to the child or knowledge of the parents' wealth, this statement could be used to impeach his credibility.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the judge would need to determine whether the probative value of the statement outweighs any potential prejudicial effect it might have on the jury. If the judge determines that the statement is more prejudicial than probative, then the objection could be sustained under Rule 403 of the Federal Rules of Evidence (or similar state rules). But based on the information provided, option B seems the most likely outcome."
