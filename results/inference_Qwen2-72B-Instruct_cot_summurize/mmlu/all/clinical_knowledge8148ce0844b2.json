To ensure best lung expansion and accuracy and consistency of readings.\n\nStanding or sitting upright allows for maximum lung expansion, which is crucial for obtaining an accurate peak flow reading. When a patient is in an upright position, their diaphragm can move more freely, enabling a larger volume of air to be expelled forcefully from the lungs. This results in a more reliable measurement of their peak expiratory flow rate. Consistency in posture during each measurement also helps in tracking changes over time, which is important for managing conditions like asthma."
