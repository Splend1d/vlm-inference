Take periodic breaks to view natural lighting\n\nTo prevent screen-induced eyestrain, it's recommended that computer users take regular breaks and look away from the screen periodically. This allows the eyes to rest and reduces the strain caused by prolonged focus on a digital display. The 20-20-20 rule is often suggested: every 20 minutes, look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds. This can help reduce eye fatigue.\n\nWhile using eye drops might help with dry eyes, they don't address the root cause of eyestrain. Changing software programs or limiting the resolution on the monitor might improve visual comfort in some cases but are not direct solutions to prevent eyestrain. Adjusting the brightness and contrast of the monitor, as well as ensuring proper lighting in the room, can also help reduce eyestrain."
