Which of the following research method choices (and the rationale for the choice) is the most appropriate?\n\nA. Experiment-the most convenient and ethical way to study online bullying is to randomly assign half of the participants to a group who experiences the independent variable (online bullying).\nB. Correlation-it would be unethical to purposefully expose middle school students to bullying behaviors, so Professor Ek should examine variables that correlate with existing instances of online bullying.\nC. Naturalistic observation-observing instances of online bullying by monitoring middle school students' social networking behavior would provide the most accurate data and not raise important privacy concerns, because social networks are considered \"public\" space.\nD. Survey-self-reports about online bullying behaviors and responses to these behaviors would likely provide the most accurate descriptions of bullying and its impact.\n"

Correlation - it would be unethical to purposefully expose middle school students to bullying behaviors, so Professor Ek should examine variables that correlate with existing instances of online bullying.\n\nThe rationale for this choice is based on ethical considerations. Exposing participants to potentially harmful conditions, such as bullying, is not acceptable in research involving human subjects, especially minors. A correlational study allows researchers to investigate relationships between variables without manipulating them. This approach can reveal patterns and associations between online bullying and other factors without causing harm to the participants.\n\nWhile survey methods (option D) can also be useful, correlation provides a more systematic way to explore relationships between variables. Surveys may be subject to self-report biases and may not capture the full complexity of the relationships between variables. Naturalistic observation (option C) could be invasive and raise privacy concerns, despite the argument that social networks are public spaces. An experiment (option A) would be highly unethical due to the potential for harm to participants."
