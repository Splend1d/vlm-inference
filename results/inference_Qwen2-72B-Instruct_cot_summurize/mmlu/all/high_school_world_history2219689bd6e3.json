A Union of African states will project more effectively the African personality. It will command respect from a world that has regard only for size and influence. The scant attention paid to African opposition to the French atomic tests in the Sahara, and the ignominious spectacle of the U.N. in the Congo quibbling about constitutional niceties while the Republic was tottering into anarchy, are evidence of the callous disregard of African Independence by the Great Powers.\"\nKwame Nkrumah, Ghanian leader, 1961\nWhich of the following explains why Nkrumah feels Africa must \"avoid all the dangers inherent in disunity\"?\n\nA. African nations will not achieve independence without unity.\nB. Disunity is what originally led many African nations into disarray.\nC. The African continent has already experienced its share of civil wars.\nD. The world community sees power as a function of size and influence.\n"
