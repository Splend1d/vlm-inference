It is crucial for tasks that require adaptability and creative thinking, such as solving logical puzzles in a new computer game. Crystallized intelligence, on the other hand, involves the use of acquired knowledge and skills, which is less relevant when encountering a new game with unfamiliar puzzles. Aptitude and achievement intelligence are not standard terms in psychology, but they might refer to specific learned abilities or accomplishments in particular domains, which would also be less applicable to the general problem-solving required in a new game."
