The position required the engineer to work underground each workday. After one week on the job, the engineer became very ill. He requested testing of the mine air system, which revealed the presence of a chemical agent to which the engineer had a rare allergic reaction. The engineer promptly quit. The coal mine then hired a qualified replacement for the remainder of the engineer's contract at a salary of $7,500 per month. Assume that no statute or regulation applies. If the coal mine sues the engineer for breach of contract, is the coal mine likely to recover damages?\n\nA. No, because an at-will employee has the right to terminate an employment contract.\nB. No, because the risk to the engineer's health excused his nonperformance of the contract.\nC. Yes, because the coal mine acted in good faith in mitigating the effect of the engineer's failure to finish the contract term.\nD. Yes, because the mine is reasonably safe for most people.\n"

No, because the risk to the engineer's health excused his nonperformance of the contract.\n\nIn this scenario, the engineer discovered a legitimate health risk that was specific to him due to a rare allergic reaction to a chemical agent present in the mine. This condition could potentially cause serious harm to the engineer if he continued to work in the mine. Therefore, the engineer's decision to quit can be justified on the grounds of preserving his health and safety. In contract law, performance may be excused when it becomes impossible or would result in serious harm to the performing party through no fault of their own. Thus, the coal mine is unlikely to recover damages from the engineer for breach of contract under these circumstances."
