While Sanskrit has been an important language in India and has influenced many other languages in the region through its literature and religious texts, it did not spread widely beyond South Asia. The other options listed (migration, trade, and conquest) have historically been major drivers of language spread around the world. For example, the English language spread to many parts of the world through British colonization and trade, while Spanish and Portuguese spread through conquest and colonization of Latin America. Similarly, Arabic spread through trade routes and Islamic conquests, while Chinese spread through migration and cultural influence in East Asia."
