Wundt set up a laboratory and focused on empirical evidence that could be replicated.\n\nThis is because setting up a laboratory for psychological experiments allowed for systematic and controlled studies, which could be repeated by other researchers to verify findings. This approach emphasized the importance of empirical evidence and scientific methods in psychology, distinguishing it as a scientific discipline."
