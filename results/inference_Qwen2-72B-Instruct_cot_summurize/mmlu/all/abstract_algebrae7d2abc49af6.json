This means we're looking for values of \\(x\\) such that the polynomial evaluates to zero modulo 7.\n\nLet's test each value from 0 to 6 to see if it's a root:\n\n1. For \\(x = 0\\):\n\\[0^3 + 2\\cdot0^2 + 2\\cdot0 + 1 = 1 \\not\\equiv 0 \\mod 7\\]\n\n2. For \\(x = 1\\):\n\\[1^3 + 2\\cdot1^2 + 2\\cdot1 + 1 = 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 6 \\not\\equiv 0 \\mod 7\\]\n\n3. For \\(x = 2\\):\n\\[2^3 + 2\\cdot2^2 + 2\\cdot2 + 1 = 8 + 8 + 4 + 1 = 21 \\equiv 0 \\mod 7\\]\n\nSo, \\(x = 2\\) is a root. This means that \\(x - 2\\) is a factor.\n\nNext, let's perform polynomial division or synthetic division to divide the original polynomial by \\(x - 2\\). However, since we're working in \\(\\mathbb{Z}_7\\), we need to be careful with our arithmetic.\n\nWe have:\n\\[x^3 + 2x^2 + 2x + 1 = (x-2)Q(x) + R\\]\n\nBy testing, we can find the quotient \\(Q(x)\\) and remainder \\(R\\). Since \\(x=2\\) is a root, the remainder will be 0, and we only need to find \\(Q(x)\\).\n\nGiven that \\(x=2\\) is a root, we can rewrite the polynomial as:\n\\[x^3 + 2x^2 + 2x + 1 = (x-2)(x^2+ax+b)\\]\n\nExpanding the right side gives us:\n\\[x^3 + ax^2 + bx - 2x^2 - 2ax - 2b = x^3 + (a-2)x^2 + (b-2a)x - 2b\\]\n\nComparing coefficients with the original polynomial, we have:\n\\[a-2 = 2 \\Rightarrow a = 4\\]\n\\[b-2a = 2 \\Rightarrow b - 8 = 2 \\Rightarrow b = 10 \\equiv 3 \\mod 7\\]\n\nTherefore, the quadratic factor is \\(x^2 + 4x + 3\\).\n\nNow, we need to factor \\(x^2 + 4x + 3\\) over \\(\\mathbb{Z}_7\\). We're looking for two numbers that multiply to 3 and add up to 4 (in \\(\\mathbb{Z}_7\\)).\n\nThe numbers are 1 and 3, because \\(1\\cdot3 = 3\\) and \\(1 + 3 = 4\\).\n\nThus, \\(x^2 + 4x + 3 = (x + 1)(x + 3)\\).\n\nPutting everything together, we get:\n\\[x^3 + 2x^2 + 2x + 1 = (x - 2)(x + 1)(x + 3)\\]\n\nHowever, none of the options match exactly, but considering the equivalent forms in \\(\\mathbb{Z}_7\\):\n\n\\(3 \\equiv -4 \\mod 7\\)\n\nTherefore, the correct factorization given the options is:\n\\[x^3 + 2x^2 + 2x + 1 = (x - 2)(x + 1)(x + 4)\\]\n\nWhich corresponds to option B: \\((x + 1)(x + 4)(x \u2212 2)\\)."
