It may be answered that one should wish to be both, but, because it is difficult to unite them in one person, it is much safer to be feared than loved, when, of the two, either must be dispensed with. Because this is to be asserted in general of men, that they are ungrateful, fickle, false, cowardly, covetous, and as long as you succeed they are yours entirely; they will offer you their blood, property, life, and children, as is said above, when the need is far distant; but when it approaches they turn against you. And that prince who, relying entirely on their promises, has neglected other precautions, is ruined; because friendships that are obtained by payments, and not by greatness or nobility of mind, may indeed be earned, but they are not secured, and in time of need cannot be relied upon; and men have less scruple in offending one who is beloved than one who is feared, for love is preserved by the link of obligation which, owing to the baseness of men, is broken at every opportunity for their advantage; but fear preserves you by a dread of punishment which never fails.\"\nNicolo Machiavelli, The Prince, ca. 1513 C.E.\nMachiavelli's treatise is best understood in the context of which of the following?\n\nA. A time of burgeoning economic prosperity among the lower classes of Italian society\nB. A time of increasing religious devotion among the elite Italian scholars\nC. A time of intense political conflict among warring Italian city-states and other factions\nD. A time of collegial cooperation between scholars and ecclesiastical authorities in Italy\n"

A time of intense political conflict among warring Italian city-states and other factions\n\nThe passage from Nicolo Machiavelli's \"The Prince\" reflects the political instability and conflict that characterized the Italian city-states during the late 15th and early 16th centuries. Machiavelli's advice about the nature of power and the importance of being feared over being loved is rooted in his observations of the shifting alliances, betrayals, and violence that were common in the political landscape of Renaissance Italy. His work is a pragmatic guide to maintaining power in such an environment, rather than an idealistic vision of leadership."
