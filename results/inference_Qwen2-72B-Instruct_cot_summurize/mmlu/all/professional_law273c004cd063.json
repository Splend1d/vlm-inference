An owner of a Detroit drug store takes his gross cash receipts each week into a city in Canada where he lives and does his banking. The office of the Deputy Atty. General learned that the owner was doing this, and indicted him on 10 counts of \"willingly and knowingly\" taking cash over $10,000 into a foreign country without reporting it. The owner's main defense is that he did not know of the law or that he was breaking it. The trial judge instructed the jury that mistake of law is no defense. He was convicted and appealed. Will the federal appellate court likely reverse the conviction?\n\nA. Yes, because willfulness clause requires proof of both knowledge of the law and a specific intent to commit the crime.\nB. Yes, because treaties with Canada make all such reporting laws unenforceable.\nC. No, the practice is so dangerous to the public interest that knowledge and specific intent are not required.\nD. No, willfulness and knowledge are inferred by the habitual practice of transporting the cash.\n"

Yes, because willfulness clause requires proof of both knowledge of the law and a specific intent to commit the crime.\n\nThe key issue here is whether the owner acted \"willfully,\" which generally requires the prosecution to prove that the defendant knew of the law and intended to violate it. While mistake of law is typically not a defense, if the statute requires a showing of willfulness, the government must prove that the defendant knew about the legal duty to report and consciously chose to ignore it. In this case, if the owner genuinely did not know about the reporting requirement and there is no evidence to suggest otherwise, the appellate court might find that the government failed to prove willfulness beyond a reasonable doubt."
