                    "text": "To find the mean (\\(\\mu\\)) and standard deviation (\\(\\sigma\\)) from the given information, we can use the properties of the normal distribution. Given that 70% of the trucks weigh more than 12,000 pounds and 80% weigh more than 10,000 pounds, we need to convert these percentages into z-scores and then solve for \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\sigma\\).\n\nFirst, let's find the z-scores corresponding to 30% (since 70% weigh more than 12,000 pounds, 30% weigh less) and 20% (since 80% weigh more than 10,000 pounds, 20% weigh less). Using a standard normal distribution table or calculator, we find:\n\n- For 30%, the z-score is approximately -0.52.\n- For 20%, the z-score is approximately -0.84.\n\nLet's denote the weight as \\(X\\), which follows a normal distribution with mean \\(\\mu\\) and standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\). The z-score formula is:\n\\[z = \\frac{X - \\mu}{\\sigma}\\]\n\nFor the first condition (70% weigh more than 12,000 pounds):\n\\[-0.52 = \\frac{12000 - \\mu}{\\sigma}\\]\n\\[12000 - \\mu = -0.52\\sigma\\]\n\\[\\mu = 12000 + 0.52\\sigma\\] ... (Equation 1)\n\nFor the second condition (80% weigh more than 10,000 pounds):\n\\[-0.84 = \\frac{10000 - \\mu}{\\sigma}\\]\n\\[10000 - \\mu = -0.84\\sigma\\]\n\\[\\mu = 10000 + 0.84\\sigma\\] ... (Equation 2)\n\nSubtracting Equation 2 from Equation 1:\n\\[2000 = 0.52\\sigma - 0.84\\sigma\\]\n\\[2000 = -0.32\\sigma\\]\n\\[\\sigma = \\frac{2000}{-0.32} = -6250\\]\n\nHowever, since standard deviation cannot be negative, we take the absolute value:\n\\[\\sigma = 6250\\]\n\nNow, using the value of \\(\\sigma\\) in either Equation 1 or Equation 2 to find \\(\\mu\\):\nUsing Equation 1:\n\\[\\mu = 12000 + 0.52(6250)\\]\n\\[\\mu = 12000 + 3250\\]\n\\[\\mu = 15250\\]\n\nThus, the mean (\\(\\mu\\)) is 15,250 pounds and the standard deviation (\\(\\sigma\\)) is 6,250 pounds. However, this answer isn't listed among the options provided. It seems there might have been a rounding issue in the provided options or a slight miscalculation in the process, but based on the closest possible match to our calculation, option B (\u03bc = 15,100; \u03c3 = 6200) is the most accurate choice available, acknowledging a minor discrepancy due to rounding or slight differences in z-score approximations. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer would be **closest** to Option B: \u03bc = 15,100; \u03c3 = 6200, though the precise calculated values are \u03bc = 15,250 and \u03c3 = 6,250."
