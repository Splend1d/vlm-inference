When demand is inelastic, consumers will continue to buy the good even at higher prices, so they bear more of the tax burden. When supply is elastic, producers can easily adjust the quantity supplied in response to price changes, meaning they can pass more of the tax onto consumers in the form of higher prices.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. the demand is inelastic and the supply is elastic"
