Water that is taken up by the roots and carbon dioxide from the air.\n\nWhile all of these factors play some role in the growth and development of an oak tree, the majority of the dry mass of organic matter in the tree comes from the synthesis of carbohydrates through photosynthesis. In this process, the tree uses energy from sunlight to convert carbon dioxide (from the air) and water (from the soil) into glucose, a simple sugar that serves as the building block for more complex organic compounds like cellulose, lignin, and proteins.\n\nOptions A and B are incorrect because although they contribute to the overall health and nutrient content of the tree, they do not make the largest contribution to the tree's dry mass. Option D is incorrect because while the endosperm in the acorn provides initial nourishment for the germinating seedling, it does not contribute significantly to the mass of a mature tree."
