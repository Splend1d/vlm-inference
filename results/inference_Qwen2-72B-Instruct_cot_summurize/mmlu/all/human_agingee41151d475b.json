In complex reaction time tasks, individuals must process more information and make decisions based on that information before responding. This can involve identifying stimuli, deciding on an appropriate response, and executing that response. As people age, their ability to process information quickly and efficiently can decline, leading to longer reaction times in complex tasks compared to younger individuals. In contrast, simple and choice reaction time tasks may show less pronounced age-related differences because they require less cognitive processing. \"Elaborate\" is not a standard category for reaction time tasks."
