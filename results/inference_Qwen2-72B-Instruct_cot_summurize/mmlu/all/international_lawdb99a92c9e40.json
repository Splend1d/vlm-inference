Piracy jure gentium is subject to universal jurisdiction\n\nUnder international law, piracy is one of the few crimes that can be prosecuted by any state under the principle of universal jurisdiction. This means that any country can seize a pirate ship or aircraft on the high seas or in airspace, arrest the pirates, and prosecute them under its own laws, regardless of the nationality of the pirates or the victims. The concept of \"piracy jure gentium\" refers to piracy as an offense against all nations, which justifies the application of universal jurisdiction."
