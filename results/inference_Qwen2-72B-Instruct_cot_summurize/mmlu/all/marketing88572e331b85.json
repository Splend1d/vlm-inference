The market segment must have measurable purchasing power and size.\n\nEffective market segmentation requires that segments can be measured in terms of their size and purchasing power. This allows a business to determine whether a segment is large enough to be profitable and worth pursuing with a specific marketing strategy. Segments should also be distinct and identifiable, with clear differences from other segments, and accessible through appropriate marketing channels. Additionally, segments should be stable over time and not change too rapidly for the company to effectively target them. However, among the options provided, B is the most critical requirement for effective market segmentation."
