During the past week, she has had six large watery stools daily. She is currently receiving triple antiretroviral therapy. She is employed as a flight attendant and works regularly on domestic flights throughout the USA. She also flies to Asia at least once monthly. She is 163 cm (5 ft 4 in) tall and weighs 59 kg (130 lb); BMI is 22 kg/m2 . Her temperature is 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), pulse is 88/min, and blood pressure is 112/64 mm Hg. The abdomen is scaphoid. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Her CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 400/mm3 (Normal\u2265500). Which of the following is the most likely causal organism?\n\nA. Cryptosporidium parvum\nB. Cytomegalovirus\nC. Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex\nD. Salmonella enteritidis\n"

                    "text": "The most likely causal organism for the patient's symptoms is A. Cryptosporidium parvum. This parasite is a common cause of diarrhea in immunocompromised patients, particularly those with AIDS. It causes a disease known as cryptosporidiosis which can result in severe, chronic diarrhea that can lead to significant weight loss. The fact that this patient has a low CD4+ T-lymphocyte count (400/mm3) and is experiencing persistent, watery diarrhea are strong indicators of a Cryptosporidium infection.\n\nIt is important to note that the other options could potentially cause gastrointestinal issues, but they are less likely given the patient's symptoms and medical history. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) can cause colitis in immunocompromised individuals, but it typically does not present with such severe diarrhea. Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex (MAI) can cause disseminated infections in AIDS patients, including gastrointestinal involvement, but it would be less likely to present primarily with severe diarrhea without other systemic symptoms. Salmonella enteritidis can cause gastroenteritis, but it would be less likely in an individual on antiretroviral therapy due to reduced risk of opportunistic infections."
