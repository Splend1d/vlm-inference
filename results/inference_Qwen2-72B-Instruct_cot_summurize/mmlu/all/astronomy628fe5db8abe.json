This distance can be expressed in meters as:\n\n1 AU = 149.6 million km = 149,600,000,000 meters = 1.496 x 10^11 meters\n\nIf the distance from the Earth to Altair is one million times greater than the distance from the Earth to the Sun, then:\n\nDistance to Altair = 1,000,000 x Distance to the Sun\nDistance to Altair = 1,000,000 x 1.496 x 10^11 meters\nDistance to Altair = 1.496 x 10^17 meters\n\nRounded to two significant figures, this becomes:\n\nDistance to Altair \u2248 1.5 x 10^17 meters\n\nSo the correct answer is D. 1.5 x 10^17 meters."
