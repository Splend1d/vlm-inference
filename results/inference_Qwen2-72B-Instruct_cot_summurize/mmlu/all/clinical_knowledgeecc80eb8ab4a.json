However, it's important to note that significant resynthesis can occur much faster, within the first few minutes of recovery, especially with passive recovery or low-intensity active recovery. The full resynthesis process can take longer, up to 20-30 minutes, depending on various factors such as the intensity and duration of the exercise, the individual's fitness level, and the type of recovery (passive vs. active)."
