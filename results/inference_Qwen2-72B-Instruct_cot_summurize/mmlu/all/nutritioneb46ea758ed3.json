However, it is often used in evolutionary biology to refer to a situation where populations of the same species are geographically separated or otherwise unable to exchange genes (reproductive isolation), leading to different evolutionary paths. In a broader context, functional isolation could also refer to a part of a system (not necessarily biological) that operates independently from other parts, without interacting with them.\n\nNone of the provided options (A, B, C) accurately defines 'functional isolation' as it is typically understood in scientific contexts. Therefore, the answer would be:\n\nD. None of the above\n\nHowever, if we were to loosely interpret the term in the context of child development, it might refer to a child who is isolated from social interactions or environmental stimuli necessary for their development, which somewhat aligns with option C but is not precisely defined by any of the options."
