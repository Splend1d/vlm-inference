It may have also had religious significance and could have been used for ceremonial purposes. Its location in the mountains above the Urubamba Valley would have provided seclusion and protection, making it a suitable retreat for the Inca elite. However, it's important to note that its exact purpose remains somewhat of a mystery, and it could have served various functions during different periods."
