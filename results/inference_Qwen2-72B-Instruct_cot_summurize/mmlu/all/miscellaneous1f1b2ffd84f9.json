However, we can make an educated guess based on typical values for hurricanes.\n\nAngular momentum (L) is given by the formula L = I\u03c9, where I is the moment of inertia and \u03c9 is the angular velocity. The moment of inertia for a hurricane can be approximated using the formula for a solid cylinder: I = 0.5mr^2, where m is the mass of the air in the hurricane and r is the radius of the storm.\n\nFor a hurricane like Florence, which had a diameter of around 400 miles (640 km), the radius is about 200 miles (320 km). Converting to meters gives us r = 320,000 m. The mass of the air in the hurricane can be estimated by multiplying the density of air by the volume of the storm. Air has a density of about 1.225 kg/m^3, and if we assume a depth of 10 km for the storm, the volume would be \u03c0r^2h, where h is the height (or depth) of the storm. This gives us a volume of \u03c0*(320,000 m)^2*10,000 m \u2248 3.2 x 10^15 m^3. Multiplying this by the density of air gives a mass of approximately 3.9 x 10^18 kg.\n\nThe angular velocity (\u03c9) of the storm can be estimated from its rotational speed. Hurricanes typically rotate with a period of about 1 day, or 86,400 seconds. The angular velocity is given by \u03c9 = 2\u03c0/T, where T is the period. This gives us \u03c9 \u2248 7.27 x 10^-5 rad/s.\n\nPlugging these values into the formula for angular momentum, we get:\n\nL = I\u03c9 = 0.5mr^2\u03c9 = 0.5*(3.9 x 10^18 kg)*(320,000 m)^2*(7.27 x 10^-5 rad/s) \u2248 1.9 x 10^25 kg*m^2/s\n\nThis value is closest to option D. However, it's important to note that this is a very rough estimate, as many factors can affect the actual angular momentum of a hurricane, including changes in size, intensity, and velocity over time. Nonetheless, it's clear that the angular momentum of a major hurricane like Florence is an enormous quantity, on the order of 10^25 kg*m^2/s. So, the answer is likely D. L = 10^25 kg * m^2 / s."
