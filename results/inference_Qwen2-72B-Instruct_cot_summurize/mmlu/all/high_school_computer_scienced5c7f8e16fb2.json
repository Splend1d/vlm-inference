In other words, it checks if it is NOT true that max is not equal to a[i], which means it checks if max is equal to a[i].\n\nWhen you put these two together with an OR operator, you're essentially checking if either condition 1 or condition 2 is true. However, since both conditions check for the same thing (a[i] being equal to max), you can simplify this expression.\n\nThe expression simplifies to:\n\na[i] == max || a[i] == max\n\nWhich further simplifies to:\n\na[i] == max\n\nSo the correct answer is:\n\nA. a[i] == max"
