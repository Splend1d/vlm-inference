Decreases       Decreases       Decreases\n\nContractionary monetary policy typically involves actions by a central bank to reduce the money supply in the economy, such as raising interest rates. This makes borrowing more expensive, which can lead to reduced spending by consumers and businesses. As a result, aggregate demand decreases, leading to lower levels of output (GDP) in the short run. Additionally, with less demand for goods and services, the overall price level tends to decrease as well."
