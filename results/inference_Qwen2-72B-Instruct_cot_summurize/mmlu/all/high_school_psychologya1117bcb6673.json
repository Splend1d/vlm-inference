During this stage, children exhibit characteristics such as egocentrism (the inability to see things from another person's perspective), animism (the belief that inanimate objects have life-like qualities), and intuitive thinking (which often leads to illogical conclusions). Trial-and-error learning is more characteristic of the sensorimotor stage, which precedes the preoperational stage."
