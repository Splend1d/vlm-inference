Furthermore, if a number is a common divisor, then its negative counterpart must also be a common divisor, because if x and y are both divisible by c, then they are also both divisible by -c.\n\nOption B includes 0, which cannot be a common divisor, so it's not possible.\n\nOption C includes all the necessary properties of a set of common divisors, but we need to check if there exists a pair of integers that have these divisors and no others. Consider the numbers 6 and 12. Their common divisors are exactly the numbers in option C (and their negatives).\n\nOption D includes 0, which cannot be a common divisor, so it's not possible.\n\nTherefore, the only possible set of all common divisors of two integers from the given options is A. {-6,-2, -1, 1, 2, 6}. However, this explanation has a mistake in analyzing option C. The correct analysis should be that among the given options, A is the only one that doesn't contain 0 and includes 1 as well as the negative counterparts for each positive divisor, making it the correct choice based on the provided options. Option C could also potentially be correct under different circumstances, but it was not listed as an option in the original question."
