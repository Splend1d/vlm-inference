                    "text": "The addition of HCl to a saturated solution of Mg(OH)2 will result in a reaction between the hydroxide ions (OH-) from the dissolved Mg(OH)2 and the hydrogen ions (H+) from the HCl. The net ionic equation for this reaction is:\n\n\\[ OH^- + H^+ \\rightarrow H_2O \\]\n\nThis reaction reduces the concentration of hydroxide ions in the solution, shifting the solubility equilibrium of Mg(OH)2 towards the dissolution direction according to Le Chatelier's principle:\n\n\\[ Mg(OH)_2(s) \\rightleftharpoons Mg^{2+}(aq) + 2OH^-(aq) \\]\n\nAs more Mg(OH)2 dissolves to replace the hydroxide ions that have reacted with the added H+, the concentration of magnesium ions ([Mg^2+]) increases. However, since the solution was already saturated with respect to Mg(OH)2 before the addition of HCl, the increased concentration of [Mg^2+] will exceed the solubility product constant (Ksp) for Mg(OH)2 at that temperature, leading to the precipitation of Mg(OH)2.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Mg(OH)2 precipitates\n\nThe other options are incorrect because:\n- A. MgCl2 does not precipitate under these conditions; it would remain dissolved as it is a soluble salt.\n- C. The value of Ksp for a substance at a given temperature is a constant and does not change due to the addition of a reactant or product. It is only affected by changes in temperature.\n- D. The concentration of water ([H2O]) is not significantly affected by the addition of HCl or the reaction with Mg(OH)2, especially considering the large volume of water compared to the small amount of HCl added."
