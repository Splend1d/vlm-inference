In scenario 1, backing up a boat into the lake is a normal activity associated with boating and does not inherently involve any moral wrongdoing unless there are additional circumstances that suggest otherwise (e.g., if it was done carelessly and caused damage). In scenario 2, helping an elderly lady off the ground is generally considered a kind and morally positive action. Without additional context suggesting harm or negative consequences resulting from these actions, neither scenario involves doing something clearly morally wrong."
