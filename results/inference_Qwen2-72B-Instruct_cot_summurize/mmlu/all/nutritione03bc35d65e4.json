                    "text": "A. The risk of high iron stores is greater than the risk of iron deficiency in older people.\n\nThis statement is correct because as people age, their iron requirements decrease and their ability to absorb iron does not change significantly. This can lead to an accumulation of iron stores, which may contribute to health problems such as cardiovascular disease and certain types of cancer. In contrast, iron deficiency is less common in older adults, although it can still occur in specific populations, such as those with chronic diseases or gastrointestinal blood loss.\n\nThe other statements are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nB. Not all older people living in Western countries have low vitamin D status. While vitamin D deficiency is more common in older adults due to decreased skin synthesis and reduced dietary intake, it is not universal. Vitamin D status can vary based on factors like sun exposure, diet, and supplementation.\n\nC. There is no strong evidence that vitamin C supplements lower the risk of cancer in older people. Some studies suggest that adequate vitamin C intake may be associated with a reduced risk of certain cancers, but the evidence is not definitive, and taking high-dose vitamin C supplements has not been consistently shown to have a protective effect against cancer.\n\nD. Low dietary intake of vitamin B12 is not the main cause of vitamin B12 deficiency in older people. The primary cause of vitamin B12 deficiency in older adults is usually related to malabsorption, often due to atrophic gastritis (reduced stomach acid) or pernicious anemia, rather than inadequate dietary intake."
