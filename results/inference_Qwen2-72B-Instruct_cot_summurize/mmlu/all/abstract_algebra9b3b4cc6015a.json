For the finite field Z_7, which consists of the elements {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, we need to find an element whose powers modulo 7 will generate all non-zero elements of the field.\n\nLet's check each option:\n\nA. 1\n- \\(1^1 = 1\\)\n- \\(1^2 = 1\\)\n- ...\n- All powers of 1 will just be 1, so it cannot generate all non-zero elements. Therefore, 1 is not a generator.\n\nB. 2\n- \\(2^1 = 2\\)\n- \\(2^2 = 4\\)\n- \\(2^3 = 8 \\equiv 1\\) (mod 7)\n- \\(2^4 = 16 \\equiv 2\\) (mod 7)\n- \\(2^5 = 32 \\equiv 4\\) (mod 7)\n- \\(2^6 = 64 \\equiv 1\\) (mod 7)\nThe powers of 2 modulo 7 cycle through {1, 2, 4} and do not generate all non-zero elements. So, 2 is not a generator.\n\nC. 3\n- \\(3^1 = 3\\)\n- \\(3^2 = 9 \\equiv 2\\) (mod 7)\n- \\(3^3 = 27 \\equiv 6\\) (mod 7)\n- \\(3^4 = 81 \\equiv 4\\) (mod 7)\n- \\(3^5 = 243 \\equiv 5\\) (mod 7)\n- \\(3^6 = 729 \\equiv 1\\) (mod 7)\nThe powers of 3 modulo 7 cycle through all non-zero elements {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. Therefore, 3 is a generator.\n\nD. 4\nWe don't need to check 4 because if 3 is a generator, then any power of 3 will also generate the same set of elements modulo 7. However, since we've already found a generator in 3, there's no need to verify 4.\n\nThus, the correct answer is **C. 3**."
