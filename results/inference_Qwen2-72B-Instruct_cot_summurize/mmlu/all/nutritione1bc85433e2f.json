Weight and height\n\nIn routine pediatric practice, assessing growth typically involves monitoring both weight and height, as these two measurements provide important information about a child's overall health and development. Comparing these measurements to standardized growth charts can help identify potential issues such as undernutrition, overnutrition, or growth disorders. Head circumference may also be measured in infants and young children to monitor brain development, but it is not the sole indicator of growth in routine practice."
