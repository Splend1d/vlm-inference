Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) is indeed higher after weight gain, and part of the reason for this increase is due to the fact that some of the excess weight gained is fat-free mass (such as muscle), which requires more energy to maintain than an equivalent amount of fat.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that:\n\nA. BMR is typically measured under very controlled conditions, including after a long period of fasting (usually overnight), while lying down in a relaxed state, and in a thermally neutral environment. It's not usually measured in a comfortable sitting position.\n\nB. BMR is altered in cases of hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism. In hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid), the BMR tends to decrease, while in hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid), the BMR increases.\n\nD. BMR can be altered after weight loss, particularly if the weight loss includes a significant loss of lean body mass (muscle). This can lead to a lower BMR, as there is less muscle tissue to maintain, which requires less energy. However, if the weight loss is primarily from fat stores, the decrease in BMR may not be as significant."
