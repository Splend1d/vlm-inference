Cheating undermines the fairness and integrity of the game, deceives other players, and can result in unfair advantages or financial gain at the expense of others.\n\nIn scenario 2, filling up the gas tank with gasoline is a normal and expected action when operating a vehicle that runs on gasoline. This action is not considered morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. It is a routine maintenance task required for the proper functioning of the vehicle."
