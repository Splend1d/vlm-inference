In this case, the grantor (the environmentalist) has conveyed the property to the state with a provision that allows the grantor or their successors to re-enter and reclaim the property if it is used or developed for any commercial purpose or otherwise converted from its natural state, except for recreational, scientific, or educational purposes. This type of estate gives the state the right to use the property but also imposes a condition that, if violated, allows the grantor to reclaim the property."
