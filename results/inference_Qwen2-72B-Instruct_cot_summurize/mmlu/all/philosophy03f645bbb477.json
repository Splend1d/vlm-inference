According to him, \"good\" expresses the speaker's approval and is used to influence the attitudes of others. Therefore, none of the options A, B, C, or D are correct as they all refer to different types of uses that do not fit Stevenson's view. However, if we were to choose the closest option, it would be:\n\nC. dynamic use.\n\nThis is because Stevenson saw ethical language as serving a function of influencing the attitudes and actions of others, which can be seen as a type of dynamic use. However, it's important to note that Stevenson didn't use this exact terminology himself."
