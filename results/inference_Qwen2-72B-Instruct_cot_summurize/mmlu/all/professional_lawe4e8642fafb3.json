As a result, the husband drove to his friend's house with a loaded shotgun. Believing that his friend was in an upstairs bedroom, the husband fired the shotgun through the dining room window, as he only wanted to teach him a lesson. Unbeknownst to the husband, his friend's wife was in the dining room and suffered a minor gunshot wound. The husband should be found\n\nA. guilty of attempted murder of his friend's wife only.\nB. guilty of attempted murder of his friend only.\nC. guilty of attempted murder of both his friend and his friend's wife.\nD. not guilty of attempted murder of either his friend or his friend's wife.\n"

This action could be seen as an attempt to commit murder, even if his primary target was his friend.\n\n2. **Unintended Consequences**: Although the husband did not intend to shoot his friend's wife, the act of firing the gun into the house created a foreseeable risk of harm to anyone inside. In legal terms, this could be considered \"transferred intent,\" meaning the intent to harm one person can be transferred to another who is actually harmed.\n\n3. **Attempted Murder vs. Murder**: Attempted murder typically requires proof that the perpetrator took a substantial step toward committing murder with the specific intent to kill. Since the husband did not actually kill anyone, he cannot be charged with murder. However, by taking the step of firing the shotgun into the house, he could be charged with attempted murder.\n\nIt's important to note that actual charges and convictions would depend on the specific laws of the jurisdiction where the incident occurred and how the prosecution presents its case. Other possible charges could include assault, reckless endangerment, and weapons offenses."
