Poor technique, physical impairment, or lack of understanding.\n\nA nurse might think that a patient could not use an inhaler if they demonstrate poor technique when using it, have a physical impairment that makes inhaler use difficult (such as severe arthritis in the hands), or if they do not understand how to use the inhaler properly. Severe leg ulcers (option A) would not necessarily preclude a patient from using an inhaler, and previous recovery from an acute exacerbation of asthma (option B) or forthcoming surgery (option C) would also not necessarily prevent a patient from using an inhaler if they are otherwise able to do so."
