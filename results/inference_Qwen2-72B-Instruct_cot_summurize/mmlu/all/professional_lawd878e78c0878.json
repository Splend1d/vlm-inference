Soon thereafter, she had sex with her husband, who contracted the disease within a few days. The woman revealed the source to her husband, and he then sued the paramour for negligence in failing to tell the woman that he had the disease. The trial court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim. What will the appellate court decide?\n\nA. There is a cause of action because one who transmits a sexually communicable disease is strictly liable to all who contracts it.\nB. There is no cause of action because the wife assumed the risk that the paramour had a sexually transmittable disease.\nC. There is a cause of action because a person with a venereal disease has a duty to use reasonable care to avoid infecting others.\nD. There is no cause of action because the paramour's negligence was cut off by the wife's intervening negligence which became a superseding cause.\n"

There is a cause of action because a person with a venereal disease has a duty to use reasonable care to avoid infecting others.\n\nIn cases involving the transmission of a sexually transmitted infection (STI), the law generally imposes a duty on individuals to inform their sexual partners of any known STIs. This duty arises from the principle that one should not harm others through foreseeable risks, especially when the risk can be mitigated by disclosure. The paramour's failure to disclose his condition could be seen as a breach of this duty, potentially making him liable for negligence if the husband can prove that the paramour knew or should have known about the disease and that the lack of disclosure directly led to the husband contracting the disease."
