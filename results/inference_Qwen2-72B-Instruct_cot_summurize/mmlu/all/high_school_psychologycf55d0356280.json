Mania is characterized by an abnormally elevated, expansive, or irritable mood that lasts for at least one week and is accompanied by increased activity, energy, and impulsivity. It is often associated with bipolar disorder. Euphoria, on the other hand, is a term used to describe a feeling of intense happiness or well-being, which can be a symptom of mania but is not a disorder in itself."
