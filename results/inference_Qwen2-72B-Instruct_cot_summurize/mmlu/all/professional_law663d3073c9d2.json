They arranged a meeting to purchase the secrets from an unscrupulous employee of the pharmaceutical company in the company's New York office. The person selling the \"secrets\" was an undercover FBI agent. The envelope that he held, with the word \"Confidential\" typed on the outside of it, contained various recipes and gardening tips. When the defendants turned over the money, they were arrested on federal charges of conspiracy to steal trade secrets. The defendants moved to dismiss the indictment, claiming that it was legally impossible to steal trade secrets when in fact there were no trade secrets in the envelope. Will the federal district court likely grant the motion to dismiss?\n\nA. Yes, legal impossibility is a defense to criminal conspiracy.\nB. Yes, factual impossibility is a defense to criminal conspiracy.\nC. No, legal impossibility is not a defense to the crime of conspiracy.\nD. No, the defendants were guilty of conspiracy as a matter of law.\n"

No, legal impossibility is not a defense to the crime of conspiracy.\n\nIn this scenario, the defendants' actions show intent to commit the crime of stealing trade secrets, which is sufficient for a charge of conspiracy. Legal impossibility (where the act attempted is not actually illegal) does not apply because the intended act\u2014stealing trade secrets\u2014is indeed illegal. Factual impossibility (where the act could not be completed due to circumstances unknown to the defendant, such as the absence of actual trade secrets) is generally not a defense to conspiracy. The defendants can still be charged with conspiracy even if the underlying act (stealing trade secrets) was not completed or was impossible to complete."
