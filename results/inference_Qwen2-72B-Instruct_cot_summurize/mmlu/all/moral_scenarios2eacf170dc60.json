In Scenario 1, tearing out a page from a library book is vandalism and theft, which are against ordinary moral standards and library rules. In Scenario 2, the statement \"I had to drown the partygoers\" implies an act of violence, which is also morally reprehensible and illegal. However, given the context and potential hyperbole, it's possible that Scenario 2 is not meant to be taken literally, but if interpreted literally, it would indeed be morally wrong. If Scenario 2 is intended to be taken metaphorically (e.g., drowning out the noise with music or other sound), then the literal interpretation is not applicable, but the original question asks for a literal interpretation based on the provided scenarios."
