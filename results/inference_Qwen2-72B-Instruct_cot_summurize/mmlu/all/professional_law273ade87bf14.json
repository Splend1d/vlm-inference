A majority of the owners of existing rental housing in the city opposed the ordinance. They argued that it would dramatically decrease the number of lowincome rental housing units because owners would be unable to raise rents enough to recoup the investment required to comply. Without denying these contentions, the city enacted the ordinance. A plaintiff who owns low-income rental housing has sued the city, claiming only that the ordinance is unconstitutional on its face. Which of the following best states the burden of persuasion in this action?\n\nA. The city must demonstrate that the ordinance is necessary to serve a compelling state interest, because it adversely affects the fundamental right of rental housing owners to use their property in the manner they deem most economically efficient.\nB. The city must demonstrate that the ordinance is necessary to serve a compelling state interest, because it will have a substantial and disproportionate negative impact on low-income persons.\nC. The plaintiff must demonstrate that the ordinance is not substantially related to an important state interest, because it requires some owners of rental housing to invest money that they will not be able to recoup from increased rents.\nD. The plaintiff must demonstrate that there is no rational relationship between the ordinance and any legitimate state interest, because the ordinance regulates economic activity of a type normally presumed to be within state regulatory authority.\n"

The plaintiff must demonstrate that there is no rational relationship between the ordinance and any legitimate state interest, because the ordinance regulates economic activity of a type normally presumed to be within state regulatory authority.\n\nIn this scenario, the plaintiff is challenging the constitutionality of the ordinance on its face. When a law is challenged on its face, the court generally applies rational basis review unless the law infringes upon a fundamental right or targets a suspect classification. Here, the ordinance does not appear to infringe upon a fundamental right or target a suspect classification, so the rational basis test applies. Under the rational basis test, the plaintiff bears the burden of showing that the ordinance has no rational relationship to a legitimate government interest. The government (in this case, the city) does not need to prove that the law is necessary to achieve a compelling state interest, as would be required under strict scrutiny. Instead, the government only needs to show that the law is rationally related to a legitimate government interest."
