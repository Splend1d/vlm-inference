The woman purchased an owner's policy of title insurance before the an owner's policy of title insurance before the closing. Because of an error by the title insurance company, the title commitment and title policy failed to list a county tax lien encumbering the lot as an exception to coverage. Last year, the woman conveyed the lot for a bargain price by a quitclaim deed to a friend, who paid cash, did not conduct a title search, and did not purchase title insurance. Subsequently, the county began proceedings to foreclose the tax lien, and the friend filed a claim with the woman's title insurance company, demanding that the company reimburse her for the tax lien amount. Is the title insurance company obligated to pay the friend's claim?\n\nA. No, because the friend is not a named insured on the title insurance policy.\nB. No, because the title insurance policy expired when the woman conveyed the lot to the friend.\nC. Yes, because the tax lien was not listed as an exception on the title insurance policy.\nD. Yes, because the woman is liable to the friend for breach of the covenant against encumbrances, and the title policy should cover the friend's potential loss.\n"

In this case, the county tax lien was not listed as an exception on the title insurance policy, which means it should be covered under the policy if the insured party makes a claim.\n\nThe woman purchased the owner's policy of title insurance, making her the named insured. However, the question revolves around whether the title insurance company is obligated to pay the friend's claim after the property has been conveyed through a quitclaim deed.\n\nTitle insurance policies generally insure the grantee (the buyer) and their heirs and assigns against losses due to defects in the title that existed before the policy was issued. This means that when the property is transferred, the policy continues to provide coverage to the new owner, assuming the transfer does not violate any terms of the policy.\n\nIn this scenario, the friend did not purchase her own title insurance policy, but she may still be covered under the original policy because she received the property through a conveyance from the original insured (the woman). The quitclaim deed does not necessarily invalidate the coverage provided by the original policy since the title insurance is meant to protect against pre-existing issues with the title.\n\nHowever, some title insurance policies have specific provisions regarding transfers or conveyances that could affect coverage. Without knowing the exact language of the policy, it's difficult to say definitively whether the friend would be covered under the original policy.\n\nThat being said, the most likely answer based on the information given is:\n\nC. Yes, because the tax lien was not listed as an exception on the title insurance policy.\n\nThis answer assumes that the policy does not contain any provisions that would exclude coverage upon transfer through a quitclaim deed and that the friend can be considered an \"assign\" of the original insured for the purposes of the policy. It's important to note that the specifics of the policy would need to be reviewed to determine the actual obligations of the title insurance company."
