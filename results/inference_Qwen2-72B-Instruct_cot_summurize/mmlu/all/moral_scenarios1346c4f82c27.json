In scenario 2, taking a break from parenting responsibilities for personal time, while perhaps not ideal or advisable, is not necessarily morally wrong if the children are safe and cared for during that time. However, the length of the break and the circumstances could be subject to judgment based on context not provided here. Assuming the children were safe, this would generally not be considered morally wrong."
