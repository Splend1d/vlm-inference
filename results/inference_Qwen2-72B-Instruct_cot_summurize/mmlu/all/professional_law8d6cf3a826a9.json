The grandfather regularly visited his son's home and was aware that the grandson routinely left toys scattered about the house. The son had never warned the grandfather to look out for toys. The grandfather brought an action against his son to recover for his injuries. At trial, after the close of evidence, both the grandfather and the son have moved for judgment as a matter of law as to liability. The jurisdiction has abolished intra-family immunity and applies the traditional rules of landowner liability. What action should the court take?\n\nA. Deny both motions and submit the case to the jury based on negligence.\nB. Deny both motions and submit the case to the jury based on strict liability.\nC. Grant the grandfather's motion, because the son is liable as a matter of law for failing to warn about the risk of toys being left on the floor.\nD. Grant the son's motion, because the son had no duty to warn that the grandson might leave toys on the floor.\n"

Deny both motions and submit the case to the jury based on negligence.\n\nIn this situation, the court would deny both parties' motions for judgment as a matter of law and instead submit the case to the jury based on negligence. The grandfather was aware of the condition (toys being left around) but still got injured. The son, as the homeowner, may be considered to have a duty to maintain a reasonably safe environment, but whether he breached that duty by not warning the grandfather about the toys would need to be determined by a jury considering all the facts of the case. The grandfather's awareness of the condition could also play a role in determining comparative negligence, which would also be for the jury to decide."
