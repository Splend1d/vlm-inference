The entropy of the system and its environment remains unchanged.\n\nIn a reversible process, the system can be returned to its initial state without any change in the surroundings. This means that the entropy of the universe (the system plus the surroundings) remains constant. In other words, the total entropy change for a reversible process is zero. \n\nOption A is incorrect because there may be changes in the internal energy of the system during a reversible process depending on whether work or heat is exchanged with the surroundings.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the temperature of the system may or may not remain constant during a reversible process. For example, an isothermal reversible process occurs at constant temperature, but an adiabatic reversible process does not involve heat exchange and hence the temperature can change.\n\nOption D is incorrect because it describes an irreversible process where the total entropy of the system and its surroundings always increases."
