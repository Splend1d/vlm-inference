This often leads to strategic interdependence among firms, where they consider the potential reactions of their rivals when making decisions. The condition that best characterizes this aspect of oligopolistic behavior is:\n\nB. A rival firm matches price increases of rivals, but fails to match any price decrease of rivals.\n\nThis behavior is often observed in oligopolies because if one firm raises its prices, others may follow to maintain their profit margins. However, if a firm lowers its prices, the others might not necessarily follow suit, as they could try to maintain higher profit margins or avoid a price war. This phenomenon is sometimes referred to as \"price leadership,\" where one firm acts as a leader and sets prices, and other firms in the industry follow these lead changes."
