The use of a weapon (option D) is less typical of date rape scenarios compared to stranger rapes but is not unheard of. Date rape often occurs between people who know each other, possibly on a date or in a social setting, and may involve manipulation, coercion, or taking advantage of someone who is incapacitated due to alcohol or drugs."
