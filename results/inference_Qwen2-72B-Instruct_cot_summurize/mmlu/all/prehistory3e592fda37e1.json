Anthropology is holistic and integrative in its approach.\n\nAnthropology differs from other social sciences like economics and sociology in that it takes a holistic and integrative approach to studying human societies and cultures. Anthropologists consider various aspects of human life, including cultural practices, social structures, language, biology, and history, to understand the complexities of human behavior and society. In contrast, economics tends to focus on economic systems and behaviors, while sociology focuses on social structures and institutions. Anthropology often incorporates insights and methodologies from these disciplines but does so within a broader, more comprehensive framework."
