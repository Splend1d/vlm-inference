However, attempting to pursue your best friend's girlfriend could be seen as a breach of trust and friendship.\n\nIn scenario 2, giving a sick child an excessive amount of medication like Advil (ibuprofen), which can be dangerous and potentially life-threatening, is clearly morally wrong and also illegal due to the potential harm and medical risks involved. This action disregards the health and safety of the child."
