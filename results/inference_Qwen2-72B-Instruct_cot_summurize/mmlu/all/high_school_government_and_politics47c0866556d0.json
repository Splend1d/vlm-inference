Incumbents have a great advantage over challengers because they are better known and can raise campaign funds more easily.\n\nThis statement is true as incumbents typically enjoy several advantages when running for reelection, including greater name recognition, established networks for fundraising, and access to resources such as staff and infrastructure. These advantages often make it more difficult for challengers to mount successful campaigns against them. While A might be generally true under normal circumstances, C is a more universally applicable statement regarding the advantages of incumbency."
