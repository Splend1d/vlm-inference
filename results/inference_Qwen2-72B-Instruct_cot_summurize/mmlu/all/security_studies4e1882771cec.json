Securitization mobilizes popular support for policies in specific areas by calling them security relevant and encourages the allocation of more resources. This is because when an issue is framed as a security threat, it can lead to increased attention, funding, and policy action due to the perceived need for urgent and exceptional measures. However, it's worth noting that while A and B may be seen as potential outcomes of securitization, they are not universally accepted as benefits, as the process can also have negative consequences such as over-prioritization of certain issues at the expense of others, erosion of civil liberties, and lack of transparency and accountability."
