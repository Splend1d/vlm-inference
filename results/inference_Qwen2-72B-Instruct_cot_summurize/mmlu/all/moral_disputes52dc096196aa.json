He contends that even false opinions should not be censored because they can serve as a foil to test and strengthen true beliefs. Mill believes that truth emerges from the free exchange of ideas and that silencing any opinion, regardless of its veracity, can hinder the discovery of truth and the development of individual character. Therefore, he opposes censorship in cases where an opinion is true, false, or a mixture of both."
