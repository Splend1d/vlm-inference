Greenhouse gases trap heat from the sun in the Earth's atmosphere, leading to a warming effect known as the greenhouse effect. This effect is the primary driver of global warming and climate change. While the other factors listed can also affect the Earth's climate, CO2 emissions from fossil fuels are the most significant contributor to the projected rise in average temperatures."
