It can be used for all of the applications mentioned in your question:\n\nA. To identify a newly discovered virus: NGS can be used to sequence the genome of a novel virus, which helps in understanding its genetic makeup, evolution, and potential pathogenicity.\n\nB. To search for drug-resistant mutants: NGS can detect mutations in the genome of a pathogen that may confer resistance to drugs. This information can help in developing new treatment strategies or adjusting existing ones.\n\nC. To identify quasi-species viruses: Quasi-species refer to a collection of genetically diverse variants of a virus within a single host. NGS can help in identifying these variants and understanding their evolution and transmission dynamics.\n\nD. Cannot be used: This option is incorrect as NGS is indeed widely used in various fields of biology and medicine, including virology, cancer research, microbiology, and personalized medicine.\n\nIn summary, NGS is a versatile tool that can be applied to a wide range of research questions and clinical applications."
