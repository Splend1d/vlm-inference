It involves theft, which is against the law and considered unethical.\n\nIn Scenario 2, you did not do anything morally wrong by purchasing Joe's painting. The wrongdoing, if any, would be on Joe's part for stealing the painting back after selling it to you. Your action of buying the painting is not inherently immoral."
