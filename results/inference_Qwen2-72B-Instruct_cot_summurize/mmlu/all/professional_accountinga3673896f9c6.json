Among the options given, the matter that is most likely to be included in a comfort letter is:\n\nA. Negative assurance on whether unaudited condensed financial information complies in form with the accounting requirements of the SEC.\n\nComfort letters typically provide negative assurance regarding interim financial information that has not been fully audited. This means the auditor will state that nothing has come to their attention that causes them to believe the unaudited condensed financial information does not comply with the applicable accounting standards or regulations.\n\nThe other options (B, C, and D) are not typically included in a comfort letter. Option B relates to fraud risk assessment, which is outside the scope of a comfort letter. Option C provides positive assurance on changes in capital stock or long-term debt, but comfort letters usually provide negative assurance. Option D involves an opinion on the effectiveness of internal controls, which is covered in a separate report (such as a Section 404 report under Sarbanes-Oxley Act) and not typically part of a comfort letter."
