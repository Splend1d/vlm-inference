The other options listed are not structures found in the inner ear:\n\nA. Hammer (or malleus) is one of the three tiny bones in the middle ear.\nC. Tympanic membrane (or eardrum) is also part of the middle ear and marks the boundary between the outer and middle ear.\nD. Pinna is the visible portion of the ear on the side of the head, which helps to collect and direct sound waves into the ear canal."
