This can also be expressed as 1 mg of adrenaline per 1 mL of solution since the density of water, which is commonly used as a solvent, is approximately 1 g/mL.\n\nSo, the equivalent concentration is:\nA. 1 mg/mL\n\nThis means that option A is correct. The other options are not equivalent to a 1 in 1000 adrenaline solution:\n\nB. 1 mg/L would be much more dilute.\nC. 1 g/mL is 1000 times more concentrated.\nD. 100 micrograms/mL is the same as 0.1 mg/mL, which is 10 times less concentrated."
