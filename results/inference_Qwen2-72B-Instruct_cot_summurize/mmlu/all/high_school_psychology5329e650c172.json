Shaping involves reinforcing closer and closer approximations to a desired behavior until the final behavior is achieved. In this case, Coach Perry is starting with easy rolls and gradually increasing the difficulty as Lana becomes more skilled at stopping the ball. He is also providing positive reinforcement (praise) for successful attempts, which is consistent with the use of shaping."
