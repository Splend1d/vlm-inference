This process involves the direct differentiation of mesenchymal cells into osteoblasts without the formation of a cartilage model. The growth pattern they follow is largely somatic, meaning it is related to the growth of the body rather than the neural crest cells that contribute to the neurocranium (the part of the skull that encases the brain). Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. intramembranous ossification and follow the somatic growth pattern."
