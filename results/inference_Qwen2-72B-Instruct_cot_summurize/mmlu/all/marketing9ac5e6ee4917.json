It also assists in determining the level of resources that must be committed to each segment (option B), but the primary focus is on assessing the potential of each segment. Designing marketing strategies and tactics (option D) comes after this evaluation, and identifying specific members of each segment (option A) may be part of a later targeting or positioning phase."
