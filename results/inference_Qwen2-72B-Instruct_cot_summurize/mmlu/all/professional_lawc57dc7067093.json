                    "text": "A consumer purchased a new station wagon from a car dealer. The car dealer performed a thorough inspection of the station wagon before the sale was completed. One evening, the consumer was driving along a city street when he saw the traffic light facing him turn from green to amber. He sped up, hoping to cross the intersection before the light turned red. However, he quickly realized that he could not do so and applied the brakes, which failed because of a defect in the brake mechanism. The consumer then swerved to avoid hitting a bus that was crossing the intersection at a right angle to him. As a result of the swerve, the consumer's car rode up on the sidewalk and overturned, pinning a pedestrian. Both the consumer and the pedestrian were severely injured. If the consumer asserts a claim against the car dealer based on strict liability in tort, will the plaintiff prevail?\n\nA. Yes, because the brakes failed while the consumer was driving his car.\nB. Yes, because the brakes failed because of a defect present when the consumer purchased the car.\nC. No, because the consumer contributed to his own injury by speeding up.\nD. No, because the car dealer carefully inspected the car before selling it.\n"

Yes, because the brakes failed because of a defect present when the consumer purchased the car.\n\nThe principle of strict liability in tort applies to manufacturers and sellers of defective products that cause harm. In this case, if the brakes failed due to a defect that was present when the car was sold, the car dealer may be held strictly liable for the injuries caused, regardless of whether they performed an inspection or not. The fact that the consumer sped up does not necessarily absolve the car dealer of liability under strict liability principles, as the defect in the brakes is the direct cause of the harm. However, the consumer's actions might be considered in terms of contributory negligence, potentially reducing the compensation awarded but not necessarily eliminating the car dealer's liability."
