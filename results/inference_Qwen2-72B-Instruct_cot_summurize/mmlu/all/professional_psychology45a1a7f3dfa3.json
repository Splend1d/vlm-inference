Object permanence\n\nAt around 4 months old, infants are still developing the understanding that objects continue to exist even when they cannot be seen, heard, or touched. This concept is known as object permanence and typically develops between 8 and 12 months of age. Since the child looks at her mother instead of searching for the rattle under the blanket, it suggests that she has not yet developed this understanding."
