In addition to debridement of the burns, pain management, a thorough history and physical examination, and baseline laboratory studies, the most appropriate next step is to\n\nA. administer a 5% albumin infusion\nB. administer intravenous steroids\nC. contact child protective services\nD. discharge the patient home with his parents\n"

Accidental injuries in children can sometimes be indicative of neglect or abuse, and it is important to ensure the safety and well-being of the child. The fact that the child was able to turn on the hot water unsupervised and sustain significant injuries raises concerns about supervision and safety measures in the home environment. Child protective services can assess the situation further to ensure that the child is not at risk of future harm."
