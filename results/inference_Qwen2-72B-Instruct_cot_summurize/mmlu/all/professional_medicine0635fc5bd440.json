                    "text": "A 9-year-old boy is brought to the physician because of progressive weakness and a purple-red discoloration over his cheeks and upper eyelids over the past 8 weeks. His symptoms began shortly after a camping trip, and he now is unable to climb stairs, walk long distances, comb his hair, or dress himself. His mother says that she was careful to apply his sunscreen on the trip and can recall no tick bites or exposure to poisonous plants. His only medication is a topical corticosteroid for several dry, scaly patches of the skin. He appears weak and lethargic. He is at the 75th percentile for height and 25th percentile for weight; he has had no change in his weight since his last examination 9 months ago. His temperature is 37.7\u00b0C (99.8\u00b0F), blood pressure is 110/68 mm Hg, pulse is 105/min, and respirations are 28/min. Examination of the skin shows a purple-red discoloration over the cheeks and eyelids, periorbital edema, erythematous plaques and scales over the elbows and knees, and flat-topped red papules over all knuckles. There is generalized weakness and atrophy of the proximal muscles. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\n\nA. Dermatomyositis\nB. Duchenne's muscular dystrophy\nC. Eczema\nD. Lyme disease\n"

The clinical presentation described includes characteristic features of dermatomyositis such as a heliotrope rash (purple-red discoloration over the cheeks and eyelids), Gottron's papules (flat-topped red papules over the knuckles), erythematous plaques and scales over the elbows and knees, and proximal muscle weakness. These symptoms, particularly when they develop progressively over weeks, are indicative of dermatomyositis, an inflammatory myopathy characterized by muscle weakness and skin rash.\n\nDuchenne's muscular dystrophy typically presents with muscle weakness but without the characteristic skin findings seen in this case. Eczema would not explain the muscle weakness and the specific rash distribution. Lyme disease could present with a rash, but it does not typically cause the specific rash pattern or the muscle weakness seen in this case."
