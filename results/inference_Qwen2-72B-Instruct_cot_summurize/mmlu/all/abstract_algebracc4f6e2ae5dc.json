A permutation, on the other hand, is any rearrangement of a set of objects.\n\nStatement 1: \"Every permutation is a cycle.\" This statement is false because not every permutation can be expressed as a single cycle. For example, consider the permutation of four elements (1, 2, 3, 4) to (2, 1, 4, 3). This cannot be represented as a single cycle but can be expressed as the product of disjoint cycles, such as (1 2)(3 4).\n\nStatement 2: \"Every cycle is a permutation.\" This statement is true because a cycle is a special case of a permutation where the elements are cycled through in a specific order.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. False, True."
