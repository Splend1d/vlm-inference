The niece and her husband took immediate possession of the farm and lived there with their daughter and son. Thereafter, the husband died in an automobile accident. In 1972, two years after her father's death, the daughter moved to another state. The son lived with his mother on the farm until her death intestate in 1980. The son continued in exclusive possession of the farm until his death in 2001. In his will, the son devised the farm to a local charity. When he was alive, the son was unaware that his sister was still alive and that title to the farm had descended to the two of them as their mother's sole surviving heirs. Since his mother's death in 1980, the son has held himself out as the owner of the farm, maintaining it and paying all of the taxes on the property. The sister had not communicated with either her mother or her brother since her redomiciling in 1972. The jurisdiction in which the farm is located has a 20-year limitation period for the acquisition of property by adverse possession. What interest, if any, does the sister have in the property?\n\nA. None, because of her own laches.\nB. None, because the brother acquired title to the farm by adverse possession.\nC. An undivided one-half interest because the brother's possession was not adverse to her title.\nD. An undivided one-half interest because the 20-year limitation period did not run against her because she was unaware of the brother's exclusive possession.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is C. An undivided one-half interest because the brother's possession was not adverse to her title.\n\nWhen the mother died intestate in 1980, the property passed to her children (the sister and the brother) as tenants in common, each inheriting an undivided one-half interest in the farm. The brother's possession of the farm was not adverse to his sister's interest because they were co-tenants. The brother's actions were consistent with those of a co-owner, and he did not act in a manner that would exclude or deny the sister's rights as a co-tenant. Therefore, the brother did not acquire title to the entire farm through adverse possession, and the sister retains her undivided one-half interest in the property.\n\nAnswer A (laches) is incorrect because laches is an equitable defense that may be invoked when a party unreasonably delays asserting a legal right to the detriment of another party. However, laches requires more than just delay; it also requires that the delay has caused prejudice to the defendant. Here, there is no evidence that the sister's delay prejudiced the brother or anyone else.\n\nAnswer B (adverse possession) is incorrect for the reasons stated above. The brother did not acquire title to the entire farm through adverse possession because his possession was not hostile to his sister's interest.\n\nAnswer D (the 20-year limitation period did not run against her because she was unaware of the brother's exclusive possession) is incorrect because lack of knowledge does not stop the running of the statute of limitations for adverse possession. However, in this case, the brother's possession was not adverse to the sister's interest, so the statute of limitations for adverse possession is not relevant."
