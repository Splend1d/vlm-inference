Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nNeither scenario, by itself, necessarily implies that the main character has done something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. \n\nIn Scenario 1, throwing a shovelful of dirt into the house could be seen as destructive or disrespectful behavior if it was done without permission or for no good reason. However, without additional context (such as whether it was an accident during landscaping work, or if there was a valid reason for doing so), it cannot be definitively labeled as morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, cleaning a stain on a child's shirt with bleach might not be considered morally wrong if done safely and appropriately. Bleach is commonly used for stain removal, but care must be taken to ensure it is used in a well-ventilated area, away from children, and according to safety guidelines. If the bleach was used responsibly and did not harm the child or their clothing beyond repair, then this action would not be considered morally wrong. However, using bleach irresponsibly or in a way that could harm the child would be morally wrong. Without more information about how the bleach was used, we cannot label this action as clearly morally wrong."
