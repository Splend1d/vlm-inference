Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Maximization\n\nIn the context of the EM algorithm, the Expectation step calculates the expected value of the log-likelihood function, considering the current estimate of the parameters and the latent variables. This step remains essentially the same in both ML and MAP estimation. However, during the Maximization step, while ML estimation seeks to maximize the expected log-likelihood, MAP estimation aims to maximize the posterior probability, which includes the likelihood as well as the prior distribution of the parameters.\n\nThus, you would need to modify the Maximization step to include the prior distributions of the parameters, effectively changing the optimization target from just the likelihood to the posterior probability."
