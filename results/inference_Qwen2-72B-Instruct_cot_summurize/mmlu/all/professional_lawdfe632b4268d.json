Therefore, the testimony is:\n\nA. admissible as not hearsay.\n\nIt's important to note that the defendant's statement would need to meet other legal standards for evidence to be admitted, such as relevance and reliability, but the primary reason it is not considered hearsay is because it is not being used to prove the truth of the assertion that he was robbing a bank, but rather to demonstrate that he had a different location at the time of the alleged murder."
