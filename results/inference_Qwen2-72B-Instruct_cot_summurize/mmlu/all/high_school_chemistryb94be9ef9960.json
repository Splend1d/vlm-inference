Grind the copper penny into very small, dust-sized particles, and spray the particles into a Bunsen burner flame.\n\nThis is because grinding the penny into fine particles increases its surface area, which makes it easier for the copper to react with oxygen in the air when heated. The reaction will occur more readily and visibly compared to heating a solid penny, as the increased surface area allows for better contact with the flame and thus faster heating and reaction. \n\nIt's important to note that \"burning\" a copper penny typically refers to oxidizing it, where copper(II) oxide forms on the surface of the penny upon heating in air. Copper(II) oxide appears as a black layer on the surface of the penny."
