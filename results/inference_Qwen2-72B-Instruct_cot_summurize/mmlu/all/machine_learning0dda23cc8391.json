The L2 norm (also known as Ridge regression) does not typically produce zero coefficients but rather shrinks them towards zero. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. L1 norm\n\nHowever, given the options provided and considering the mislabeling of the choices, the correct selection from the provided options would be:\n\nD. either (a) or (b)\n\nBut it's important to note that in this context, only the L1 norm (option B) can actually result in zeroing out some of the coefficients. The L0 norm is not commonly used as a penalty term in optimization problems due to its computational complexity and discontinuity."
