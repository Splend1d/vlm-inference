According to the study results, alcohol consumption is strongly associated with lung cancer (OR = 2.5). The researchers then divide the study subjects into two groups: smokers and non-smokers. Subsequent statistical analysis does not reveal any association between alcohol consumption and lung cancer within either group. The scenario described is an example of which of the following?\n\nA.

When the researchers did not account for smoking status, it appeared that alcohol consumption was associated with lung cancer. However, when they divided the study subjects into smokers and non-smokers, the association disappeared, indicating that the initial observed association was due to the influence of smoking, not alcohol consumption itself."
