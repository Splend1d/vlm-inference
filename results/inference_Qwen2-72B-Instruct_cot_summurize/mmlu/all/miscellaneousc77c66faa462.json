JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group) is a lossy compression technique, meaning that it reduces the file size of digital photographs by eliminating some of the image data that is less noticeable to the human eye. This process can result in a trade-off between image quality and file size. While some detail and quality may be lost, the compression allows for much smaller file sizes, which is beneficial for storage and transmission."
