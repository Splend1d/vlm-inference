                    "text": "The answer is A. The friend's heirs.\n\nWhen the woman executed the deed in 2001, she conveyed the tract of land to her friend for life. This means that the friend had a life estate in the property, with the right to use and enjoy it during her lifetime. Since the friend died intestate (without a will), her interest in the property would pass to her heirs under the laws of intestate succession.\n\nThe fact that the friend died before the wheat she had planted could be harvested does not change the fact that she had a life estate in the property at the time of her death. Therefore, her heirs are entitled to the proceeds of the crop as part of her estate.\n\nThe contingent remainder in favor of the cousin and his heirs only becomes relevant if liquor is ever sold on the tract of land. Since there is no indication that this condition has been met, the cousin and his heirs do not have any current interest in the property. Similarly, the woman's reserved right to re-enter the tract of land and take back her property is not triggered unless the interest conveyed to the cousin is not valid, which is also not applicable in this scenario."
