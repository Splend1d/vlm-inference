Kass argues that reproductive cloning would involve an exercise of power over the cloned individual, as the cloner would be attempting to create a person with a predetermined genetic makeup and potentially predetermined traits or characteristics. This, he suggests, would be a form of despotism or tyranny over the cloned individual's future."
