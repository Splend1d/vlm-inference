It does not seem to be true.\n\nCurrent research in social psychology suggests that similarity, rather than difference, tends to foster attraction and liking between individuals. People are generally more attracted to others who share their attitudes, values, beliefs, and interests. This is known as the similarity-attraction effect. While there may be some exceptions or specific contexts where opposites might attract, the overall trend supported by empirical evidence is that similarity is a stronger predictor of interpersonal attraction. However, it's important to note that attraction can be complex and influenced by many factors beyond just similarity or difference in attitudes."
