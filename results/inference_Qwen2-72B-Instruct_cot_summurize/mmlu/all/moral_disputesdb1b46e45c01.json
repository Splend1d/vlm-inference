While some proponents of the death penalty argue that it serves as a deterrent to prevent future murders, there is no clear evidence to support this claim. In fact, studies have shown that states with the death penalty do not have lower murder rates than those without it. Therefore, preventing future murders is not a guaranteed or proven consequence of imposing the death penalty and cannot be considered a negative consequence. The other options listed (great financial cost, incitement effect, and the execution of innocent persons) are all potential negative consequences of the death penalty."
