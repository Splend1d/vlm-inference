This is largely due to the fact that this age group is more sexually active and may be more likely to engage in behaviors that put them at risk for HIV infection, such as having multiple sexual partners or using intravenous drugs. Additionally, individuals in this age group may not have access to or may not use prevention methods such as condoms, and they may not be aware of their HIV status or may not seek treatment until the disease has progressed to a more advanced stage. However, it's important to note that HIV/AIDS affects people of all ages and that efforts to prevent and treat the disease must target all age groups."
