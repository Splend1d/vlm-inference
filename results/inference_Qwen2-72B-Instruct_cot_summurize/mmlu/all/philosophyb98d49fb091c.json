However, this isn't an exact match with any of your options. If we have to choose the closest one, it would be:\n\nA. Life.\n\nThis is because Butler's argument focuses on the preservation of one's existence, which is most closely aligned with the right to life. But it's important to note that Butler's position is more nuanced than simply saying the right to life is the only right. He discusses the importance of considering the rights and needs of others in relation to one's own rights, emphasizing a balance and consideration of the common good."
