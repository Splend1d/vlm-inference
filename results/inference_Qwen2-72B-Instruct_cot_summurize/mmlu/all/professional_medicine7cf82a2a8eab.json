The infant was born at term via uncomplicated spontaneous vaginal delivery; he has been breast-feeding well and is urinating and having bowel movements normally. At birth, he weighed 3289 g (7 lb 4 oz; 30th percentile). Today, he weighs 3629 kg (8 lb; 25th percentile). He appears adequately hydrated. Vital signs are normal. Physical examination discloses white patches on the tongue and buccal mucosa that do not come off when gently scraped with a tongue blade.

Nystatin is an antifungal medication often used to treat candida infections in infants and young children. It can be administered orally as a suspension that the baby can swish around their mouth before swallowing. Fluconazole is also effective but generally reserved for cases resistant to nystatin or where systemic therapy is required. Acyclovir and valacyclovir are antiviral medications used for herpes simplex virus infections and would not be indicated for a fungal infection like oral thrush."
