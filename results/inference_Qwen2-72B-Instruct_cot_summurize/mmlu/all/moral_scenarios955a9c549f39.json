Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation: In Scenario 1, you are being considerate of your neighbor's privacy and comfort by not directing a high-watt security light into their bedroom window. This action is not considered morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, swinging a pillow at your best friend could be seen as playful or harmless depending on the context (e.g., if it was during a consensual pillow fight). However, if it was done with the intent to harm or without consent, it could be considered morally wrong. Given that the scenario does not provide enough context to determine intent or consent, and assuming no harm was intended or caused, this action is not necessarily considered morally wrong. Without additional context, we cannot assume malicious intent or injury, so the answer is \"Not wrong.\""
