Therefore, the distance it travels during this time is:\n\ndistance = speed * time = 24 m/s * 1 s = 24 m\n\nAt t = 1 second, the body begins to decelerate with an acceleration of -6 m/s^2. We can use the equation for position as a function of time for constant acceleration:\n\nx = x_0 + v_0*t + (1/2)*a*t^2\n\nwhere x_0 is the initial position, v_0 is the initial velocity, a is the acceleration, and t is the time elapsed since the acceleration began.\n\nIn this case, the initial position x_0 is the distance traveled in the first second (24 m), the initial velocity v_0 is the speed at t = 1 second (24 m/s), the acceleration a is -6 m/s^2, and the time t is 10 seconds (since we're looking for the position at t = 11 seconds, and the acceleration began at t = 1 second).\n\nPlugging these values into the equation gives:\n\nx = 24 m + 24 m/s * 10 s + (1/2) * (-6 m/s^2) * (10 s)^2\n  = 24 m + 240 m - 300 m\n  = -36 m\n\nTherefore, the answer is C: -36 m."
