Exercise increases blood flow to the brain, which can help with the growth of new brain cells and the strengthening of existing ones. It also reduces inflammation and insulin resistance, both of which can negatively impact brain health.\n\nB. Acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter that plays a role in memory and learning. However, taking acetylcholine supplements directly isn't typically done because it doesn't easily cross the blood-brain barrier. Some people take cholinergic supplements like choline or huperzine A, which can increase acetylcholine levels in the brain, but the evidence for their effectiveness in improving normal memory is mixed.\n\nC. Ginkgo biloba is an herbal supplement that some people use to improve memory and cognitive function. While some studies have suggested that ginkgo may have benefits for memory, the evidence is not consistent, and many studies have failed to show any significant effects.\n\nD. Increasing social contacts can also benefit memory and overall cognitive health. Social interaction can provide mental stimulation and emotional support, both of which can contribute to better brain health. Engaging in social activities can help maintain cognitive skills and delay age-related decline.\n\nSo, while all of these options might have some potential benefits for memory, aerobic exercise (option A) has the most consistent and robust evidence supporting its positive effects on memory and cognitive function in healthy individuals."
