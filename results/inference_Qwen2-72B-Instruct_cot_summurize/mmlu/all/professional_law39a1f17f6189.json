The owner told the woman that he was sorry but it was his policy not to cash Social Security checks. Terribly upset, the woman reached into her pocketbook and said, \"Listen, buddy, I've got a bomb in here, and if you don't give me the money, I'm going to blow up this joint. \" Actually, the woman did not have a bomb in her possession. The owner, who was not deceived by her threat, felt sorry for the woman and agreed to cash the check. The woman, who walked with the assistance of a cane, took the money and limped out of the store. After she left, the owner noticed that the woman had not endorsed the check. The woman has committed which, if any, of the following crimes?\n\nA. No crime.\nB. Robbery.\nC. Attempted robbery.\nD. False pretenses.\n"

Attempted robbery.\n\nUnder common law, attempted robbery occurs when a person takes substantial steps toward committing a robbery but does not complete the act. In this case, the woman threatened to use a bomb (a form of force) to obtain money from the store owner. Although she did not actually have a bomb, she made a credible threat that could instill fear in the owner. The fact that the owner was not deceived by her threat does not negate the attempt. Additionally, the woman's actions were interrupted before she could complete the robbery because the owner decided to cash the check out of pity rather than fear. Since the woman did not have the legal authority to demand or receive the money and used a threat to try to obtain it, her actions constitute an attempted robbery."
