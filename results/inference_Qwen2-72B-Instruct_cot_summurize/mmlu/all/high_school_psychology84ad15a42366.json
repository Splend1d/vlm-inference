Albert Bandura and other social-cognitive personality theorists propose that personality is shaped by the dynamic interplay among an individual's traits, their behaviors, and the environmental context in which they find themselves. This perspective emphasizes the role of learning through observation (modeling) and the consequences of behavior (rewards and punishments), as well as cognitive processes such as expectations and self-efficacy beliefs."
