According to this hypothesis, the nominal interest rate is approximately equal to the real interest rate plus the expected inflation rate. This relationship can be expressed as:\n\nNominal Interest Rate = Real Interest Rate + Inflation Rate\n\nThis formula shows that if the inflation rate increases, the nominal interest rate should also increase to maintain the same real (inflation-adjusted) return for investors. Conversely, if the inflation rate decreases, the nominal interest rate should also decrease to keep the real return constant."
