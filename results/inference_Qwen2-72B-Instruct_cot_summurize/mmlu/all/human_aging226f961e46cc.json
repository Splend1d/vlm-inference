While not being able to pick and choose diseases, understanding the links between diseases could allow for more personalized medicine approaches, where treatments are tailored to an individual's specific risk profile.\n\nTherefore, options A, B, and C are plausible outcomes based on advancements in understanding the links between diseases, but option D is not a realistic scenario.
