Therefore, the correct answer is A. egg. However, it's important to note that some forms of sterilization, like oophorectomy (removal of the ovaries), would indeed affect hormone production. But usually when people refer to \"female sterilization\", they're talking about procedures like tubal ligation which only prevent the movement of eggs from the ovaries to the uterus."
