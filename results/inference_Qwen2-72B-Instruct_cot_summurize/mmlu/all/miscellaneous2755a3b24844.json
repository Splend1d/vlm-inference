The correct answer is:\n\nE. red and yellow (Actually, the overlapping circles in the MasterCard logo are primarily red and blue, but since those options were not available, I chose the closest match.) However, it's important to note that the current Mastercard logo, which was updated in 2016, no longer features the traditional overlapping circles design. The new logo is more simplified and features the brand name in lowercase letters with the overlapping circles incorporated into the 'a' of 'mastercard'. The colors used in the new logo are primarily red and blue, but they are not as distinct as in the previous design. \n\nSo, the most accurate answer would be:\n\nF. red and blue."
