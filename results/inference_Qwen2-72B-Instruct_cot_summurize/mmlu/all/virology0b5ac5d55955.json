Bias\n\nBias refers to any systematic error in the design, conduct, or analysis of a study that leads to a mistaken estimate of the effect of an exposure on the risk of disease. It can occur due to various reasons such as selection bias, information bias, or confounding, which are specific types of biases. Confounding, mentioned in option A, is actually a type of bias where the observed association between an exposure and an outcome is distorted by the presence of another variable (confounder) that is related to both the exposure and the outcome. Interaction (option C) refers to a situation where the effect of one exposure on the outcome depends on the level of another exposure. Stratification (option D) is a method used in analysis to control for confounding by dividing the data into subgroups based on the confounding variable."
