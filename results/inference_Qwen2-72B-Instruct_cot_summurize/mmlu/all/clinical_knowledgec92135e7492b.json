Sensory loss is demonstrated in a stocking distribution\n\nIn peripheral neuropathy, sensory loss often follows a stocking-glove distribution, meaning it starts in the toes and feet and can progress upward, affecting the hands and arms as well. This pattern is due to the involvement of the longest nerve fibers first. Options B, C, and D describe findings that are more consistent with central nervous system disorders or upper motor neuron lesions rather than peripheral neuropathy."
