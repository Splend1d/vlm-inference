In an experiment, the control group should receive a procedure identical to that given the experimental group except for receiving the treatment under examination. The purpose of the control group is to provide a baseline against which the effects of the treatment can be compared. By ensuring that all other variables are held constant between the two groups, any differences in outcomes can be attributed to the treatment itself."
