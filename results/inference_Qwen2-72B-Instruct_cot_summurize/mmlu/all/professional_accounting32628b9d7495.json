In this case, we have three pairs to consider:\n\n1. (2,2) - This pair indicates a risk (standard deviation) of 2 and a return of 2%.\n2. (2,3) - This pair indicates a risk (standard deviation) of 2 and a return of 3%.\n3. (4,2) - This pair indicates a risk (standard deviation) of 4 and a return of 2%.\n\nA rational and risk-averse investor would prefer a higher return for the same level of risk or the same return for less risk. Based on this principle, the order from least to most favorable would be:\n\nFirst, (2,3) because it offers the highest return (3%) for the least risk (2).\nNext, (2,2) because it offers a lower return (2%) but also a low risk (2), which is still preferable to more risk for the same return.\nLastly, (4,2) because it offers the lowest return (2%) for the highest risk (4).\n\nSo, the correct order from least to most favorable is (2,3), (2,2), and then (4,2).\n\nThe answer is D.
