Not independent and, therefore, may issue a compilation report, but may not issue a review report.\n\nAccording to the AICPA's Code of Professional Conduct, an accountant must be independent when performing an audit or a review engagement. However, for a compilation engagement, the standards do not require the accountant to be independent. Nevertheless, having a direct financial interest in a client could impair independence if the engagement involves any level of assurance. Since a compilation does not provide any assurance on the financial statements, the accountant can still perform this service despite having an immaterial direct financial interest. However, this same allowance would not extend to a review or an audit engagement, where independence is required."
