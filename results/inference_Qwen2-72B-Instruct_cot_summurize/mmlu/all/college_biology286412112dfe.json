This results in multiple copies of a single chromosome being packed together, making them highly condensed and visible under a light microscope. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. multiple copies of a single chromosome\n\nAs for the other options:\nA. Polytene chromosomes can be active in transcription.\nB. Polytene chromosomes are not produced during mitosis but rather through a specialized form of cell division known as endomitosis.\nC. While it's true that there are repeated rounds of DNA replication, these do not result in nuclear division as in typical cell cycles."
