The site was lost for about 1,500 years before its initial rediscovery in 1599 and broader rediscovery almost 150 years later by Spanish engineer Rocque Joaquin de Alcubierre in 1748. The objects that lay beneath the city have been well-preserved for centuries because of the lack of air and moisture. This allowed for the creation of plaster casts of the bodies and objects that were left behind."
