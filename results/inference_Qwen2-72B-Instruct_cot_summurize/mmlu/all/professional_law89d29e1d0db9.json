The carpenter agreed to bid if the general contractor would agree to give the carpenter the job provided that his bid was lowest and the general contractor was awarded the main contract. The general contractor so agreed. The carpenter, incurring time and expense in preparing his bid, submitted the lowest carpentry bid. The general contractor used the carpenter's bid in calculating its own bid, which was successful. Which of the following best supports the carpenter's position that the general contractor is obligated to position that the general contractor is obligated to award the carpentry subcontract to the carpenter?\n\nA. The carpenter detrimentally relied on the general contractor's conditional promise in preparing his bid.\nB. The carpenter gave consideration for the general contractor's conditional promise to award the carpentry subcontract to the carpenter.\nC. The general contractor has an implied duty to deal fairly and in good faith with all bidders whose bids the general contractor used in calculating its main bid to the building owner.\nD. The general contractor has an obligation to the owner of the building to subcontract with the carpenter because the carpenter's bid was used in calculating the general contractor's bid, and the carpenter is an intended beneficiary of that obligation.\n"

The carpenter detrimentally relied on the general contractor's conditional promise in preparing his bid.\n\nThis answer best supports the carpenter's position because it highlights the principle of promissory estoppel. The carpenter incurred time and expense based on the general contractor's promise, reasonably expecting that if their bid was the lowest and the general contractor won the main contract, they would be awarded the carpentry subcontract. This reliance led the carpenter to expend resources on preparing the bid, which the general contractor then used to secure the main contract. Therefore, the general contractor should be held to their promise to award the subcontract to the carpenter to prevent unjust enrichment and to honor the reasonable expectations set by their conditional promise."
