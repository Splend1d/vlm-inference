The value of the 4 in the tenths place (0.4) is indeed 1/10 the value of the 4 in the tens place (40). This statement is true.\n\nB. The value of the 4 in the hundredths place (0.04) is indeed 1/10 the value of the 4 in the ones place (4). This statement is also true.\n\nC. The value of the 4 in the hundreds place (400) is indeed 10 times greater than the value of the 4 in the ones place (4). However, this is not what the statement says; it incorrectly compares the hundreds place to the ones place instead of the tens place. Therefore, this statement is false based on the exact wording.\n\nD. The value of the 4 in the tenths place (0.4) is indeed 10 times greater than the value of the 4 in the hundredths place (0.04). This statement is true.\n\nGiven the options, statements A, B, and D are all true according to the values and relationships between the digits in the number 444.44. However, since the question asks for one true statement, and considering common test logic where only one answer is correct, the most directly applicable answer based on the provided options would be D, as it uniquely fits the criteria without requiring comparison to another place value that is not immediately adjacent (as in A and B). \n\nBut if the question allows for multiple true statements, then A, B, and D would all be considered correct."
