Let's denote the total number of nodes as \\(N\\), and the height of the tree as \\(h\\). The height \\(h\\) is defined as the length of the longest path from the root to a leaf.\n\nGiven that the ratio of the lengths of any two root-to-leaf paths is bounded above by \\(c\\), it means that the difference in length between any two such paths cannot exceed a factor of \\(c\\).\n\nHowever, this condition doesn't directly limit the height of the tree but does suggest that all leaf nodes are within a certain depth range relative to each other.\n\nTo find the relation between \\(h\\) and \\(N\\), let's consider the maximum number of nodes at each level of the tree. A perfect binary tree of height \\(h\\) would have:\n\n- 1 node at level 0 (root),\n- 2 nodes at level 1,\n- 4 nodes at level 2,\n- ...\n- \\(2^{(h-1)}\\) nodes at level \\(h-1\\) (last level).\n\nSo, the total number of nodes \\(N\\) can be calculated as:\n\\[N = 1 + 2 + 4 + \\cdots + 2^{(h-1)}\\]\n\nThis is a geometric series with the sum:\n\\[N = 2^h - 1\\]\n\nSolving for \\(h\\), we get:\n\\[h = \\log_2(N + 1)\\]\n\nFor large values of \\(N\\), \\(N + 1\\) is approximately \\(N\\), so:\n\\[h \\approx \\log_2(N)\\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is closest to option A, which states:\n\\[h \\leq \\log_2(N)\\]\n\nThis result does not directly depend on the constant \\(c\\) because the condition regarding the ratio of path lengths doesn't affect the fundamental relationship between \\(h\\) and \\(N\\) in a strictly binary tree. However, the existence of such a bound \\(c\\) ensures that the tree is not extremely unbalanced, which is implicit in the height calculation based on \\(N\\).\n\nThus, the best characterization of the height \\(h\\) of any tree in this class, where \\(N\\) is the number of nodes and \\(N > 1\\), is:\n\\[h \\leq \\log_2(N)\\]"
