The more electronegative atom will have a partial negative charge and the less electronegative atom will have a partial positive charge. \n\nA. In O\u2014S, oxygen (O) is more electronegative than sulfur (S), so the negative end would be on the oxygen side.\n\nB. In Br\u2014N, nitrogen (N) is more electronegative than bromine (Br), so the negative end would be on the nitrogen side.\n\nC. In N\u2014C, nitrogen (N) is more electronegative than carbon (C), so the negative end would be on the nitrogen side.\n\nD. In P\u2014Cl, chlorine (Cl) is more electronegative than phosphorus (P), so the negative end would be on the chlorine side.\n\nTherefore, the answer to your question \"in which of the following is the negative end of the bond written last?\" is D. P\u2014Cl, as the negative end (chlorine) is written after the less electronegative atom (phosphorus)."
