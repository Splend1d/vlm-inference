Producing a heterokaryon\n\nA heterokaryon is a cell containing two or more genetically different nuclei within a single cytoplasm. This can be achieved by fusing two different cells, such as mouse and human cells, without the nuclear membranes breaking down and the nuclei merging (as would happen in a true hybrid cell). In this scenario, the plasma membranes of the two cells fuse, allowing for the mixing and observation of cell-surface proteins from both species in the same membrane plane."
