This deeper level of processing leads to better retention than simply attending to the sounds of the words, which would be considered a shallower level of processing (echoic features). Deep processing, which involves semantic encoding, tends to lead to longer-lasting memory traces compared to shallow processing, which might involve only surface or sensory characteristics of the stimuli."
