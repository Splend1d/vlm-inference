The blue and green wavelengths of light scatter more due to the Rayleigh scattering process, which involves light interacting with particles in the atmosphere that are much smaller than the wavelength of the light. This leaves the longer wavelengths, such as red and orange, to dominate the sky's color because they scatter less and can travel more directly to our eyes."
