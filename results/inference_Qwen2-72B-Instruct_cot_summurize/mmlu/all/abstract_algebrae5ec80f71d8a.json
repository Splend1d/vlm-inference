This implies the existence of an element of order 5.\n- Similarly, \\((a^5)^2 = e\\), meaning \\(a^5\\) has order 2 (since \\(a^5\\) squared equals the identity). This confirms the existence of an element of order 2.\n- An element of order 1 always exists in any group, which is the identity element itself.\n\nTherefore, **Statement 1** is **True**.\n\n**Statement 2**: If a group has an element of order 2 and an element of order 3, then it has an element of order 6.\n\n- The existence of elements of order 2 and 3 does not automatically imply the existence of an element of order 6.\n- The product of two elements of orders 2 and 3 does not necessarily have order 6 because the group operation may not preserve the direct multiplication of orders. For instance, in the group \\(\\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}\\) under addition, the elements [2] and [3] have orders 3 and 2, respectively, but their sum [5] does not have order 6\u2014it has order 6/5 = 6 (in terms of additive groups, the order of an element is often considered modulo the group size).\n- A counterexample to this statement can be found in cyclic groups. Consider a cyclic group of order 6 generated by an element \\(g\\), i.e., \\(G = \\langle g \\rangle\\). In this group, \\(g^2\\) has order 3 and \\(g^3\\) has order 2, but there's no guarantee that just because you have elements of order 2 and 3, there must be an element of order 6 unless the group is specifically structured to allow for this (like a cyclic group of order 6).\n- However, if the group is abelian and the orders of the elements are coprime, then the product of these elements will indeed have an order equal to the product of their orders. But without additional information about the group being abelian or the specific structure allowing for such a property, we cannot assert the truth of the statement based solely on the given conditions.\n\nTherefore, **Statement 2** is **False**.\n\nThe correct answer is **C. True, False**."
