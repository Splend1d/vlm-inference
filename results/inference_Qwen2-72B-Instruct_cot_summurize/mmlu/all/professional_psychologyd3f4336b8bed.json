According to this theory, children learn gender roles by observing and imitating others, particularly those who are rewarded for behaving in gender-appropriate ways. Parents, as primary role models, influence their children's gender-role identity development through differential treatment based on the child's sex.\n\nSocial learning theory suggests that children learn what is considered appropriate behavior for their gender by watching how their parents behave toward them and other family members. When parents engage in rough play with boys and are more protective with girls, they are modeling and reinforcing traditional gender roles. Boys may learn that being physically active and adventurous is acceptable for males, while girls might learn that being cautious and nurturing is expected of females.\n\nThus, the differential treatment of children by their parents based on gender is a key concept within the social learning theory of gender-role identity development."
