Vaccination increases the number of lymphocytes with receptors that can recognize and bind to the antigen.\n\nVaccines work by stimulating the immune system to produce memory cells (a type of lymphocyte) that can quickly recognize and respond to a specific pathogen if it is encountered in the future. This process involves the presentation of antigens from the vaccine to the immune system, which then generates a response that includes the production of antibodies and the activation of T cells. The result is an increased population of lymphocytes with receptors specific to the antigen, providing enhanced protection against the targeted pathogen."
