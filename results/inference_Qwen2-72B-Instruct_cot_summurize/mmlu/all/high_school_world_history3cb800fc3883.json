Albert Camus was a philosopher associated with the philosophy of absurdism, which explores the conflict between the human tendency to seek inherent value and meaning in life and the silent, indifferent universe that offers no answers. This excerpt reflects Camus's view that humans cannot find meaning outside of their own existence and must create their own meaning within the human condition. This perspective aligns with broader modernist tendencies to challenge traditional religious beliefs and explore the limitations of human understanding."
