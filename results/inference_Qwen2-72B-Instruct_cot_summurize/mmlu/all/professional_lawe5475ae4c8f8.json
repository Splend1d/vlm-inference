The homeowner made an offer that proposed a unilateral contract, and the roofer manifested an intent to accept the offer when he began performance by unloading the materials and equipment at the homeowner's house.\n\nA unilateral contract is one where there is a promise in exchange for an act. In this case, the homeowner offered to pay $5,000 in exchange for the roofer replacing the tiles on the roof. The roofer accepted this offer by beginning the work, which is the act that completes the formation of the unilateral contract. Once the roofer started unloading the materials and equipment, he was in the process of performing the act required by the homeowner's offer, making it irrevocable.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the purchase of materials does not necessarily constitute acceptance or the formation of a bilateral contract; it is merely preparation for potential performance.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the roofer's statement \"Sure, if I can clear my busy schedule\" does not constitute acceptance of the offer; it is a conditional response that does not commit the roofer to performing the work.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the formation of a unilateral contract occurs when the act begins, not when the roofer purchases the materials. The purchase of materials is not the act required by the offer; it is merely preparatory. The act required by the offer is the replacement of the roof tiles, which the roofer began by unloading the materials at the homeowner's house."
