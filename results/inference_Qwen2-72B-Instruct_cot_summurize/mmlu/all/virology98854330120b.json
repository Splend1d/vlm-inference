This discovery was significant because it showed that information could flow from RNA back to DNA, which was previously thought to be impossible. This process is now known as reverse transcription and has been critical in understanding retroviruses such as HIV. David Baltimore was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1975 for this work."
