The Court held that immunity trumped the right to a fair trial.\n\nThe court found that Kuwait's ambassador to Belgium and Luxembourg had immunity from criminal prosecution under international law for alleged torture committed in Kuwait. This decision was based on the principle of state immunity, which protects foreign states and their officials from legal proceedings in another state's courts. However, this ruling has been criticized by some as being at odds with the principle of universal jurisdiction for serious human rights violations. It should be noted that the case dealt with issues of diplomatic and state immunity rather than personal immunity of an individual official."
