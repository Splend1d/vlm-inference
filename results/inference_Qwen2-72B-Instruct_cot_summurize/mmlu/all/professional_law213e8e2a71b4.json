At trial, the insurer called as an expert witness an engineer, who testified that the pipe had burst because of age rather than freezing. On cross-examination, the engineer admitted that five years earlier, he had been convicted of tax fraud, even though he had asserted that it was his accountant's error. In response, the insurer calls a witness, who is well acquainted with the engineer and his reputation, to testify that (1) in the witness's opinion, the engineer is a truthful person, and (2) the engineer's neighbors all describe him as a truthful person. How much, if any, of the witness's testimony is admissible?\n\nA. All of the testimony is admissible to support the engineer's credibility.\nB. Only the portion concerning the engineer's reputation is admissible, because where both opinion and reputation evidence are available, only the latter is admissible under a rule of preference.\nC. Only the portion concerning the witness's opinion of the engineer's character, because the witness's reporting of the neighbors' comments is hearsay.\nD. None of the testimony is admissible, because it is collateral, having no bearing on the engineer's qualifications as an expert.\n"

                    "text": "The admissibility of the witness's testimony regarding the engineer's credibility is governed by the rules of evidence, particularly those concerning character evidence and its relevance to witness credibility. When a witness's credibility has been attacked by evidence of a prior conviction for a crime involving dishonesty or false statement, Rule 608(a) of the Federal Rules of Evidence allows for rehabilitation through evidence of the witness\u2019s character for truthfulness. This can be done by:\n\n1. Opinion evidence about the witness's character for truthfulness.\n2. Evidence of the witness's reputation for having such a character.\n\nHowever, specific instances of the witness's conduct, other than convictions for crimes, may not be proved by extrinsic evidence to attack or support the witness\u2019s character for truthfulness. The witness's testimony about what the engineer's neighbors say about him would be considered hearsay and would not be admissible for the truth of the matter asserted, but it could potentially be admissible to show the engineer's reputation for truthfulness among his community.\n\nGiven these considerations, the correct answer would be:\n\nB. Only the portion concerning the engineer's reputation is admissible, because where both opinion and reputation evidence are available, only the latter is admissible under a rule of preference.\n\nThis answer assumes that the court follows a rule of preference for reputation evidence over opinion evidence when it comes to character for truthfulness. However, some courts may allow both types of evidence, so the precise rule may vary depending on jurisdiction. The key point here is that the witness's direct report of what others say about the engineer would be hearsay and not admissible for its truth, but it could be admissible to show the engineer's general reputation for truthfulness."
