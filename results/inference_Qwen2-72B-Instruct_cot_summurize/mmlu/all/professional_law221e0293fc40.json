That evening, the buyer was preparing dinner and poured himself a glass of milk from the container purchased at the market. He then sat down to eat his meal and proceeded to take a mouthful of milk. As he did so, the buyer felt something furry lodge in his mouth. He immediately spat out the furry object and saw that it was a dead mouse. The buyer suffered severe emotional distress but did not suffer any physical illness or injury.

                    "text": "The correct answer is C. not recover, because the dairy's negligence only caused mental disturbance.\n\nIn most jurisdictions, to recover damages in a negligence case, the plaintiff must show that they suffered some form of physical harm as a result of the defendant's negligence. Emotional distress alone, without accompanying physical injury, is generally not sufficient grounds for recovery in a negligence claim. There are exceptions to this rule, particularly in cases involving food products where there is a high likelihood of foreseeable harm due to contamination, but these exceptions vary widely by jurisdiction.\n\nRes ipsa loquitur (option B) is a legal doctrine that allows a plaintiff to infer negligence from the very nature of an accident or injury in the absence of direct evidence on how any defendant behaved. However, even if res ipsa loquitur applies, the buyer would still need to demonstrate that he suffered a compensable injury, which in this case would typically require some form of physical harm beyond mere emotional distress.\n\nIt is worth noting that the buyer might have a cause of action under product liability law or breach of warranty, which may provide remedies for injuries caused by defective products, including emotional distress in certain circumstances. However, the question specifically asks about a claim based on negligent manufacturing, and thus options related to other causes of action are not considered here."
