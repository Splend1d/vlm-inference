Lack of informed consent: Participants were not fully informed about the nature of the experiment before it began. They were told they were participating in a study about learning and memory, but the true purpose of the study\u2014to investigate obedience to authority\u2014was concealed from them.\n\nD. Risk of psychological harm: Many participants experienced significant emotional distress during the experiment, with some showing signs of nervousness, sweating, trembling, and other symptoms of anxiety. The experiment placed participants in a situation where they believed they were causing harm to another person, which could have long-lasting psychological effects.\n\nThese two issues were the most significant ethical concerns raised by Milgram's study. However, it's worth noting that the study has also been criticized for potential bias due to nonrandom sampling (B) and for the fact that the identities of the participants were not kept completely anonymous (C), although these criticisms are not as central to the ethical debate surrounding the study."
