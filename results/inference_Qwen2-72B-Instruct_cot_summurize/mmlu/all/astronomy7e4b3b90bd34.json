It is, however, a direct consequence of Newton's law of universal gravitation, which was formulated after Kepler's time and explains the \"why\" behind Kepler's laws.\n\nKepler's three laws of planetary motion are:\n\n1. The orbit of a planet is an ellipse with the Sun at one of the two foci (Law of Ellipses).\n2. A line segment joining a planet and the Sun sweeps out equal areas during equal intervals of time (Law of Equal Areas).\n3. The square of the orbital period of a planet is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit (Harmonic Law).\n\nOptions A, B, and D are all consistent with Kepler's laws:\n\nA. This is Kepler's second law, stating that a planet sweeps out equal areas in equal times as it orbits the Sun.\nB. This is Kepler's first law, describing the shape of a planet's orbit as an ellipse with the Sun at one focus.\nD. This statement is a consequence of Kepler's second law; because the area swept by the line connecting the planet to the Sun must be constant over equal time periods, the planet must move faster when closer to the Sun (where the distance to sweep a given area is shorter) and slower when farther away (where the distance is longer)."
