He said to the roofer, \"We'll have a deal when you begin to do the work necessary for this job.\" The roofer did not directly respond to the offer but he went out and purchased the supplies and materials needed for the homeowner's specifications. When he arrived at the site with the supplies he found a message from the homeowner that he revoked the offer. Can the homeowner revoke the offer under these circumstances?\n\nA. Yes, because an offer for a bilateral contract can be revoked before its acceptance.\nB. No, because the act of purchasing supplies specifically for the homeowner's job was an effective acceptance and a contract was formed prior to homeowner's attempted revocation.\nC. No, because the offer had to remain open for a reasonable period of time before it could be revoked.\nD. Yes, because an oral offer to enter a bilateral contract is never enforceable.\n"

No, because the act of purchasing supplies specifically for the homeowner's job was an effective acceptance and a contract was formed prior to homeowner's attempted revocation.\n\nThe key point here is that the roofer took specific action in reliance on the homeowner's offer by purchasing supplies for the job. This action can be considered as an acceptance of the offer, forming a binding contract between the homeowner and the roofer. Once the roofer accepted the offer by his actions, the homeowner could no longer revoke the offer."
