The optimal span of control can vary widely depending on the situation, including factors such as the complexity of the work, the level of training and experience of subordinates, the need for coordination among subordinates, and the communication skills of the manager. \n\nHowever, in general, a commonly cited guideline is that an effective span of control is between 5 and 9 direct reports. This range allows a manager to provide sufficient guidance and oversight without becoming overwhelmed. \n\nTherefore, option C (7) could be considered a reasonable average for many situations, but it's important to note that there is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question. In some contexts, a smaller or larger span of control may be more appropriate. So, a more accurate answer might be D (None of the above), since it depends on the specific circumstances."
