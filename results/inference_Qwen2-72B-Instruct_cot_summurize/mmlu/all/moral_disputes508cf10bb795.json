This could be seen as fulfilling a duty related to property rights, which in turn can be considered a type of right to goods.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the question seems to be looking for a more general duty that corresponds to a right to goods and services, such as the duty to provide reasonable access to essential services like healthcare, education, or public utilities. None of the provided options clearly exemplify this type of duty."
