High-involvement purchases or High-involvement buying decisions.\n\nHowever, if we have to choose from the given options, then A. Durable goods might be the closest fit as they often involve significant financial investment and long-term use, leading to higher involvement in the purchasing decision. Examples include cars, appliances, and electronics, which consumers typically research thoroughly before buying due to their high cost and importance. \n\nIn marketing, high-involvement purchases refer to situations where the consumer is highly engaged in the decision-making process because of the product's importance, cost, or personal significance. These purchases often require extensive information search, evaluation of alternatives, and careful consideration of the implications of the decision. Consumers may feel a high level of perceived risk associated with these purchases, such as the fear of making an expensive mistake or the potential for negative social consequences. As a result, they tend to invest more time and effort into gathering information, comparing options, and making a well-informed decision."
