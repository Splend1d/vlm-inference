The liability should be measured at the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation.\n\nIn this case, since no amount within the range ($150,000 to $200,000) is more likely, the company would typically record the minimum amount of the range as the liability, which is the most conservative approach. This is because the company has an obligation to pay at least $150,000, and recognizing this amount would not overstate assets or income.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. $150,000\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that some accounting standards may require the recognition of a provision for the best estimate within the range, even if no specific amount is more likely. If this were the case, a mid-range amount such as $175,000 (option B) might be considered. But based on the information provided and the principle of conservatism, option C is the most appropriate choice."
