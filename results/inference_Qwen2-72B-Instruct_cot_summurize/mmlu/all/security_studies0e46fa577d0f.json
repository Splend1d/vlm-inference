HM regards capitalism as producing extreme insecurity in its disempowerment of the worker or labourer, from whom the ability to control labour or output is removed by the capitalist.\nB. HM regards the assertion by liberalists and realists that the capitalist economic sphere is non-political to be a misrepresentation, serving the interests of the unelected capitalist elite.\nC. HM regards the capitalist's accumulation of surplus value as a by-product of labour to be exploitation of those labourers by which the value was originally produced.\nD. All of these options.\n"

All of these options.\n\nHistorical Materialism (HM), often associated with Marxist theory, views capitalism through a critical lens that encompasses all the points mentioned:\n\nA. Capitalism is seen as creating insecurity for workers due to their lack of control over the means of production and the conditions of their labor. This alienation can lead to instability in their lives and a lack of power in the labor market.\n\nB. The claim by liberals and realists that the economy operates independently of political influence is challenged by HM, which argues that economic structures are deeply political and serve the interests of the capitalist class. This class maintains its dominance through various means, including the control of economic policies and institutions.\n\nC. The accumulation of surplus value by capitalists at the expense of the laborers who produce it is considered a form of exploitation. Surplus value is generated when the value of what a worker produces exceeds the wages they receive; this excess is then appropriated by the capitalist as profit.\n\nOverall, HM posits that capitalism is a system characterized by class struggle between the bourgeoisie (capitalists) and the proletariat (workers), where the former exploits the latter to accumulate wealth and maintain social and economic power."
