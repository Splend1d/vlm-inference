This situation can arise due to several reasons, but among the options provided, the most likely culprit is:\n\nC. Step size is too large\n\nA large step size (learning rate) can cause the optimization algorithm to overshoot the minimum of the loss function, leading to oscillations or divergence in the loss. As a result, the training loss may not only fail to decrease but might actually increase over time.\n\nWhile regularization can influence the training process, particularly if set incorrectly, it does not directly cause an increase in training loss. If regularization is too high (option B), the model might underfit, but this would typically manifest as both training and validation losses being high rather than the training loss increasing specifically. Similarly, if the step size is too small (option D), the model might learn very slowly, but it is less likely to cause an increase in training loss; instead, the loss might plateau without reaching the global minimum."
