Bond order is related to bond length; higher bond order typically corresponds to shorter bond lengths.\n\n1. **CO2 (Carbon Dioxide)**\n\n   - Carbon dioxide has a linear structure with carbon in the center and two oxygen atoms attached to it.\n   - Each carbon-oxygen bond is a double bond (\\(\\ce{C=O}\\)), meaning there is a bond order of 2.\n   - Double bonds are shorter than single bonds due to the stronger attraction between the nuclei and the shared electrons.\n\n2. **CO3^2- (Carbonate Ion)**\n\n   - The carbonate ion has a trigonal planar structure with one carbon atom at the center bonded to three oxygen atoms.\n   - Two of these bonds are single bonds (\\(\\ce{C-O}\\)) and one is a double bond (\\(\\ce{C=O}\\)).\n   - However, because of resonance, all three carbon-oxygen bonds are equivalent and have an average bond order slightly more than 1 but less than 2.\n   - This means the bonds are longer than a typical double bond but shorter than a typical single bond.\n\n3. **NO2^- (Nitrite Ion)**\n\n   - The nitrite ion has a bent structure with nitrogen in the center and two oxygen atoms attached.\n   - One nitrogen-oxygen bond is a double bond (\\(\\ce{N=O}\\)), and the other is a single bond (\\(\\ce{N-O}\\)).\n   - Due to resonance, the actual bond orders are intermediate between 1 and 2, similar to the carbonate ion.\n   - Therefore, the bonds are also longer than a typical double bond but shorter than a typical single bond.\n\n4. **NO3^- (Nitrate Ion)**\n\n   - The nitrate ion has a trigonal planar structure with one nitrogen atom at the center bonded to three oxygen atoms.\n   - All three nitrogen-oxygen bonds are equivalent due to resonance, with an average bond order between 1 and 2.\n   - Similar to the carbonate ion, the bond lengths are intermediate between those of a single and double bond.\n\nGiven this information:\n\n- **CO2** has the highest bond order (2) among these molecules for its carbon-oxygen bonds, indicating that it would have the shortest bonds.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. **CO2**"
