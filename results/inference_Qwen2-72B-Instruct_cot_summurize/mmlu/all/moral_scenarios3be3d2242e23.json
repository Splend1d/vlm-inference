In Scenario 2, attending an office Christmas party while having the flu could be seen as potentially irresponsible or thoughtless, but it is not necessarily \"clearly morally wrong\" unless you knew you were contagious and deliberately chose to put others at risk. However, given the context of the question, and without further information about the contagiousness of the flu or the potential impact on others, this action would not be considered clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. It's worth noting that with the advent of COVID-19 after 2020, the perception of attending social events while being sick has become more strongly viewed as irresponsible due to the heightened awareness of viral transmission."
