This was a significant finding in the field of psychology, showing that higher-order thinking is not exclusive to humans. In one famous experiment, Kohler placed a banana out of reach for a chimp and observed that the chimp was able to stack boxes on top of each other to reach the banana, indicating an understanding of the problem and how to solve it, rather than simply stumbling upon the solution through random actions."
