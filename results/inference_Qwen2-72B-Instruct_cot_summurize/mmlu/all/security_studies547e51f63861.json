Human migration will arise as a result of global inequalities in the distribution of power, wealth, and resources. Disempowerment of populations will lead to competition and violence, manifested in transnational movements; and environmental threats and resources scarcity will lead to conflict.\nB. Economic interdependency between states will strengthen global security and lead to a reduction in international conflict. Human migration will lead to overcrowding and resource scarcity but this will be addressed by the technological advancements of developing states to which most migration will take place.\nC. The primary cause of conflict, both at international and sub-national level will be based in ideological differences between populations as resources scarcity, population growth and human migration forces diverse identity groups into increasingly close contact.\nD. Environmental concerns will be overshadowed by immediate threats to international security, posed by global economic crisis and the subsequent rise of fundamentalist ideologies and violence. Human migration will be managed within the current global economic system as poverty restricts movement although there is a limited risk of transnational revolt as a result of disempowerment and resource scarcity.\n"

However, elements from all four answers can be considered when assessing how conflicts may evolve in the 21st century:\n\nA. **Human Migration and Resource Scarcity**: Global inequalities in power, wealth, and resources can indeed lead to human migration, which can exacerbate tensions and lead to competition and violence. Environmental threats and resources scarcity, such as water and arable land, can also become flashpoints for conflict.\n\nB. **Economic Interdependency and Technological Advancements**: While economic interdependency can potentially reduce conflict by creating mutual interests, it does not guarantee peace. Technological advancements might help address some resource scarcities, but they can also create new disparities and dependencies that could fuel conflicts.\n\nC. **Ideological Differences and Identity Groups**: Ideological differences and the clash of identities can indeed be significant drivers of conflict, especially as different groups come into closer contact due to migration and globalization. This can manifest in both international and sub-national levels.\n\nD. **Environmental Concerns vs. Immediate Threats**: While environmental concerns are critical, immediate threats like economic crises and the rise of fundamentalist ideologies can indeed overshadow them in terms of urgency. Human migration might be restricted by poverty, but the potential for transnational revolts due to disempowerment and resource scarcity remains a concern.\n\nGiven these considerations, it's clear that the future landscape of conflicts will be complex and multifaceted, influenced by a combination of factors including resource scarcity, economic dynamics, ideological differences, and environmental challenges. Understanding and addressing these issues will be crucial for maintaining global security in the 21st century."
