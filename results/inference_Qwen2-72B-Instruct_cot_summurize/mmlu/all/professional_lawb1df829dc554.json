Concerned about being able to fulfill contractual commitments, the president instructed his staff to deliver the defective lot. A cancer patient who had been maintained on the drug died shortly after beginning to take the defective pills. Medical evidence established that the patient would have lived longer had the drug been at full strength, but would have died before long in any event. The president was convicted of murder. On appeal, he argues that his conviction should be reversed. Should the conviction be reversed?\n\nA. No, because the intentional delivery of adulterated or mislabeled drugs gives rise to strict criminal liability.\nB. No, because the jury could have found that the president\u00d5s conduct was sufficiently reckless to constitute murder.\nC. Yes, because distribution of the defective lot was only a regulatory offense.\nD. Yes, because the cancer, not the president\u00d5s conduct, was the proximate cause of death of the patient.\n"

No, because the jury could have found that the president's conduct was sufficiently reckless to constitute murder.\n\nIn this scenario, the president knowingly and intentionally distributed a defective lot of medication despite knowing it could harm patients. This level of recklessness can be considered as a form of depraved indifference to human life, which can meet the legal standard for murder in some jurisdictions. The fact that the patient would have died eventually due to cancer does not absolve the president of responsibility for hastening the patient's death by providing ineffective medication. Therefore, the president's conviction for murder may stand if the jury found his actions to be sufficiently reckless."
