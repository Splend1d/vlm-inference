This carbon-14 then combines with oxygen to form carbon dioxide, which is taken up by plants and enters the food chain. While nuclear bomb tests during the 20th century did increase the levels of carbon-14 in the atmosphere for a time (known as the \"bomb pulse\"), this is not the primary source of naturally occurring carbon-14."
