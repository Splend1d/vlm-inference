One year after the neighbor died, her daughter executed a quitclaim deed conveying any interest she might have in the land to the woman's friend. The common law Rule Against Perpetuities is unmodified in the jurisdiction. There are no other applicable statutes. Who has what interest in the land?\n\nA. The friend has a fee simple absolute, because his life estate merged with the remainder conveyed to him by the daughter.\nB. The friend has a life estate and the charity has a vested remainder, because the neighbor's interest was devisable.\nC. The friend has a life estate and the daughter has a vested remainder, because the deed from the woman created an interest in the neighbor's heirs.\nD. The friend has a life estate and the woman has a reversion, because the neighbor's remainder was void under the Rule Against Perpetuities.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is B. The friend has a life estate and the charity has a vested remainder, because the neighbor's interest was devisable.\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. The woman originally owned the land in fee simple absolute.\n2. She conveyed the land to a friend \"for life,\" which means the friend has a life estate.\n3. When the friend dies, the land is supposed to go to the woman's neighbor \"and her heirs.\"\n4. The neighbor died and left her entire estate to a local charity through her will. This means that the charity has inherited whatever interest the neighbor had in the land.\n5. Under common law, the Rule Against Perpetuities does not apply here because the interest in the neighbor (and subsequently her heirs) vested before her death. The Rule Against Perpetuities prevents interests from vesting too far into the future, but since the neighbor's interest vested during her lifetime, it is not void under this rule.\n6. The neighbor's daughter, who would have been her only heir if she died intestate, executed a quitclaim deed conveying any interest she might have in the land to the woman's friend. However, since the neighbor's interest was devisable and went to the charity upon her death, the daughter did not have any interest to convey.\n7. Therefore, the friend retains his life estate, and the charity holds a vested remainder as the devisee of the neighbor's estate.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the friend did not receive a fee simple absolute; he still holds only a life estate. Option C is incorrect because the daughter did not have a vested remainder to convey, as the neighbor's interest went to the charity. Option D is incorrect because the neighbor's remainder was not void under the Rule Against Perpetuities."
