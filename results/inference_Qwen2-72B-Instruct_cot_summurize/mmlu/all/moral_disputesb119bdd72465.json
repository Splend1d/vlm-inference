Fine argues that even if we accept the importance of freedom of association, it does not necessarily follow that states have an unrestricted right to exclude immigrants. She contends that there are limits to the application of freedom of association in this context, and that other moral considerations, such as the rights and needs of potential immigrants, must also be taken into account."
