They see it as an ideological fa\u00e7ade for US imperialism.\n\nContemporary European liberal democrats may object to the influence of exceptionalism on American foreign policy because they view it as a justification for unilateral action and interventionism that can undermine international law and institutions. The idea of American exceptionalism, which holds that the United States has a unique role and mission in the world due to its history, values, and power, can be seen as a way to mask imperial ambitions and justify aggressive policies that prioritize US interests over those of other nations. This can create tensions with European countries that prioritize multilateralism, diplomacy, and respect for sovereignty in their own foreign policies."
