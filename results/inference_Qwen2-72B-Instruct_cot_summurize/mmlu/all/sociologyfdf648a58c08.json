It specifies the poverty line at a level set in the 1960s and adjusted since to reflect inflation.\n\nThe official poverty measure used by the U.S. government was developed in the 1960s by Mollie Orshansky, an economist for the Social Security Administration. The measure was based on a calculation that the cost of food represented about one-third of total family expenditures. Therefore, the poverty threshold was set at three times the cost of the minimum food budget required to sustain life. Since then, the poverty line has been updated annually for inflation using the Consumer Price Index (CPI), but the basic methodology has not changed. This means that the poverty line does not take into account non-cash benefits or regional differences in the cost of living, among other factors."
