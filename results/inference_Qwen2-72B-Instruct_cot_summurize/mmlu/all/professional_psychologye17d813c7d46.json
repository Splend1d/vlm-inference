This means that while most trainees will have improved their skills and knowledge as a result of the training program, the relative differences in ability between trainees may not have changed significantly. High-performing trainees before the program are likely to still be high performers after the program, while lower-performing trainees may still lag behind even if they have improved.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that the effectiveness of a training program can vary widely depending on factors such as the quality of instruction, the relevance of the material to the trainees' jobs, the trainees' motivation and prior experience, and the evaluation methods used to assess performance. In some cases, a well-designed training program may lead to significant improvements across the board, narrowing the gap between high and low performers. In other cases, poorly designed or implemented training programs may fail to produce any meaningful improvements in performance."
