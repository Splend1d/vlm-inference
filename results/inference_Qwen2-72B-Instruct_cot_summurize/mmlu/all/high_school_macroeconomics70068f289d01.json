This shift could be due to various factors such as higher input costs, natural disasters, or other events that reduce productive capacity.\n\nGiven an upward sloping aggregate supply curve, when it shifts to the left, it intersects the aggregate demand curve at a higher price level and a lower quantity of output. This is because the reduced supply leads to upward pressure on prices as demand outstrips supply, but the total amount of goods and services that can be produced decreases.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. The equilibrium price level increases while the equilibrium quantity of output decreases."
