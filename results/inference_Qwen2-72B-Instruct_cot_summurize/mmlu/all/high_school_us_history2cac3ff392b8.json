Anthony's speech \"I Stand Before You Under Indictment,\" delivered in 1873, where she discusses the disenfranchisement of women and their lack of representation under the law. However, the question asks about legislation designed to regulate the wealth and power of industrialists in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\n\nAmong the options listed:\n\nA. The Sherman Anti-Trust Act of 1890 was enacted to prevent anti-competitive practices and monopolies, thereby regulating the power of large corporations.\n\nB. The Interstate Commerce Act of 1887 aimed to regulate railroad rates and practices, addressing issues of monopoly power in transportation.\n\nC. The Federal Trade Commission Act of 1914 created the Federal Trade Commission to enforce antitrust laws and prevent unfair business practices.\n\nD. The Newlands Reclamation Act of 1902 was primarily concerned with water conservation and irrigation projects in the arid western states of the United States. It was not designed to regulate the wealth and power of industrialists but rather to promote agricultural development through federal funding for irrigation projects.\n\nThus, the answer is D. Newlands Reclamation Act (1902)."
