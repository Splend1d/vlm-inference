Therefore, option A is incorrect.\n\nDecreasing the concentration of \\(\\text{Fe}^{2+}\\) (option C) will have the opposite effect: the logarithm of a number less than 1 is negative, leading to a positive term when multiplied by \\(-\\frac{RT}{2F}\\), thus increasing the cell potential. Therefore, option C is correct.\n\nAdding more Fe(s) (option B) or removing some Fe(s) (option D) will not change the cell potential because the concentration of solid reactants does not appear in the expression for \\(Q\\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is **C**. Decreasing \\([Fe^{2+}]\\) would cause an increase in potential in the voltaic cell described by the reaction."
