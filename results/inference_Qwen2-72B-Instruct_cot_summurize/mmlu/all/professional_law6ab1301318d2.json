In this type of contract, the seller is responsible for delivering the goods to a specific location designated by the buyer. The risk and title transfer from the seller to the buyer only upon delivery at the specified destination.\n\nSo, the correct answer would be:\n\nB. Destination contract\n\nHowever, it's important to note that other terms mentioned in your question also refer to specific types of contracts or terms used in sales agreements:\n\n- A. F.A.S. (Free Alongside Ship) Contract: This term is used in international trade and means that the seller must deliver the goods alongside the vessel at the named port of shipment.\n- C. Shipment contract: This refers to a contract where the seller's obligation ends when they have delivered the goods to the carrier for shipment to the buyer. The risk of loss passes to the buyer once the goods are delivered to the carrier.\n- D. F.O.B. (Free On Board) Contract: This can either be an F.O.B. origin or F.O.B. destination contract. F.O.B. origin means the buyer assumes the risk and ownership once the goods are placed on the carrier at the seller's location. F.O.B. destination means the seller retains the risk and ownership until the goods reach the buyer's location."
