This can pose a risk for individuals with egg allergies, as they may experience a hypersensitivity reaction when vaccinated. For this reason, it's important to inform healthcare providers about any known allergies before receiving vaccinations. \n\nIt should be noted that newer influenza vaccines have been developed using cell-based technology or recombinant methods that do not use eggs, making them safer for those with egg allergies. However, at the time of writing, not all influenza vaccines are egg-free."
