None of the options provided directly matches this definition. However, the closest option would be:\n\nB. causing confusion during refutation because of a real or feigned lack of the ability to engage in refutation\n\nThis can sometimes be related to the fallacy of ignorance of refutation when one party pretends not to understand the argument or the evidence presented against their claim, thereby avoiding addressing the actual issues at hand. This can lead to confusion and a false impression that the original claim remains unrefuted.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that this option does not perfectly capture the essence of the fallacy of ignorance of refutation, which is more about the assumption of truth or falsity due to the absence of proof rather than the tactics used during an argument."
