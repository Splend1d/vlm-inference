Which of the following is true about water potential?\n\nA. An eager AP Biology student interested in studying osmosis and the movement of water in solutions took a dialysis bag containing a 0.5 M solution and placed it into a beaker containing a 0.6 M solution. It drives the movement of water from a region of lower water potential to a region of higher water potential.\nB. Solute potential is the only factor that determines the water potential.\nC. Pressure potential combines with solute potential to determine the water potential.\nD. Water potential always drives water from an area of lower pressure potential to an area of higher pressure potential.\n"

Pressure potential combines with solute potential to determine the water potential.\n\nExplanation:\nWater potential (\u03a8) is a measure of the potential energy of water at a particular location relative to pure water, which has a water potential of zero. Water moves from areas of higher water potential to areas of lower water potential. In this scenario, since the dialysis bag contains a 0.5 M solution and the beaker contains a 0.6 M solution, the water will move from the bag (higher water potential due to lower solute concentration) to the beaker (lower water potential due to higher solute concentration).\n\nA. This statement is incorrect because water moves from a region of higher water potential to a region of lower water potential, not the other way around.\nB. This statement is incorrect because water potential is determined by both solute potential and pressure potential, not just solute potential.\nD. This statement is incorrect because pressure potential does not solely determine the direction of water movement; it combines with solute potential to determine water potential, which then drives the movement of water.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: Pressure potential combines with solute potential to determine the water potential."
