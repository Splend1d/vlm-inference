Diabetes\n\nDiabetes is a group of metabolic diseases in which a person has high blood sugar (glucose) levels, either because the body does not produce enough insulin, or because cells do not respond appropriately to the insulin that is produced. This high blood sugar produces the classical symptoms of polyuria (frequent urination), polydipsia (increased thirst) and polyphagia (increased hunger)."
