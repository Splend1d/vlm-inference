According to this theory, if a behavior (in this case, engaging in intercourse) is followed by an aversive stimulus (pain), that behavior will be less likely to occur in the future. Therefore, in the context of experiencing pain during intercourse leading to a decreased desire for it, Skinner's theory would classify the pain as a form of punishment."
