They can be complex and costly to design, implement, and maintain due to the need for feedback sensors and additional components.\n\nC. If not properly designed, they can lead to oscillatory response or instability, where the system output fluctuates instead of settling at the desired value.\n\nA. While it is true that the overall gain of a system might be affected in a closed loop system, this is not necessarily always a disadvantage. In some cases, reducing the gain can improve stability. However, if the reduction in gain leads to a less responsive system than required, then it could be considered a disadvantage.\n\nTherefore, considering the options given, the correct answer would be D. All of the above, as each point can be a potential disadvantage depending on the context and specific requirements of the control system."
