For example, \\(\\mathbb{Z}_2[x]/(x^2 + x + 1)\\) is a finite field with four elements that extends \\(\\mathbb{Z}_2\\). Therefore, Statement 1 is true.\n\nThe second statement is also true. This is a consequence of the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra for fields, which states that every non-constant polynomial over a field has a root in some extension field. This can be proven using the concept of splitting fields in field theory.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\nA. True, True"
