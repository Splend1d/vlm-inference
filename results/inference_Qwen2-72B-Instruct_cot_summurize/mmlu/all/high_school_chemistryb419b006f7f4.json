Let's assume a total mass of 100g for ease of calculation.\n\n2. **Calculate the mass of NaOH and water**:\n   - Mass of NaOH = 50% of 100g = 50g.\n   - Mass of water = 50% of 100g = 50g.\n\n3. **Convert the masses to moles using molar masses**:\n   - Molar mass of NaOH \u2248 23 + 16 + 1 = 40 g/mol.\n   - Molar mass of H2O \u2248 2(1) + 16 = 18 g/mol.\n\n   - Moles of NaOH = 50g / 40 g/mol = 1.25 moles.\n   - Moles of H2O = 50g / 18 g/mol \u2248 2.78 moles.\n\n4. **Calculate the total number of moles in the solution**:\n   - Total moles = 1.25 moles (NaOH) + 2.78 moles (H2O) \u2248 4.03 moles.\n\n5. **Calculate the mole fraction of NaOH**:\n   - Mole fraction of NaOH = moles of NaOH / total moles \u2248 1.25 / 4.03 \u2248 0.3102.\n\nTherefore, the mole fraction of sodium hydroxide is approximately 0.3102 or 31.02%.\n\nAmong the given options, the closest answer is:\n\nC. 0.311\n\nThis matches our calculated value when rounded to three significant figures."
