The demographic transition refers to the shift from high birth and death rates to lower birth and death rates as a country develops from a pre-industrial to an industrialized economic system. This results in a decline in the birth rate, greater life expectancy, and an aging population. This transition typically occurs in five stages: high stationary, early expanding, late expanding, low stationary, and declining. As a country moves through these stages, it experiences changes in fertility, mortality, and population growth."
