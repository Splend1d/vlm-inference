They formed as gas giants beyond the frost line and then migrated inwards.\n\nHot Jupiters, which are massive gas giant planets orbiting very close to their host stars, are thought to have formed beyond the frost line (the region around a star where it is cold enough for volatile compounds like water, ammonia, and methane to condense into solid ice grains) where there was more material available to form large planets. After forming, these planets likely migrated inward due to gravitational interactions with the protoplanetary disk or other planets in the system. This migration brought them much closer to their host stars than where they originally formed."
