Instead, it seems to suggest that the expectations placed on SCNT individuals might not be significantly different from those placed on sexually reproduced children, which could be seen as a counterargument to one potential concern about SCNT. However, it does not address other potential objections related to the welfare of the child resulting from SCNT."
