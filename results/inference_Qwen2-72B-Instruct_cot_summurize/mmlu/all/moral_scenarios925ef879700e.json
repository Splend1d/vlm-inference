Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation:\nScenario 1: Backing a truck up into a lake might be considered destructive or wasteful behavior, but it is not necessarily morally wrong if the individual has permission to do so and there is no harm caused to others or the environment. If the truck belongs to them and there is no damage to public or private property, it could be seen as an unusual action rather than a morally wrong one.\nScenario 2: Shooting a hole in a strawman during gun practice is a common activity for target practice. It is not morally wrong if done in a controlled and safe environment with proper precautions taken. This scenario assumes that the gun practice is legal and conducted responsibly."
