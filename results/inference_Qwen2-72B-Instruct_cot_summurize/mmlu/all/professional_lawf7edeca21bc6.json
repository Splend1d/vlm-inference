Subsequently, the woman sued the driver of the vehicle to recover damages for her injuries. At trial, the woman calls a police officer to testify that a few minutes after the accident, a driver stopped him and said, \"Hey, officer, I just saw an accident involving a red truck that hit this girl who was riding a bicycle. The truck left the scene of the accident and I followed it to a warehouse. \" The police officer then testified that he immediately drove to the warehouse and saw the defendant sitting in a red truck that was parked in the lot. The driver is available to testify at trial. Upon objection by the defendant's attorney, the police officer's testimony regarding the driver's statement should be\n\nA. admissible as a statement of recent perception.\nB. admissible as a present sense impression.\nC. inadmissible, because the driver was available to testify at trial.\nD. inadmissible as hearsay not within any recognized exception.\n"

It must also be made while the declarant's recollection is clear and before there has been time to contrive or misrepresent. In this case, the driver's statement to the police officer about witnessing the accident and following the red truck meets the criteria for a statement of recent perception.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that some jurisdictions may classify this type of statement under the \"present sense impression\" category instead, which is similar but requires the statement to be made contemporaneously with the event or immediately thereafter. In this case, option B could also be considered correct depending on the jurisdiction's specific rules of evidence. But since only one answer can be chosen, A is the most appropriate choice based on the information provided."
