Neutral nitrogen (N, Z=7) has the electron configuration 1s\u00b2 2s\u00b2 2p\u00b3 in its ground state.\n\nIn the 1s and 2s orbitals, the electrons are paired, so their spins cancel out (total spin contribution is 0). In the 2p orbital, there are three unpaired electrons. Each electron can have a spin quantum number of either +1/2 or -1/2.\n\nSince these three electrons are unpaired, they all contribute to the total spin. If we take two of them to have the same spin direction (say, both +1/2), and the third one to also have the same spin direction, the total spin would be:\n\nS = 1/2 + 1/2 + 1/2 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. 3/2."
