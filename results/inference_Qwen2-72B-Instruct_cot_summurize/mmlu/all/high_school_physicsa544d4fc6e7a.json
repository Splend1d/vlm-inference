The acceleration of the ball is affected by air resistance, which decreases the acceleration below g.\"\n\nHere's why:\nA. The ball changing its shape would not significantly affect its velocity in free fall.\nB. The acceleration due to gravity does not vary significantly over the height range of 6 meters.\nC. Air resistance actually decreases the acceleration of the ball, not increase it.\nD. The acceleration of the ball under the influence of gravity alone is constant (g \u2248 9.8 m/s\u00b2). However, air resistance increases with increasing velocity, causing the effective acceleration of the ball to decrease.\n\nGiven the information, the most likely explanation for the discrepancy between the predicted velocity and the measured velocity is that air resistance has slowed the ball down more than was accounted for in the prediction, resulting in a lower velocity at the photogate than expected. Therefore, the correct answer would be something like \"D. The acceleration of the ball is affected by air resistance, which decreases the acceleration below g.\" However, since this option is not presented verbatim, none of the given answers are strictly correct."
