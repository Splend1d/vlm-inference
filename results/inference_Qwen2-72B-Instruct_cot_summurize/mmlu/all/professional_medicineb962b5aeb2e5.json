It is part of the limbic system and is involved in the formation and storage of emotional memories. When a person experiences a sudden, intense feeling of fear, it is likely that the amygdala has been activated. In this case, the patient's experience during the surgery suggests that his amygdala was stimulated, leading to the overwhelming feeling of fear."
