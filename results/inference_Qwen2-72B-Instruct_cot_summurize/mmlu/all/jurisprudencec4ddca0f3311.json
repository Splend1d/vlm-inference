We cannot objectively know what is morally right or wrong.\n\nDavid Hume, an 18th-century Scottish philosopher, was a skeptic when it came to the existence of objective moral truths. He argued that moral judgments are not derived from reason but rather from feelings and passions. This position is often summarized by his famous statement that \"reason is, and ought only to be the slave of the passions.\" In this view, Hume challenges the notion that there is a set of universal moral laws (such as those proposed by natural law theory) that can be known through reason alone.\n\nWhile the other options you've provided might relate to various philosophical debates, they do not specifically characterize Hume's critique of natural law. Hume did not argue that natural law is backward-looking, nor did he deny the existence of social contracts. Furthermore, his critique of natural law does not center around its ability to protect the state against attacks."
