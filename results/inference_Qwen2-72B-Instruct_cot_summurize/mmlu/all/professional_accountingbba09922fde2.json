Increasing the credit period from 30 to 60 days means that customers will have more time to pay their invoices. This will lead to an increase in the average collection period, which is the average number of days it takes for a company to receive payment from its customers after a sale has been made on credit.\n\nC. By offering a longer credit period, you may attract more customers or encourage existing customers to buy more since they have more time to pay. This could result in an increase in sales, as customers might prefer your company over others that offer shorter credit periods (assuming other factors are equal).\n\nB. A decrease in bad debt losses is not necessarily guaranteed. While some customers might appreciate the extended credit period and be more likely to pay, others might take advantage of the extra time and delay payments further, potentially increasing the risk of non-payment.\n\nD. Higher profits are not an immediate or guaranteed outcome of extending the credit period. While sales might increase, there could also be increased costs associated with financing the extended credit period and potentially higher bad debt losses, which could offset any gains from increased sales."
