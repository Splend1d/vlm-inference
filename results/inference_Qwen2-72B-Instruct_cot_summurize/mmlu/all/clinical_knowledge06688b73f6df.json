A raised TSH level.\n\nHypothyroidism, which is an underactive thyroid gland, typically results in a raised Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) level as the pituitary gland tries to stimulate the thyroid to produce more hormones. Options A and D can be symptoms of hyperthyroidism (an overactive thyroid), not hypothyroidism. Option B, pre-tibial myxoedema, is associated with Graves' disease, a form of hyperthyroidism."
