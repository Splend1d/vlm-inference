A morpheme can be a word by itself (like \"cat\" or \"am\") or it can be a part of a word (like the \"un-\" in \"uncle\" or the \"-ed\" in \"walked\"). Phonemes, on the other hand, are the smallest units of sound in a language, and semantics refers to the study of meaning in language. Phenotypes are not related to language; they refer to the physical traits of an organism resulting from the interaction of its genotype with the environment."
