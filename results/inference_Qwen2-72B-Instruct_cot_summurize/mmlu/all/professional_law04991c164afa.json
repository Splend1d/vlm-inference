After his meal, the defendant picked up a similar black leather jacket, believing it to be his own. The jacket he took, however, belonged to another customer. The defendant left the deli and walked a short distance before realizing he had taken the wrong jacket by mistake. He then returned to the deli and placed the jacket back on the coat rack. He found his own jacket, which had been partially hidden under a stack of other coats. If the defendant were arrested and charged with larceny of the other customer's jacket, he will most likely be acquitted because\n\nA. there was a mistake of fact.\nB. he returned the jacket after discovering his mistake.\nC. he lacked the requisite state of mind.\nD. there was no fraudulent conversion.\n"

Larceny, or theft, requires that the defendant intentionally take someone else's property with the intent to permanently deprive the owner of it. In this case, the defendant mistakenly took the wrong jacket, believing it to be his own, and returned it as soon as he realized the error. This shows that he did not have the intent to steal the jacket, thus lacking the mens rea (guilty mind) required for a larceny conviction. Additionally, A. there was a mistake of fact, which also supports the lack of intent to commit a crime."
