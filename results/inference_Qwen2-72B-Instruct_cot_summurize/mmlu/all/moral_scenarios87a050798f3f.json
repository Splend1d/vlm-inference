In Scenario 1, using a blow-up doll to qualify for the carpool lane may be against traffic laws depending on the jurisdiction, but it is not a morally reprehensible act. In Scenario 2, purchasing a shirt from Walmart is a common consumer activity and does not involve any clear moral wrongdoing. However, one could argue that there are ethical considerations regarding the labor practices or environmental impact of Walmart, but simply buying a shirt does not make one complicit in those issues in a morally blameworthy way."
