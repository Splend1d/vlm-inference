The biceps reflex is associated with the C5 and C6 spinal nerve roots. It is tested by tapping the biceps tendon while the patient flexes their elbow against resistance or relaxes their arm.\n\nB. This statement is not entirely accurate. When no reflex is elicited, it should be documented as \"absent,\" but this needs to be interpreted in the context of other clinical findings. Absence of a reflex can indicate an upper or lower motor neuron lesion depending on the accompanying signs and symptoms.\n\nC. This statement is incorrect. The triceps tendon should be struck at the back of the elbow, not in the antecubital fossa (which is the front of the elbow). Striking the triceps tendon tests the triceps reflex, which has a root value of C7 and C8.\n\nD. This statement is incorrect. Brisk finger jerks do not necessarily confirm a lower motor neuron lesion. In fact, brisk reflexes (hyperreflexia) typically indicate an upper motor neuron lesion. Lower motor neuron lesions usually result in hyporeflexia or areflexia."
