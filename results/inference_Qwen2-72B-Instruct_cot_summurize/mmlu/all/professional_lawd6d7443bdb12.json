On each of the Model 1 A snowmobiles produced, the manufacturer installed a speed-regulating device that prevented the snowmobiles from exceeding 50 m. p. h. The manufacturer distributed the snowmobile through wholesalers and retailers across the country. In its sales brochures and advertising materials, the manufacturer advises all of its distributors against making any modifications on snowmobiles without first conferring with the manufacturer's staff of engineers. The operator of a shop in a mountain community had the exclusive right to distribute Model 1A snowmobiles in the area. Amid complaints from previous buyers regarding Model lA's speed limitations, the operator removed the speed regulators from all the Model 1A snowmobiles in stock. A buyer purchased from the operator one of the Model 1A snowmobiles that had the speed regulator removed. One day, the buyer was driving the Model 1A snowmobile through a snow-covered field, at speeds in excess of 70 m. p. h. The snowmobile hit a snow-covered rock, causing the buyer to lose control of the snowmobile, crash into a tree, and suffer serious injuries. If the buyer institutes a strict liability in tort action, he will most likely recover against\n\nA. the manufacturer only.\nB. the manufacturer, even though it was unaware of the removal of the speed regulator.\nC. the operator only.\nD. both the manufacturer and the operator.\n"

However, the fact that the manufacturer advised against such modifications in their sales brochures and advertising materials may not completely absolve them of liability since they originally designed the snowmobile with the speed regulator for safety reasons.\n\nThe operator, who removed the speed regulator, clearly altered the product in a way that made it more dangerous than intended, and thus can also be held liable for the buyer's injuries. Since the operator's actions directly contributed to the accident, the buyer has grounds to sue the operator as well.\n\nStrict liability in tort law holds manufacturers responsible for damages caused by defective products, regardless of fault or negligence. In this scenario, the removal of the speed regulator could be considered a defect that led to the buyer's injuries. Both parties (manufacturer and operator) played roles in the chain of events leading to the injury, so the buyer can potentially recover damages from both."
