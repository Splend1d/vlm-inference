The amino acid score is calculated by comparing the amino acid pattern of the protein to that of egg protein.\n\nHowever, it's also important to note that (D) can be correct depending on the context and the specific scoring system being used. Historically, egg protein was often used as the reference standard, but more recently, WHO has recommended using the amino acid requirements of young children aged 6-24 months as the reference pattern because their requirements are higher than those of older children and adults. So, while A is traditionally correct, D reflects a more nuanced approach in contemporary nutritional science."
