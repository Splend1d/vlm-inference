It could be seen as a lapse in responsibility rather than a clear moral transgression.\n\nIn Scenario 2, making leather with the hides of endangered species is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. This action violates laws and ethical guidelines that protect endangered species and promote biodiversity conservation."
