This type of filing is often used by businesses that want to continue operations while they develop and negotiate a plan to pay off their creditors over time. It's a form of bankruptcy, but unlike Chapter 7, which involves liquidation of assets, Chapter 11 focuses on restructuring and potentially returning the business to profitability."
