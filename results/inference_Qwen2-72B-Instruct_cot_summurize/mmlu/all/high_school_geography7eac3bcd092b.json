Migration typically refers to the movement of people from one place to another with the intention of settling there permanently or for an extended period of time. In this case, Johnny and Susie are moving to Scotland to renovate and live in the family castle, which suggests that they are planning to settle there permanently. Crossing another country's borders (option A) can be a part of migration, but it is not the defining characteristic. Option B is not relevant to the definition of migration, and option D is not necessarily true for all migrations, as some may involve shorter stays."
