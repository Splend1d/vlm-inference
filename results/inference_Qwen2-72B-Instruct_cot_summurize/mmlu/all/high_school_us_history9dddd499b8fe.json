Marcus Garvey's words reflect his belief in the importance of self-determination for people of African descent and his advocacy for the return to Africa as a solution to racial oppression. He was a prominent figure in the Black Nationalist movement and advocated for the establishment of independent black nations in Africa. The excerpt highlights Garvey's call for a homeland for people of African origin, paralleling the nationalist sentiments expressed by various other ethnic groups at the time."
