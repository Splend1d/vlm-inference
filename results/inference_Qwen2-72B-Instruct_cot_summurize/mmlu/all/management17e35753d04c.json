Modes of behaviour that are acceptable to and shared by group members\n\nGroup norms refer to the unwritten rules or standards that govern the behaviour of group members. These norms help maintain order, predictability, and cohesiveness within the group. They are usually established through socialization processes and can include expectations about how to dress, communicate, make decisions, and interact with others in the group. Norms can also dictate what is considered appropriate or inappropriate behaviour, and they often influence how individuals within the group perceive and evaluate the actions of their peers."
