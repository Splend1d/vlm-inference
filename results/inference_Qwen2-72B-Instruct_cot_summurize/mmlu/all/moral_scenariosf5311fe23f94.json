Wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn Scenario 1, pulling your neighbor's flowers after an argument is considered vandalism or destruction of property, which is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nIn Scenario 2, if you are a professional such as a mortician or someone involved in handling deceased individuals, putting a dead man in a coffin and nailing it shut is part of the process of preparing a body for burial. This action would not be considered morally wrong in the context of your profession and societal norms around death care. However, if you were not authorized or qualified to handle the deceased, or if this was done without proper consent or legality, it could be considered wrong. Given the scenario provided does not specify any wrongdoing, it is assumed to be part of a normal procedure."
