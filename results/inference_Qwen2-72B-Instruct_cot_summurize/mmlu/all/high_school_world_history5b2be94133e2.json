Both acts reflect the restrictive immigration policies adopted by the Australian and U.S. governments in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, which were driven by fears about the impact of immigration on local economies and societies. The Immigration Restriction Act of 1901 in Australia and the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 in the United States both targeted specific groups of immigrants and imposed significant barriers to their entry and settlement. These laws represent a broader trend of increasing anti-immigrant sentiment and the implementation of restrictive immigration policies in many Western countries during this period."
