Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn scenario 1, while lying may not be considered a commendable action, saying one's stomach hurts to leave work early is generally not viewed as seriously morally wrong in the context of everyday minor deceptions. It might be seen as a white lie or a harmless fib, especially if there are no negative consequences for others.\n\nIn scenario 2, locking a gun safe while the parents are sleeping could actually be seen as a responsible action, particularly if it is done with the intention of preventing accidental access by unauthorized individuals, such as children. Without additional context suggesting malicious intent or potential harm to the parents, this action does not appear to be clearly morally wrong."
