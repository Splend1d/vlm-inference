They are used to convey a candidate's position on an issue or their overall message in a brief and memorable way. Because they are so concise, sound bites can help to capture the attention of busy voters who may not have time to watch lengthy campaign speeches or debates. However, they can also be criticized for oversimplifying complex issues and contributing to a superficial focus on image over substance in political coverage."
