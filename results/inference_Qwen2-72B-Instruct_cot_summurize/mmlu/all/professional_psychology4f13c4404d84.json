Equity/inequity\n\nWeiner's attributional style theory includes three dimensions: locus of control (internality/externality), stability (stability/instability), and controllability. The concept of equity/inequity is not part of this theory but is related to another theory known as equity theory, which focuses on how people evaluate their inputs and outcomes in social exchanges."
