This theory was a significant factor in shaping U.S. foreign policy during the Cold War, particularly in Southeast Asia. It suggested that if one country fell to communist rule, neighboring countries would follow like a row of dominoes, and thus the U.S. should prevent any single country from falling to communism to avoid a chain reaction."
