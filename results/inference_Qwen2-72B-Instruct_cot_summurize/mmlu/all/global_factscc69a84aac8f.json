However, this data isn't specific to just 13-15-year-olds and also includes other forms of bullying beyond just the past couple of months. There's no exact match in the options you provided, but if we have to choose the closest one, it would be:\n\nA. 26%\n\nBut note that this is an approximation and the actual number might vary. As of my knowledge cutoff in 2021, more recent data or more precise figures for the 13-15 age group specifically might have been published, but I can't provide that information."
