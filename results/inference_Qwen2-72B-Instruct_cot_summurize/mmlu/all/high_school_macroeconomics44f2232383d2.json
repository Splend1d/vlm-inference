                    "text": "Contractionary fiscal policy involves reducing government spending and/or increasing taxes, which leads to a decrease in the overall demand in the economy. This can have several effects on domestic interest rates and the international value of the dollar:\n\n1. **Effect on Domestic Interest Rates:**\n   - When the government implements contractionary fiscal policy, it reduces its borrowing from the financial markets (since it's either spending less or has more revenue due to higher taxes). This decreases the demand for loanable funds, putting downward pressure on interest rates.\n   - However, if the policy successfully reduces inflation expectations, this could also lead to lower interest rates as the central bank might not need to raise rates to control inflation.\n\n2. **Effect on the International Value of the Dollar:**\n   - A reduction in government spending or an increase in taxes can make the U.S. economy less attractive to foreign investors if it leads to slower economic growth. This could potentially reduce the demand for dollars in the foreign exchange market, leading to depreciation.\n   - On the other hand, if the policy successfully curbs inflation and interest rates remain stable or fall less than in other countries, the dollar might appreciate because lower inflation can make a country's currency more attractive to hold.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most direct initial impact of contractionary fiscal policy would be to decrease interest rates (as the government borrows less and inflation expectations may fall), and potentially lead to a depreciation of the dollar (if the policy reduces the attractiveness of the U.S. economy to foreign investors). However, long-term effects on the dollar's value could be more complex and depend on how the policy affects inflation, economic stability, and investor confidence compared to other countries.\n\nThus, based on the immediate effects, the closest answer would be:\n\n**D. Interest rates decrease and the dollar depreciates.**\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the actual outcomes can be influenced by many factors, including the actions of the central bank, global economic conditions, and market perceptions."
