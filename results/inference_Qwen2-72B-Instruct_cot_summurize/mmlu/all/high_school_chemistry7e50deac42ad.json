                    "text": "The false statement from the given list is D. The average speed of all the molecules is the same.\n\nExplanation:\nAccording to the kinetic molecular theory, the average kinetic energy of the molecules in a gas is proportional to the absolute temperature (T) of the gas. Since all three containers are at the same temperature, they have the same average kinetic energy. However, the average speed (\\(v_{avg}\\)) of the molecules depends on both the temperature and the mass of the molecules. It can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[v_{avg} = \\sqrt{\\frac{3kT}{m}}\\]\n\nwhere \\(k\\) is the Boltzmann constant, \\(T\\) is the temperature in Kelvin, and \\(m\\) is the mass of one molecule. Since the masses of helium (\\(m_{He}\\)), nitrogen (\\(m_{N_2}\\)), and carbon dioxide (\\(m_{CO_2}\\)) are different, their average speeds will also be different at the same temperature.\n\nGiven that:\n- Helium has a lower molar mass than nitrogen or carbon dioxide,\n- Nitrogen has a lower molar mass than carbon dioxide,\n\nit follows that the average speed of helium molecules is higher than that of nitrogen molecules, which in turn is higher than that of carbon dioxide molecules. Thus, statement D is false."
