Stomata are tiny pores that allow for gas exchange, but they also contribute to water loss through transpiration. A plant with fewer stomata would likely conserve more water because it has less surface area for water to evaporate from.\n\nIn a hot and dry environment (Option D), water conservation is critical for survival. Fewer stomata would help the plant reduce water loss, making it better adapted to such conditions. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Hot and dry"
