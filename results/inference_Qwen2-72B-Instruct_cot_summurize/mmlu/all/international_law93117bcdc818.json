In legal terms, it is the characteristic of a matter that makes it appropriate for determination through the judicial process. It involves the court's assessment of whether a dispute is one that can be resolved through the application of legal principles and whether the plaintiff has standing to sue. Thus, none of the options provided directly define justiciability, but option C comes closest in referring to the courts' assessment of whether the non-enforcement of a particular right conforms to principles of justice, which is part of the broader concept of justiciability. The correct answer would be:\n\nC. Justiciability refers to the courts' assessment of whether the non-enforcement of a particular right conforms to principles of justice\n\nHowever, this is an oversimplification of the concept. Justiciability also includes factors such as whether the issue presented is a political question, if there is a live controversy, if the plaintiff has suffered a concrete injury, and if the case is not moot or abstract."
