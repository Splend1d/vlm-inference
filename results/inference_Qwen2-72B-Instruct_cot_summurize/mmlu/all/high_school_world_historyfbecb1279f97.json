Enslaved man has multiplied his strength, [but] having become free, he has become unjust to his companion. Oh, women, women! When will you cease to be blind? What advantage have you received from the Revolution? A more pronounced scorn, a more marked disdain. If our leaders persist, courageously oppose the force of reason to their empty pretentions of superiority. Regardless of what barriers confront you, it is in your power to free yourselves!\nOlympe de Gouges, \"Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen,\" 1791\nThe independence? Nothing of what I hoped for was achieved. I had expected that my children would be able to have an education, but they did not get it. We were poor peasants then, we are poor peasants now. Nothing has changed. Everything is the same. The only thing is that we are free, the war is over, we work without fear\u2014but apart from that, nothing has changed.\nHalima Ghomri, interviewed in the 1970s, after Algeria's war of independence\nWhich of the following factors is likeliest to have prevented the sort of progress hoped for by the speaker in the second passage?\n\nA. Failure to eradicate Islamic traditionalism\nB. Lack of industrial assets or infrastructure\nC. Hostility to women's rights on the part of new elites\nD. Prioritization of national liberation over social reform\n"

Prioritization of national liberation over social reform\n\nThe passage from Halima Ghomri indicates that while the war for independence has been won and people can work without fear, there has been little improvement in the socioeconomic conditions, particularly concerning education. This suggests that the focus of the new government and society was primarily on achieving and consolidating national independence rather than implementing social reforms, such as improving education and the status of women."
