This can lead to unnecessary energy loss and potentially damage the furnace lining or affect the quality of the metal being processed.\n\nB. In direct core type induction furnaces, magnetic coupling between the primary and secondary circuit can be poor at higher frequencies due to skin effect and proximity effect. These effects cause the current to concentrate near the surface of conductors, reducing the effective cross-sectional area through which current flows and thereby increasing resistance and heat generation. At lower frequencies, these effects are less pronounced, allowing for better magnetic coupling and more efficient operation.\n\nTherefore, both reasons justify the need for low frequency supply in direct core type induction furnaces."
