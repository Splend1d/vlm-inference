For any \\(\\epsilon > 0\\), there exists \\(N_1 \\in \\mathbb{N}\\) such that \\(|s_n - s| < \\frac{\\epsilon}{(1 + |t|)}\\) for all \\(n > N_1\\).\n2. Similarly, there exists \\(N_2 \\in \\mathbb{N}\\) such that \\(|t_n - t| < \\frac{\\epsilon}{(1 + |s|)}\\) for all \\(n > N_2\\).\n\nNow, consider \\(|s_nt_n - st| = |s_nt_n - s_nt + s_nt - st| \\leq |s_n||t_n - t| + |t||s_n - s|\\).\n\nFor \\(n > \\max\\{N_1, N_2\\}\\), we have:\n\\[|s_nt_n - st| \\leq (1 + |t|)\\frac{\\epsilon}{(1 + |t|)} + (1 + |s|)\\frac{\\epsilon}{(1 + |s|)} = 2\\epsilon\\]\n\nThus, for any \\(\\epsilon > 0\\), we can find an \\(N = \\max\\{N_1, N_2\\}\\) such that \\(|s_nt_n - st| < 2\\epsilon\\) for all \\(n > N\\). Since \\(\\epsilon\\) was arbitrary, this shows that \\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}(s_nt_n) = st\\).\n\nTherefore, **Statement 1 is True**.\n\n### Statement 2\n\nThis statement claims that there exists a bounded sequence of real numbers with no convergent subsequence. This statement contradicts the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem, which states that every bounded sequence in \\(\\mathbb{R}^k\\) has a convergent subsequence.\n\nSince we're considering a sequence in \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) (a special case of \\(\\mathbb{R}^k\\) where \\(k=1\\)), according to the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem, every bounded sequence in \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) must have at least one convergent subsequence.\n\nTherefore, **Statement 2 is False**.\n\nThe answer is **B. True, False**."
