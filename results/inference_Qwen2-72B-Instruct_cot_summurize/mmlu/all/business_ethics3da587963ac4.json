Without knowing what those options are, it's impossible to give an accurate answer. However, I can provide you with some general strategies that organizations might use to head off negative publicity:\n\n1. **Proactive Communication**: Regularly updating stakeholders and the public about the organization's activities, successes, and challenges can help build trust and reduce the impact of negative news when it occurs.\n\n2. **Crisis Management Planning**: Developing a crisis management plan in advance can help an organization respond quickly and effectively to potential negative publicity, minimizing damage.\n\n3. **Transparency and Honesty**: Being transparent about issues and honest about mistakes can often mitigate the severity of negative publicity by showing that the organization is responsible and accountable.\n\n4. **Engagement with Media and Influencers**: Building positive relationships with media outlets and influencers can help ensure that the organization's perspective is represented fairly in coverage.\n\n5. **Monitoring and Early Detection**: Regularly monitoring social media, news, and other channels for signs of potential negative publicity can allow an organization to address issues before they escalate.\n\n6. **Legal Review**: Ensuring all communications and practices comply with legal standards can prevent legal issues that could lead to negative publicity.\n\n7. **Training and Preparedness**: Training staff on how to handle inquiries and potential crises can ensure that everyone responds appropriately during a negative publicity event.\n\nIf you can provide the specific options you're referring to, I can help you determine which ones would be most effective in heading off negative publicity."
