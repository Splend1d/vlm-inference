Both can be viewed as different means of achieving the same liberal ends\n\nExceptionalism, particularly in the context of American exceptionalism, is the belief that the United States is unique among nations due to its founding principles, history, and mission to promote democracy and freedom. This belief can underpin both isolationist and internationalist strategies, as both approaches can be seen as attempts to preserve or advance these perceived exceptional qualities.\n\nIsolationists may argue that the best way to maintain America's exceptionalism is by avoiding entanglements with other countries, which could dilute or compromise its values and principles. They might advocate for a focus on domestic issues and national sovereignty, believing that this approach will preserve the nation's unique character and allow it to serve as a beacon of liberty to the world without direct intervention.\n\nInternationalists, on the other hand, might argue that America's exceptionalism requires active engagement with the world to spread democratic ideals and protect global stability. They believe that the U.S. has a moral duty to lead by example and promote peace, democracy, and human rights internationally. This can involve forming alliances, participating in international institutions, and using military force when necessary to uphold these values.\n\nIn both cases, the underlying belief in American exceptionalism can motivate different strategic choices, but they are ultimately aimed at preserving and promoting the same perceived liberal ends of freedom, democracy, and individual rights."
