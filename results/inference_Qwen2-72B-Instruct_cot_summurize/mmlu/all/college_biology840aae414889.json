Lysosome\n\nProtein targeting to lysosomes often requires two distinct signal sequences: an N-terminal signal peptide for entry into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and a C-terminal sorting signal, such as the KKXX motif or mannose-6-phosphate modification, that targets the protein from the Golgi apparatus to the lysosome. This dual targeting mechanism ensures proper localization and function of lysosomal enzymes."
