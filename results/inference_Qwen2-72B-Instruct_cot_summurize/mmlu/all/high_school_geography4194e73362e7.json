The Gulf Stream brings warm waters to Great Britain, raising the temperature of winds that blow onto the island.\nB. Hot springs throughout the country raise the temperature of the surrounding land and air.\nC. Mountain ranges in the north of Great Britain act as a barrier to cold winds blowing from the Arctic.\nD. Small landmasses generate their own local climate and are largely unaffected by latitude.\n"

The Gulf Stream brings warm waters to Great Britain, raising the temperature of winds that blow onto the island.\n\nThis is the primary reason why Great Britain has a milder climate compared to other places at similar latitudes. The Gulf Stream, also known as the North Atlantic Drift, carries warm water from the Gulf of Mexico towards the British Isles, warming the coastal areas and moderating temperatures."
