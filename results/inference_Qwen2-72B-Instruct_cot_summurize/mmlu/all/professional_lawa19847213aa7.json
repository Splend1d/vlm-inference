The defendant approached a hit man to solicit his assistance in carrying out the planned murder. Although the wife believed that he was a hit man, he was, in fact, an undercover agent. The wife told the undercovr agent she would pay him $20,000 if he accepted the job and an additional $20,000 after the killing was completed. Upon hearing the wife's proposal, the undercover agent told the wife he would kill her husband. However, the undercover agent secretly intended not to go through with the plan, and he merely feigned agreement because he wished to trap the wife. The wife told the undercover agent that she would deliver the first payment the next day. However, before making the initial payment, the wife learned that the hit man was really an undercover agent. Fearful that she might be prosecuted for planning her husband's murder, the wife contacted the police and renounced her participation in the criminal endeavor. The defendant will most likely be found\n\nA. guilty of solicitation.\nB. guilty of conspiracy to commit murder.\nC. guilty of solicitation and conspiracy to commit murder.\nD. not guilty of either solicitation or conspiracy to commit murder.\n"

However, she did not complete the act of solicitation (i.e., paying the hitman/undercover agent) nor did she take any overt steps towards committing the murder beyond the agreement. Her renunciation of the criminal endeavor before any act was carried out may serve as a defense to conspiracy if it can be shown that she voluntarily and completely renounced her criminal intent and prevented the commission of the crime.\n\nHowever, renunciation is generally not a defense to solicitation, as the crime of solicitation is complete once the request to commit a crime has been made. In this case, the wife did make such a request to the undercover agent, even though he had no intention of carrying out the murder.\n\nTherefore, the defendant will most likely be found:\n\nA. guilty of solicitation.\n\nIt is important to note that the specifics of the law regarding solicitation, conspiracy, and renunciation can vary by jurisdiction, and a court would need to consider all relevant facts and legal precedents to make a final determination."
