                    "text": "A prisoner was serving a life sentence in a state prison as a result of his conviction for the murder of a child who had trespassed onto his farmland. The prisoner came from a family of farmers, dating back to at least 1750. His family believed that all nourishment comes from the ground and that one's soul will be saved only if his diet consists totally of natural, farm-grown food. The prisoner followed that belief and ate only fresh fruits and vegetables. He further believes that a higher power has commanded him to eat only vegetarian foods. When the prisoner entered the prison state prison officials agreed to grant his wishes and served him only fresh fruits and vegetables for his meals. After six months, deciding that catering to his special diet was overly burdensome and administratively unworkable, the officials decided to stop giving the prisoner special treatment and began to serve him the same food as served to the rest of the prison population. Although nothing physically prohibited the prisoner from eating and surviving on the general prison population's diet, he refused to eat the food that was not in conformity with his special diet. The prisoner's best constitutional argument to support his claim of the right to a fresh fruit and vegetable diet is based on\n\nA. the First Amendment.\nB. the Eighth Amendment's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment, as applied to the states.\nC. the Fourteenth Amendment's substantive due process clause.\nD. the Fourteenth Amendment.\n"

This amendment protects the freedom of religion, allowing individuals to practice their religion without government interference. In this case, the prisoner's dietary requirements are tied to his religious beliefs, which he argues have been commanded by a higher power. Thus, the prison's decision to cease providing him with a diet that aligns with his religious practices could be seen as a violation of his First Amendment rights.\n\nIt is worth noting that courts generally balance an individual's constitutional rights with the legitimate interests of the state, particularly in institutional settings like prisons where operational concerns can limit the exercise of those rights. However, the First Amendment argument would be the most directly applicable to the situation described."
