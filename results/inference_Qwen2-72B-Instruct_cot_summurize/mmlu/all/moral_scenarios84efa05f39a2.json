There may be circumstances where such denial could be justified or at least understandable.\n\nIn Scenario 2, tossing a ball at a catcher's mitt is a normal part of playing sports like baseball or softball and is not considered morally wrong under ordinary circumstances. It is an expected action within the context of the game."
