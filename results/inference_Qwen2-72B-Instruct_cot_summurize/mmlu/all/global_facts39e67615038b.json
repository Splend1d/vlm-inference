According to historical data from the World Bank, the US GDP per capita in 1950, when adjusted to 2011 international dollars (a common method for comparing economic indicators over time and across countries), was approximately $15,000.\n\nSo the correct answer is:\n\nC. About $15k\n\nHowever, it's important to note that exact figures can vary depending on the specific methodology used for adjustment and estimation. The number provided here is an approximation based on widely accepted economic data and adjustments."
