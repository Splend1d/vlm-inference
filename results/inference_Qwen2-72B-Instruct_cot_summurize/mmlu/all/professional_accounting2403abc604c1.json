This means that as of June 30, this bill represents a service received but not yet paid, thus creating a liability.\n\nThe period from June 16 to July 15 has an amount of $8000 and will be paid on August 1. This bill also represents a service received but not yet paid as of June 30, adding to the liability.\n\nTherefore, the total amount Dash Co. should report as a liability for utility bills on its June 30 balance sheet is the sum of the amounts for the two periods that have not been paid by that date:\n\n$6000 (for the May 16 to June 15 period) + $8000 (for the June 16 to July 15 period) = $14,000\n\nSo the correct answer is D. $14,000."
