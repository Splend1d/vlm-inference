In his essay \"The Land Ethic,\" Leopold argues that a purely economic approach to conservation fails to recognize the intrinsic value of all living things and their role in the ecological community. He suggests that conservation should be guided by an ethical principle that recognizes the interdependence of all living things and the need to maintain the health and integrity of the entire ecological system, not just its economically valuable components."
