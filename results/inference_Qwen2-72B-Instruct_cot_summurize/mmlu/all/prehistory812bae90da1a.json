This technique has been used to discover ancient roads, field systems, settlements, and other large features that have been modified over time.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that the other methods listed can also contribute to understanding large-scale land modifications in different ways:\n\nA. Test pits can provide information about soil stratigraphy and artifact distribution at specific points within a site, which can help interpret larger-scale modifications.\n\nB. Ground-penetrating radar (GPR) can detect subsurface features and changes in soil composition, which can indicate modifications such as buried structures or ditches.\n\nD. Proton magnetometers can detect variations in the Earth's magnetic field caused by buried features, which can also help identify large-scale modifications like ditches, walls, or hearths.\n\nEach of these methods has its strengths and is often used in conjunction with others to build a comprehensive understanding of archaeological sites."
