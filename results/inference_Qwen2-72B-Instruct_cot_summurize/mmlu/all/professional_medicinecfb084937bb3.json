When she stands up suddenly, she becomes light-headed and has to steady herself for approximately 1 to 2 minutes before she is able to walk. She has hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Current medications include glyburide, a diuretic, a \u03b2-adrenergic blocking agent, and an angiotensinconverting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. Her pulse is 55/min. Her blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg in the right arm and 70/50 mm Hg in the left arm while supine; her blood pressure is 70/50 mm Hg in the right arm and 50/30 mm Hg in the left arm immediately after standing. Neurologic examination shows no focal findings. An ECG shows sinus bradycardia with no evidence of ischemia. Carotid duplex ultrasonography shows reverse flow in the left vertebral artery with no evidence of occlusion. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?\n\nA. Cardiac stress scintigraphy\nB. Adjusting her medication regimen\nC. Warfarin therapy\nD. Transesophageal echocardiography\n"

The patient's symptoms of dizziness and hypotension upon standing (orthostatic hypotension) could be related to her current medication regimen. Medications such as diuretics, beta blockers, and ACE inhibitors can contribute to orthostatic hypotension, particularly when used in combination. Reducing the dose or changing one or more of these medications may help to alleviate her symptoms. It is important to note that any changes to her medication regimen should be done under the guidance of her physician. Cardiac stress scintigraphy, warfarin therapy, and transesophageal echocardiography are not indicated based on the information provided in this case."
