The value for nitrogen is greater than that of phosphorus because nitrogen is smaller, but less than that of oxygen because nitrogen has a smaller effective nuclear charge.\n\nElectronegativity generally increases across a period from left to right due to the decrease in atomic radius (nitrogen being smaller than phosphorus) and increase in effective nuclear charge. However, it also decreases as you move down a group because of the increased distance between the nucleus and the valence electrons (oxygen being more electronegative than nitrogen despite both having the same number of valence electrons, because oxygen's electrons are closer to the nucleus)."
