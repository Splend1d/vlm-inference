In scenario 2, helping a friend who is under house arrest to leave their home could be seen as aiding in breaking the law, but the morality of this action might be subject to debate depending on the circumstances that led to the house arrest. However, based on ordinary moral standards, simply helping someone escape legal confinement without considering the context would generally be considered wrong. Yet, given the question asks for a clear violation according to ordinary moral standards, and without further context that might justify the action in scenario 2 (such as if the house arrest was unjust), the initial judgment would lean towards 'wrong.' But for the sake of this categorization, and assuming the most common interpretation, scenario 2 is not automatically considered \"clearly morally wrong\" without additional context that justifies or condemns the action. Thus, the closest answer based on the information provided is B. Wrong, Not wrong."
