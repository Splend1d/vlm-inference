This process is widely believed to be one of the major cellular mechanisms that underlie learning and memory in the brain. When two neurons connected by a synapse are simultaneously active, the connection between them strengthens, making it easier for subsequent signals to pass from one neuron to the other. This strengthening of synaptic connections is thought to be a key mechanism by which information is encoded and stored in the brain, supporting the processes of learning and memory."
