(i), (ii), and (iii) only.\n\nExplanation:\n\n(i) A stationary process does indeed cross its mean value frequently, as it fluctuates around a constant mean without trending in any direction.\n\n(ii) One of the defining characteristics of a stationary process is that it has a constant mean and variance over time. This means that the statistical properties of the process do not change with time.\n\n(iii) A stationary process by definition contains no deterministic trend component. If there is a trend, the process is non-stationary until the trend is removed (for example, through differencing).\n\n(iv) This statement is not necessarily true for all stationary processes. Some processes are already stationary in levels and do not require differencing to achieve stationarity. Only certain types of non-stationary processes become stationary after being differenced once. Therefore, this characteristic does not apply to all stationary processes.\n\nThus, options (i), (ii), and (iii) are characteristics of a stationary process, but (iv) is not necessarily so."
