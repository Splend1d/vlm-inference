P2 louder than A2\n\nA loud P2 (pulmonary component of the second heart sound) can indicate increased pressure in the pulmonary artery, which can occur in pulmonary arterial hypertension. This finding can be a clue to the presence of pulmonary hypertension in a patient with a pulmonary embolism. However, it's important to note that this sign alone may not be sufficient to diagnose pulmonary arterial hypertension and further diagnostic tests such as echocardiography or right heart catheterization may be necessary.\n\nIncreased jugular venous pressure (option A) can be seen in various conditions including right heart failure, constrictive pericarditis, or severe tricuspid regurgitation, but it is not specific for pulmonary arterial hypertension.\n\nPeripheral edema (option C) can occur in many conditions, including congestive heart failure, renal disease, and venous insufficiency, and is not specific for pulmonary arterial hypertension.\n\nThe presence of an S3 (option D), a third heart sound, can indicate left ventricular dysfunction or volume overload, but it is not specific for pulmonary arterial hypertension."
