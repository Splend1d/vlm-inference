The candidate subsequently lost the election and sued the newspaper for defamation. The newspaper defended on the grounds of truth. At trial, the candidate took the stand and testified that he was not a thief. Thereafter, the newspaper called a witness to testify that three years ago the candidate committed a larceny while employed at his former job. Upon objection by the candidate's attorney, the witness's testimony should be\n\nA. excluded, because bad acts may not be proved by extrinsic evidence.\nB. excluded, because it is improper character evidence.\nC. admitted as probative evidence of the candidate's character for veracity.\nD. admitted as relevant evidence of the candidate's character as a thief.\n"

This is not merely character evidence being used to suggest that the candidate acted in conformity with a character trait on a particular occasion (which would generally be inadmissible under Federal Rules of Evidence 404(a)), but rather evidence that goes to the heart of the defamation claim. If the newspaper is defending on the grounds of truth, then evidence that the candidate has previously committed theft is directly relevant to the truthfulness of the statements made by the newspaper.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that even though the evidence might be relevant, it must also pass the test of Rule 403, which allows a judge to exclude relevant evidence \"if its probative value is substantially outweighed by a danger of one or more of the following: unfair prejudice, confusing the issues, misleading the jury, undue delay, wasting time, or needlessly presenting cumulative evidence.\" In this case, if the prejudicial effect of admitting such evidence outweighs its probative value, it could still be excluded. But based on the information provided, the most direct answer to the question posed is D."
