Ocean floor topography and the shape of the coastline serve to amplify tidal flow at specific localities.\n\nTidal ranges can vary significantly due to the configuration of the ocean floor and the shape of the coastline. In some areas, the coastline and seafloor channel the tide in such a way that it creates very high tides and very low tides, resulting in a large tidal range. This phenomenon is known as a funneling or amplification effect. For example, the Bay of Fundy in Canada has one of the highest tidal ranges in the world because its shape and orientation amplify the tidal forces caused by the gravitational pull of the Moon and the Sun. Conversely, in areas where the coastline and seafloor do not channel the tide in this way, the tidal range will be much smaller."
