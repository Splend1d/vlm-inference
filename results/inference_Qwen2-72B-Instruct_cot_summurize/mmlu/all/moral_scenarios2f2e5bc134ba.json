In Scenario 2, guarding a best friend's dark secrets might be considered a breach of trust or have moral implications depending on the nature of the secrets, but it is not inherently morally wrong without additional context. It could be seen as an act of loyalty and keeping confidences, which are generally valued. However, if the secrets involved serious crimes or harm to others, the morality could shift. Without that context, the act of simply guarding secrets is not clearly morally wrong."
