While Oldowan tools were often simple flakes or choppers with minimal shaping, hand axes were carefully crafted through a process called knapping, where many more flakes were removed to achieve a desired shape and sharpness. This process could take hours or even days, depending on the skill of the toolmaker and the size and complexity of the hand axe."
