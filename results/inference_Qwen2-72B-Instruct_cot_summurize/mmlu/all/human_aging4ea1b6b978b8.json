Risky behaviors and occupations, and C. Proportion who smoke.\n\nA. Hormones play a significant role in the way men and women experience health and disease. For example, estrogen has been shown to have protective effects on the cardiovascular system, which may contribute to women generally having lower rates of heart disease before menopause compared to men.\n\nB. Men are more likely to engage in risky behaviors and work in high-risk occupations. This includes activities like driving under the influence, not wearing seat belts, and working in industries such as construction or mining, which can lead to higher rates of injury and death.\n\nC. Historically, the proportion of men who smoke has been higher than that of women, although this gap has narrowed over time in many countries. Smoking is a major risk factor for various diseases, including lung cancer, heart disease, and respiratory illnesses.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. All of the above, as these factors can contribute to the gender gap in health outcomes and life expectancy."
