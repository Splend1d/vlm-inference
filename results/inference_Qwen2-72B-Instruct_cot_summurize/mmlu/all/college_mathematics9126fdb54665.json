                    "text": "To determine which statement is true, we need to find the critical points of the function \\(f(x,y) = x^2 - 2xy + y^3\\) by taking the partial derivatives with respect to \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), setting them equal to zero, and solving for \\(x\\) and \\(y\\).\n\nFirst, let's find the partial derivatives:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = 2x - 2y \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = -2x + 3y^2\n\\]\n\nSetting these equal to zero gives us:\n\n\\[\n2x - 2y = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad -2x + 3y^2 = 0\n\\]\n\nFrom the first equation, we can solve for \\(x\\) in terms of \\(y\\):\n\n\\[\n2x = 2y \\implies x = y\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\(x = y\\) into the second equation:\n\n\\[\n-2y + 3y^2 = 0 \\implies 3y^2 - 2y = 0 \\implies y(3y - 2) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives us two possible values for \\(y\\): \\(y = 0\\) or \\(y = \\frac{2}{3}\\). Since \\(x = y\\), the corresponding values for \\(x\\) are also \\(0\\) and \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\). So, our critical points are \\((0, 0)\\) and \\((\\frac{2}{3}, \\frac{2}{3})\\).\n\nNow, to determine the nature of these critical points (whether they are minima, maxima, or saddle points), we need to compute the second partial derivatives and evaluate the discriminant \\(D = f_{xx}f_{yy} - (f_{xy})^2\\) at each critical point.\n\nThe second partial derivatives are:\n\n\\[\nf_{xx} = 2, \\quad f_{yy} = 6y, \\quad f_{xy} = -2\n\\]\n\nAt \\((0, 0)\\):\n\n\\[\nD = f_{xx}f_{yy} - (f_{xy})^2 = 2 \\cdot 0 - (-2)^2 = -4 < 0\n\\]\n\nSince \\(D < 0\\), this indicates that \\((0, 0)\\) is a saddle point.\n\nAt \\((\\frac{2}{3}, \\frac{2}{3})\\):\n\n\\[\nD = f_{xx}f_{yy} - (f_{xy})^2 = 2 \\cdot 6(\\frac{2}{3}) - (-2)^2 = 8 - 4 = 4 > 0\n\\]\n\nSince \\(D > 0\\) and \\(f_{xx} > 0\\), this indicates that \\((\\frac{2}{3}, \\frac{2}{3})\\) is a relative minimum.\n\nTherefore, option D: \"f has an absolute minimum at (\\(\\frac{2}{3}, \\frac{2}{3}\\))\" is not necessarily true since it's only guaranteed to be a relative minimum without further information about the behavior of the function outside of the critical points. However, among the given options, D correctly identifies a relative minimum at \\((\\frac{2}{3}, \\frac{2}{3})\\), making it the best choice based on the information provided.\n\nSo, the correct answer is **D**. Note that without additional context, claiming this minimum to be absolute requires further proof, but within the scope of the given options, D is accurate regarding the existence of a relative minimum at the specified point."
