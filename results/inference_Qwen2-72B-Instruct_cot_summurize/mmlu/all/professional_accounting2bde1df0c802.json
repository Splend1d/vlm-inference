The preferred stock dividends amount to $5 per share for 10,000 shares:\nPreferred stock dividends = $5 * 10,000 = $50,000\n\nIncome available to common shareholders = Net income - Preferred stock dividends\n= $480,000 - $50,000\n= $430,000\n\nFinally, calculate EPS by dividing the income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares:\nEPS = Income available to common shareholders / Weighted average number of common shares\n= $430,000 / 150,000\n= $2.87\n\nSo the answer is B. $2.87."
