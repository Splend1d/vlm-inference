Real evidence, also known as physical or material evidence, consists of tangible objects or exhibits that are directly related to the case, such as weapons, marks, wounds, or photographs. Hearsay, on the other hand, refers to statements made outside of the courtroom that are offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted and are generally inadmissible under the hearsay rule unless an exception applies."
