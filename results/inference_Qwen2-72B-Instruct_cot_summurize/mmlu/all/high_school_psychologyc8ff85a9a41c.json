In Group I, each rat was raised in isolation with no toys, while in Group II, rats were divided into small groups and given toys to play with. Which of the following statements most accurately reflects the probable findings of this study?\n\nA. The rats raised in Group I will have forebrains that weigh more than those of the rats raised in Group II.\nB. The rats raised in Group I will have forebrains that weigh less than those of the rats raised in Group II.\nC. The brains of the rats raised in Group I will not be noticeably different from the brains of the rats raised in Group II.\nD. The brains of the rats raised in Group I will consist of more white matter, while the brains of the rats raised in Group II will consist of more gray matter.\n"

The rats raised in Group I will have forebrains that weigh less than those of the rats raised in Group II.\n\nThis statement is consistent with what has been found in similar studies on environmental enrichment. Rats (and other animals) that are provided with stimulating environments, social interaction, and toys tend to develop larger and more complex brains compared to those kept in impoverished or isolated conditions. This is because enriched environments promote neurogenesis (the birth of new neurons), synaptogenesis (the formation of new synapses), and myelination (the insulation of nerve fibers), all of which can lead to an increase in brain weight and complexity."
