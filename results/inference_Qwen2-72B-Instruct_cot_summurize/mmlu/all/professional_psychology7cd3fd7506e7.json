They have several uses, including treatment of anxiety, insomnia, seizures, and acute alcohol withdrawal. However, they must be used cautiously because they can lead to physical dependence and addiction. This dependence can make it difficult to stop taking the drugs without experiencing withdrawal symptoms."
