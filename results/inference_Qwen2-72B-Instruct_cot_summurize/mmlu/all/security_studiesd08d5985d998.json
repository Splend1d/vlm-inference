After its successful application during the Cold War, arms control has retained its momentum and applicability in the contemporary security environment.\n\nThis statement does not necessarily characterize arms control as a strategic policy because it makes a claim about the continued success and relevance of arms control that may or may not be true. While arms control was indeed a significant aspect of strategic policy during the Cold War, its effectiveness and applicability in the contemporary security environment can be debated. The statement assumes that arms control has remained as effective after the Cold War as it was during that period, which is a contentious point among scholars and policymakers."
