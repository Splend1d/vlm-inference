                    "text": "The answer is B. Yes, if the dominant intent of Congress was that the tax would produce revenue.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has established that Congress has broad power to levy taxes under the Taxing and Spending Clause of the Constitution (Article I, Section 8). A tax is generally constitutional if its primary purpose is to raise revenue rather than to regulate behavior. However, even if a tax has some regulatory effect, it can still be constitutional if the revenue-raising purpose is dominant.\n\nIn the case of the $100 tax on the sale of handguns, if the primary intent of Congress is to raise revenue and not merely to discourage or penalize handgun ownership, the tax is likely to survive a constitutional challenge. The Court has upheld taxes with incidental regulatory effects, such as the federal excise tax on machine guns and the Occupational Tax on dealers in firearms, which were both challenged but found constitutional in the landmark case of United States v. Sullivan (1937) and other cases.\n\nHowever, if the tax is so high that it effectively bans the sale of handguns by making them prohibitively expensive, it might be seen as a regulatory measure rather than a tax, and thus potentially unconstitutional. But simply being intended to discourage handgun ownership does not automatically make it unconstitutional if the primary intent is revenue generation.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the question of whether Congress could ban possession of handguns outright (option A) is irrelevant to the constitutionality of a tax. The Supreme Court has ruled that individuals have a right to possess firearms for lawful purposes under the Second Amendment in cases like District of Columbia v. Heller (2008), but this does not preclude Congress from imposing taxes on firearms sales, provided the tax serves a legitimate revenue-raising purpose."
