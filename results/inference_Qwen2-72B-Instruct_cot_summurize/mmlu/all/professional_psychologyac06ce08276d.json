It assesses whether several items that propose to measure the same construct produce similar scores. Commonly used statistics to estimate internal consistency reliability include Cronbach's alpha and the split-half method. However, the description provided in option C best fits the definition of internal consistency reliability. Options A and B describe test-retest reliability and alternate-forms reliability, respectively. Option D does not define a reliability method but rather makes a statement about the appropriateness of using reliability estimates for certain traits."
