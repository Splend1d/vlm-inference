It could be viewed as a common social strategy, albeit potentially unethical if done deceitfully.\n\nIn Scenario 2, throwing milk on a classmate's head to make them cry is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards. This action involves physical aggression and emotional harm, which are generally considered unacceptable behaviors."
