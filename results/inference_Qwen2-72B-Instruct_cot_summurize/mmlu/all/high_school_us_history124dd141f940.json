During the course of the last long and bloody war, Logan remained idle in his cabin, an advocate for peace. Such was my love for the whites, that my countrymen pointed as they passed, and said, \"Logan is the friend of the white man.\" I had even thought to have lived with you but for the injuries of one man. Colonel Cresap, the last spring, in cold blood and unprovoked; murdered all the relations of Logan, not even sparing my women and children. There runs not a drop of my blood in the veins of any living creature. This called on me for revenge. I have sought it: I have killed many; I have fully glutted my vengeance. For my country, I rejoice at the beams of peace. But do not harbor a thought that mine is the joy of fear. Logan never felt fear. He will not turn on his heel to save his life. Who is there to mourn for Logan? Not one.\n\u2014Address attributed to Logan, an Indian leader, 1774\nWhich of the following in later years would be most likely to see themselves in Logan's position?\n\nA. An opponent of big government in the 1930s\nB. An opponent of consumerism in the 1950s\nC. A supporter of liberalism in the 1960s\nD. A supporter of feminism in the 1970s\n"

Logan's position can be seen as one of betrayal by those he had trusted and a subsequent radicalization in response to violence against his people.\n\nOf the options given, the most likely to see themselves in Logan's position would be:\n\nC. A supporter of liberalism in the 1960s\n\nWhile none of the options perfectly align with Logan's situation, the 1960s saw a significant rise in social movements advocating for civil rights and equality, including the Civil Rights Movement and the American Indian Movement (AIM). Supporters of liberalism during this time period were often fighting against systemic injustices and seeking redress for historical wrongs, much like Logan fought against the injustices committed against his people. The 1960s was also a time when many people felt betrayed by the government and society, leading them to take more radical stances in their pursuit of justice."
