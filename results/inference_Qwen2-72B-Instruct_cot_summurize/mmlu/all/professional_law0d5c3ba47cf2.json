The buyer paid 10% of the purchase price and financed the rest by executing a promissory note and purchase money mortgage to the builder. A year later, the buyer missed several mortgage payments to the builder and became unable to make payments to the builder and became unable to make payments. During that year, property values in the neighborhood declined substantially. The builder suggested that the buyer deed the house back to the builder to settle all claims and avoid the costs and other disadvantages of foreclosure. The buyer deeded the house back to the builder. Does the builder now own fee simple title to the house?\n\nA. No, because the deed back to the builder constitutes a disguised mortgage.\nB. No, because the owner of a personal residence cannot waive the right to foreclosure.\nC. Yes, because of the doctrine of equitable redemption.\nD. Yes, because the transaction was reasonable and fair under the circumstances.\n"

Yes, because the transaction was reasonable and fair under the circumstances.\n\nWhen a borrower conveys their interest in a property back to the lender to satisfy a debt, it is known as a \"deed in lieu of foreclosure.\" This can be an advantageous alternative to foreclosure for both parties, as it typically allows the borrower to avoid the negative impacts of a foreclosure on their credit record and saves the lender the time and expense of going through the foreclosure process. In this scenario, since the buyer has deeded the house back to the builder, and assuming there were no legal restrictions or fraudulent activities involved, the builder would indeed own fee simple title to the house. \n\nIt's important to note that the specifics of such transactions can vary based on local laws and regulations, and it may be necessary to consult with a legal professional to ensure that all parties' rights are protected. However, based on the information provided, option D appears to be the most accurate answer given the context."
