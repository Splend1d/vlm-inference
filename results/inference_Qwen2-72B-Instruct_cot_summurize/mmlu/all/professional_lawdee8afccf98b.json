Call us to reserve your table. \"The response to the promotion was more than the restaurant expected, and the restaurant was soon overbooked for the Mother's Day brunch. On the day before Mother's Day, the restaurant owner decided to double-check inventory to make sure the restaurant had enough food and supplies to handle the large Mother's Day crowd. To her horror, she discovered that the restaurant was almost out of eggs. Knowing that a large supply of eggs would be needed for the omelet station, the owner immediately sent the following e-mail to her egg supplier:\"Desperately need 20 flats of Grade AA eggs for tomorrow's brunch. Money is no object. The eggs must be delivered today. \"The supplier e-mailed back:\"No problem! I'll load them on the truck and deliver them within the hour. \"With respect to the agreement between the owner and the supplier, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the omittance of a fixed contract price?\n\nA. The contract is unenforceable as violative of the statute of frauds.\nB. The contract is unenforceable, because of indefiniteness.\nC. The contract may be enforceable if it is later modified to include the price term.\nD. The contract is enforceable with reasonable price being fixed at time of delivery.\n"

The contract is enforceable with reasonable price being fixed at time of delivery.\n\nIn this situation, the owner's email can be considered an offer, and the supplier's reply can be considered an acceptance. Although there is no specified price, under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), contracts for the sale of goods without a fixed price are not necessarily void. If the parties intend to enter into a contract but do not specify a price, the UCC provides that the price shall be a reasonable price at the time of delivery if no other method of determining the price is provided. Therefore, the contract is enforceable, and the price will be determined as a reasonable price at the time of delivery."
