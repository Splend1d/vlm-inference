High concentrations of leptin without reduction in energy intake\n\nLeptin resistance is a condition where the body does not respond appropriately to the hormone leptin, which is produced by fat cells and signals satiety or fullness to the brain. In leptin resistance, high levels of leptin are present in the body, but the brain does not receive the signal to stop eating or increase energy expenditure, leading to overeating and weight gain. This can contribute to obesity and related health problems."
