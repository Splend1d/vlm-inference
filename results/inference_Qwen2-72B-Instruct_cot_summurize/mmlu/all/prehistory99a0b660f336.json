This tool culture emerged around 43,000 to 35,000 years ago in Europe and is characterized by the production of flint blades, bone tools, and the earliest known figurative art.\n\nB. Acheulean and C. Mousterian are both associated with earlier hominins. The Acheulean tool culture was developed by Homo erectus around 1.76 million years ago, while the Mousterian tool culture was associated with Neanderthals (Homo neanderthalensis) and some late archaic Homo sapiens populations around 160,000 to 40,000 years ago."
