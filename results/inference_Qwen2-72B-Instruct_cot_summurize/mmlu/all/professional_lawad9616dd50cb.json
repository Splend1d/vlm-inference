In this case, the student did not consent to the confinement, as he was intoxicated and did not voluntarily get into the police car. Moreover, the police did not have probable cause to make an arrest, so the confinement was likely unlawful. Therefore, the student would likely prevail on a claim of false imprisonment unless the police can demonstrate that they had a valid reason to detain him. However, it's worth noting that the specific outcome may depend on the jurisdiction and the facts of the case."
