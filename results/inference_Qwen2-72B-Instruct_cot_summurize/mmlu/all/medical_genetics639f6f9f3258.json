Its genome was one of the first to be fully sequenced among plants, making it an invaluable resource for understanding gene function and genetic pathways in higher plants. It's not chosen for reasons A, B, or C; rather, it's a well-studied model organism precisely because of its simplicity and low cost of cultivation and study."
