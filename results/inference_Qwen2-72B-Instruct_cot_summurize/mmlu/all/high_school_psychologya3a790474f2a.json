Openness is characterized by imagination, creativity, curiosity, and a willingness to try new experiences. People with high levels of openness are more likely to engage in imaginative activities, have vivid fantasies, and are generally more receptive to novel ideas and experiences. These traits may make them more susceptible to hypnosis as they are more likely to immerse themselves in the hypnotic experience and respond to suggestions."
