The security guard, having already graduated from a program in his former state, wishes to work again as a private security guard. He began to advertise his services but was informed by the state that he must cease and desist from working as a private security guard until he complied with state law and graduated from an in-state program. The security guard challenges the constitutionality of the licensing statute on grounds that it violates the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Which of the following statements is most accurate?\n\nA. The security guard has the burden of persuasion to show that the state does not have a compelling state interest in enacting such legislation.\nB. The security guard has the burden of persuasion to show that the denial of a license to work in private security violates his rights of due process.\nC.

The state has the burden of persuasion to show that the denial of a license to work in private security does not violate the petitioner's rights of due process.\n\nIn cases involving challenges to state regulations under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, the state bears the burden of demonstrating that its action is rationally related to a legitimate government interest. In this case, the state would need to justify why requiring out-of-state trained guards to complete an in-state program is necessary and does not arbitrarily infringe upon the individual's right to pursue a chosen occupation. However, it's worth noting that the \"compelling state interest\" standard typically applies to cases involving fundamental rights or suspect classifications under equal protection analysis, rather than due process challenges to economic regulation."
