According to this theory, there are two sets of factors that influence job satisfaction and motivation: hygiene factors and motivators. Hygiene factors include aspects of the work environment such as pay, company policies, supervision, interpersonal relations, and job security. These factors can prevent dissatisfaction but do not necessarily lead to high levels of motivation or job satisfaction.\n\nMotivators, on the other hand, are related to the work itself, such as achievement, recognition, responsibility, and advancement. These factors are directly linked to job satisfaction and motivation. The president's financial incentive program might address some hygiene factors (pay), but if it does not address the motivators, it may not increase job motivation or satisfaction. Employees might still feel unfulfilled in their roles despite the financial incentives."
