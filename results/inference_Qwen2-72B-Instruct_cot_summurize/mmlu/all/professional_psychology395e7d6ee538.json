Spirituality has been shown to act as a protective factor against disease, and it is imperative to put effort toward understanding and incorporating spirituality into clinical practice\n\nThis statement is true based on research that indicates spirituality can have positive effects on health outcomes. Spirituality can provide individuals with a sense of meaning, purpose, and connection, which may contribute to better coping mechanisms and improved mental and physical well-being. Therefore, integrating spirituality into clinical practice can be beneficial for patients.\n\nB. This statement is false because incorporating spirituality into evidence-based treatments can be effective for both religious and non-religious individuals. Spirituality does not necessarily equate to religiosity, and people who are not religious can still benefit from spiritual practices.\n\nC. This statement is false because yoga, meditation, mindfulness, and acupuncture techniques have been found to be effective in managing pain associated with chronic illnesses. These practices can help reduce stress, improve mood, and enhance overall quality of life for individuals suffering from chronic conditions.\n\nD. Since choice A is true, this statement is false."
