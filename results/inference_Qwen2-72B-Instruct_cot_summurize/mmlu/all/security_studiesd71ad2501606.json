For societal security dilemmas ambiguity can stem from two sides of nationalism; cultural (positive) and ethnic (negative). Ethnic (political) nationalism is often described as more malign and linked to state disintegration, whereas cultural nationalism is often seen as benign, working within existing state structures.\nB. Clear distinctions between cultural nationalism and political nationalism are difficult to make: cultural nationalism may sometimes be compelled to change itself from a solely cultural movement into a political movement and be conflated with political nationalism.\nC. Dominant actors may exaggerate threat perceptions with the intent of mobilizing political support which can result in action reaction processes.\nD. All of these options.\n"

This option describes how ambiguity can arise from the dual nature of nationalism, which can either be culturally positive or ethnically negative, leading to potential security dilemmas.\nB. This option highlights the difficulty in distinguishing between cultural and political nationalism, where cultural nationalism might transform into political nationalism, creating confusion and contributing to security dilemmas.\nC. This option refers to the manipulation of threat perceptions by dominant actors for political gain, which can escalate tensions and create security dilemmas through action-reaction processes.\nAll three options are relevant to understanding the concept of security dilemmas in terms of societal identity, making D the correct answer."
