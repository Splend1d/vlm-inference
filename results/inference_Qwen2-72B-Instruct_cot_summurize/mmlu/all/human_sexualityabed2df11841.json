In 2018, the U.S. had a teen birth rate of 17.4 per 1,000 women aged 15-19, while Canada had a rate of 6.3, Sweden had a rate of 5.2, and France had a rate of 5.9. However, it's worth noting that all of these rates are significantly lower than they were in previous decades, thanks in part to increased access to contraception and sex education."
