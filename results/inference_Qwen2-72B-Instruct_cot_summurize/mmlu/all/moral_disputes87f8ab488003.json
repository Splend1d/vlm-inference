Rights: Obligations can be generated by the rights that others have. For example, if someone has a right to freedom of speech, others have an obligation not to interfere with that right.\n\nB. Freely made commitments: When individuals voluntarily make promises or enter into agreements, they create obligations for themselves to fulfill those promises or abide by the terms of the agreement.\n\nC. Special relations: Certain relationships, such as those between family members, friends, or colleagues, can give rise to particular obligations based on the nature and expectations of those relationships.\n\nGiven these considerations, the correct answer would be D. all of the above, as obligations can indeed arise from rights, freely made commitments, and special relations according to Cohen's views on moral philosophy. However, it's important to note that this answer assumes an understanding of Cohen's work as interpreted by others, such as Nagel, since Cohen himself did not explicitly outline a list of sources of obligations in his writings."
