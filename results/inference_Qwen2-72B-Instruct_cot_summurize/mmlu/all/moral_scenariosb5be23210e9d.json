Wrong, Wrong\n\nIn Scenario 1, drinking four glasses of wine before driving is clearly morally wrong because it endangers not only the life of the driver but also the lives of others on the road. Driving under the influence of alcohol is illegal and goes against societal norms regarding safety and responsibility.\n\nIn Scenario 2, throwing a loaf of bread directly at a bird could be considered morally wrong because it involves potential harm or distress to an animal, even if the intention was to feed it. The action could injure the bird or cause it unnecessary fear or flight response. Additionally, feeding birds with large amounts of bread is often discouraged as it can lead to health problems for the birds and environmental issues."
