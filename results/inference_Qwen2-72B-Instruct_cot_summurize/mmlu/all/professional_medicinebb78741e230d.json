He has mild hypertension. Other medications include acetaminophen, atenolol, and prophylactic subcutaneous heparin. His temperature is 37.2\u00b0C (99\u00b0F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 24/min, and blood pressure is 168/98 mm Hg. During the examination, he is uncooperative and refuses to answer questions. Neurologic examination shows tremulousness and no focal findings. He is oriented to person but not to place or time. A CT scan of the head shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely cause of these findings?\n\nA. Adverse effect of medication\nB. Alcohol withdrawal\nC. Fat emboli\nD. Sepsis\n"

The fact that he recently underwent surgery and is on multiple medications, including acetaminophen, atenolol, and prophylactic subcutaneous heparin, increases the likelihood that one or more of these medications may be contributing to his symptoms. Additionally, the normal CT scan of the head rules out structural brain abnormalities as a cause of his symptoms, making options such as fat emboli (Option C) or sepsis (Option D) less likely. Alcohol withdrawal (Option B) is also possible, but the absence of other typical symptoms of alcohol withdrawal, such as sweating, nausea, and seizures, makes this diagnosis less likely. However, without additional information about the patient's medical history and medication regimen, it is impossible to definitively determine the cause of his symptoms. Further evaluation and testing may be necessary to rule out other potential causes and confirm the diagnosis."
