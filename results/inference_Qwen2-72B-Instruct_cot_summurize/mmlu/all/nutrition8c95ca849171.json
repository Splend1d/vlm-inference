However, it should be noted that the percentages for Intracellular Fluid (ICF) and Extracellular Fluid (ECF) are usually expressed as a percentage of total body water, not of total body mass. Typically, ICF makes up about 40% of total body weight and ECF about 20% of total body weight in men, but these figures include the contribution of water to the fat mass, which is small. If we consider only the fat-free mass, the ICF is about 75% and the ECF is about 25%. So a more accurate answer would be something like: Fat = 17%, Fat Free Mass=83%, with the Fat Free Mass composed of 75% Intracellular Fluid and 25% Extracellular Fluid. But given the choices provided, option A is the closest to what might be expected for a healthy young adult male."
