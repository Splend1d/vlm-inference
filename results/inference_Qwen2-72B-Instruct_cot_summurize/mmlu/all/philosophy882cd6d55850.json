However, if we interpret your question as asking which term best describes someone who endorses ideals without regard for whether those ideals serve people's interests, the closest fit might be an \"amoralist,\" or option B.\n\nAn amoralist is someone who acts without considering moral principles, either because they do not believe in them or because they are indifferent to them. If someone endorses ideals without caring whether those ideals actually benefit people or not, they could be considered amoral in their approach to ethics.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the term \"hare\" typically refers to the animal or, in a figurative sense, something that starts quickly but may not last (as in the fable of the tortoise and the hare). It does not have a standard usage in philosophy or ethics to describe people with certain moral attitudes."
