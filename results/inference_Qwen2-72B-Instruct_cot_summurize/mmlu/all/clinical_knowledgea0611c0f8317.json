                    "text": "A. increased when intracellular ADP rises.\n\nCreatine kinase (CK) catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from phosphocreatine to ADP, generating ATP and creatine. Its activity increases as the concentration of ADP rises inside the cell, which typically occurs during periods of high energy demand such as muscle contraction. This helps maintain the cellular ATP level by converting ADP back into ATP.\n\nWhile some of the other options may have relevance under certain conditions, they are not universally true or directly related to the activity of creatine kinase in the way that option A is. For example:\n\nB. The activity of creatine kinase can be affected by changes in pH, but it's not necessarily increased when muscle pH falls below 6.9. In fact, extreme drops in pH can inhibit enzyme activity.\n\nC. The activity of creatine kinase is not always lower in Type II fibers than in Type I fibers. Type II fibers (fast-twitch) often have higher levels of creatine kinase because they rely more on anaerobic metabolism for energy production.\n\nD. Endurance training can lead to adaptations in muscle fibers, including changes in enzyme activity, but it does not specifically increase the activity of creatine kinase. Instead, endurance training tends to increase oxidative enzymes and mitochondrial density, while creatine kinase activity might be more associated with strength or power training."
