She tells you that she has not had a menstrual period for the past 6 months. She is a college student who is in good health, has not had any medical illnesses or surgery, and has never been pregnant. She is currently sexually active and uses barrier contraception. She reports that during the past year her menses had become very irregular prior to complete cessation 6 months ago. She also notes that she has gained about 9 kg (20 lb) in the past 6 months and has had an increasing problem with acne and a troublesome growth of hair on her thighs and abdomen. She has been somewhat depressed about this, and her grades have declined. She reports that one of her sisters also had this problem prior to getting married. Physical examination shows a mildly obese young woman who has scattered facial acne, mild male pattern hair growth on the abdomen, and an essentially normal pelvic examination except for slight enlargement of the uterus and both ovaries. This patient's history is most consistent with which of the following?\n\nA. Androgen-producing ovarian tumor\nB. Cushing syndrome\nC. Hypothyroidism\nD. Polycystic ovarian syndrome\n"

The symptoms described, including irregular periods, amenorrhea, weight gain, acne, and hirsutism (excessive hair growth in a male pattern), are characteristic of PCOS. Additionally, the mention of her sister having a similar problem suggests a possible genetic component, which is often seen in PCOS.\n\nWhile the other conditions listed can present with some of these symptoms, they typically do not present with the full constellation of symptoms as described by this patient. An androgen-producing ovarian tumor would likely present with more severe androgenic symptoms such as deepening of the voice and clitoromegaly. Cushing syndrome would present with additional symptoms such as purple striae, proximal muscle weakness, hypertension, and glucose intolerance. Hypothyroidism could cause weight gain and menstrual irregularities but would not typically present with acne and hirsutism."
