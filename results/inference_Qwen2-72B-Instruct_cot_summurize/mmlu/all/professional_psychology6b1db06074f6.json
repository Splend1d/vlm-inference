This can be achieved by facilitating structured interactions that allow both groups to engage in meaningful and cooperative activities together, such as community service projects, cultural exchange events, or team-building exercises.\n\nThese interactions should be designed to highlight the commonalities between the two groups and to challenge negative stereotypes and assumptions. It's important to create a safe and respectful environment where residents can share their experiences and perspectives without fear of judgment or hostility. Over time, these positive interactions can help to build trust and understanding between the old and new residents, reducing antagonism and hostility and promoting greater social cohesion in the community. \n\nOptions A, B, and C may not be as effective in achieving this goal. Casual and superficial interactions may not provide enough depth to address underlying issues and build meaningful relationships. Making explicit the status hierarchy between the two groups may reinforce existing power dynamics and increase tensions. An open airing of negative beliefs about the other group may lead to further polarization and conflict."
