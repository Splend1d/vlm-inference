Hare was an influential British philosopher known for his work in meta-ethics, particularly for developing the theory of prescriptivism. According to Hare, moral statements are not merely expressions of emotion or subjective preferences; they are prescriptions that guide action and can be evaluated based on logical consistency and coherence.\n\nIf someone refuses to make any positive moral judgments, they are essentially refusing to prescribe any actions as right or good. This means that when it comes to their own interests, they lack a moral framework to justify why their interests should be protected over others'. For instance, if such a person were to say, \"It's wrong to harm me,\" they would be making a positive moral judgment (that harming them is wrong), which contradicts their refusal to make such judgments. Thus, they cannot coherently use morality to defend their own interests without being inconsistent.\n\nOptions A and B do not accurately represent Hare's position. While he might argue that such a stance is illogical or incoherent, he does not necessarily claim that it is irrational (in the sense of lacking reason) or immoral (as violating specific moral norms). Option D also does not reflect Hare's views, as he does not argue that such a person could not exist; rather, he critiques the incoherence of their position."
