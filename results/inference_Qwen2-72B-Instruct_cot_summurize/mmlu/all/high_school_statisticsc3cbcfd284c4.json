Because the population standard deviations are not known and conditions are met, the student shoulduse a two-sample t-test.\nB. Because the sample sizes are different, the student should notuse a two-sample t-test.\nC. Because the sample sizes are both greater than 30, the student should notuse a two-sample t-test.\nD.

Because the population standard deviations are not known and conditions are met, the student should use a two-sample t-test.\n\nExplanation: In this scenario, the student is comparing two independent groups (boys and girls) on a quantitative variable (number of contacts). Since the population standard deviations are unknown, a two-sample t-test is appropriate as long as certain conditions are met, such as random sampling, independence of observations, approximately normal distributions within each group, and equal variances between groups. The difference in sample sizes does not preclude the use of a two-sample t-test, nor does the fact that the sample sizes are greater than 30. While it's true that the shape of the population distribution is not explicitly mentioned, the t-test can be robust to departures from normality with larger sample sizes, and we do not have enough information to conclude that the distribution is significantly non-normal."
