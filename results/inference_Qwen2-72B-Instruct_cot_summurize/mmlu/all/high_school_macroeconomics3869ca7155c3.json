                    "text": "The process you're referring to is called the money multiplier effect, which occurs when banks lend out a portion of their deposits and keep a portion as reserves. The formula for calculating the maximum amount of money that can be created through this process is:\n\nMoney Multiplier = 1 / Reserve Ratio\n\nIn this case, the reserve ratio is 10%, or 0.10 in decimal form. So,\n\nMoney Multiplier = 1 / 0.10 = 10\n\nThis means that for every dollar deposited, the banking system can potentially create up to $10 in new money.\n\nIf a new customer deposits $500, then the maximum amount of money that can be created is:\n\n$500 * Money Multiplier = $500 * 10 = $5,000\n\nSo, the answer is C. $5,000. However, it's important to note that this assumes that all banks lend out the maximum amount they're allowed to and that no one withdraws any money during the process. In reality, the amount of money created would likely be less due to these factors."
