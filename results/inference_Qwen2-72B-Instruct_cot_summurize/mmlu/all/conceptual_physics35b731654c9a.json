This force causes the electron to accelerate.\n\nMagnetic fields, on the other hand, do not change the speed or kinetic energy of a charged particle; instead, they cause the particle to change direction (if the particle's velocity is not parallel to the magnetic field). The force due to a magnetic field is given by F = qvB sin(\u03b8), where v is the velocity of the particle, B is the magnetic field strength, and \u03b8 is the angle between the velocity vector and the magnetic field. Since this force is always perpendicular to both the velocity and the magnetic field, it does not do work on the particle and thus cannot change its kinetic energy.\n\nSo the correct answer is:\n\nA. an electric field"
