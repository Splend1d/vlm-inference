                    "text": "The properties described suggest that the substance has a high melting point, is an insulator (poor conductor of electricity), and is insoluble in water. These characteristics are typical of substances with strong interatomic bonds. Ionic compounds can have high melting points and be poor conductors when solid, but they typically dissolve well in water due to their polar nature. Metallic bonding would make the substance a good conductor of electricity. Nonpolar covalent bonding doesn't usually lead to high melting points or insolubility in water.\n\nSubstances with covalent network bonding, such as diamond (a form of carbon), exhibit all these properties. They have extremely high melting points because the entire crystal is one giant molecule where each atom is covalently bonded to its neighbors in a repeating pattern. This type of bonding makes the material very hard and a poor conductor of electricity (except for some specific cases like graphite which conducts along the layers). Additionally, such materials do not dissolve in water because the forces holding the network together are much stronger than any interaction with the solvent.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. covalent network bonding"
