All of the above.\n\nThe first apes, which emerged during the late Eocene and early Oligocene epochs (around 35-20 million years ago), indeed belonged to a much greater number of genera than those existing today. These early apes were widespread, inhabiting areas that included Europe, Asia, and Africa\u2014far more extensive than the current distribution of apes, which are now found only in Africa and Southeast Asia. Additionally, some ancient ape species were indeed larger than any living ape today, with examples like Gigantopithecus being significantly bigger than modern gorillas."
