This is because the process of breaking down fatty acids produces acetyl-CoA, which cannot be converted back into glucose due to the irreversible nature of certain reactions in the citric acid cycle and the lack of a pathway that can convert acetyl-CoA into intermediates that can enter gluconeogenesis."
