Remove ants and measure subsequent leaf damage.\n\nBy removing the ants and measuring the amount of leaf damage, you can determine if the absence of ants leads to an increase in damage caused by leaf-feeding insects. This would suggest that the ants were indeed protecting the plant from these insects."
