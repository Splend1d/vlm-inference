This means that as $x$ approaches $1$ from either side, $f(x)$ will approach positive or negative infinity. Specifically:\n\n- As $x \\to 1^-$, $f(x) \\to +\\infty$.\n- As $x \\to 1^+$, $f(x) \\to -\\infty$.\n\nNow, let's consider what happens to $f(x)$ for other values of $x$. If $x < 1$, then $1-x > 0$, so $\\frac{1}{1-x} > 0$. That is, for $x < 1$, $f(x)$ takes on positive values. As $x$ gets closer to $1$, $f(x)$ increases without bound.\n\nSimilarly, if $x > 1$, then $1-x < 0$, so $\\frac{1}{1-x} < 0$. That is, for $x > 1$, $f(x)$ takes on negative values. Again, as $x$ gets closer to $1$, $|f(x)|$ increases without bound.\n\nTherefore, the range of $f(x)$ is all real numbers except for $f(x) = 0$, which cannot be achieved because there is no value of $x$ such that $\\frac{1}{1-x} = 0$.\n\nSo the correct answer is B. $(-\\infty,0)\\cup (0,\\infty)$."
