The specified mean length of 3.5 cm is not within a 90 percent confidence interval.\n\nIf the botanist has found significant results at a 5 percent level of significance for the hypothesis test, it means that the p-value is less than 0.05. This indicates that there is strong evidence against the null hypothesis (H0), suggesting that the true mean petal length is likely greater than 3.5 cm.\n\nIn terms of confidence intervals, rejecting the null hypothesis at the 5 percent level is equivalent to saying that the 95 percent confidence interval does not include the value of 3.5 cm. However, the question asks about a 90 percent confidence interval. Since a 95 percent confidence interval is wider than a 90 percent confidence interval (it includes more values), if 3.5 cm is not included in the 95 percent interval, it will also not be included in the narrower 90 percent interval.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is that the specified mean length of 3.5 cm is not within a 90 percent confidence interval."
