The man locked the door and quietly took the female's purse, emptied all of the money into his pockets, and removed the jewelry from her person. He was apprehended and charged with robbery. Can he be convicted of that crime?\n\nA. Yes, robbery is the unlawful taking of property from another's person by intimidation or force.\nB.

Yes, robbery does not require that the victim be subdued by force or be placed in fear.\nD.

Yes, robbery does not require that the victim be subdued by force or be placed in fear.\n\nRobbery is generally defined as the unlawful taking of property from a person's immediate possession through force, threat, or intimidation. However, in many jurisdictions, robbery statutes do not require that the victim be conscious or aware of the taking. In fact, the use of the victim's incapacitated state to facilitate the taking can itself be considered a form of intimidation or coercion, even if the victim is not directly threatened or harmed. Therefore, the man could be convicted of robbery for taking advantage of the woman's unconscious state to steal her property."
