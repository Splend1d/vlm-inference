Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. beneficence overrides autonomy\n\nIn this scenario, the physician is prioritizing the health and well-being of the patient's wife by encouraging the patient to disclose his HIV status to her. This action is in line with the ethical principle of beneficence, which requires healthcare providers to act in the best interest of their patients. However, this recommendation also involves a limitation of the patient's autonomy, as it involves disclosing private health information without the patient's consent. In this case, the potential harm to the patient's wife if she remains unaware of her potential exposure to HIV outweighs the patient's right to privacy."
