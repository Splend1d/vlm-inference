While other planets and moons may have evidence of past tectonic activity, or even current geological processes, Earth is unique in having an active system of moving tectonic plates that shape its surface. Mars and Venus do not have active plate tectonics. Mars shows evidence of past volcanic and tectonic activity but it is not currently active. Venus also has evidence of past tectonic activity, but it does not appear to have the same kind of plate tectonics as Earth."
