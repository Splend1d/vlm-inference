In a holistic evaluation of student essays, evaluations are made on the basis of the overall quality of each student's essay in relation to the topic. This means that the evaluation considers the effectiveness of the essay in addressing the assigned topic, as well as the coherence, organization, development, and style of the writing. While aspects such as grammar, sentence structure, and discourse modes may be considered, they are not the primary focus of a holistic evaluation. Instead, these elements are assessed in the context of how they contribute to the overall quality and effectiveness of the essay."
