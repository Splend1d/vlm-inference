The city manual requires that newcomers pay a higher contribution to the city's employee betterment fund for the first three years of employment. Newcomer refuses to pay a higher contribution than other employees, whereupon she is terminated. Can she make a successful equal protection argument to fight for her job?\n\nA. No, she is not a member of a suspect class as there cannot be a \"class-of-one\" in the employment law context.\nB. No, the request for the contribution was not unreasonable and cannot support an equal protection argument.\nC. Yes, she can claim a class of one who is being discriminated against.\nD. Yes, she can claim membership in a group of newcomers who are coming and are being treated differently than everyone else, even if she is the only newcomer she knows of at this time.\n"

                    "text": "The answer to this question depends on the interpretation and application of Equal Protection Clause jurisprudence. Generally, the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution prohibits states from denying any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. This includes employment discrimination by state or local governments.\n\nIn the employment law context, the Supreme Court has held that an equal protection claim can be made under what is known as the \"class of one\" theory. This theory applies when a plaintiff alleges that she has been intentionally treated differently from others similarly situated and that there is no rational basis for the difference in treatment. In the case of Village of Willowbrook v. Olech (2000), the Supreme Court recognized that a \"class of one\" could form the basis of an equal protection claim, even if the plaintiff could not identify a larger class of similarly situated individuals.\n\nGiven this precedent, the answer to the question would be:\n\nD. Yes, she can claim membership in a group of newcomers who are being treated differently than everyone else, even if she is the only newcomer she knows of at this time.\n\nThis answer assumes that the requirement for newcomers to pay a higher contribution to the city's employee betterment fund has no rational basis and is not applied uniformly to all employees regardless of their status as newcomers. If the policy has a rational basis, such as compensating for additional training costs or other legitimate government interests, then the equal protection argument may not succeed. However, based solely on the information provided, the newcomer can potentially argue that she is being discriminated against as a \"class of one,\" which is sufficient to make an equal protection claim."
