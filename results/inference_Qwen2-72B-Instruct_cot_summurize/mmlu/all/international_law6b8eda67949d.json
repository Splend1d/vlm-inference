Treaties are to be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.\n\nThis principle is established under Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, which provides that a treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose. This approach is known as the \"contextual\" or \"teleological\" method of interpretation, which takes into account not only the words of the treaty but also its context and purpose."
