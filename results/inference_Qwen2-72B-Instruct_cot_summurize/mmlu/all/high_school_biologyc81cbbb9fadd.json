This process can lead to new combinations of alleles, contributing to genetic diversity in offspring (which is related to A, but not the primary focus here). However, the frequency of crossing-over between two genes can be used to determine their relative positions on a chromosome. The closer two genes are to each other on a chromosome, the less likely they are to be separated by a crossover event, and thus the lower the recombination frequency between them. This information can be used to create genetic maps that show the relative distances between genes."
