While the other options were indeed discussed as potential signs of past life, no definitive amino acids with chirality were reported as evidence in the case of ALH84001. The presence of chiral amino acids would be significant because biological processes tend to favor one enantiomer over another, while abiotic processes can produce equal amounts of both enantiomers. However, such specific evidence was not part of the original findings associated with this meteorite."
