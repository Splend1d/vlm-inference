The fourth column represents the negation of K (~K). The fifth column represents the biconditional between J and ~K (J \u2261 ~K). The sixth column represents the disjunction between J and L (J \u2228 L). The last column represents the conditional statement \"if ~K, then L\" (~K / L).\n\nTo determine whether the argument is valid, we need to check if there is any row in which the premises (J \u2261 ~K and J \u2228 L) are true and the conclusion (~K / L) is false. In this case, there are two rows that meet this condition: when J and K are true and L is false (row 2), and when J is true and K and L are false (row 4).\n\nTherefore, the argument is invalid. Option B presents a counterexample when J and K are true and L is false. Option C also presents a counterexample when J is true and K and L are false.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nB. Invalid. Counterexample when J and K are true and L is false\nC. Invalid. Counterexample when J is true and K and L are false\n\nNote: Since both options B and C present valid counterexamples, either one could be considered a correct answer depending on the specific instructions given for the question. However, since the question asks for only one answer, it might be best to choose the first counterexample presented (option B) unless instructed otherwise."
