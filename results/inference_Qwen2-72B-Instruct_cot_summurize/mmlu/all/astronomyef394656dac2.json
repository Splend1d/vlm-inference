Therefore, the mass of the sandbag will remain constant at 5 kg, regardless of its location in the universe.\n\nWeight, on the other hand, is the force exerted by gravity on an object and is given by the formula W = mg, where m is the mass of the object and g is the acceleration due to gravity. On Earth, the acceleration due to gravity is approximately 9.8 m/s^2.\n\nGiven that the sandbag weighs 50 N on Earth, we can calculate its weight on a planet with half the gravity as follows:\n\nLet's assume the acceleration due to gravity on the new planet is g_new = 0.5g_Earth = 0.5 x 9.8 m/s^2 = 4.9 m/s^2\n\nNow, using the formula for weight, we can calculate the weight of the sandbag on the new planet:\n\nW_new = m x g_new = 5 kg x 4.9 m/s^2 = 24.5 N\n\nSince weight is typically rounded to the nearest whole number, the weight of the sandbag on the new planet would be approximately 25 N. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Mass 5kg weight 25N."
