Reform movements led to the creation of regulations on work hours and ages and gender of workers.\n\nBefore 1850, in response to the social and economic upheaval caused by the Industrial Revolution, governments in Europe, particularly in Britain, began to enact various reforms aimed at addressing the issues raised by industrialization. This included the introduction of factory acts that regulated working conditions, particularly concerning the hours of work and the employment of women and children. These reforms were often a result of growing public awareness and agitation by reformers and labor activists who highlighted the poor conditions faced by workers during this period. The Luddites, mentioned in Source 2, were a group of workers who protested against the use of machinery in textile mills, fearing it would lead to job losses and worsened working conditions. While the immediate reaction of the British government was often repressive, in the long term, these protests contributed to the push for labor reforms."
