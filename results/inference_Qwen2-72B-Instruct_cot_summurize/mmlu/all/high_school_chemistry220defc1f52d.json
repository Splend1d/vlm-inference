The molarity of HCl is given as 0.108 M, and the volume used is 42.6 mL.\n\nConverting 42.6 mL to liters:\n\\[ 42.6 \\, \\text{mL} = 42.6 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{L} = 0.0426 \\, \\text{L} \\]\n\nThe number of moles of HCl is calculated by multiplying the molarity by the volume (in liters):\n\\[ \\text{Moles of HCl} = \\text{Molarity of HCl} \\times \\text{Volume of HCl} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Moles of HCl} = 0.108 \\, \\text{M} \\times 0.0426 \\, \\text{L} = 0.0046128 \\, \\text{mol} \\]\n\nSince the neutralization reaction between NaOH and HCl is 1:1 (one mole of NaOH reacts with one mole of HCl), the number of moles of NaOH will also be 0.0046128 mol.\n\nNow, we need to find the molarity of the NaOH solution using the volume of NaOH provided (40.0 mL or 0.040 L).\n\n\\[ \\text{Molarity of NaOH} = \\frac{\\text{Moles of NaOH}}{\\text{Volume of NaOH (in liters)}} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Molarity of NaOH} = \\frac{0.0046128 \\, \\text{mol}}{0.040 \\, \\text{L}} = 0.11532 \\, \\text{M} \\]\n\nRounding to three significant figures (as per the given data), the molarity of the NaOH solution is approximately 0.115 M.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. 0.115 M."
