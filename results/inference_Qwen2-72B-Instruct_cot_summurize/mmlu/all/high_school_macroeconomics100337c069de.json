When there is a decline in investment, it means less capital is being allocated to new projects, expanding businesses, or upgrading technology and equipment. This can lead to slower productivity growth, fewer jobs, and lower overall economic output. In contrast, increases in immigration, technological advances, and the labor force typically contribute positively to economic growth."
