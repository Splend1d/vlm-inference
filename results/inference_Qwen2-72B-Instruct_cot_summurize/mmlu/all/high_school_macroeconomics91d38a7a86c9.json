Money demand is nearly perfectly elastic.\n\nIf money demand is nearly perfectly elastic, it means that the quantity of money demanded remains constant regardless of changes in interest rates. This situation would limit the effectiveness of expansionary monetary policy because changes in the money supply by the central bank would not lead to changes in interest rates, which are a key tool for stimulating economic activity. The other options do not directly limit the central bank's ability to conduct expansionary monetary policy in the same way that an inelastic money demand does."
