                    "text": "A 15-year-old boy was sledding down a pathway through a wooded area of land owned by a woman. The boy had frequently used the pathway for sledding in the previous months. The path, made of concrete, led through the woods from a public highway to a pond in the rear of the woman's property. The pathway was used for sledding and the pond for skating by the residents of the neighboring areas, without the consent of the woman. Furthermore, the woman failed to post any signs forbidding trespassing. After the boy had been sledding down the pathway for approximately three hours one morning, he lost control of the sled, and steered it into a tree. The boy suffered serious injuries in the crash. If a suit is brought on the boy's behalf against the woman for the boy's personal injuries, the plaintiff will\n\nA. recover, under the \"attractive nuisance\" doctrine.\nB. recover, because the woman knew or should have known of the frequent trespasses.\nC. not recover, because the boy was a trespasser.\nD. not recover, because a 15-year-old boy should have realized the risk.\n"

The woman may be held liable for the boy's injuries because she knew or should have known of the frequent trespasses and did nothing to prevent them or make the area safe. The \"attractive nuisance\" doctrine typically applies to cases involving young children who are drawn to potentially dangerous conditions on property, but this case involves a 15-year-old boy who had been using the pathway for some time. However, the fact that the woman knew or should have known about the frequent use of the pathway for sledding and did not take steps to prevent it or make it safer could be grounds for liability. The fact that the boy was a trespasser does not necessarily bar recovery, as the woman may have a duty to take reasonable steps to prevent foreseeable harm to trespassers. Finally, while the boy may have contributed to his own injuries by losing control of the sled, this does not necessarily mean that he cannot recover damages. The court may consider the comparative negligence of both parties in determining the outcome of the case."
