Exposure to bright light in the evening can delay the production of melatonin, a hormone that helps regulate sleep, leading to difficulties in falling asleep. Therefore, the answer would be B. Increase insomnia.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that exposure to bright light earlier in the day can help to reset your circadian rhythm and improve sleep patterns, so the timing of the light exposure is crucial.\n\nThe correct answer based on the options given would be:\n\nB. Increase insomnia"
