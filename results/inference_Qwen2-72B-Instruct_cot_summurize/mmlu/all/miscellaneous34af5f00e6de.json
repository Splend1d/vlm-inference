Observing rules of proper behavior toward others will ensure social and political harmony.\n\nConfucianism places great emphasis on the cultivation of virtue, adherence to ritual propriety (li), and the maintenance of social harmony through ethical conduct. It advocates for the practice of five key relationships: ruler and subject, father and son, elder brother and younger brother, husband and wife, and friend and friend. By observing the proper roles and duties within these relationships, individuals can contribute to a well-ordered society. This contrasts with other philosophies or religions that may focus more on individual salvation, escape from samsara (the cycle of rebirth), or personal spiritual enlightenment."
