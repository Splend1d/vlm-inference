The demand for daycare rises, increasing the market price.\n\nWhen the county government sends each parent a coupon that can be used to subsidize the cost of daycare, it effectively reduces the price that parents have to pay out-of-pocket for daycare services. This makes daycare more affordable for families, which increases the quantity demanded for daycare services. As demand increases, the market price is likely to rise as well, assuming the supply of daycare services remains relatively constant. Daycare providers may see an increase in business and could potentially raise their prices due to higher demand, although they might also be incentivized to increase the supply of daycare services to meet this new demand. However, the question specifically asks what we would expect to occur initially, so the primary effect would be an increase in demand leading to a potential increase in market price."
