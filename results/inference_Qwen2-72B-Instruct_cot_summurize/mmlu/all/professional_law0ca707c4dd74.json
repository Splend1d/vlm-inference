Over the course of time, she developed the property into a residential subdivision. A four-lane public highway ran along the northern boundary of the residential subdivision. When the residential subdivision was first plotted, the developer constructed a private road along (and including) the western boundary of the subdivision. This private road was used only for the benefit of the owners who purchased lots in the subdivision. A homeowner owned a 20-acre tract immediately outside of the residential subdivision, which was situated just below the public highway and immediately adjacent to the west side of the private road. The homeowner's property was divided into two 10-acre parcels: Parcel 1 was the northern half and bordered along the public highway; Parcel 2 was the southern sector and abutted a river. In 1997, the homeowner conveyed Parcel 1 to a man by warranty deed. No encumbrances were mentioned in the deed. Six months later, the homeowner conveyed Parcel 2 by warranty deed to a woman. Both the man and the woman promptly recorded their deeds with the County Recorder's Office. Assume that no part of Parcel 2 adjoins a public road. Consequently, the woman constructed an access road connecting her property to the private road. After the woman used the private road for approximately two months, a teacher who was an owner within the residential subdivision, ordered the woman to discontinue using the private road. In an appropriate action by the teacher against the woman to enjoin the use of the private road, the woman will\n\nA. win, because there is an easement by estoppel over the private road.\nB. win, because there is an implied easement appurtenant over the private road.\nC. lose, unless the private road is the only access road by which woman can gain ingress and egress to her property.\nD. lose, because she has no legal right to travel over the private road.\n"

Given that the private road was already constructed and used by other lot owners in the residential subdivision, and considering the location of Parcel 2 relative to the private road, it is reasonable to infer that an implied easement appurtenant exists. An implied easement appurtenant arises when a parcel of land is sold and the use of another piece of land (the dominant tenement) is necessary for the reasonable enjoyment of the newly sold parcel (the servient tenement). Since Parcel 2 does not border a public road and the private road is essential for access, an implied easement likely exists, allowing the woman to use the private road for ingress and egress."
