The defendant did not intend to kill the victim.\n\nFelony murder charges do not require proof of intent to kill. The prosecution must show that the death occurred during the commission or attempted commission of a felony (in this case, arson), and that the defendant was involved in that felony. The lack of intent to kill does not negate the charge of felony murder because the doctrine holds that anyone who engages in a felony that results in a death can be charged with murder, regardless of whether they intended to cause death.\n\nThe other assertions might potentially provide defenses against the charge:\n\nB. The defendant was insane when he set the fire: If the defendant can prove that he was legally insane at the time of the offense, it could be used as a defense to negate criminal responsibility.\n\nC. The defendant was coerced by another to set the fire: If the defendant can prove that he acted under duress or coercion, it could mitigate his culpability for the felony murder charge.\n\nD. The victim died of a heart attack before the fire spread to his bedroom: This assertion could challenge the causal link between the defendant's actions and the victim's death. If the victim's death was not caused by the fire but by a heart attack, it could potentially negate the felony murder charge since the death would not have been a direct result of the felony being committed."
