In the case of the word \"incarnate,\" the letters \"c\" and \"a\" are closer to the letters \"r\" and \"n\" respectively, making it more likely for the viewer to perceive the word \"car\" within the string of letters. This principle helps us organize and make sense of visual information by grouping elements that are close together into a single unit."
