Its jurisdiction includes the tax system.\n\nThe House Committee on Ways and Means is one of the oldest and most powerful committees in the U.S. House of Representatives. It has broad jurisdiction over all taxation, tariffs, and other revenue-raising measures. This includes oversight of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the implementation of federal tax laws. The committee also handles Social Security and some aspects of Medicare. It does not handle appropriations, which are managed by the Appropriations Committee, nor does it deal specifically with infrastructure or banking reform, although taxes related to these areas might fall under its purview."
