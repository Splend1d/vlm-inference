They are part of homeotic genes, which play crucial roles in development by controlling the expression of other genes that determine the identity and structure of various body parts during embryonic development. These sequences are particularly well-known for their role in specifying segment identity along the anterior-posterior axis in arthropods and vertebrates. Homeobox genes are highly conserved across different species, indicating their fundamental importance in developmental processes."
