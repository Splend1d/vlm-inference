Instead of calling for help, they chose to make a non-urgent personal call. This is a clear violation of the duty to help others in danger when one can do so without excessive risk to oneself.\n\nIn scenario 2, the main character's action is not clearly morally wrong. It is generally considered acceptable and beneficial for friends to help each other study. However, if the help involved cheating during the exam itself, that would be morally wrong, but based on the information provided, this does not seem to be the case.\n\nSo the correct answer is:\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong"
