                    "text": "The octet rule states that atoms tend to gain, lose, or share electrons in order to achieve a full set of eight valence electrons. This rule is most applicable to main-group elements, especially those in groups 14 through 17.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. BF3 (Boron Trifluoride)\n- Boron (B) has 3 valence electrons.\n- Each Fluorine (F) atom contributes 1 electron when it forms a single bond with B.\n- Total electrons around B = 3 (from B) + 3 (from F atoms) = 6.\n- Boron does not follow the octet rule; it typically has only 6 electrons in its valence shell when bonded.\n\nB. NH4+ (Ammonium Ion)\n- Nitrogen (N) has 5 valence electrons.\n- Each Hydrogen (H) atom contributes 1 electron when it forms a single bond with N.\n- The positive charge indicates one electron has been lost.\n- Total electrons around N = 5 (from N) + 4 (from H atoms) - 1 (lost) = 8.\n- Nitrogen follows the octet rule in this ion.\n\nC. PF5 (Phosphorus Pentafluoride)\n- Phosphorus (P) has 5 valence electrons.\n- Each Fluorine (F) atom contributes 1 electron when it forms a single bond with P.\n- Total electrons around P = 5 (from P) + 5 (from F atoms) = 10.\n- Phosphorus exceeds the octet rule in this molecule because it is in period 3 and can expand its octet.\n\nD. SF6 (Sulfur Hexafluoride)\n- Sulfur (S) has 6 valence electrons.\n- Each Fluorine (F) atom contributes 1 electron when it forms a single bond with S.\n- Total electrons around S = 6 (from S) + 6 (from F atoms) = 12.\n- Sulfur also exceeds the octet rule because it is in period 3 and can expand its octet.\n\nThus, the answer is **B. NH4+** which has an octet of electrons around the central atom (Nitrogen)."
