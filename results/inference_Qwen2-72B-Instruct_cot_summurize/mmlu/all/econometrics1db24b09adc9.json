(i), (ii), and (iii) only\n\nEGARCH models address several limitations of the standard GARCH model:\n\ni) In an EGARCH model, the parameters are applied in a logarithmic form, which ensures that the conditional variance remains positive and prevents estimated coefficients from being negative.\n\nii) EGARCH models can account for leverage effects, where bad news (negative shocks) tends to increase volatility more than good news (positive shocks) of the same magnitude.\n\niii) Unlike the standard GARCH model, which assumes symmetry in the response to positive and negative shocks, EGARCH models allow for asymmetric responses, capturing the leverage effect.\n\nHowever, EGARCH models do not necessarily solve the issue of allowing for feedback from volatility to returns (iv). This limitation typically requires other types of models or extensions, such as volatility feedback terms or models that incorporate mean-reversion in volatility."
