Turning away from someone when you need to sneeze is actually a recommended hygienic practice to prevent the spread of germs. Encouraging good posture by giving visual cues (like glaring) may be considered strict or perhaps even slightly harsh, but it is not morally wrong, as the intention is to help the children develop healthy habits."
