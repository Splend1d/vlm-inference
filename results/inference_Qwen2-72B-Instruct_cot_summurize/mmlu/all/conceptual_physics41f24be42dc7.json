Increase.\n\nThis phenomenon is due to the Doppler effect, which causes the frequency of waves to appear higher when the source is moving towards the observer and lower when the source is moving away from the observer. In this case, as the blinking light source approaches you, the frequency of the flashes appears to increase because each subsequent flash has less distance to travel to reach your eyes than the previous one, causing them to seem closer together in time."
