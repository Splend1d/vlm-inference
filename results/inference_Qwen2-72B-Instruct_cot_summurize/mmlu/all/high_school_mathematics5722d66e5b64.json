The number of cases decreased from 450,000 to 500 over these 36 years.\n\nThe total decrease in cases over 36 years is \\(450,000 - 500 = 449,500\\).\n\nThe average annual decrease in cases is \\(\\frac{449,500}{36} = 12,486.11\\) (approximately).\n\nNow, we want to find out how many cases would have been reported in 1987. The number of years from 1960 to 1987 is \\(1987 - 1960 = 27\\) years.\n\nIf the decrease was linear, after 27 years, the decrease in cases would be \\(27 \\times 12,486.11 = 337,125\\) (approximately).\n\nSo, starting with 450,000 cases in 1960, after 27 years, the number of cases would be \\(450,000 - 337,125 = 112,875\\).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. 112,875."
