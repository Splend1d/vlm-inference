This theory is known as constructivism. According to Piaget, children actively seek to understand the world by building upon their existing knowledge, adapting it when new information is encountered, and integrating this new information into their existing schemas (mental frameworks). This process involves two key mechanisms: assimilation (incorporating new information into existing schemas) and accommodation (modifying existing schemas or developing new ones to accommodate new information)."
