Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), also known as gel shift assay or band shift assay. This technique involves the incubation of a DNA probe with a protein extract, followed by separation of the DNA-protein complexes from free DNA by electrophoresis. The shift in the mobility of the DNA probe indicates the formation of a complex between the protein and the specific DNA sequence.\n\nA. Western blot hybridization is used to detect specific proteins in a sample.\nB. Northern blot hybridization is used to detect specific RNA molecules in a sample.\nC.
