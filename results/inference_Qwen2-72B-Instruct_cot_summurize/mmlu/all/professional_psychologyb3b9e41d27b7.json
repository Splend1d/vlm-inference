Verbal functions are preserved relatively well, but performance decreases on tests of perceptual-integrative ability.\n\nThis pattern reflects the observation that crystallized intelligence (which includes verbal skills, vocabulary, and knowledge) tends to be well-preserved in older adults, while fluid intelligence (which involves problem-solving, pattern recognition, and the processing of complex information) shows more decline with age. Perceptual-integrative abilities often fall under the category of fluid intelligence, which is why they may decline more than verbal functions."
