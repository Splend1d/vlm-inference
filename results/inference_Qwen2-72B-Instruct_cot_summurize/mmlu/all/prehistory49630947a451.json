Argon/Argon and Potassium-Argon dating\n\nThese methods rely on the radioactive decay of isotopes to determine the age of minerals and rocks. Potassium-Argon dating measures the amount of radioactive potassium-40 that has decayed into argon-40 in a rock sample, while Argon/Argon dating is a more precise version of this method that uses mass spectrometry to measure the ratios of different isotopes of argon.\n\nThe other options do not use the half-life of a radioactive isotope for dating:\n\nB. Archaeomagnetic dating uses changes in Earth's magnetic field recorded in archaeological materials to date sites. Radiocarbon dating uses the decay of carbon-14 in organic material but is not typically used for dating rocks.\n\nC. Luminescence dating (including Optically Stimulated Luminescence) measures the last time minerals were exposed to light or heat and is not based on radioactive decay.\n\nD. X-ray fluorescence is an analytical technique used to determine the elemental composition of a sample, not its age. Paleomagnetic dating uses the orientation of magnetic minerals in rocks to determine past geomagnetic field directions, which can help correlate rock layers but does not directly provide numerical ages."
