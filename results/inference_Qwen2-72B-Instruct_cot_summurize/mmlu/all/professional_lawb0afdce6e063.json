A buyer sent a signed letter to a seller that stated: \"Ship 100 boxes of nails at $3 per box, the price quoted in your circular.\" The seller mailed the buyer a signed form acknowledgment that agreed to the buyer's terms and stated on the reverse side: \"Disputes regarding quality shall be arbitrated.\" The buyer did not reply to the seller's acknowledgment, and the seller shipped the nails. When the buyer received the nails, it found their quality to be unsatisfactory and sued the seller for breach of warranty. The seller has asked an attorney whether the parties' contract requires arbitration of the buyer's claim. What is the best advice the attorney can provide?\n\nA. A contract was formed pursuant to conduct when the buyer received the nails, and a court would exclude the arbitration provision from the contract.\nB. A contract was formed when the seller mailed its acknowledgment, and the arbitration term became part of the contract. arbitration term became part of the contract.\nC. A contract was formed when the seller mailed its acknowledgment, and the court must decide whether the arbitration term should be excluded as a material alteration of the contract.\nD. No contract exists, because the arbitration term in the seller's acknowledgment created a counteroffer that the buyer never accepted.\n"

A contract was formed when the seller mailed its acknowledgment, and the court must decide whether the arbitration term should be excluded as a material alteration of the contract.\n\nIn this situation, the buyer's initial letter served as an offer to purchase goods under specific terms. The seller's acknowledgment and shipment of the goods constituted acceptance of the offer, thus forming a contract. However, the seller included an additional term (arbitration clause) in the acknowledgment, which could be considered a material alteration of the original offer. Since the buyer did not explicitly reject or accept the new term, it is unclear whether this term became part of the contract. In such cases, courts may determine whether the additional term is a material alteration and whether it can be included in the contract. If the court finds that the arbitration term is a material alteration, it may exclude it from the contract, and the buyer's lawsuit for breach of warranty would proceed in court rather than through arbitration."
