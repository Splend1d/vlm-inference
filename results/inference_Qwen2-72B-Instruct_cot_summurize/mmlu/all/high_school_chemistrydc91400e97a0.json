                    "text": "The significant difference in the volume of base required to reach the endpoint for one of the samples suggests that there may have been an additional substance present that also consumed the base. Since the sample requiring significantly more base is the outlier, it's likely that this sample was contaminated. Given the options provided:\n\nA. The indicator was added too late: This would not affect the volume of base required to reach the endpoint; it would only affect the accuracy of identifying the endpoint.\n\nB. The wrong indicator was used: This could lead to an inaccurate determination of the endpoint, but it wouldn't change the amount of base required to neutralize the acid.\n\nC. There was a base contaminating the unclean beaker: If there was a base contaminating the beaker, it would react with the acid before the titration began, reducing the amount of acid available for titration and thus requiring less base to reach the endpoint, not more.\n\nD. There was an acid contaminating the unclean beaker: This is the most plausible explanation. An additional acid in the sample would require more base to neutralize both the original acid (phenol) and the contaminant, resulting in a higher volume of base needed to reach the endpoint.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **D**. There was an acid contaminating the unclean beaker."
