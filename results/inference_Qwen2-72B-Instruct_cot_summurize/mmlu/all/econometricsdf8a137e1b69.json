                    "text": "The statement that is true concerning alternative forecast accuracy measures is:\n\nD. Mean squared error penalises large forecast errors disproportionately more than small forecast errors\n\nThis is because the mean squared error (MSE) squares the difference between the forecast and the actual value, which means that larger errors are weighted more heavily in the calculation than smaller errors. This can make MSE a more sensitive measure to outliers compared to other measures like the mean absolute error (MAE), which does not square the errors.\n\nA. Mean squared error is usually highly correlated with trading rule profitability - This statement may or may not be true depending on the specific context and the nature of the trading rules being used. While it's possible that more accurate forecasts could lead to more profitable trading rules, the relationship is not necessarily direct or guaranteed.\n\nB. Mean absolute error provides a quadratic loss function - This statement is false. The mean absolute error (MAE) actually provides a linear loss function because it sums up the absolute differences between the forecast and the actual values without squaring them.\n\nC. Mean absolute percentage error is a useful measure for evaluating asset return forecasts - This statement could be considered true in certain contexts. Mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) can be useful for comparing forecast accuracy across different scales, but it has limitations when dealing with very small or zero actual values, which can occur with asset returns. Additionally, MAPE can be misleading if the data contains zeros or near-zero values since the percentage error becomes undefined or extremely large in these cases."
