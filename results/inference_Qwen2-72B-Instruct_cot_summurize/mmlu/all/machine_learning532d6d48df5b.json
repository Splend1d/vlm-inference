The BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) metric is commonly used in natural language processing for evaluating the quality of machine translation by comparing a candidate translation with one or more reference translations. It uses precision to measure how many n-grams (contiguous sequences of n items from a given sample of text or speech) in the candidate translation also appear in the reference translation.\n\nStatement 2 is also true. Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) have been widely used in various applications in natural language processing, including part-of-speech tagging and modeling English sentences. HMMs can capture the probabilistic nature of language and have been effective in modeling sequences of words in sentences."
