Instead, he proposes a contractarian approach to ethics that he believes can solve this crisis. According to Gauthier, rational individuals would agree to limit their pursuit of self-interest (enlightened egoism, option A) through a social contract that results in mutual benefit. This agreement is grounded in the principle of \"justified constraint\" (option C), where individuals agree to constrain their own actions for the sake of a cooperative society that benefits everyone involved. Gauthier's theory does not center around \"prima facie duties\" (option D), which are a concept from the ethical theory of W.D. Ross.\n\nTherefore, the morality that Gauthier describes as facing a foundational crisis essentially involves:\n\nB. pure altruism.\n\nAnd the alternative morality that he proposes is based on:\n\nA. enlightened egoism and\nC. justified constraint."
