Mediator\n\nIn this scenario, motivation is hypothesized to be the mechanism through which the intervention (brief motivational interviewing) affects the outcome (lower levels of problem alcohol use). Therefore, motivation serves as a mediator. Mediators are variables that explain how an independent variable leads to a dependent variable. In other words, they account for the relationship between the independent and dependent variables by showing the process or pathway through which the effect occurs."
