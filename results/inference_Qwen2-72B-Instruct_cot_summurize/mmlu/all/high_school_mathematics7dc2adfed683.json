According to the problem, Grady rides his bike \\(60\\%\\) faster than Noah, so we can write:\n\n\\[G = N + 0.6N = 1.6N\\]\n\nWe know that Grady rides \\(12\\) miles further than Noah in \\(2\\) hours. The distance traveled is equal to the speed times the time, so we have:\n\n\\[Distance_{Noah} = N \\times 2\\]\n\\[Distance_{Grady} = G \\times 2\\]\n\nSince Grady rides \\(12\\) miles further than Noah in the same time, we can set up the following equation:\n\n\\[Distance_{Grady} - Distance_{Noah} = 12\\]\n\nSubstituting the expressions for the distances, we get:\n\n\\[1.6N \\times 2 - N \\times 2 = 12\\]\n\nSimplifying this equation:\n\n\\[3.2N - 2N = 12\\]\n\\[1.2N = 12\\]\n\nDividing both sides by \\(1.2\\), we find:\n\n\\[N = 12 / 1.2\\]\n\\[N = 10\\]\n\nTherefore, Noah rides at a speed of \\(10\\) miles per hour, which corresponds to option C."
