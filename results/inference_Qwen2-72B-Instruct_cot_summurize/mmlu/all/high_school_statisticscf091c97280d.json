The first showed 58% and the second 13% because of response bias due to the wording of the questions.\n\nExplanation: Response bias occurs when the way a question is worded influences the answers that respondents give. In this case, the different wording of the two questions may have led to different responses from the participants, resulting in a significant difference in the percentage of people who supported the proposed school budget increase. This type of bias can occur when the questions are leading or suggest a particular answer, which can influence the responses given by the participants. Without a neutral and unbiased question, it's difficult to accurately measure public opinion on the issue."
