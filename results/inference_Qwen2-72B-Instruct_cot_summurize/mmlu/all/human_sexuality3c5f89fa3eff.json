Genital herpes can be transmitted through oral-genital sex, as the virus can be present in saliva or on the skin around the mouth and can infect the genital area.\n\nB. Genital herpes cannot be cured with antibiotics. Antibiotics are used to treat bacterial infections, while genital herpes is caused by a virus (Herpes Simplex Virus or HSV). There is no cure for genital herpes, but antiviral medications can help manage symptoms and reduce the frequency of outbreaks.\n\nC. If Avalon contracted genital herpes, she could be contagious even when she doesn't have a breakout. The virus can be shed asymptomatically, meaning it can be transmitted even when there are no visible sores or other signs of an outbreak."
