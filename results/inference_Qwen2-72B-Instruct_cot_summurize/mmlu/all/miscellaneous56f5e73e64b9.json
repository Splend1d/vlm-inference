Only 46 individuals have ever served as President of the United States, and they have all met the constitutional requirements of being at least 35 years old, a natural-born citizen, and a resident of the United States for at least 14 years. The average term of a US president is about 4.5 years. However, if we consider the time each individual citizen has spent as president, it would be a very small fraction of a second, given that there are over 328 million people living in the United States."
