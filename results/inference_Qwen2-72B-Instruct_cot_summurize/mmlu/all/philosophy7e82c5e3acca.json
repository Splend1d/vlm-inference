Augustine argued that lying corrupts the soul and damages one's relationship with God. Therefore, in Augustine's view, lying is:\n\nD. never permissible.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that Augustine did recognize certain complexities in moral situations where telling the truth might lead to grave harm. In such cases, he suggested that one could remain silent or use ambiguous language rather than lie outright. But this does not mean he considered lying to be permissible; rather, he saw it as less preferable to other alternatives that still maintained a commitment to truth."
