Hearsay is generally inadmissible unless it falls under a recognized exception. However, in this case, there is no indication that the statement falls under any such exception.\n\nWhile the excited utterance exception to the hearsay rule could potentially apply if the statement was made while the declarant was under the stress of excitement caused by the event, the plaintiff's testimony does not specify that the son made the statement immediately after the event or while still under the stress of the event. Therefore, without further information, it cannot be assumed that the statement qualifies as an excited utterance. Additionally, option D incorrectly describes the excited utterance exception, as statements made under the stress of excitement are not typically considered to be products of reflection and deliberation.\n\nThe availability of the son as a witness (option A) does not automatically make the plaintiff's hearsay statement admissible. The proper course would be for the son to testify directly about what he witnessed, rather than having the plaintiff relate the son's statement. Option B is incorrect because the statement is indeed hearsay and requires an applicable exception to be admitted, which has not been demonstrated in this scenario."
