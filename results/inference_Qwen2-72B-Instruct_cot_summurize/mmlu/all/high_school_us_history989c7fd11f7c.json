I have read\u2026the last will and testament of the Lord Jesus over many times, and yet I cannot find by one tittle of that testament that if He had been pleased to have accepted of a temporal crown and government that ever He would have put forth the least finger of temporal or civil power in the matters of His spiritual affairs and Kingdom. Hence must it lamentably be against the testimony of Christ Jesus for the civil state to impose upon the souls of the people a religion, a worship, a ministry, oaths (in religious and civil affairs), tithes, times, days, marryings, and buryings in holy ground\u2026\"\nRoger Williams, The Hireling Ministry None of Christ's, 1652\nThe Puritans believed that the freedom to practice religion should be extended to\n\nA.

He argues against the imposition of religious practices by civil authorities, suggesting that such actions are contrary to the teachings of Christ.\n\nHowever, the quote does not directly address who the Puritans believed should have the freedom to practice religion. Given the context of the time and the known beliefs of Roger Williams, who was a proponent of religious liberty and founded Rhode Island as a haven for religious minorities, we can infer that his views were more inclusive than those of many other Puritans.\n\nThe Puritans themselves believed in a form of religious freedom within their own community but often imposed strict religious conformity on others. They persecuted Quakers, Baptists, and other dissenters within their colonies. However, Roger Williams' stance suggests a broader interpretation of religious freedom that could potentially extend beyond just Puritans or even Christians.\n\nSince the quote does not provide enough information to definitively answer the question regarding the Puritans' beliefs about religious freedom for non-Puritans, and considering that different Puritans might have held different views, the most accurate answer based on the given information would be:\n\nE. None of the above, as the quote does not specify the Puritans' beliefs on religious freedom for non-Puritans, and historical context suggests varied stances among Puritans.\n\nHowever, if you must choose from the options provided (A through D), none of them accurately reflect the broad religious freedom advocated by Roger Williams in the quote, nor do they fully capture the complex and sometimes contradictory views of the Puritans regarding religious freedom. Therefore, the options provided (A through D) do not sufficiently answer the question based on the information given."
