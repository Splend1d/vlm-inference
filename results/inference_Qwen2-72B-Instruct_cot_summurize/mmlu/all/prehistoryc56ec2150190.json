All of the above. \n\nResearchers have proposed multiple interpretations of the fossil record for the period between about 1.8 million and 400,000 years ago. Some argue for the existence of two or more related but geographically separate hominid species that evolved from earlier African hominids (option A). Others suggest that hominids from this time can be grouped into different species based on their geographic location in Africa, Asia, and Europe (option B). Still others maintain that all hominids that evolved from Homo habilis and predate Homo sapiens should be classified under a single, geographically widespread but morphologically diverse species known as Homo erectus (option C). These differing interpretations reflect ongoing debates within the scientific community regarding how to classify the diversity of hominid fossils found across different regions and time periods."
