In Scenario 2, placing unwanted items in a garage sale could be seen as a positive action, provided that the items actually belong to the wife or she has given consent for their sale. Without additional context about whether the wife was aware and agreed to this, it's not clear if anything morally wrong occurred, but typically disposing of unwanted items is not considered morally wrong."
