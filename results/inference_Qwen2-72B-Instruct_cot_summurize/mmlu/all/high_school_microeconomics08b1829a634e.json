In a perfectly competitive market, all workers willing to work at the equilibrium wage will be employed because there are no barriers to entry or exit and all firms pay the same wage. This does not mean that everyone in the economy is employed, only those willing to work at the current wage rate.\n\nOptions (B) and (D) are incorrect because in a perfectly competitive market, individual firms face a horizontal labor demand curve, not a downward sloping or upward sloping one. This is because they are price (and wage) takers and must accept the market-determined wage rate.\n\nOption (C) is also incorrect because high levels of unemployment are not consistent with the concept of a perfectly competitive labor market in equilibrium. Unemployment might exist due to frictional reasons or if the wage rate is set above the equilibrium level, but these conditions would not represent a market in equilibrium."
