This feature has a strong effect on the model (should be retained)\n\nA high negative coefficient in a linear regression model indicates that there is a strong relationship between the feature and the target variable, but it is an inverse relationship. As the value of the feature increases, the predicted value of the target variable decreases, and vice versa. This does not mean the feature should be ignored; rather, it suggests that the feature is important in predicting the target variable and should be retained in the model unless other considerations (such as multicollinearity or irrelevant predictive power) suggest otherwise. However, it's crucial to also consider the context of the data and the specific domain knowledge to fully understand the implications of such coefficients."
