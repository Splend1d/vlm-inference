However, when used together in context, it most directly refers to the Guru Granth Sahib (the holy scripture of Sikhism) as the living Guru. So, the closest answer would be:\n\nB. Scripture\n\nThis is because the Guru Granth Sahib is considered the final and eternal Guru in Sikhism, guiding the Sikhs in their faith and practice."
