Cell wall\n\nProkaryotic cells, such as bacteria, typically have a cell wall made of peptidoglycan, while animal cells do not have a cell wall at all. However, it's important to note that the presence of chloroplasts (option C) would also distinguish both from each other, as chloroplasts are found in plant and algae cells, which are eukaryotic, not in animal cells or prokaryotic cells. But since the question asks to distinguish between a prokaryote and an animal cell specifically, the correct answer is the cell wall."
