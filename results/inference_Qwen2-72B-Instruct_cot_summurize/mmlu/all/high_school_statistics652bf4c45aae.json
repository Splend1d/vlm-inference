When a group of teachers rated their ability to control their situation and their satisfaction with their job, the two variables had a correlation of 0.30. Which statement follows from this correlation?\n\nA. If you want teachers to be happy with their job, give them more control over their situation.\nB. If you want teachers to take more control over their situation, make them happier at their jobs.\nC. Teachers in the study who were more satisfied with their job were less confident in their ability to control their situation.\nD. 9% of the variability in job satisfaction can be explained by the linear model with self-efficacy as a predictor.\n"

Therefore, options A and B, which suggest causal relationships, do not follow directly from the correlation. Option C is incorrect because it suggests an inverse relationship, which contradicts the positive correlation reported.\n\nThe square of the correlation coefficient (r^2), also known as the coefficient of determination, gives the proportion of variance in one variable that can be predicted from the other variable. In this case, r^2 = 0.30^2 = 0.09 or 9%. This means that 9% of the variability in job satisfaction can be explained by knowing the level of self-efficacy among teachers."
