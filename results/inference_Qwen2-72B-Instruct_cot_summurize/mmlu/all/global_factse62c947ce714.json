However, if we look at the percentage of GDP spent on renewable energy investment, it was actually Sweden that led the world in 2015. That being said, none of the options you've given is correct based on the information I have.\n\nHowever, if we look at total investment in renewable energy rather than as a percentage of GDP, China has been the leader for several years and was also the top investor in 2015.\n\nSo, if your question is about the country that invested the most in absolute terms in 2015, the answer would be:\n\nA. China\n\nBut if your question is about the country that invested the largest fraction of its GDP in renewable energy in 2015, then none of the above options are correct, and the answer would be Sweden."
