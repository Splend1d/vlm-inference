Levy in 1978 and later expanded upon by Michael J. Darroch in 2003. They are used to classify the characteristics of goods and services based on how consumers evaluate them before and after purchase.\n\nSearch properties are those that can be assessed before the purchase, such as price or design. Experience properties can only be evaluated during or after consumption, like taste or comfort. Credence properties are those that require expertise to assess, often involving trust, such as medical treatment or education quality."
