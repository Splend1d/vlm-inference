Wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn Scenario 1, hitting someone is considered a violent and aggressive act that can cause harm, both physically and emotionally, to the person being hit. This action is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nIn Scenario 2, locking a door when one's child is outside and asking to be let in might not be inherently morally wrong without additional context. It could be a situation where the parent is momentarily securing the door for safety reasons or due to a misunderstanding. However, if the action results in neglect or causes significant distress to the child, it could potentially be seen as morally questionable. Without further context, though, the action is not clearly morally wrong. Given the options provided, \"Not wrong\" is the closest choice assuming there is no harmful intent or consequence."
