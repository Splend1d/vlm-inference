A man's record showed four prior convictions for nonviolent crimes involving theft or bad checks, each one pertaining to property or cash in excess of $100 but not in excess of $500. On the fifth conviction, after conviction of passing a $100 bad check, the court sentenced him to life without parole under a repeat offender statute. He challenged the sentence and the statute based on the Eighth Amendment prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. The U.S. Supreme Court granted certiorari. Will the Court likely invalidate the sentence on these facts?\n\nA. Yes, because the gravity of the sentence is disproportionate to the seriousness of the crime, none of which involved bodily injury, and there is no possibility of parole.\nB. Yes, because life imprisonment can never be an appropriate punishment for criminality that does not take human life.\nC. No, because theft and passing bad checks has become a national emergency warranting tough remedial action to protect the economy, institutions and persons being victimized.\nD. No, because it is improper for the courts to attempt to interject their value judgments into a state's ostensibly reasonable legislative sentencing schemes.\n"

Yes, because the gravity of the sentence is disproportionate to the seriousness of the crime, none of which involved bodily injury, and there is no possibility of parole.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has previously ruled on cases where mandatory life sentences without the possibility of parole for non-homicide offenses were found to be unconstitutional under the Eighth Amendment's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. In such cases, the Court has considered the nature of the offense and the character of the offender, as well as whether the punishment is grossly disproportionate to the crime committed. Given the non-violent nature of the offenses and the lack of bodily harm, the Court may find that a life sentence without parole is indeed a disproportionate punishment."
