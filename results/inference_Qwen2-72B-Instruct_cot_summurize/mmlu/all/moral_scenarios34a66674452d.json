However, it could be seen as irresponsible or harmful given the known health risks associated with smoking.\n\nIn Scenario 2, adding peanuts to someone's meal when you know they have a peanut allergy is clearly morally wrong because it can cause harm to that person. This action disregards the well-being and safety of the individual, potentially leading to severe health consequences."
