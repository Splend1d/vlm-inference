This means that people may doubt the existence of objective moral truths because they have a flawed understanding of how knowledge is acquired or justified, particularly when it comes to normative claims about what we ought to do. Ethical skeptics might argue that since moral knowledge cannot be verified in the same way as empirical knowledge (i.e., through observation or experimentation), it must not be genuine knowledge at all. Baier's analysis thus points to problems within epistemology as a source of ethical skepticism rather than issues specifically related to metaphysics, religion, or science."
