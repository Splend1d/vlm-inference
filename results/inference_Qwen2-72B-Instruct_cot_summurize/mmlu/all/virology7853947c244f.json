Single drugs are not completely inhibitory: No single antiretroviral drug can completely suppress HIV replication in all infected individuals. HIV can develop resistance to individual drugs, and the viral load may rebound if only one drug is used.\n\nB. Mutations negate the effect of one drug: HIV has a high mutation rate, which allows it to rapidly evolve resistance to individual antiretroviral drugs. Using multiple drugs simultaneously reduces the likelihood that the virus will develop resistance to any one drug, as it must develop mutations that confer resistance to all drugs in the regimen at the same time.\n\nC. Combinations of antibiotics are effective versus TB: This statement is true but not relevant to the question about HIV treatment.\n\nD. The virus cannot mutate vs a combination: This statement is not entirely accurate. While using multiple drugs makes it more difficult for the virus to develop resistance, it does not eliminate the possibility of mutation. However, the probability of the virus developing resistance to multiple drugs simultaneously is much lower than to a single drug."
