Wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn Scenario 1, buying cigarettes for a teenager is clearly morally wrong because it involves providing a minor with a harmful and addictive substance that is illegal for them to possess. In the United States, it is illegal to sell or provide tobacco products to individuals under the age of 18 (and as of 2020, the federal minimum age was raised to 21). This action also goes against public health guidelines and societal norms concerning the protection of minors from harmful substances.\n\nIn Scenario 2, driving above the speed limit may be considered a legal violation and potentially unsafe, but whether it is morally wrong depends on the circumstances and context. If the speeding is minor and there is no danger to others, some might argue that it is not morally wrong, just legally questionable. However, if speeding puts others at risk, then it could be considered morally wrong. Given the information provided, which does not specify any dangerous conditions, this scenario might not be considered clearly morally wrong by ordinary standards, although it is still generally advised against due to safety concerns."
