This is because there are no values of \\(x\\) for which \\(\\sin(x)\\) is undefined.\n\n2. **Range**: The range of \\(\\sin(x)\\) is \\([-1, 1]\\). This means that the smallest value \\(\\sin(x)\\) can attain is -1, and the largest value it can attain is 1.\n\nNow, consider the transformed function \\(3\\sin(2x)\\).\n\n1. **Domain**: The transformation does not affect the domain of the sine function. No matter how you scale or shift the input \\(x\\), the sine function will still accept all real numbers as inputs. Therefore, the domain of \\(3\\sin(2x)\\) is also all real numbers, i.e., \\((-\\infty, +\\infty)\\).\n\n2. **Range**: The amplitude of the sine function is affected by the coefficient in front of it. In this case, the amplitude of \\(\\sin(x)\\) is multiplied by 3. Thus, the new range is \\([-3, 3]\\). This is because the smallest value \\(3\\sin(2x)\\) can now attain is -3 (when \\(\\sin(2x) = -1\\)), and the largest value it can attain is 3 (when \\(\\sin(2x) = 1\\)).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**D. Domain is the same; range is tripled**"
