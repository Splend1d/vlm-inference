It is possible to place a linear order relation \u2264 on the complex numbers C such that (C, +, \u00d7, \u2264) is not an ordered field.\n\nExplanation: An ordered field is a field equipped with a total order that is compatible with the algebraic operations. The complex numbers C cannot be made into an ordered field because they do not satisfy the necessary properties for an ordered field. Specifically, there is no way to define a linear order on C that is compatible with its algebraic structure. This is because any linear order on C would have to satisfy the property that if a < b, then a + c < b + c for all c in C, and if a > 0 and b > 0, then ab > 0. However, this leads to a contradiction when considering the square root of -1, since i^2 = -1, but we cannot say whether i is positive or negative without violating one of these properties.\n\nTherefore, option B is false, and option D is also false since it includes B. Option C is not a valid choice since it implies that neither A nor B is true, which is not the case since A is true. Hence, the only correct answer is A."
