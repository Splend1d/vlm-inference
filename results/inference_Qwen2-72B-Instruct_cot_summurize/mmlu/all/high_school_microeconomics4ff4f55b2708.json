This is because the demand for labor by firms is essentially a derived demand, which means that it depends on the demand for the goods or services that the labor helps to produce. As the demand for the output increases, firms will require more labor to increase production to meet this higher demand, thereby shifting the labor demand curve outwards. Conversely, if the demand for output decreases, the demand for labor will also decrease as firms cut back on production, leading to a shift inward of the labor demand curve."
