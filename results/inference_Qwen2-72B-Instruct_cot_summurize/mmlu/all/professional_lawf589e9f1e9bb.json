Charlie in an amount of $10,000 if the court finds the contract divisible and the $10,000 is an equivalent amount for the completed portion of the agreement.\n\nIn this scenario, Charlie completed the bathroom portion of the work, which was valued at $10,000 in the contract. If the court determines that the contract can be divided (i.e., the bathroom and kitchen portions are separate obligations), then Charlie should be compensated for the work he has already done. Since he refuses to begin the kitchen work due to Nancy's non-cooperation, he may not be entitled to the full $25,000, but he should receive payment for the completed bathroom. Option C reflects this legal principle of partial performance and apportionment of damages."
