                    "text": "The correct answer is D. little effect on venous pressure and a large increase in arterial pressure.\n\nWhen the ventricles contract during the systolic phase of the cardiac cycle, they eject a volume of blood equivalent to the ventricular stroke volume into the arteries. This sudden increase in blood volume leads to a significant increase in arterial pressure as the arteries, which have much lower compliance than veins, resist the expansion caused by the additional blood volume. The increase in arterial pressure is necessary to push the blood through the systemic circulation against the resistance of the arterioles and capillaries.\n\nOn the other hand, the effect on venous pressure is minimal because veins have much greater compliance (ability to expand) than arteries. They can accommodate changes in blood volume without a substantial increase in pressure. Additionally, during diastole, when the ventricles relax, the blood flows back from the arteries to the atria and then to the ventricles, and the pressure in the veins does not significantly increase due to this process.\n\nTherefore, the transfer of blood from the venous to the arterial side during the cardiac cycle primarily results in a large transient increase in arterial pressure with little effect on venous pressure."
