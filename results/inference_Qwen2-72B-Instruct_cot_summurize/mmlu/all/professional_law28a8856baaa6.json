At sentencing the court made additional factual findings, based on a preponderance of the evidence, that resulted in the addition of a 10-year enhancement to the sentence, which was over and above the maximum provided for by the jury's verdict. Defense counsel objected that the judge-made enhancement was unconstitutional and denied his right to a jury trial on that issue. Does counsel have a valid constitutional argument?\n\nA. No, sentencing laws widely authorize the sentencing court to engage in fact-finding that is based on a preponderance of the evidence.\nB. No, it has never been decided that a defendant has a right to be judged on proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\nC. Yes, judicial fact-finding that increases the maximum sentence over what the jury's verdict allows is unconstitutional.\nD. Yes, it is unconstitutional for a court to use its discretion to fashioning a defendant's sentence.\n"

New Jersey (2000) decision by the U.S. Supreme Court, which held that any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt. This ruling was later extended in Blakely v. Washington (2004) and further clarified in Alleyne v. United States (2013), where the Court stated that any fact that increases the mandatory minimum or maximum sentence must also be found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. Therefore, the defense counsel's objection based on the denial of the right to a jury trial on this issue is constitutionally valid."
