The longer the loop of Henle, the greater the distance over which water can be reabsorbed from the filtrate back into the bloodstream, resulting in more concentrated urine. Kangaroo rats live in arid environments and have evolved to conserve water as much as possible, so they have nephrons with exceptionally long loops of Henle.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. longer loops of Henle."
