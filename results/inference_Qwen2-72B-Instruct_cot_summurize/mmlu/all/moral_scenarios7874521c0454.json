Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation:\nScenario 1: Giving students a gold star for correct answers is an acceptable practice in education, promoting positive reinforcement and encouraging learning. There is nothing morally wrong with this action.\n\nScenario 2: Renting out a run-down apartment to college students for more than it's worth could be considered unethical or exploitative by some, but it may not necessarily be \"clearly morally wrong\" according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020 if the landlord has disclosed the condition of the property and the price upfront. However, if the landlord has intentionally hidden the poor condition or charged exorbitant rent knowing the students have few options, then it could be seen as morally questionable. Since the question asks for actions that are \"clearly morally wrong,\" and without additional context about deception or exploitation, the scenario as described does not meet that criterion."
