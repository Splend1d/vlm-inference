The Minoans were a peaceful people who focused on trade, art, and architecture. They developed a complex society with a sophisticated administrative system, but there is little evidence of a standing army or fortified cities. This has led some scholars to suggest that the Minoans may have been a largely pacifistic culture. However, it's worth noting that the lack of evidence for warfare doesn't necessarily mean that it didn't occur at all. It could simply be that the Minoans didn't leave behind as many records or artifacts related to warfare as other ancient cultures did."
