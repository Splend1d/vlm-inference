Generally, elements that are more electronegative tend to have higher electron affinities because they can more easily attract an additional electron.\n\nAmong the options given:\n\nA. Fluorine (F) - It is one of the most electronegative elements and has a very high electron affinity.\nB. Silicon (Si) - It is less electronegative than fluorine and oxygen, and therefore, it has a lower electron affinity.\nC. Oxygen (O) - Although oxygen is quite electronegative, its electron affinity is not as high as you might expect due to the half-filled subshell stability of the oxygen atom. Adding an electron to oxygen would fill its p-orbital, leading to a less stable configuration.\nD. Calcium (Ca) - This is an alkaline earth metal with a low electronegativity. Metals typically have low electron affinities because they readily lose electrons rather than gain them.\n\nBased on these considerations, the element with the lowest electron affinity among the options provided is:\n\nD. Calcium (Ca)"
