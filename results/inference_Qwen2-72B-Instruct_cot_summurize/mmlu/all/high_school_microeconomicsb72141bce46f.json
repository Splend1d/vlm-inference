This implies that its production does not significantly impact the overall market price of plastic. In a constant-cost industry, the costs of production do not change as output increases or decreases because the industry does not have enough market power to affect the prices of its inputs (in this case, plastic). Therefore, the cost per unit remains relatively stable regardless of how much the industry produces.\n\nAn increasing-cost industry would experience higher costs as it increases output due to factors such as higher input prices from increased demand, while a decreasing-cost industry would see lower costs per unit as output increases due to economies of scale or technological advancements. The information given doesn't suggest either scenario for the plastic army figures industry.\n\nOption D, \"profit-making industry,\" isn't an accurate classification based on the given information since profitability depends on many factors beyond just the cost structure, including sales price, demand, and competition."
