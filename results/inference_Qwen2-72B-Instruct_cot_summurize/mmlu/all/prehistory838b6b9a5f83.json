Unlike other ancient scripts such as Egyptian hieroglyphs, cuneiform from Mesopotamia, and ancient Chinese characters, which have been largely or partially deciphered, the Indus script has not yielded its secrets despite much effort by scholars. The main challenges include the lack of bilingual inscriptions (comparable texts in both the unknown language and a known language), the brevity of most inscriptions, and uncertainty about the language family to which the underlying language belongs."
