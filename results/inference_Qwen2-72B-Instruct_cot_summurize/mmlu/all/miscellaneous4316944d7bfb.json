The only state he did not carry was Vermont, which went to the incumbent president, Herbert Hoover. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nA. six\n\nHowever, this answer choice is incorrect based on the historical fact. The correct number should be \"one,\" but that option is not provided among the choices you've listed. It seems there might have been an error in the formulation of the question or the answer choices. Given the context and the options provided, the closest correct response based on the information given would be:\n\nA. six\n\nBut this is only correct if we assume there was a misunderstanding in the creation of the question, as FDR did not fail to carry six states in the 1932 election. He failed to carry one state, Vermont."
