Here's how:\n\nA. Suppresses milk production: Nicotine, the addictive substance in cigarettes, can reduce the levels of prolactin, a hormone that stimulates milk production. This can lead to a decrease in breast milk supply.\n\nB. Alters the composition of breast milk: Smoking can change the chemical makeup of breast milk, introducing harmful substances like nicotine and carbon monoxide into it. These substances can then be ingested by the baby during feeding.\n\nC. Increases the risk of early cessation of breastfeeding: Smoking has been linked to an increased likelihood of mothers stopping breastfeeding earlier than they might have if they didn't smoke. This could be due to reduced milk production or concerns about the safety of breastfeeding while smoking.\n\nIt's important for smoking mothers who wish to breastfeed to consider quitting or significantly reducing their smoking habits to minimize these risks to their baby's health."
