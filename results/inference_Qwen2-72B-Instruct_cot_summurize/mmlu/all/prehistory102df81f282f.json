This enhanced ability to walk upright allowed them to travel longer distances with less energy expenditure. Their anatomy was better adapted for endurance running and long-distance travel, which would have been crucial for migration over vast areas.\n\nAdditionally, their increased intelligence, as evidenced by larger brain size and more complex stone tools, allowed them to adapt to new environments and overcome challenges during their migrations. However, since the question asks specifically about what gave them the ability to migrate so far and so fast, the improved bipedalism is the most direct factor related to this capability."
