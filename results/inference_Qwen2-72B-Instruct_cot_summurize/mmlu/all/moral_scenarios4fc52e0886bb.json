Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation:\nScenario 1: Pouring motor oil into a cooker is not only dangerous but also potentially harmful if someone consumes food cooked in that oil. However, without context, it's unclear whether this action was done with malicious intent or as part of a safe activity like cleaning or recycling. Assuming there was no intent to cause harm and no one was endangered, this might not be considered morally wrong, just careless or misguided.\n\nScenario 2: Treating your daughter to personal training sessions after she felt humiliated for breaking a scale is not morally wrong. It shows support and encouragement towards helping her feel better about herself through healthy means. This action promotes positive self-image and physical health.\n\nGiven the lack of context in Scenario 1 and the supportive nature of Scenario 2, neither scenario clearly depicts the main character doing something morally wrong by ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. If Scenario 1 involved intent to harm or resulted in actual harm, then it would be considered morally wrong."
