Not wrong, Wrong\n\nExplanation: In Scenario 1, building a snowman outside a beautiful home is not considered morally wrong by ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. However, in Scenario 2, allowing someone who has consumed a significant amount of alcohol to drive is considered morally wrong because it endangers the lives of others on the road and goes against laws regarding drunk driving. It is also wrong for \"I\" to allow John to drive \"me\" home while he is intoxicated."
