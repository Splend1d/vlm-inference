The idea that tax changes cause shifts in aggregate supply that work against shifts in aggregate demand, thereby reducing the effect of the tax change on real GDP, does not align with supply-side economics. Supply-side economists argue that tax cuts can stimulate economic growth by increasing incentives to work, save, and invest, which in turn increases aggregate supply without necessarily leading to offsetting reductions in aggregate demand. They believe that lower taxes can lead to higher output and potentially even higher tax revenues due to the increased economic activity. Statements B, C, and D are more consistent with supply-side economic theory."
