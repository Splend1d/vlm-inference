One morning, there was a bank robbery in the state. That afternoon, a police officer arrested a suspect who he believed was involved in the crime. However, the police officer and the suspect have given different accounts concerning what happened next. According to the police officer, after the suspect was apprehended, he resisted arrest and hit the police officer in the mouth with his fist. The police officer, who was momentarily stunned, pulled out his nightstick and struck the suspect over the head with it. On the other hand, the suspect claimed that after he was arrested, he cursed at the policeman, whereupon the police officer began hitting the suspect with his nightstick. To avoid being hit again, the suspect hit the police officer with his fist, knocking him down. The suspect was charged with assault. The suspect should be found\n\nA. not guilty, if the arrest was unlawful without probable cause and the jury believes the suspect's account.\nB. not guilty, if the arrest was lawful, provided that the jury believes the suspect's account.\nC. guilty, if the arrest was lawful, regardless which account the jury believes.\nD. guilty, if the arrest was unlawful, regardless which account the jury believes.\n"

This duty applies regardless of whether the arrest is ultimately determined to be lawful or unlawful. If the arrest was lawful, then the suspect had no right to resist arrest by striking the police officer, even if the police officer initiated physical contact. Therefore, if the jury believes the police officer's account that the suspect struck him first, the suspect would be guilty of assault. Even if the jury believes the suspect's account that he only struck the police officer in self-defense after being hit with the nightstick, the suspect would still be guilty of violating the state statute by using force to resist arrest. The legality of the arrest is irrelevant to the question of whether the suspect violated the statute by using force to resist arrest."
