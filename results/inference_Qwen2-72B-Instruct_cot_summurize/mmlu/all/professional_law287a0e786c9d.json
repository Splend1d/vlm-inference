The remedy is recovery of actual damages from harm to chattel or loss of use.\n\nWhile actual damages for harm to the chattel or loss of use may be recoverable in some cases, the primary remedy for conversion is typically the fair market value of the chattel at the time of the conversion, which is reflected in option D. Conversion is a tort that occurs when someone intentionally interferes with another person's property rights to the extent that it deprives the owner of possession. The remedy usually involves an award of damages equal to the value of the chattel (personal property), not necessarily the cost of repairs or loss of use unless those can be specifically quantified and proven."
