Positive symptoms are those that add or distort normal function and include hallucinations (auditory, visual, or other senses), delusions (paranoid or otherwise), disorganized speech, and disorganized or catatonic behavior. Negative symptoms involve a reduction or loss of normal function and can include flat affect (reduced emotional expression), avolition (loss of motivation), anhedonia (loss of pleasure in activities), and asociality (withdrawal from social interactions)."
