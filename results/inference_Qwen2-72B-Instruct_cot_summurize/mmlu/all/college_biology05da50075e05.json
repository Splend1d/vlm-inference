This process often requires a primer, which is a short nucleic acid sequence that provides a starting point for DNA synthesis. The primer can be either DNA or RNA. Reverse transcriptase has both RNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity (to synthesize the DNA strand) and RNAase H activity (to degrade the RNA template), although in some cases, the RNA may not be completely degraded, resulting in an RNA/DNA hybrid."
