What ensures that an expired Kerberos ticket can no longer be used?\n\nA. The Kerberos server (KDC) refuses to establish new connections between clients and servers for expired tickets.\nB. When a client connects to a server, the server sets a 24-hour timer to terminate the connection, which ensures a client cannot remain connected past the ticket\u2019s maximum lifetime.\nC. When a client connects to a server, the server compares the ticket\u2019s expiration time to the server\u2019s current clock, and refuses to authenticate the user if the ticket expiration time is in the past.\nD. When a client connects to a server, the server sends a query to the KDC to check if the ticket is still valid with respect to the KDC\u2019s clock, and refuses to authenticate the user if the KDC reports that the ticket is expired.\n"

When a client connects to a server, the server compares the ticket's expiration time to the server's current clock, and refuses to authenticate the user if the ticket expiration time is in the past.\n\nIn Kerberos authentication, when a client requests a service from a server, it presents a ticket issued by the Key Distribution Center (KDC). This ticket contains an encrypted timestamp, among other things. When the server receives the ticket, it decrypts it using its own key and checks the timestamp against its own clock. If the ticket's expiration time is in the past according to the server's clock, the server will refuse to authenticate the user and provide the requested service. This mechanism ensures that an expired Kerberos ticket cannot be used to gain access to services or resources."
