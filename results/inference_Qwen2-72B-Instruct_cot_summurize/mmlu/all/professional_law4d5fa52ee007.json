By the terms of the lease, the friend expressly covenanted to pay a monthly rental of $300 and to pay the taxes on the premises during the term of the lease. The lease also stipulated that the friend, as lessee, may not assign or sublease the said premises. The friend and his family lived in the house for two years. Then the friend, still owing the landlord three months back rent, assigned his leasehold interest in the property to a professor, who was unaware of the prohibition against assignments. This written assignment expressly provided that the professor would pay the landlord the monthly rental of $300, but was silent concerning the payment of taxes. The landlord never objected to this assignment. Six months after the assignment, the landlord conveyed his property interest in the premises to a new owner. After residing in the house for a year, the professor subleased the third floor to a student for a term of two years; the agreement provided that the professor would receive a monthly rental payment of $100. After the student had made regular rental payments to the professor for the first six months of the sublease, he defaulted. The following month, the professor sent the new owner $200 as payment for rent and notified him that he should collect the remaining $100 from the student, who refused to vacate the premises. In an action by the new owner against the student to recover the additional $100 for rent due, he will most probably\n\nA. recover, because the landlord and sublessee are in privity of estate.\nB. recover, even though he never objected to the sublease.\nC. not recover, because the professor would only be held liable.\nD. not recover, because the professor remains liable.\n"

                    "text": "The new owner will most probably not recover the additional $100 for rent due from the student. The reason is that the professor is the one who has a direct contractual relationship with the new owner, having taken over the lease from the original tenant (the friend). The professor is responsible for paying the full rent to the new owner, regardless of whether the student pays the sublease rent.\n\nWhen the professor subleased the third floor to the student, he created a separate contractual relationship between himself and the student. The new owner is not a party to this sublease agreement and therefore cannot enforce it directly against the student. If the student defaults on the sublease payments, it is the professor who must pursue the student for the unpaid rent, not the new owner.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\nC. not recover, because the professor would only be held liable.\n\nHowever, the phrasing \"because the professor remains liable\" in option D is also true, but option C more accurately reflects the legal principle at play here: the professor, not the student, is directly liable to the new owner for the full rent under the terms of the lease."
