One day, a truck driver pulled into the gas station for some gas. After filling up the gas tank, the truck driver entered the convenience store for a bite to eat. He was eating a bowl of chili when he noticed a cockroach in the food. The truck driver demanded a new serving of chili. When the owner refused, the truck driver stormed out of the store in anger. The truck driver jumped into his truck and decided to get even by causing some damage. He purposely drove into one of the gas tanks, which ruptured the gas line. The collision caused a terrible explosion and the building became engulfed in flames. The owner could not escape the blaze and burned to death. At common law, the truck driver should be found guilty of\n\nA. arson only.\nB. murder only.\nC. arson and murder.\nD. arson, burglary, and murder.\n"

Therefore, at common law, the truck driver should be found guilty of C. arson and murder. There is no indication of burglary (unlawful entry into a building with intent to commit a crime) in the scenario provided, as the truck driver did not enter the building with any such intent prior to the events leading to the explosion. Thus, option D is incorrect. The correct answer is C. arson and murder."
