To determine if it has three real solutions, we can look at its derivative to understand its behavior and use the Intermediate Value Theorem (IVT).\n\nThe derivative of \\(f(x)\\) is \\(f'(x) = 3x^2 + 4x - 9\\). This is a quadratic equation with two real roots, suggesting that \\(f(x)\\) changes direction twice, meaning it could cross the x-axis three times. To confirm, we can check for sign changes in \\(f(x)\\) around the critical points found by setting \\(f'(x) = 0\\).\n\n- Let's find the critical points by solving \\(3x^2 + 4x - 9 = 0\\). Using the quadratic formula, we get:\n\\[x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} = \\frac{-4 \\pm \\sqrt{16 + 108}}{6} = \\frac{-4 \\pm \\sqrt{124}}{6}\\]\n\\[x \u2248 -2.52, 1.18\\]\n\n- We need to check the sign of \\(f(x)\\) at intervals defined by these critical points: before \\(-2.52\\), between \\(-2.52\\) and \\(1.18\\), and after \\(1.18\\).\n- \\(f(-3) = -27 + 18 + 27 - 18 = 0\\)\n- \\(f(0) = -18\\)\n- \\(f(2) = 8 + 8 - 18 - 18 = -20\\)\n\nSince there are sign changes between these intervals, by IVT, \\(f(x)\\) crosses the x-axis at least three times, making this statement likely true.\n\n### B. \\(f(x) \u2265 -18\\) for all \\(x \u2265 0\\).\n\nTo verify this, let's examine \\(f(x)\\) for \\(x \u2265 0\\):\n\n- \\(f(0) = -18\\)\n- For \\(x > 0\\), the leading term \\(x^3\\) dominates, making \\(f(x)\\) increase without bound as \\(x\\) increases.\n\nThus, \\(f(x)\\) starts at \\(-18\\) and increases for \\(x > 0\\), making this statement true.\n\n### C. \\(f(x) \u2264 -18\\) for all \\(x \u2264 0\\).\n\nLet's consider \\(f(x)\\) for \\(x \u2264 0\\):\n\n- \\(f(0) = -18\\)\n- For \\(x < 0\\), \\(f(x)\\) decreases due to the \\(x^3\\) term until \\(x\\) reaches a point where \\(f(x)\\) becomes less than \\(-18\\).\n\nHowever, since \\(f(-3) = 0\\), this statement is false because \\(f(x)\\) is not always less than or equal to \\(-18\\) for all \\(x \u2264 0\\).\n\n### D. The function \\(f(x)\\) is decreasing for \\(x \u2264 -3\\).\n\nWe already found that \\(f'(x) = 3x^2 + 4x - 9\\) has roots approximately at \\(-2.52\\) and \\(1.18\\). The derivative is negative between these roots but positive outside them. Therefore, \\(f(x)\\) is decreasing on the interval \\((-\u221e, -2.52)\\) and increasing on \\((-2.52, \u221e)\\).\n\nGiven that \\(-3 < -2.52\\), \\(f(x)\\) is indeed decreasing for \\(x \u2264 -3\\), making this statement true.\n\nIn conclusion, **statements A, B, and D are true**. Statement C is false."
