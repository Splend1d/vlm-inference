Firefighters\n\nMany public safety positions, including firefighters and police officers, have mandatory retirement ages due to the physically demanding nature of the job. This policy is intended to ensure that those in such roles can perform their duties safely and effectively. The specific retirement age can vary by jurisdiction but is commonly set around age 60 to 65. \n\nIt's worth noting that mandatory retirement policies are subject to legal restrictions and may be challenged under anti-discrimination laws unless there is a bona fide occupational qualification (BFOQ) that justifies the age limit. In the case of firefighters, the physical demands of the job often meet this standard.\n\nThe other jobs listed (cab drivers, insurance regulators, and computer programmers) typically do not have mandatory retirement ages as they do not involve the same level of physical exertion or public safety concerns that might warrant such a policy."
