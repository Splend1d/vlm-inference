All of these options.\n\nCritics argue that the human security concept can be seen as neo-colonial because it often involves external actors intervening in the affairs of sovereign states, which some view as a continuation of colonial-era power dynamics. Others criticize it for promoting global capitalism by framing security issues in terms that align with market-oriented solutions. Additionally, many argue that the concept of human security is too broad and vague, encompassing everything from health to economic stability, which makes it difficult to implement or prioritize in policy-making."
