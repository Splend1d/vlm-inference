One afternoon, the lift suddenly broke down because of a power failure in the area. A customer was suspended in his lift chair, one-third of the way up the hill and 50 feet above the ground. The customer remained on the lift for five hours until power was restored. He was then returned uninjured to the bottom of the hill. In a suit against the ski resort, the customer is likely to have action for\n\nA. false imprisonment.\nB. negligence.\nC. assault.\nD. no cause of action.\n"

In this case, while the ski resort may not have directly caused the power failure, they may be held responsible for not having adequate backup systems or procedures in place to deal with such situations. This could include having a plan to safely evacuate customers from the lift in case of a power failure or having a backup generator to keep essential services running.\n\nFalse imprisonment (A) typically involves intentionally confining a person without their consent and without legal justification. While the customer was indeed confined, it was due to an unforeseen event rather than intentional confinement by the ski resort. Therefore, it's less likely that a false imprisonment claim would succeed.\n\nAssault (C) involves intentionally putting someone in reasonable apprehension of imminent harmful or offensive contact. Since there was no intentional act by the ski resort to put the customer in fear of harm, an assault claim is also unlikely.\n\nNo cause of action (D) is not correct because the circumstances described suggest that the ski resort may have been negligent in not having proper safety measures in place."
