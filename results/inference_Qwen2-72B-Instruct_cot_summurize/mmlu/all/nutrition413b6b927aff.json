                    "text": "The correct answer is B. Glucose.\n\nWhen someone breaks their overnight fast, their body starts to process the food they eat, converting it into glucose, which can then be absorbed into the bloodstream. The meal described includes carbohydrates from the toast, which will be broken down into glucose and absorbed into the bloodstream. This will cause an increase in the concentration of glucose in the blood.\n\nA. Alanine: While alanine is an amino acid that can be produced from muscle protein breakdown or from the metabolism of pyruvate, its levels in the blood are not typically significantly affected by the immediate consumption of a meal like the one described.\n\nC. Ketone bodies: These are produced when the body uses fat for energy during periods of fasting or carbohydrate restriction. After eating a meal with carbohydrates, the body will preferentially use glucose as its primary energy source, reducing the need for ketone body production.\n\nD. Non-esterified (free) fatty acids: These would be expected to decrease after a meal because the body shifts from using stored fats for energy (as it does during fasting) to using the newly available glucose from the meal.\n\nTherefore, the only option that will have a higher concentration in the blood after this meal compared to before breakfast is glucose."
