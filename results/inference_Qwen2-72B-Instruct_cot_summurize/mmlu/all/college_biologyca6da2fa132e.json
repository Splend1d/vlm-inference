This often results in reduced biodiversity, as certain species may dominate at the expense of others. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. there exist large populations of a low number of species\n\nThis is because when an ecosystem is simplified, it often leads to fewer species being present but those species having larger populations due to reduced competition and predation pressure. The other options do not accurately reflect the consequences of ecosystem simplification as described in the quote."
