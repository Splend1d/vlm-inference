Anomaly detection - This refers to the identification of items, events, or observations which do not conform to an expected pattern or other items in a dataset.\n\nB. One-class detection - This is a type of anomaly detection where the goal is to detect whether a new observation belongs to the same distribution as the training data, which is often assumed to be \"normal.\" The model is trained on examples from only one class (the \"normal\" class).\n\nC. Train-test mismatch robustness - This is a related concept but not exactly synonymous with OOD detection. It refers to the ability of a model to perform well on test data that may differ from the training data in some way, such as having different distributions or characteristics.\n\nD. Background detection - This term is typically used in image processing and computer vision to distinguish between the foreground (objects of interest) and the background (everything else). It's not directly related to OOD detection.\n\nThe closest synonyms to out-of-distribution detection among the options provided would be A (anomaly detection) and B (one-class detection), as they both deal with identifying data points that do not belong to the distribution of the known classes. However, the most direct synonym would be \"anomaly detection,\" as it is more commonly used across various fields to describe the process of identifying outliers in data."
