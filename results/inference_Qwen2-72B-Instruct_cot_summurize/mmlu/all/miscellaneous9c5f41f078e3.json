However, after scoring a touchdown, the team has the opportunity to score additional points through a kick or a two-point conversion attempt. A successful kick (extra point) is worth one point, and a successful two-point conversion is worth two points. Therefore, the total points from a touchdown can be six, seven, or eight, depending on what happens after the touchdown. But the touchdown itself is worth six points."
