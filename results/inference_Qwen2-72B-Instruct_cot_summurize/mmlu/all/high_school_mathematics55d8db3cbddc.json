Therefore, if we want to find the corresponding point on the graph of $y=h(x)$ for $x=3$, we substitute $g(3)$ into $h(x)$:\n\n\\[h(3) = (g(3))^2 = 6^2 = 36.\\]\n\nSo, the point $(3, 36)$ must be on the graph of $y=h(x)$. The question asks for the sum of the coordinates of this point.\n\nThe sum of the coordinates of the point $(3, 36)$ is $3 + 36 = 39$.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. 39."
