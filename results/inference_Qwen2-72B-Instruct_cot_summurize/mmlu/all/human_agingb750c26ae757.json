As people age, the muscles in the bladder can weaken and lose some of their capacity to hold urine, leading to more frequent urination. However, it's important to note that options A (Prostate cancer), C (Kidney problems) can also lead to increased frequency of urination, especially in men. Option D (Gall stones) is unlikely to cause this symptom. It's always best to consult with a healthcare provider if there are concerns about changes in urinary habits."
