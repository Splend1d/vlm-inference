There are 12 inches in a foot, so:\n\n\\[5 \\text{ feet} = 5 \\times 12 \\text{ inches} = 60 \\text{ inches}\\]\n\nSo, the length of each piece of rope is \\(60 + 8 = 68\\) inches.\n\nNow, multiply this length by the number of students (32):\n\n\\[68 \\text{ inches/student} \\times 32 \\text{ students} = 2176 \\text{ inches}\\]\n\nConvert this back into feet and inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:\n\n\\[2176 \\text{ inches} \\div 12 = 181 \\text{ feet with a remainder of } 4\\]\n\nThus, the total length of rope is 181 feet 4 inches.\n\nThe correct answer is D. 181 feet 4 inches."
