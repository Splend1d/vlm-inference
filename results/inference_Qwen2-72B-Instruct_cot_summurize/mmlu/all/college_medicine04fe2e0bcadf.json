Sensory adaptation is the process by which sensory receptors become less sensitive to constant stimuli over time, allowing organisms to focus on new or changing stimuli in their environment. In each case, the individual becomes less aware of the unchanging stimulus (the texture of a shirt, background noise, constant light levels, or a consistent odor) as their sensory system adapts to the ongoing presence of that stimulus.\n\nTherefore, there is no exception in the list provided; all are examples of sensory adaptation. If the question was posed with the intent of finding an exception, it would need to include an example that does not involve the adjustment of sensitivity to a constant stimulus over time."
