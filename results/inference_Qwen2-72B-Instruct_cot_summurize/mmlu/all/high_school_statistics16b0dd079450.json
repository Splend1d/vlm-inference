It would not be unexpected for 3% of the population to begin using coupons or stop using coupons.\nC. Between 395 and 425 of the 500 households surveyed responded that they used grocery coupons.\nD.

A margin of error of 3% means that the true percentage of the population that uses grocery coupons could be as low as 79% (82% - 3%) or as high as 85% (82% + 3%). This indicates the range within which the actual value is likely to fall, based on the sample data.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the margin of error does not relate to the number of people who refuse to participate in the poll.\nChoice B is also incorrect because the margin of error doesn't predict future behavior changes among the population.\nChoice C is incorrect because it refers to the number of households in the sample rather than the estimated proportion with its margin of error applied. The calculation for C would be based on 82% of 500 households, which is 410 households. The margin of error allows us to estimate that the true number could be as low as 395 (410 - 3% of 500) or as high as 425 (410 + 3% of 500), but this is not what the margin of error directly expresses. The margin of error applies to the percentage, not the absolute number of households."
