The only work being done here is by the force of friction, which acts over the distance the box slides until it stops.\n\nThe force of friction is given by:\nF_friction = \u03bc * F_normal\n\nSince the box is on a horizontal surface, the normal force (F_normal) is equal to the weight of the box (mg), where g is the acceleration due to gravity. So,\nF_friction = \u03bc * mg\n\nThe work done by this force as the box slides a distance d is:\nW = F_friction * d = \u03bc * mg * d\n\nThis work must equal the initial kinetic energy of the box, which is:\nKE_initial = (1/2) * m * v0^2\n\nSetting these two equal gives:\n(1/2) * m * v0^2 = \u03bc * mg * d\n\nSolving for d gives:\nd = (1/2) * m * v0^2 / (\u03bc * mg)\n\nThe mass m cancels out, and we can simplify further:\nd = v0^2 / (2 * \u03bc * g)\n\nSo the answer is A. v0^2/(2\u03bcg)."
