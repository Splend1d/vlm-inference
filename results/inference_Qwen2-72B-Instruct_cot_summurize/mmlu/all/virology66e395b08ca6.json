Interacting with a T helper cell.\n\nAntibody-producing cells, also known as B lymphocytes or B cells, are stimulated by interacting with T helper cells. When a pathogen enters the body, it is recognized by both B cells and T helper cells. The B cell that recognizes the specific antigen (a protein or other molecule on the surface of the pathogen) will bind to it and become activated. This B cell then interacts with a T helper cell that has also been activated by the same antigen. The interaction between the B cell and the T helper cell leads to the activation and proliferation of the B cell, which then differentiates into a plasma cell that produces antibodies specific to that antigen. These antibodies can then neutralize the pathogen or mark it for destruction by other components of the immune system."
