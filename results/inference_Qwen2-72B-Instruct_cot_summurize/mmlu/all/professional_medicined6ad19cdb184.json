She is asymptomatic and has no history of serious illness. Twelve months ago, she was diagnosed with a urinary tract infection and treated with oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. She currently takes no medications. Subsequent blood pressure measurements on three separate occasions since the last visit have been: 155/94 mm Hg, 145/90 mm Hg, and 150/92 mm Hg. She is at the 50th percentile for height and 95th percentile for weight. Her blood pressure today is 150/90 mm Hg confirmed by a second measurement, pulse is 80/min, and respirations are 12/min. Examination shows no other abnormalities. Her hematocrit is 40%. Urinalysis is within normal limits. Cardiac and renal ultrasonography shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?\n\nA. Exercise and weight reduction program\nB. Measurement of urine catecholamine concentrations\nC. Measurement of urine corticosteroid concentrations\nD. Captopril therapy\n"

The patient is overweight (95th percentile for weight) and has consistently high blood pressure readings over several months, which meets the criteria for hypertension. Although there are no current symptoms or abnormalities found on examination, her elevated blood pressure should be addressed. Lifestyle modifications such as exercise and dietary changes aimed at weight loss are first-line interventions for managing hypertension in adolescents before considering pharmacological treatment. Since her urinalysis, cardiac, and renal ultrasonography are normal, and she does not have any symptoms that suggest pheochromocytoma (which would require measuring urine catecholamines) or Cushing's syndrome (which would require measuring urine corticosteroids), these tests are not indicated at this time. Captopril therapy, an ACE inhibitor, is a medication used to treat hypertension but is typically considered after lifestyle changes have been attempted and if they are insufficient to control blood pressure."
