In this case, the president's statement is an admission by a company representative, which can be used as evidence against the company. Therefore, the employee's proposed testimony is admissible.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the tape recording and the secretary's transcribed notes may also be admissible as evidence under certain circumstances, but they do not necessarily make the employee's testimony inadmissible. The court may consider all available evidence in determining the facts of the case."
