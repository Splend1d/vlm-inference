According to West, feminist legal theory's focus on the harm of rape as being solely about non-consent implies that all consensual sex is good, which she argues is not necessarily true. This can lead to an under-acknowledgment of the potential harms of consensual sex, such as coercion, exploitation, and inequality. Option A is incorrect because West does not argue that feminist legal theory posits that all sex is rape. Option C is also incorrect because West does not argue that feminist legal theory suggests that the harm of rape has nothing to do with the victim's gender."
