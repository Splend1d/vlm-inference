Congenital adrenal hyperplasia\n\nFemale pseudohermaphroditism occurs when a genetically and gonadally normal female (XX) has an abnormal development of external genitalia that makes them appear more male-like. This can be caused by an excess of androgens, which masculinize the external genitalia. Congenital adrenal hyperplasia is a condition where the adrenal glands produce excessive amounts of androgens, leading to the development of male-like external genitalia in females."
