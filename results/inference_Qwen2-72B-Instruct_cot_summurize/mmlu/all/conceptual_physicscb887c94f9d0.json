Specifically, time appears to move slower for an object in motion relative to an object at rest. This effect is known as time dilation.\n\nSo if you travel at high speed compared to your friends who stay at home, you will experience time more slowly than they do. As a result, when you return from your journey, you will be younger than your friends who stayed at home. So the correct answer is:\n\nB. younger."
