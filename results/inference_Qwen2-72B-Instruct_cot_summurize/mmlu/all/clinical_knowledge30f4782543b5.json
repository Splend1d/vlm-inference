A person with blood group B (rhesus negative) can receive blood from donors with the same blood type (B rhesus negative) or from donors with type O (rhesus negative) because type O red blood cells lack both A and B antigens and are therefore considered the universal donor type for ABO compatibility. However, since the recipient is rhesus negative, they cannot receive blood from rhesus positive donors to avoid potential hemolytic reactions due to the presence of the D antigen in rhesus positive blood."
