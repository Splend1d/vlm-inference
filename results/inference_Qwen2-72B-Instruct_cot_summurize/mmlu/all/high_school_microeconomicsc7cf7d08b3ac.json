The firm will realize zero economic profits.\n\nIn the long run, under perfect competition, firms will only be able to earn normal profit (also known as zero economic profit). This occurs when the price equals the average total cost, and there is no incentive for new firms to enter or existing firms to exit the market. Economic profits attract new entrants, which would increase supply, lower prices, and reduce profits until they are normalized. Similarly, economic losses lead to exit of firms, which would decrease supply, raise prices, and increase profits back to normal levels."
