Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn Scenario 1, voting once in a presidential election is not only not morally wrong but is also an exercise of one's democratic rights and civic duty. In fact, it is encouraged for eligible citizens to vote.\n\nIn Scenario 2, failing a student due to excessive absence can be seen as a reasonable action by a teacher if the student's absences have negatively impacted their academic performance or violated school attendance policies. This decision could be based on the educational institution's rules and standards for academic progress, which are typically established to ensure students receive a quality education. However, this scenario assumes that the teacher has followed proper procedures and has considered all relevant factors before making such a decision. If the decision was made without just cause or due process, then it could potentially be considered morally questionable. But based on the information provided, the action does not seem to be clearly morally wrong."
