The function \\(f(x,y,z) = x + 4z\\) represents planes in \\(\\mathbb{R}^3\\) with normal vector \\((1, 0, 4)\\).\n\nThe minimum value of the function \\(f(x,y,z)\\) subject to the constraint will occur when the plane defined by \\(f(x,y,z)\\) is tangent to the sphere. This happens when the vector from the origin to the point of tangency is parallel to the normal vector of the plane. Thus, the vector from the origin to the point of tangency must be proportional to the normal vector \\((1, 0, 4)\\).\n\nLet's denote the vector from the origin to the point of tangency as \\(\\vec{v} = (x, y, z)\\). Since this vector lies on the surface of the sphere, it satisfies \\(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 2\\). Moreover, since \\(\\vec{v}\\) is parallel to the normal vector of the plane, we have \\(\\vec{v} = k(1, 0, 4)\\) for some scalar \\(k\\). This implies:\n\\[x = k, \\quad y = 0, \\quad z = 4k.\\]\n\nSubstituting these into the equation of the sphere gives:\n\\[k^2 + 0^2 + (4k)^2 = 2,\\]\n\\[k^2 + 16k^2 = 2,\\]\n\\[17k^2 = 2,\\]\n\\[k^2 = \\frac{2}{17},\\]\n\\[k = \\pm\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{17}}.\\]\n\nSince we're looking for the minimum value of \\(f(x,y,z)\\), we choose the negative value of \\(k\\):\n\\[k = -\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{17}}.\\]\n\nThus,\n\\[x = k = -\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{17}},\\]\n\\[y = 0,\\]\n\\[z = 4k = -4\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{17}}.\\]\n\nFinally, substituting these values into the function \\(f(x,y,z)\\) gives:\n\\[f(x,y,z) = x + 4z = -\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{17}} - 4\\cdot 4\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{17}} = -\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{17}}(1 + 16) = -17\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{17}} = -\\sqrt{34}.\\]\n\nTherefore, the minimum value of the expression \\(x + 4z\\) as a function defined on \\(\\mathbb{R}^3\\), subject to the constraint \\(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \\leq 2\\), is:\n\nC. \\(-\\sqrt{34}\\)."
