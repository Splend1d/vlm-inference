In this case, the defendant did not intend to kill the bartender; he only meant to intimidate him with the penknife. However, his actions led to the bartender's death, albeit indirectly through an infection caused by the cut. Since the death was not intentional, it does not meet the criteria for murder, but it could be considered involuntary manslaughter because the defendant's reckless behavior (using a knife in a threatening manner) resulted in the death of another person."
