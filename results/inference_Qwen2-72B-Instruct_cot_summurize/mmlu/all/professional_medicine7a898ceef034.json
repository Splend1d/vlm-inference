He says he intentionally burned his right thigh several times with a cigarette lighter 6 days ago. This morning he soaked his thigh in a tub of hot water and massaged it, after which a large amount of \"greenish fluid\" drained from the wound sites. The patient normally takes lithium carbonate but stopped 3 months ago after he lost his job. Medical history is otherwise unremarkable. Vital signs are temperature 39.2\u00b0C (102.5\u00b0F), pulse 170/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/60 mm Hg. Physical examination shows an edematous right lateral thigh with multiple burn sites with a white exudative appearance. There is erythema surrounding the burn areas with red streaks extending up the thigh. Palpation of the burn sites discloses fluctuance. Results of laboratory studies show a hemoglobin concentration of 14 g/dL and a leukocyte count of 19,000/mm3 . In addition to beginning antibiotic therapy, which of the following is the most appropriate next step?\n\nA. Incision and drainage\nB. Psychiatric consultation\nC. Topical silver sulfadiazine\nD. Transfer to a burn center\n"

                    "text": "The patient's presentation suggests a severe infection at the site of the burns on his right thigh. The greenish fluid, high fever, shaking chills, tachycardia (high heart rate), and the presence of fluctuance upon palpation all point to a deep-seated abscess or cellulitis that likely requires immediate surgical intervention to prevent further complications such as sepsis.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate next step would be:\n\nA. Incision and drainage\n\nThis procedure involves surgically opening the abscess to allow the purulent material to drain out. This can help reduce the infection and relieve pressure caused by the pus buildup. After incision and drainage, the patient would require close monitoring and continued treatment with antibiotics to manage the infection.\n\nWhile psychiatric consultation (B) might be necessary given the patient's history of self-mutilation and the need for management of his mental health issues, this is not the immediate priority when dealing with a potentially life-threatening infection.\n\nTopical silver sulfadiazine (C) can be used for local wound care and infection control, but it is not sufficient to address a systemic infection or an abscess that requires surgical intervention.\n\nTransfer to a burn center (D) might be considered if the burn injuries were extensive and required specialized care, but in this scenario, the immediate concern is the infection rather than the burn itself. Once the infection is under control, consideration of transfer to a burn center could be more appropriate for ongoing care of the burn sites. However, the primary focus should be addressing the acute infection first."
