This strategy is characterized by taking advantage of whatever food sources are available in the environment at any given time, rather than relying on planned or predictable sources of food. Opportunistic foragers may move frequently to follow the availability of resources, and they do not typically store food for future use. This contrasts with more planned foraging strategies, such as those used by hunter-gatherer societies that rely on specific seasonal resources or agricultural societies that cultivate crops and raise livestock."
