He also argues that drug use is not necessarily more detrimental to a person's character than other legally permitted harmful activities (option C). Therefore, the correct answer would be D: all of the above. However, it's worth noting that this is a simplified summary of Huemer's argument, and his views are more nuanced and complex than can be captured in a multiple-choice question."
