They are based on incomplete data and are therefore subject to revision as more comprehensive information becomes available. These revisions can occur in subsequent months as final data is collected and analyzed. Option D might seem correct but the thirty-day lag is not a universal standard for the release of flash GDP estimates, making option A the most accurate choice."
