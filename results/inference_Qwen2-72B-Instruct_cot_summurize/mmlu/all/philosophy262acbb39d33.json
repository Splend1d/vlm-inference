They are the true reality, while the objects we encounter in our everyday lives are mere shadows or imperfect copies of these Forms. Therefore, Forms cannot exist in the sensible world because they transcend it, being eternal and immutable, unlike the constantly changing and imperfect objects found within the sensible world."
