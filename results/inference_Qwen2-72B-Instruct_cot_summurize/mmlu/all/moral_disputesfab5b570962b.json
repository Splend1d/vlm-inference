Fine thinks Wellman's response is insufficient because excluding people who wish to pursue interests specific to that state is still potentially harmful. This means that even if a state can fulfill its duties to outsiders without allowing them into its territory, it may still be causing harm by denying them access to opportunities and resources that are available within the state. This is particularly relevant in cases where the excluded individuals have a strong interest or need to enter the state, such as for family reunification or to seek asylum."
