Acetyl-CoA\n\nAlcohol (ethanol) is primarily metabolized in the liver through two major pathways: \n\n1. Alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) pathway: Ethanol is converted to acetaldehyde, which is further oxidized to acetate by aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH). Acetate can then enter the mitochondria and be converted to acetyl-CoA.\n\n2. Microsomal ethanol-oxidizing system (MEOS): This pathway involves the production of reactive oxygen species and generates heat instead of useful energy.\n\nIn the end, acetyl-CoA from both pathways enters the citric acid cycle for further metabolism or can be used in biosynthetic pathways to synthesize other compounds such as lipids. \n\nNote that options B and D also contain metabolites related to other metabolic processes but are not primary metabolites directly involved in alcohol metabolism. Beta-hydroxybutyrate and acetone are ketone bodies produced during ketogenesis, while pyruvate and lactate are products of glycolysis."
