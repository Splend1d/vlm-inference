Out of these, he baked 6 pies for his family. The rest were baked for the 4 school fund-raisers.\n\nLet's subtract the 6 pies he baked for his family from the total:\n\n\\[18 - 6 = 12\\]\n\nThis means Carl baked 12 pies for the school fund-raisers in total. Since these 12 pies were distributed equally among 4 school fund-raisers, we divide this number by 4 to find how many pies he baked for each fund-raiser:\n\n\\[12 \\div 4 = 3\\]\n\nTherefore, Carl baked 3 pies for each of the school fund-raisers.\n\nNow, let's translate this into an equation to match one of the options provided. We know that Carl baked 6 pies for his family and 4 times \\(p\\) (the number of pies per school fund-raiser) equals the remaining pies he baked for the fund-raisers. This sum should equal the total number of pies he baked, which is 18. Therefore, the correct equation is:\n\n\\[6 + 4p = 18\\]\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\nD. \\(6 + 4p = 18\\)"
