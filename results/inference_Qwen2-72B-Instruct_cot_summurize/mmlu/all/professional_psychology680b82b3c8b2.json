Barter may be acceptable when certain conditions are met.\n\nThe American Psychological Association's Ethical Principles of Psychologists and Code of Conduct states that psychologists may barter for goods or services as payment for psychological services under certain circumstances. These circumstances include ensuring that the arrangement is not exploitative, is based on the consent of the client, is not clinically contraindicated, and is documented in writing before services are rendered. The acceptability of bartering can also depend on the cultural context and the nature of the goods or services being exchanged. However, it's important to note that bartering is generally discouraged because it can potentially blur professional boundaries and create conflicts of interest."
