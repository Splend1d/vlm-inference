Weber's theory suggests that the location of a manufacturing industry will be determined by the cost of transporting raw materials and finished products. The industry will locate where the transportation costs are minimized. However, it's important to note that this theory was developed in the early 20th century and may not fully apply to modern industries due to changes in technology, communication, and other factors."
