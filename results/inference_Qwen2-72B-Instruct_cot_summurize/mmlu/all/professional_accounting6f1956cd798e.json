Impossibility of performance.\n\nImpossibility of performance can discharge contractual duties by operation of law when it becomes objectively impossible to perform the contract due to unforeseen events that were not caused by either party. This is different from mere difficulty or inconvenience in performing the contract, which does not typically excuse performance.\n\nA. Novation involves the substitution of a new contract for an old one, with the consent of all parties involved, and therefore does not discharge contractual duties by operation of law but rather through agreement.\n\nB. Accord and satisfaction refers to the process where a new agreement replaces an existing obligation, usually involving a lesser payment than originally agreed upon. It discharges the original contractual duty through mutual agreement, not by operation of law.\n\nC. Anticipatory repudiation occurs when one party communicates their intention not to fulfill their contractual obligations before the time for performance arrives. While this can lead to the non-breaching party being discharged from their duties, it does not automatically discharge duties by operation of law; rather, it allows the non-breaching party to sue for damages immediately or terminate the contract."
