Given \\(H(k \\| m)\\) anyone can compute \\(H(k \\| m \\| \\text{PB} \\| w)\\) for any \\(w\\), where PB stands for padding block.\n\nThe reason is that the Merkle-Damgard construction has a length-extension property, which allows an attacker to extend the message after observing only its hash value without knowing the key \\(k\\). In particular, given \\(H(k \\| m)\\), the attacker can append padding and additional data (\\(\\text{PB} \\| w\\)) to \\(m\\) and compute the hash of the extended message using only the original hash value, without needing the secret key \\(k\\).\n\nThis vulnerability arises because the hash function's output at each step of the Merkle-Damgard iteration includes the intermediate state that could be used to continue the computation with additional input. The padding is necessary to prevent trivial collision attacks by ensuring that messages of different lengths have distinct representations before hashing. However, once the padding is added, the attacker can append arbitrary data and compute the hash of the extended message, compromising the security of the MAC scheme."
