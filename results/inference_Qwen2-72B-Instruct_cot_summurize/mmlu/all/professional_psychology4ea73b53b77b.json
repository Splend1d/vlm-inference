Parkinson's disease is caused by a progressive degeneration of dopamine-producing cells in the substantia nigra, a region of the midbrain that plays a key role in movement control. The loss of these cells leads to a decrease in dopamine levels, which can result in the motor symptoms associated with Parkinson's disease, such as tremors, stiffness, and difficulty with movement."
