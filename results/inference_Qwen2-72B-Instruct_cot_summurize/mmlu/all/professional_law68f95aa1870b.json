As the hiker came around a bend in the trail, he suddenly saw a hunter standing next to the trail, looking in the other direction. The hunter was holding a rifle. The hunter turned, causing the rifle to be pointed at the hiker. The hiker felt sure that he was going to get shot, but the gun did not go off. The hiker asserts a claim for assault against the hunter. In his action, the most likely result is that the hiker will\n\nA. recover, because the hunter's rifle was pointed directly at him.\nB. recover, because the hunter's decision to carry the gun was voluntary.\nC. not recover, unless the hunter intended to scare the hiker.\nD. not recover, if the hunter did not intend to shoot the hiker.\n"

The hunter must have intentionally placed the hiker in reasonable apprehension of imminent harmful or offensive contact. If the hunter did not intend to threaten or harm the hiker, then there may not be grounds for an assault claim, even though the hiker felt threatened. However, this does not mean that no legal action can be taken; other claims such as negligence might be more appropriate under these circumstances."
