By controlling the consequences of a patient's actions, therapists can encourage desired behaviors and discourage unwanted ones. This method can include techniques such as positive reinforcement, negative reinforcement, punishment, and extinction to alter behavior. However, it's important to note that modern behavioral therapy often integrates cognitive-behavioral techniques as well, addressing both thoughts and actions.\n\nA. is related to systematic desensitization, a specific technique within behavioral therapy used to treat phobias.\nB. describes cognitive therapy, which focuses on changing irrational beliefs and thought patterns.\nD. refers to reflective listening or paraphrasing, a technique more commonly associated with humanistic therapies like client-centered therapy."
