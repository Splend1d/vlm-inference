Unbeknownst to the defendant, her friend had taken a music player from the display case and stuffed it in her bag earlier in the day. Knowing that employees are subject to search when they leave the store, the friend surreptitiously put the music player into the defendant's bag. The defendant and her friend proceeded to a local tavern and drank shots of tequila. The friend became intoxicated and forgot to retrieve the stolen music player from the defendant's bag. After leaving the tavern, the defendant proceeded home. Upon opening her bag, she was surprised to see the music player. Believing that the music player had accidentally fallen into her bag at the bar, the defendant planned to return it the next day. The following day, however, the defendant changed her mind and decided to keep it. The defendant is guilty of\n\nA. receiving stolen property.\nB. larceny.\nC. receiving stolen property and larceny.\nD. neither receiving stolen property nor larceny.\n"

However, once she discovered the music player in her bag and chose to keep it instead of returning it, she becomes complicit in the crime. At that point, she is knowingly in possession of stolen goods, which makes her guilty of:\n\nA. receiving stolen property.\n\nIt's important to note that for larceny (option B) to occur, there must be an unlawful taking of personal property with the intent to permanently deprive the owner of it. In this scenario, the defendant did not take the music player herself; it was placed in her bag without her knowledge. Therefore, she cannot be charged with larceny based on the information provided.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\nA. receiving stolen property."
