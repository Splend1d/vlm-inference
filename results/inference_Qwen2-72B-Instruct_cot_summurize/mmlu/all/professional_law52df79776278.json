                    "text": "A man owned a four-story apartment building. The man borrowed $125,000 from his friend to make improvements. As consideration for the loan, the man executed a promissory note for $125,000 payable to the friend in one year and secured by a mortgage on the apartment building. The mortgage was dated January 1, 2008, and was recorded January 2, 2008. Thereafter, on February 1, 2008, the man executed a deed absolute on the apartment building and named the friend as grantee. This deed, although absolute in form, was intended only as additional security for the payment of the debt. In order to make judicial foreclosure unnecessary and to eliminate the right to redeem, the man then delivered the deed to an escrow agent in escrow with instructions to deliver the deed to the friend if the man failed to pay his promissory note at maturity. On January 1, 2009, the man failed to pay the note when it came due. The next day, the escrow agent delivered the deed to the apartment building to the friend. The friend then properly recorded this deed on January 3. One week later, on January 10, the friend conveyed the apartment building by warranty deed to an investor for the purchase price of $200,000. On January 12, the man tendered the $125,000 balance due to the friend, which he refused to accept. The man now brings an appropriate action against the friend and the investor to set aside the conveyance and to permit the redemption of the property by the man. Which of the following best states the man's legal rights, if any, in his action against the friend and the investor?\n\nA. The man has no rights against the investor, but the man does have an action for redemption against the friend for the value of the property.\nB. The man has no rights against the friend, but the man does have an action for redemption against the investor for the value of the property.\nC. The man has the option of seeking redemption against either the friend or the investor for the value of the property, but the man cannot set aside the conveyance.\nD. The man has no rights against either the friend or the investor because he defaulted on the promissory note.\n"

                    "text": "The man's legal rights in this situation revolve around the nature of the deed absolute that was given as additional security and the subsequent events. The deed absolute, although intended only as additional security for the debt, was delivered to the friend upon default. However, the man's tendering of the $125,000 balance after the deed was delivered but before it was recorded by the friend could potentially invoke a right of redemption.\n\nThe right of redemption allows a borrower to reclaim their property by paying off the debt before the lender sells the property or, in some jurisdictions, within a certain period after sale. The fact that the deed was intended only as additional security and not as an outright transfer of ownership supports the argument that the transaction was akin to a mortgage rather than a sale. This means that the man might have a right to redeem the property by paying the debt, plus any interest and costs incurred.\n\nGiven the specifics of the case:\n\n- The deed was delivered to the friend after the man defaulted on the promissory note.\n- The man tendered the full amount of the debt ($125,000) to the friend after the deed was delivered but before the friend sold the property to the investor.\n- The friend recorded the deed after receiving it from the escrow agent and subsequently sold the property to the investor.\n\nThe investor purchased the property in good faith and for value, without knowledge of the man's potential right to redeem. Under these circumstances, the investor is considered a bona fide purchaser for value without notice of the man's claim, which generally protects the investor's title.\n\nConsidering the above, the most likely correct answer would be:\n\nC. The man has the option of seeking redemption against either the friend or the investor for the value of the property, but the man cannot set aside the conveyance.\n\nHowever, the man's ability to seek redemption from the investor may be limited due to the investor's status as a bona fide purchaser. The man's strongest claim might be against the friend for failing to accept the tendered payment and for possibly violating the terms of the agreement by not allowing the right of redemption. The man's action against the investor would depend on state laws regarding redemption rights and the protections afforded to bona fide purchasers."
