However, based on the sentence you provided, I can say that insider trading does indeed undermine the fiduciary relationship because it involves the misuse of non-public information for personal gain, which breaches the duty of trust and confidence that is a cornerstone of fiduciary relationships.\n\nIf you're asking about the impacts of insider trading, common points often include:\n1. It erodes investor confidence in the fairness and integrity of the market.\n2. It creates an uneven playing field where some investors have unfair advantages.\n3. It can lead to significant financial losses for uninformed investors.\n4. It violates securities laws and regulations designed to protect market integrity.\n\nGiven these points, if your question was related to how insider trading affects the market and investors, the answer would be D. 1,2,3,4. Please provide more context or clarify your question so I can give a more precise response."
