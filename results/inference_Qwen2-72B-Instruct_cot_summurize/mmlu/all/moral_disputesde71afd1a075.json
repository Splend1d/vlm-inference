However, it's important to note that this is a simplification of his argument. In his 1989 paper \"Why Abortion is Immoral,\" Marquis argues that the act of abortion deprives the fetus of a future like ours, which he considers to be a significant harm. He does not rely solely on the claim that the fetus is a person with full moral rights, but rather on the idea that the fetus has a potential future that is being unjustly taken away."
