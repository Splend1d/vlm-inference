Observational error.\n\nGross errors are usually due to carelessness, such as misreading instruments, incorrect recording of data, or making arithmetic mistakes. Observational errors occur because of limitations in human senses or judgment when taking measurements, which can lead to inconsistencies in the recorded data. Both types of errors can be significantly reduced through training and careful attention to detail during data collection."
