Steady state concentration of free radical intermediates is often too low to enable direct detection by EPR, thus spin trapping is used to increase their detectability by forming more stable spin adducts.\n\nSpin trapping is a technique that involves the use of a molecule (spin trap) that reacts with the free radical intermediate to form a more stable and detectable product known as a spin adduct. The spin adduct can then be detected using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, which provides information about the structure and environment of the free radical. This technique is often necessary because the concentration of free radicals in a reaction mixture is typically very low, making them difficult to detect directly using EPR. Spin trapping allows for the accumulation and stabilization of the free radicals, increasing their detectability and providing more detailed information about their structure and reactivity."
