The defendant admitted that she told the victim she could save him if he brought a large sum of money wrapped in a handkerchief to a ritual. After the ritual, the defendant returned the handkerchief to the victim filled with waste paper rather than the money. After the defendant was convicted of false pretenses, she moved for a new trial and offered the affidavits of several jurors who sat on the case. An affidavit containing which of the following facts will most likely furnish the defendant's best basis for securing a new trial?\n\nA. A juror misunderstood the judge's instructions regarding the burden of proof.\nB. A juror, in violation of the court's instructions, read a newspaper article implicating the defendant in several other similar schemes.\nC. Ajuror fell asleep during defense counsel's closing argument.\nD. A juror admittedly stated during deliberations that he had a personal animosity toward the defendant.\n"

If a juror has personal animosity toward the defendant, it could prevent them from making an impartial decision based solely on the evidence presented in court. This type of juror misconduct can be grounds for a mistrial and a subsequent retrial.\n\nOptions A, B, and C may also be grounds for appeal or a motion for a new trial, but they do not necessarily indicate the same level of potential prejudice or unfairness as a biased juror. Misunderstanding of instructions, reading extraneous material, or falling asleep during proceedings are issues that can affect the jury's understanding of the case, but they do not necessarily imply a juror's prejudgment of the defendant's guilt or innocence."
