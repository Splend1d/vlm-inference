As the driver was approaching the intersection of Main Street and First Avenue, a motorist, who was driving straight through a red light, suddenly appeared before him. Trying to avoid the motorist, the driver veered his car onto the sidewalk. The car landed in a deep hole in the sidewalk. This hole had been dug by a construction company, which had been repairing a water main break earlier in the day. The construction company had been hired by the local municipal water department. Although the' construction company had erected a warning sign advising pedestrians about the hole, there was no fence or barrier surrounding it. When the driver's car fell into the hole, it ruptured the water main, engulfing the car with water. Within a short time, the driver, unable to escape, drowned in his car, which rapidly filled with water. In a wrongful death action by the driver's estate against the municipal water department, the estate will most probably\n\nA. prevail, because sovereign immunity would not attach to non-delegable duties, which are proprietary in nature.\nB. prevail, because the city government would be strictly liable for failing to ensure the water main repair work was done properly.\nC. not prevail, because the municipal water department would not be liable for the negligence of its independent contractor.\nD. not prevail, because sovereign immunity attaches to functions that are governmental in nature.\n"

Generally, sovereign immunity protects governments from liability for their actions, but this protection does not extend to proprietary functions, which are those that could also be performed by a private entity. Maintaining public infrastructure like water mains can be seen as a proprietary function, especially when the work is contracted out to a private company. Since the construction company, acting as an agent of the municipal water department, failed to adequately secure the area where they were working (by not placing a fence or barrier around the hole), the municipal water department may be held liable for the driver's death due to breach of a non-delegable duty to maintain safe conditions."
