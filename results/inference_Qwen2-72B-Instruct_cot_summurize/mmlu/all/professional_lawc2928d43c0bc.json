The man has \u00d2Beware of Dogs\u00d3 signs clearly posted around a fenced-in yard where he keeps the dogs. The man\u00d5s next-door neighbor frequently walks past the man\u00d5s house and knows about the dogs\u00d5 ferocity. One summer day, the neighbor entered the man\u00d5s fenced-in yard to retrieve a snow shovel that the man had borrowed during the past winter. The neighbor was attacked by one of the dogs and was severely injured. In a suit against the man, is the neighbor likely to prevail?\n\nA. No, because the neighbor knew that the man had dan-gerous dogs in the yard.\nB. No, because the neighbor was trespassing when he entered the man\u00d5s property.\nC. Yes, because the neighbor was an invitee for the pur-pose of retrieving the shovel.\nD. Yes, because the man was engaged in an abnormally dangerous activity.\n"

No, because the neighbor was trespassing when he entered the man\u2019s property.\n\nWhile the other options may have some bearing on the legal analysis, the fact that the neighbor was trespassing is a significant factor. Generally, property owners owe a lower duty of care to trespassers than they do to invitees or licensees. However, it's important to note that specific laws can vary significantly by jurisdiction, and there may be exceptions or additional considerations (such as whether the man took reasonable steps to secure the dogs or warn of their presence). Nonetheless, based on the information provided, the neighbor's status as a trespasser would likely weaken his case against the man."
