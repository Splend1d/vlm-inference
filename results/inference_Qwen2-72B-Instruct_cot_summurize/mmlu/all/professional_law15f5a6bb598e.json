                    "text": "A farmer owned a tract of land in a state that has a notice recording statute and follows the title theory of mortgages. There were two farms situated on the property, one farm on the eastern half and one farm on the western half of the property. The farmer recorded a general warranty deed conveying the property to his son. Two years later, the son obtained a mortgage, secured by the farm property, in favor of his friend. The friend promptly recorded the mortgage. Twenty years later, the son sold the property to an investor by a general warranty deed, with the investor assuming the friend's mortgage. The following year, the investor subdivided the property and sold the western farm to a developer, while retaining the eastern farm. There was no mention of the mortgage in the general warranty deed between the investor and developer. The developer was unable to rezone the property to build houses as he had planned, so the developer sold the western farm to a florist. The conveyance to the florist made no mention of the friend's mortgage. Three years later, the florist entered into a contract with a rancher, pursuant to which the rancher would purchase the western farm for $75,000. The closing date for the deal was set for January 15. Assuming that on January 10, the rancher conducted a title search that revealed the friend's mortgage on the property, which of the following is correct?\n\nA. The rancher would be entitled to rescind the real estate contract with the florist immediately.\nB. The encumbrance renders title to the western farm unmarketable.\nC. The mortgage would only encumber the eastern farm, not the western farm, because the investor's partition of the property created a joint tenancy.\nD. The encumbrance would not entitle the rancher to rescind the real estate contract until closing on January 15.\n"

The rancher would not necessarily be entitled to rescind the real estate contract immediately upon discovering the encumbrance. The right to rescind would depend on the terms of the contract and whether the existence of the mortgage constitutes a breach of any representations or warranties made by the florist.\n\nB. This is the correct answer. A mortgage is an encumbrance on the property, and if it is not disclosed or satisfied, it can render the title to the property unmarketable. Since the mortgage was not mentioned in the conveyance from the investor to the developer, nor from the developer to the florist, the rancher could potentially have grounds to rescind the contract due to an unmarketable title.\n\nC. The mortgage does not only encumber the eastern farm; it encumbers the entire property unless there was a specific release of either portion of the property from the mortgage. The fact that the investor subdivided the property does not automatically create a joint tenancy or release any part of the property from the mortgage.\n\nD. While the encumbrance might provide grounds for rescission, the right to rescind does not necessarily wait until the closing date. It depends on the terms of the contract and applicable law. However, this option does not directly address the issue of marketability of title, which is the primary concern here."
