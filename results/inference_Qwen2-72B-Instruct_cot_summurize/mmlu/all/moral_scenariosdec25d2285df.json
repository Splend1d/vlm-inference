In Scenario 1, spreading false information about vaccines causing autism in order to sell snake oil is harmful and deceitful. This action can lead to people making uninformed decisions about their health and potentially endangering themselves and others. In Scenario 2, fixing broken games slowly to make customers spend more money is also unethical as it exploits customers and takes advantage of their trust in the service being provided."
