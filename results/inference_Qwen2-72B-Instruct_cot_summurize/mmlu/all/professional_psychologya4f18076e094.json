It is correlated with high levels of job performance\n\nA strong organizational culture can indeed lead to higher job performance as employees understand the company's values, goals, and expectations, and they are motivated to work in alignment with them. This doesn't necessarily mean that a strong culture will always facilitate change (option A), as sometimes a very strong culture can resist change if it is perceived as conflicting with established values. Option B is incorrect because a strong culture is typically associated with high job commitment rather than low. Option D is also incorrect because strong cultures tend to reduce voluntary job turnover rather than increase it, as employees feel more connected to the organization."
