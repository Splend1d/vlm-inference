The wife's gynecologist has reported that her anatomic and physiologic evaluation disclosed no abnormalities and that assessment of potential male factors is needed. The husband is 188 cm (6 ft 3 in) tall with fair skin and little facial hair. He has mild gynecomastia and small, firm testicles. No sperm are seen on semen analysis. Which of the following tests is most likely to establish the underlying cause of this couple's infertility?\n\nA. Karyotype from peripheral leukocytes\nB. Serum estrogen and testosterone concentrations\nC. Serum follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone concentrations\nD. Serum prolactin concentration\n"

Serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) concentrations\n\nElevated FSH levels can indicate testicular failure or primary testicular dysfunction, while LH levels help assess the function of the pituitary gland. Abnormalities in these hormone levels could suggest a hormonal cause for the azoospermia (absence of sperm in the semen). Additionally, the patient's physical features such as gynecomastia and small testicles may indicate a genetic or hormonal imbalance that could be affecting spermatogenesis.\n\nWhile karyotyping (option A) could also be useful in identifying chromosomal abnormalities that might contribute to infertility, testing serum FSH and LH levels is more directly related to assessing the function of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, which is crucial for normal spermatogenesis.\n\nSerum estrogen and testosterone concentrations (option B) and serum prolactin concentration (option D) could also provide additional information about hormonal imbalances, but they are not the first-line tests for evaluating male infertility due to azoospermia. Elevated prolactin levels can suppress gonadotropin release, leading to decreased testosterone production and potentially affecting sperm production, but it is less commonly implicated in cases of azoospermia compared to FSH and LH."
