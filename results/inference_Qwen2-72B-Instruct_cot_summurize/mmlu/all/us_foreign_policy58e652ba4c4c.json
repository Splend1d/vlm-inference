This concept can be seen as a form of neocolonialism where the relationship between the two entities is ostensibly consensual but may be driven by unequal power dynamics.\n\nThus, the answer that best fits the definition of \"Empire by Invitation\" is:\n\nA. Voluntary reliance on an external power for security\n\nThis choice emphasizes the idea that the weaker entity is willingly seeking the support of a more powerful one, which aligns with the notion of an \"invitation.\" The other options do not capture the voluntary aspect or the specific nature of seeking protection or security from another power."
