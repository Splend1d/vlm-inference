Cohort study\n\nIn a cohort study, a group of individuals (in this case, 500 women aged 40-54) is identified based on whether they do or do not have a certain characteristic or exposure (vegetarian vs. non-vegetarian diet) and then followed over time to determine the incidence of an outcome (colorectal cancer). The key features of a cohort study include identifying groups based on exposure status at the start of the study and prospectively observing these groups to measure the development of disease or other outcomes."
