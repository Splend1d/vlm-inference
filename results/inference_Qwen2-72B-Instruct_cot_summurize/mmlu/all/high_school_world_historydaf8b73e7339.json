Take this winter:\nThe Shanxi troops were never sent home.\nThe District Officers are demanding the land tax,\nBut where will it come from? You can't get blood from a stone!\nI honestly think it's bad luck to bear a son now,\nIt's better to have a daughter: at least she can marry\nAnd live with the neighbors next door.\nBut a son will end up lying on some distant prairie.\"\nDu Fu, \"Ballad of the Army Carts,\" ca. 750 C.E.\nWhich of the following does the poem provide direct evidence for in its discussion of taxation in the third stanza?\n\nA. The Tang Dynasty's strong bureaucracy at the local level\nB. The Tang Dynasty's large, standing professional army with no need of conscription\nC. Relatively advanced Tang agricultural technologies\nD. The relatively high level of urbanization in Tang China\n"

However, it does provide evidence for the difficulty soldiers and their families faced in paying taxes due to the absence of the main labor force (the soldiers) and the resulting neglect of the fields. This is not explicitly listed among the provided options, but if one were to create an option based on the text, it might read something like:\n\nE. The strain on rural households and the difficulty in collecting taxes due to military conscription and neglect of agricultural lands.\n\nIf forced to choose from the given options, one could argue that the closest is:\n\nA. The Tang Dynasty's strong bureaucracy at the local level\n\nbecause the mention of District Officers demanding land tax implies a level of administrative organization at the local level. However, this is not the primary focus of the passage and is not directly supported by the evidence provided in the third stanza."
