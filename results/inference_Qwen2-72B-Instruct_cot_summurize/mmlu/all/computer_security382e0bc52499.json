It works by sending ICMP echo request packets to multiple IP addresses in a range, and then analyzing the responses to determine which hosts are online. Options C and D are incorrect because a ping sweep does not provide information about open ports or the location of firewalls. However, identifying live systems can be a precursor to further scanning for open ports and other vulnerabilities."
