This concept is central to his understanding of ethics and virtue, where he argues that human beings have a unique function or purpose that defines their highest good (eudaimonia), which is the fulfillment of their rational capacities through virtuous activities. Therefore, for Aristotle, the good of anything is determined by how well it performs its function."
