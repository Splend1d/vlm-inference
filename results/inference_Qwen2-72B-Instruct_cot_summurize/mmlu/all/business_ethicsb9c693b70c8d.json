Ethics of duty, Ethics of rights and justice, Principle\n\nThese two ethical theories (ethics of duty and ethics of rights and justice) are based on the principle of deontology, which holds that certain actions are morally required, forbidden, or permitted, regardless of their consequences. They are both examples of principle-based theories, as they are grounded in universal moral principles. Utilitarianism is a form of consequentialism, while egoism is not necessarily principle-based but rather focuses on self-interest."
