For 12 years after executing her will, the woman lived on her farm. Then she sold it and used the sales proceeds to purchase a home in the city, in which she lived until she died, never having changed her will. Following the admission of the will to probate, both the nephew and the niece claimed ownership of the home. There is no applicable statute. Who is the owner of the home?\n\nA. The nephew, because of the doctrine of ademption.\nB. The nephew, because of the doctrine of equitable estoppel.\nC. The niece, because of the doctrine of lapse.\nD. The niece, because she is the residuary legatee.\n"

The niece, because she is the residuary legatee.\n\nWhen the woman sold her farm, the specific devise to her nephew lapsed because the subject of the devise (the farm) was no longer part of the estate at the time of her death. The sales proceeds from the farm became part of the residue of her estate. Since she never changed her will, the residue of her estate, including the proceeds from the sale of the farm and the home purchased with those proceeds, would pass to her niece as the residuary legatee. The doctrines of ademption and lapse apply to situations where specific devises fail due to the absence or change in character of the property being devised, but they do not affect the distribution of the residue of the estate. Equitable estoppel does not apply here because there is no indication that the nephew relied on any representation by the testator to his detriment."
