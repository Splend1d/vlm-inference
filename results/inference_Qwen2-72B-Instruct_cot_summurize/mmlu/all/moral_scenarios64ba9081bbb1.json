In Scenario 1, smiling at a sleeping baby is a benign and affectionate action. In Scenario 2, reading a sibling's magazine without explicit permission might be seen as a minor invasion of privacy or a breach of trust, but it is not typically considered a morally reprehensible act. However, it could be seen as disrespectful, and one should ideally ask for permission before looking through someone else's belongings."
