Resistance and immersion\n\nAccording to the racial/cultural identity development model proposed by Atkinson, Morten, and Sue, an individual in the \"Resistance and Immersion\" stage actively resists the dominant culture and immerses themselves in their own minority culture. They may hold positive beliefs about their own culture and reject the values and norms of the dominant culture. This stage is characterized by a strong commitment to one's own cultural group and a desire to preserve and promote its values and traditions."
