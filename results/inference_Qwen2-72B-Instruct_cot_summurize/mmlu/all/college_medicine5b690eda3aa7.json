                    "text": "The pKb is the negative logarithm of the base dissociation constant (Kb). For a very weak base, the Kb value is very small, meaning that the pKb value is large.\n\nThe pOH is defined as the negative logarithm of the hydroxide ion concentration ([OH-]). In an aqueous solution at 25\u00b0C, the product of the concentrations of hydrogen ions [H+] and hydroxide ions [OH-] is equal to 10^-14 (the ionic product of water). This means that if a base is very weak and does not significantly increase the [OH-], then the pOH will be close to the pKw (which is 14 at 25\u00b0C), because the contribution of the base to the [OH-] is negligible compared to the autoionization of water.\n\nTherefore, for a very weak base, the pKb is likely to be higher than the pOH, since the pOH remains close to its value in pure water (about 14) while the pKb can be much larger due to the base's weak dissociation.\n\nSo the correct answer is:\n\nB. Higher than the pOH"
