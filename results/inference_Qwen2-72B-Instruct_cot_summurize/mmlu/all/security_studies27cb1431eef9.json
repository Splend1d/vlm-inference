Cost of imports soar, including vital resources such as imported medicines. Basic food prices rise, putting even greater pressure on already stretched household budgets.\nB. Reduced health, education, and social welfare spending and the introduction of cost-recovery and user-fees put healthcare and education beyond the reach of many ordinary people. Public sector redundancies and salary freezes lead to fewer teachers and doctors.\nC. Massive redundancies and increased unemployment with no social security provision push families deeper into poverty. Farmers and small companies can no longer afford to borrow money and are forced to reduce production or go out of business.\nD. All of these options.\n"

The cost of imports, including vital resources like medicines, soars due to devaluation of local currencies and removal of subsidies, making them less affordable.\n\nB. Spending cuts on health, education, and social welfare, along with the introduction of user fees, make essential services less accessible to the poor.\n\nC. Job losses and increased unemployment without social security exacerbate poverty. Additionally, reduced access to credit for farmers and small businesses leads to decreased production or closure.\n\nThese policies are typically imposed by international financial institutions like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) as conditions for loans or debt relief, often leading to negative consequences for the most vulnerable populations in developing countries."
