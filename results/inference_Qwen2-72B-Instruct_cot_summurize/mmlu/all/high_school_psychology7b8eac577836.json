Structuralism was an early school of psychology that aimed to understand the structure of the mind by identifying and analyzing its basic components, such as sensations, feelings, and ideas. This approach has similarities with modern cognitive psychology, which studies mental processes such as perception, memory, thinking, and language to understand how people acquire, process, and store information."
