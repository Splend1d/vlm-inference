                    "text": "The correct answer is B. The infant has a 50% risk for hemophilia.\n\nExplanation:\n\nHemophilia is an X-linked recessive disorder, meaning that it is carried on the X chromosome and typically manifests in males (who have one X and one Y chromosome) because they lack a second X chromosome to potentially carry a healthy copy of the gene. Females (who have two X chromosomes) can be carriers if one of their X chromosomes carries the mutated gene but are less likely to manifest symptoms unless both X chromosomes carry the mutation.\n\nIn this case, the patient's father had classic hemophilia, which means she has a 50% chance of being a carrier of the hemophilia gene since she received one X chromosome from her father. Since the fetus is male (XY), he will inherit his X chromosome from his mother. If the fetus inherits the X chromosome with the mutated hemophilia gene, he will have hemophilia because he does not have a second X chromosome to potentially carry a healthy copy of the gene.\n\nThus, the male fetus has a 50% chance of inheriting the mutated gene from his mother and developing hemophilia. He cannot be a carrier since being a carrier requires having at least one healthy copy of the gene, which is only possible in females with two X chromosomes."
