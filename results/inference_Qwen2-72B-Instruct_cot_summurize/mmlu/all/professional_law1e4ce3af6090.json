This bid was $30,000 lower than the construction company's next lowest bid for the kitchen work. As a result, the construction company lowered its bid by $20,000 before submitting it to the hospital board. After the construction company was awarded the construction bid and had accepted the subcontractor's offer, the subcontractor discovered that in his preparation of the quotation, he had overlooked some subsidiary kitchen installments required by the plans. Immediately thereafter, the subcontractor brought suit for rescission of the contract. It should\n\nA. prevail, because of the unilateral mistake.\nB. prevail, because the mistake was an essential element of the bargain.\nC. not prevail, unless the construction company knew or should have known of the subcontractor \u0080\u0098s error.\nD. not prevail, because the computation mistake was antecedent to acceptance of the bid.\n"

If the construction company was unaware of the subcontractor's error when they accepted the bid, then the subcontractor would not be entitled to rescission. However, if the construction company did know or should have known about the error, then the subcontractor might be able to prevail in seeking rescission of the contract."
