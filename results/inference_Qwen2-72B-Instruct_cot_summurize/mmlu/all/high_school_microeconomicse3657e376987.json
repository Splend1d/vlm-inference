If the MPL decreases, it means that each additional worker contributes less to total output than the previous one. This could happen due to various reasons such as diminishing returns, reduced efficiency, or technological changes that make labor less productive.\n\nWhen the MPL decreases, firms will be willing to hire fewer workers at any given wage rate because the benefit of hiring additional workers is lower. As a result, the demand for labor from firms will decrease, shifting the demand curve for labor to the left.\n\nA and B are incorrect because an increase in the price of the good or an increase in demand for the good would lead to higher revenues for firms, which could increase their willingness to hire more workers, shifting the demand curve for labor to the right.\n\nC is incorrect because an increase in the wage rate paid to workers does not directly shift the demand curve for labor; instead, it moves along the demand curve. If the wage rate increases, firms may hire fewer workers at that higher wage rate, but this is a movement along the demand curve rather than a shift of the curve itself."
