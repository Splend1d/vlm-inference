The following month, the doctor was granted a license to practice optometry in that neighboring state by its board of optometrists. For approximately one year, the doctor was engaged in the practice of optometry in the neighboring state. Subsequently, the doctor decided to relocate his practice to the state for which Section 2022(a) applies. The doctor re-domiciled in the state, where he opened a new office for the practice of optometry. When he initially opened his office, the doctor was unaware of the state's licensing provision for optometrists. Since the doctor was a licensed optometrist for 10 years, he assumed that he could practice optometry in the state by reciprocity. The doctor received notification from the state's board of optometrists that he was illegally practicing optometry and that he must immediately cease and desist from such practice. If the doctor challenges the constitutionality of Section 2022(a) of the medical licensing statute as violating the Commerce Clause, which of the following, if factually true, is the WEAKEST defense that the state could offer?\n\nA. The statute will help to ensure that only the most qualified optometrists practice in the state.\nB. The statute will help protect the optometrists in the state from competition outside the state.\nC. The statute will help to ensure a continuously available number of practicing optometrists within the state.\nD. The statute will help to ensure that the practicing optometrists in the state are subject to standards of a regulatory body.\n"

The statute will help protect the optometrists in the state from competition outside the state.\n\nThis argument is weak because it directly conflicts with the principles of the Commerce Clause, which generally prohibits states from passing legislation that discriminates against or excessively burdens interstate commerce. Protecting local practitioners from out-of-state competition is precisely the type of protectionism that the Commerce Clause aims to prevent. The other options A, C, and D all relate to ensuring the quality, availability, and regulation of healthcare professionals within the state, which are more likely to be considered legitimate state interests that could potentially justify restrictions on interstate commerce."
