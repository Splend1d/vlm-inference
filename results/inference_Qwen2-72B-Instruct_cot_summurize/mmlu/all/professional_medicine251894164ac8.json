This patient presents with abnormal uterine bleeding, which can be caused by various conditions such as endometrial hyperplasia or endometrial cancer. Given her age and family history of cancer, it is important to rule out endometrial cancer. An endometrial biopsy involves taking a small sample of tissue from the lining of the uterus and examining it under a microscope for any abnormal cells. This can help determine the cause of the bleeding and guide further treatment. The other options listed are not indicated based on the patient's presentation."
