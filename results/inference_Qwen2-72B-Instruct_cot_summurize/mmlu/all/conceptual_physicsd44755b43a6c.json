This removal of thermal energy would cause the temperature of the remaining air to:\n\nB. Decrease\n\nThis process is known as evaporative cooling when it occurs in the opposite direction (faster moving molecules leaving a liquid to become a gas, thus cooling the remaining liquid), but the principle applies in both directions. When slower moving molecules are removed from the gaseous state, they take some of the system's total internal energy with them, resulting in a cooler remaining gas."
