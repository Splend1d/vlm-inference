Chemiosmosis\n\nChemiosmosis is the process that couples the production of ATP with the movement of electrons down the electron transport chain by using the energy from the proton gradient to drive ATP synthesis. This occurs in both mitochondria (in eukaryotes) and plasma membrane (in prokaryotes). Glycolysis, fermentation, and the Calvin cycle are other metabolic pathways but they do not directly involve the use of a proton gradient for ATP production."
