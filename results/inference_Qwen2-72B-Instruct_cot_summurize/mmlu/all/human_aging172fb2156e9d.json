This often results in older adults having smaller social networks not because they are unable to expand their networks or are too emotionally involved to spend time with others, but rather because they are more selective about who they spend their time with, focusing on the relationships that matter most to them.\n\nSo the correct answer would be:\n\nA. Are more concerned with those closest to them\n\nThis choice aligns with the core tenet of socioemotional selectivity theory that older adults prioritize emotionally significant interactions and relationships, leading to a more selective and often smaller social circle."
