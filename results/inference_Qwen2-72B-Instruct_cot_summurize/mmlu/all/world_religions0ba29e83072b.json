Chan-Zen\n\nThe \"Flower Sermon\" is a famous story in Chan (Chinese) and Zen (Japanese) Buddhism, which are essentially the same school but developed in different countries. The story tells of the Buddha holding up a flower before his audience without saying a word. Only Mahakashyapa, one of his disciples, understood the silent message and smiled, thus becoming the first patriarch of Chan/Zen Buddhism. This event symbolizes the transmission of the Dharma outside of scriptures, directly from heart to heart."
