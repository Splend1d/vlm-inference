The process requires sufficient oxygen to generate ATP via oxidative phosphorylation, which is then used to rephosphorylate creatine to form phosphocreatine. In the absence of adequate oxygen, the body relies more heavily on anaerobic pathways for ATP production, which are less efficient and do not support rapid PCr resynthesis."
