Aesthetic values pertain to the appreciation, evaluation, and interpretation of art, beauty, taste, and other sensory experiences. They involve judgments about what is considered beautiful, harmonious, or pleasing to the senses or intellect.\n\nWhile aesthetic values can sometimes intersect with moral values (option A), they are not inherently concerned with morality. They focus on qualities such as form, composition, color, texture, and design, which contribute to the overall appeal of an object or artwork. Aesthetic judgments may be influenced by cultural, historical, and personal contexts, but they primarily relate to the perception of beauty and artistic merit. Options C and D are not directly related to aesthetic values; they concern the ethics of individuals in the art world and practical considerations in displaying art, respectively."
