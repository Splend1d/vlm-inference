In this case, the doctor may hold the belief that smoking is unhealthy (which he acknowledges), but also wants to continue smoking, which creates a conflict. To resolve this dissonance, he justifies his behavior by focusing on another healthy habit (eating healthily), which allows him to maintain the smoking behavior without completely abandoning his self-image as a health-conscious individual."
