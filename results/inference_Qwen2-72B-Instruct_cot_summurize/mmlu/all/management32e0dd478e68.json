This model was developed by Michael D. Cohen, James G. March, and Johan P. Olsen in 1972 to describe decision-making processes in complex organizations where problems, solutions, decision-makers, and choice opportunities are not clearly defined or aligned. The model assumes that decisions are made under conditions of high ambiguity and that decision-makers often lack complete information about the problems they face and the potential solutions available."
