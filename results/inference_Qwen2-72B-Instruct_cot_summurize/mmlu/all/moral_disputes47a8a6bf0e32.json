This is because institutions and individuals have different roles, responsibilities, and capacities. Therefore, if the government has a moral obligation to do something, it doesn't automatically follow that you as an individual have the same moral obligation. However, it could still be argued that you might have a moral obligation to support or advocate for the government to fulfill its duty, depending on the context."
