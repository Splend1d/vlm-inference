These stimuli are known as sign stimuli or releasers and can include visual, auditory, olfactory, or tactile cues. Once triggered, FAPs typically run their full course without being influenced by external factors, although they are not necessarily irreversible or non-modifiable under all circumstances. However, the primary characteristic is that they are reliably initiated by certain environmental cues."
