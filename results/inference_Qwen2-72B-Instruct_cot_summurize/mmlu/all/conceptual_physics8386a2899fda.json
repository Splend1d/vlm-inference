Therefore, the correct answer is A.\n\nHere's why: An alpha particle is made up of two protons and two neutrons, which together have a mass number of 4 (this is what option B refers to). When an atom emits an alpha particle, it loses these two protons from its nucleus. Since the atomic number of an element is determined by the number of protons in its nucleus, losing two protons means that the atomic number decreases by 2. The mass number also decreases by 4 because of the loss of the two protons and two neutrons, but this question specifically asks about the change in the atomic number."
