Here's how each of these factors contributes to that determination:\n\nA. The structure of the innominate (pelvis), including the ilium and ischium: Bipedalism requires a pelvis that is short and wide, with the ilium flaring out to the sides. This structure helps support the internal organs while walking upright and provides leverage for the leg muscles attached to the ischium.\n\nB. The position of the foramen magnum: In bipedal species, the foramen magnum (the hole in the skull where the spinal cord passes) is positioned at the bottom of the skull, directly under the brain. This allows the head to be balanced on top of the spine when standing upright.\n\nC. The absence of a divergent big toe: In bipedal species, the big toe aligns more closely with the other toes, forming a more efficient structure for pushing off the ground during walking. In contrast, non-bipedal species often have a divergent big toe, which aids in grasping and manipulating objects or surfaces, such as when climbing trees.\n\nBy examining all these features together, paleoanthropologists can build a strong case for whether an extinct species was bipedal or not."
