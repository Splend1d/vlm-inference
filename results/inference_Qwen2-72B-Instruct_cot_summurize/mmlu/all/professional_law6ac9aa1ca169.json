She went to the home with an investigative team including a drug-sniffing dog. On the front porch of the home the dog began pacing back and forth frantically, which indicated smelling illegal drugs. The team retreated while some of them went to get a warrant. A warrant was issued based on the dog's behavior. The search inside revealed large quantities of marijuana. The homeowner was arrested. Through counsel, he filed a motion to suppress based on the assertion that the use of the dog was an illegal search without probable cause thus rendering the warrant invalid. Should the court suppress the evidence?\n\nA. No, because the detective had probable cause after receiving the anonymous call, which justified the use of the dog for a valid search -- the warrant was thus valid and the evidence will not be suppressed.\nB. No, because the detective had a right to take the dog to make a reasonable search, which led to the finding of probable cause and the issuance of a valid warrant.\nC. Yes, because the anonymous call was insufficient cause to allow for a search of the front porch with the dog, which made the warrant invalid \u0080\u0093 the suppression motion will be granted.\nD. Yes, because the dog's reaction did nothing to tell them that there were drugs inside \u0080\u0093 a warrant can never be based on a dog's information.\n"

No, because the detective had a right to take the dog to make a reasonable search, which led to the finding of probable cause and the issuance of a valid warrant.\n\nThe use of a drug-sniffing dog on a property's front porch does not constitute a search under the Fourth Amendment (Florida v. Jardines, 2013). Therefore, the dog's alert provided probable cause for the subsequent warrant. The court is unlikely to suppress the evidence as long as the proper procedures were followed in obtaining the warrant based on the dog's alert."
