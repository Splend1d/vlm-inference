Oxygen is instead consumed in the electron transport chain during oxidative phosphorylation, which follows the TCA cycle in aerobic respiration. The TCA cycle itself does not directly use oxygen; it generates reduced coenzymes (NADH and FADH2) that later donate electrons to the electron transport chain where oxygen acts as the final electron acceptor."
