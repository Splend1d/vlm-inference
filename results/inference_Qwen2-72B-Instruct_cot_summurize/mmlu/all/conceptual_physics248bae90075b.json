In thermodynamics, the second law states that the total entropy (a measure of disorder or randomness) of an isolated system can never decrease over time, and often increases. So, natural processes tend to move towards more disordered states, but in some cases, local order can increase at the expense of increasing disorder elsewhere. For instance, living organisms maintain a state of relatively high order by creating disorder in their environment.\n\nSo, another correct answer could be seen as:\n\nA. higher order to lower order\n\nBut this is specifically in the context of the overall behavior of closed systems according to the second law of thermodynamics. The answer D is more directly aligned with the principle of entropy increase leading to a state of equilibrium, where energy is evenly distributed and no further natural processes can occur to change the distribution."
