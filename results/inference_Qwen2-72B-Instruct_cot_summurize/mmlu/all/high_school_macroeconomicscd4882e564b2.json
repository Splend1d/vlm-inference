This can lead to an outflow of the country's currency as it pays for more imports than it earns from exports, potentially leading to a depreciation of its currency rather than appreciation. And while in historical times, countries with trade deficits might have had to ship gold or other precious metals to their creditors, in modern times this is not typically the case as most international transactions are conducted using fiat currencies and credit arrangements."
