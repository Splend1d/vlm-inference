So, our equation becomes:\n\\[\nx^2 - (p+q)x - r(r - p - q) = 0\n\\]\n\nTo solve for $x$, we can use the quadratic formula where $a=1$, $b=-(p+q)$, and $c=-r(r - p - q)$. The solutions for $x$ are given by:\n\\[\nx = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting $a$, $b$, and $c$ into the formula, we get:\n\\[\nx = \\frac{(p+q) \\pm \\sqrt{(p+q)^2+4r(r - p - q)}}{2}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying under the square root:\n\\[\nx = \\frac{(p+q) \\pm \\sqrt{p^2 + 2pq + q^2 + 4r^2 - 4pr - 4qr}}{2}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{(p+q) \\pm \\sqrt{(p-q)^2 + 4r^2 - 4r(p+q)}}{2}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{(p+q) \\pm \\sqrt{(p-q)^2 + 4r(r - (p+q))}}{2}\n\\]\n\nSince one solution is $x=r$, we know that the term inside the square root must be zero when $x=r$. This means that the other solution will come from the negative or positive variation of the square root term. Since $x=r$ comes from setting the entire expression inside the square root to zero, the other solution will come from the $\\pm$ part. \n\nGiven that $x=r$ is a solution, it corresponds to the case where the square root term cancels out with the numerator (i.e., $(p+q)$). Thus, the other solution will involve adding/subtracting the square root term to/from $(p+q)$, divided by $2$. \n\nGiven the options provided, the correct answer would be related to the sum or difference between $p$ and $q$, and potentially involving $r$. Among the options you've given, D. $p+q-r$ fits this description, assuming that the question intends to describe the second solution which differs from $r$.\n\nTherefore, the other solution in terms of $p$, $q$, and $r$ is **D. $p+q-r$**."
