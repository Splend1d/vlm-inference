Free trade allows each nation to consume beyond the production possibility curve.\n\nThis statement is true because through trade, countries can specialize in the production of goods for which they have a comparative advantage, allowing them to produce more efficiently and then exchange these goods with other countries. This results in a situation where both trading partners can consume at levels that would not be possible if they were operating solely within their own production possibility curves. In essence, trade allows countries to access points outside of their own PPFs (Production Possibility Frontiers). \n\nStatement A is incorrect because nations typically specialize and trade based on comparative advantage, not absolute advantage.\nStatement C is incorrect because while absolute advantage might influence trade, it is comparative advantage that drives international trade patterns.\nStatement D is incorrect because protectionism (protecting domestic industries) actually limits a country's ability to consume beyond its production possibility curve, as it restricts access to cheaper or more efficient foreign goods."
