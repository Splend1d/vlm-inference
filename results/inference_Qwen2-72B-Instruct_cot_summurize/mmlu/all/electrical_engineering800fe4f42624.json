The 8085 has 16 address lines (output), 8 data lines (bi-directional but can be considered as both input and output), and the rest are power, ground, control signals, etc. So if we strictly consider only output pins, the answer might depend on how one counts the bi-directional data pins. However, the question is typically framed around the total pin count for context, which is 40.\n\nSo, the closest correct answer would be:\n\nB. 40. \n\nBut it's important to note that this refers to the total pin count, not exclusively output pins."
