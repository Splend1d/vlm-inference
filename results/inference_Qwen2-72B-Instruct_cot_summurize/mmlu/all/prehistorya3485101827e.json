This trait allowed individuals to consume milk and other dairy products without experiencing digestive discomfort, which would have been particularly beneficial in times of food scarcity. The timing of this development, around 7,500 years ago, corresponds with the archaeological evidence for the production of cheese and yogurt in Europe."
