In this case, we want to find the degree of the field extension \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})\\) over \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\).\n\nTo do this, we need to find a basis for \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})\\) as a vector space over \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\). We know that \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) is a root of the polynomial \\(x^2 - 2\\), which is irreducible over \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) by Eisenstein's criterion with \\(p = 2\\). This means that \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})\\) is generated over \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) by the powers of \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) up to the degree of the minimal polynomial, which in this case is 2. \n\nThus, a basis for \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})\\) as a vector space over \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) is \\(\\{1, \\sqrt{2}\\}\\). Therefore, the degree of the field extension \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})/\\mathbb{Q}\\) is 2.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nB. 2"
