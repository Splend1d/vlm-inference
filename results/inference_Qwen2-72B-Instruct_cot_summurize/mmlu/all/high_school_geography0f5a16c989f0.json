Advancements in technological development\n\nWhile technology can certainly influence various aspects of society, including communication and social interactions, it does not inherently determine gender roles or relationships in a culture. Gender relationships are primarily shaped by societal norms, cultural expectations, religious beliefs, customs, and biological differences. Technology may exacerbate or mitigate existing gender inequalities, but it is not a primary factor in defining gender relationships."
