While specific psychological disorders may also play a role in some cases (option D), Shapiro suggests that addiction is a complex phenomenon that cannot be attributed to any single cause. Therefore, the most accurate answer would be a combination of options A, B, and C. However, if only one option must be chosen, option B (the pharmacological effects of drug use) is often considered the primary factor in drug addiction."
