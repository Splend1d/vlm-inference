These tools were simple choppers and flakes that were part of the Oldowan tool culture, named after Olduvai Gorge in Tanzania where they were first found. This association has led many scientists to believe that Homo habilis was the first species to cross the threshold from using natural objects as tools to actually making their own tools."
