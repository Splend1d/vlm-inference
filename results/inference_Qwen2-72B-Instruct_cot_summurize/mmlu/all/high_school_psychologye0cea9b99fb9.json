Allowing Mary to play with the blocks afterward if she remains in her seat throughout the assigned seat-work time\n\nThis strategy uses positive reinforcement (the opportunity to play with the blocks) contingent upon Mary's compliance with the desired behavior (completing her seat work). Positive reinforcement has been shown to be effective in increasing the likelihood of a behavior being repeated in the future. This strategy also acknowledges Mary's interest in the blocks and channels it into a motivating factor for her to stay on task."
