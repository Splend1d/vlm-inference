Going for a jog while one's parents are sleeping is not an immoral act.\n\nIn scenario 2, pouring detergent into the washer with your roommate's clothes could be seen as morally wrong if it was done with the intent to damage or disrespect their property. However, if it was simply a mistake made without ill intent, it may not be considered morally wrong, but rather an accident. Since the question assumes that the action is \"clearly morally wrong,\" we can assume there was malicious intent, making this action wrong."
