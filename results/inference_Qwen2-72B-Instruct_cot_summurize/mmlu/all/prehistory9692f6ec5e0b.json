Mit'a\n\nThe required labor service owed to the king in return for the privilege of using property owned by the Incan empire was called \"Mit'a.\" This was a form of tribute labor that was an essential part of the Inca economy and social structure. The Mit'a system required citizens to work on public projects, such as construction, agriculture, and mining, for a certain period each year. This labor helped maintain the empire's infrastructure and supported its administrative and military needs."
