                    "text": "Let's analyze both statements:\n\n**Statement 1:** \"Every integral domain with characteristic 0 is infinite.\"\n\nAn integral domain is a commutative ring with unity in which the product of any two non-zero elements is non-zero (i.e., it has no zero divisors). The characteristic of a ring is the smallest positive integer \\(n\\) such that \\(n\\cdot 1 = 0\\), where \\(1\\) is the multiplicative identity of the ring and \\(n\\cdot 1\\) represents adding \\(1\\) to itself \\(n\\) times. If no such \\(n\\) exists, then the ring is said to have characteristic 0.\n\nIn an integral domain with characteristic 0, there cannot be a smallest positive integer \\(n\\) for which \\(n\\cdot 1 = 0\\), because this would imply that \\(1 + 1 + \\ldots + 1\\) (\\(n\\) times) equals \\(0\\), which contradicts the definition of an integral domain (since it implies that \\(1\\) is a zero divisor). This means that for every positive integer \\(n\\), \\(n\\cdot 1 \\neq 0\\), which allows us to construct infinitely many distinct elements by considering all multiples of \\(1\\). Thus, every integral domain with characteristic 0 must be infinite. So, **Statement 1** is **True**.\n\n**Statement 2:** \"Every integral domain with prime characteristic is finite.\"\n\nThis statement is not necessarily true. An integral domain having a prime characteristic does not automatically make it finite. For instance, consider the polynomial ring \\(\\mathbb{F}_p[x]\\), where \\(\\mathbb{F}_p\\) is the finite field with \\(p\\) elements (where \\(p\\) is prime). This ring is an integral domain with characteristic \\(p\\), but it is infinite since there are infinitely many polynomials over \\(\\mathbb{F}_p\\).\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that if an integral domain is a field (every non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse), and it has a prime characteristic, then it must indeed be finite. But since the statement does not specify that the integral domain is also a field, **Statement 2** is **False**.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **C. True, False**."
