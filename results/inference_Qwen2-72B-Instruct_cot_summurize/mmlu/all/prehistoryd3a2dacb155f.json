Complex foragers focus on a few highly productive resources.\n\nComplex foragers, also known as \"specialized\" or \"resource-intensive\" foragers, tend to concentrate on exploiting specific, high-yield resources such as fish, shellfish, or certain large game animals. They may develop sophisticated techniques to harvest these resources effectively. In contrast, simple foragers typically have a broader diet that includes a wide variety of plant and animal foods. This specialization can lead to more sedentary lifestyles and the development of more complex social structures among complex foragers. However, option A is not correct because irrigation technology is associated with agricultural societies, not foraging groups. Option C is incorrect because complex foragers might actually be less mobile than simple foragers due to their reliance on specific resources that may require them to stay in one place for longer periods."
