According to Taurek, each person has an equal claim to be saved, and it is not justifiable to sacrifice one person to save others simply because there are more of them.\n\nIn the scenario you've described, Taurek would likely argue that:\n\nD. Neither A nor B.\n\nHe would suggest that neither Y nor anyone else is obligated to choose saving the life of X over preserving Y's arm based solely on the fact that X's life is at stake. Instead, the decision should be made based on other factors, such as the consent of those involved, the severity of harm to each party, or some form of impartial consideration that does not automatically prioritize one person's life over another's limb.\n\nIt's important to note that this interpretation assumes a simplified version of Taurek's argument for the sake of addressing the question. In reality, his stance on such issues is more nuanced and involves a detailed critique of utilitarian approaches to ethics."
