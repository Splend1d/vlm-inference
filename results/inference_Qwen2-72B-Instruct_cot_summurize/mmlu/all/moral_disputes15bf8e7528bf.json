Pence has suggested that this assumption is unfair and that proponents of SCNT believe they are acting in the best interests of scientific progress and potentially medical advancement.\n\nTherefore, the answer to your question would be:\n\nC. The parents have bad motives.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that this interpretation may not accurately represent all objections to SCNT, as some concerns may focus on ethical issues related to the status of the embryo or broader societal implications rather than assumptions about the motives of individuals involved."
