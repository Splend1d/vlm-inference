Although our [principal] wish is to serve God and the pleasure of the king of Kongo, none the less you will make him understand\u2014as though speaking in our name\u2014what he should do to fill the ships, whether with slaves, or copper, or ivory.\"\nInstructions from King Manuel of Portugal to his envoy in Kongo, 1512\nThe tone of the first letter best reflects which of the following developments in early modern Africa?\n\nA. A growing dependence on trade with Europe for manufactured goods\nB. Vigorous resistance to European expeditions of conquest\nC. The establishment of Portuguese trading posts along the coastline\nD. The consolidation of states along the Atlantic coast of Africa\n"
