On cross- examination of the pedestrian's physician, the defendant's attorney asked him whether or not the pedestrian had told him that the leg that she claimed was injured had been permanently stiff as a result of a former field hockey injury the pedestrian suffered in high school. Upon objection by the pedestrian's attorney, the trial judge should\n\nA. sustain the objection, as hearsay not within any recognized exception.\nB. sustain the objection, as violative of the physician-patient privilege.\nC. overrule the objection, as a statement made for the purpose of diagnosis or treatment.\nD. overrule the objection, as a statement against interest.\n"

However, this privilege does not apply to all statements made to a physician. One exception is for statements made for the purpose of diagnosis or treatment. In this case, if the pedestrian told her physician about her previous field hockey injury, it would be relevant information for the physician to know in order to properly diagnose and treat her current injury. Therefore, the statement would not be considered privileged and could be admissible as evidence.\n\nAdditionally, the statement would not be considered hearsay because it falls under an exception to the hearsay rule. Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. However, statements made for the purpose of medical diagnosis or treatment are not considered hearsay and are admissible under the hearsay exception found in Federal Rule of Evidence 803(4). This exception applies because such statements are generally considered reliable since they are made for the purpose of obtaining medical care, and patients have an incentive to be truthful when describing their medical history to their physicians."
