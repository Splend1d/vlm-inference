Pregnancy has been complicated by mild asthma treated with inhaled bronchodilators. At the beginning of the second stage of labor, the cervix is 100% effaced and 10 cm dilated; the vertex is at -1 station. The fetal heart rate is reactive with no decelerations. After 10 minutes of pushing, there is a prolonged deceleration to 60/min. The patient has the acute onset of shortness of breath, rapidly develops cyanosis, and becomes unresponsive. Her pulse and blood pressure cannot be detected. Immediate resuscitation is started. Five minutes later, there is bleeding from the nose, mouth, and intravenous sites. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\n\nA. Amniotic fluid embolism\nB. Intracerebral hemorrhage\nC. Myocardial infarction\nD. Status asmaticus\n"

AFE is characterized by a sudden onset of respiratory distress, hypotension, and cardiovascular collapse, often followed by bleeding diathesis due to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The presence of bleeding from the nose, mouth, and intravenous sites suggests DIC, which is commonly associated with AFE.\n\nTherefore, the most likely diagnosis in this case is:\n\nA.
