Pregnancy and delivery of her first child were uncomplicated. Medications include folic acid and a multivitamin. Her temperature is 37.2\u00b0C (99\u00b0F), and blood pressure is 108/60 mm Hg. Pelvic examination shows a uterus consistent in size with a 12-week gestation. Urine dipstick shows leukocyte esterase; urinalysis shows WBCs and rare gram-negative rods. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?\n\nA. Recommend drinking 8 oz of cranberry juice daily\nB. Oral amoxicillin therapy\nC. Oral metronidazole therapy\nD.

During pregnancy, UTIs can lead to complications such as pyelonephritis, which can be serious for both the mother and the fetus. Therefore, it's important to treat any identified infection promptly.\n\nGiven that the patient is pregnant, the choice of antibiotic should take into consideration safety during pregnancy. Amoxicillin is considered safe for use in pregnancy and is effective against many common causes of urinary tract infections.\n\nThus, the most appropriate next step in management would be:\n\nB. Oral amoxicillin therapy\n\nIt's important to note that the choice of antibiotic should also consider local resistance patterns, and if there is a concern about resistance to amoxicillin, another appropriate antibiotic for UTIs that is safe in pregnancy, such as nitrofurantoin or a cephalosporin, might be chosen instead. However, based on the information provided, oral amoxicillin therapy is the best initial choice."
