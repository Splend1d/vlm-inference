However, we can determine the correct approach based on the information provided.\n\nIf Ty spends 2 weeks reading each book and he has 12 weeks available, then the number of books he can read is found by dividing the total number of weeks available (12) by the number of weeks it takes to read one book (2).\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of books} = \\frac{\\text{Total weeks}}{\\text{Weeks per book}} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of books} = \\frac{12}{2} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of books} = 6 \\]\n\nNone of the given options (A through D) represents this calculation directly. However, if we interpret the question as asking for an expression that could be used to represent this calculation, the closest option would involve division or possibly repeated subtraction, which is not directly represented among the choices.\n\nIf we were to create an expression using repeated subtraction to reflect the process of subtracting 2 weeks from the total 12 weeks until we reach zero (which would represent the number of books read), the correct expression would look like multiple subtractions of 2 from 12 until we reach zero. However, since we're only looking for the number of times we can subtract 2 from 12 before reaching zero (which corresponds to the number of books read), none of the given options accurately reflects this.\n\nGiven the options, there isn't a direct match, but conceptually, the closest representation of the process could be seen as repeated subtraction of 2 from 12, which none of the options (A-D) properly illustrate. A proper expression following the logic of the given options would be something akin to \"12 - 2 * n = 0\", where n is the number of books, but this is not listed. \n\nThe correct answer based on the problem statement and mathematical principles would be:\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of books} = \\frac{12}{2} = 6 \\] \n\nBut since this isn't an option, the question seems to be asking for a conceptual understanding rather than a literal match, and none of the given options (A-D) correctly represent the process described."
