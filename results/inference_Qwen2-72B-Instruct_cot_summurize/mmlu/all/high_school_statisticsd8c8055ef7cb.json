Given the options, and revisiting the calculation:\n\n0.72 = 0.6 + P(B) - 0.18\nP(B) = 0.72 - 0.6 + 0.18\nP(B) = 0.22 + 0.18\nP(B) = 0.40\n\nThis still doesn't match any of the options directly, but it's closest to option D, 0.48. However, based on the information given and the calculations performed, the correct answer should be closer to 0.40, which isn't an exact match to any of the options provided. If we must choose from the given options, the closest would be:\n\nD. 0.48\n\nBut it's important to note that this is not the mathematically calculated result based on the provided data. The precise calculation yields a value of 0.40, which is not listed among the options."
