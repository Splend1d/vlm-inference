Alexia without agraphia\n\nThis condition is often referred to as \"dissociated alexia,\" where an individual loses the ability to read (alexia) but retains the ability to write (agraphia). The disconnection between the visual centers and language centers due to damage in the posterior part of the corpus callosum can lead to difficulties in reading, as the visual information cannot be properly interpreted by the language centers. However, writing ability remains intact because it does not rely as heavily on the visual processing pathways that are disrupted."
