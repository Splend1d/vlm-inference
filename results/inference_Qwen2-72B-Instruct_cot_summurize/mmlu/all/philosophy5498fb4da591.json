He argued that justice, generosity, kindness, and other virtues were not only good in themselves but also beneficial to individuals and society. According to Cicero, being virtuous leads to a better reputation, stronger relationships, and ultimately a more fulfilling life. Therefore, it is expedient to be just, generous, and kind."
