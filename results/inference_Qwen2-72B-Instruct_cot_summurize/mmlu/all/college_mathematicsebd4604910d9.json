                    "text": "To determine which of these options are ideals of R, we need to check if they satisfy the conditions for being an ideal:\n\n1. The set must be closed under addition.\n2. The set must absorb multiplication from any side by elements in R.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nI. {u + v : u \u2208 U and v \u2208 V}\n\nThis is the sum of two ideals. Since both U and V are ideals, it follows that for any u1, u2 \u2208 U and v1, v2 \u2208 V, we have u1 + u2 \u2208 U and v1 + v2 \u2208 V due to closure under addition in ideals. Therefore, (u1 + v1) + (u2 + v2) = (u1 + u2) + (v1 + v2), which means this set is closed under addition.\n\nNow, for absorption under multiplication, let r \u2208 R. We want to show that r(u + v) \u2208 {u + v : u \u2208 U and v \u2208 V} and (u + v)r \u2208 {u + v : u \u2208 U and v \u2208 V}. Since U and V are ideals, ru \u2208 U and rv \u2208 V, so r(u + v) = ru + rv is in the set. Similarly, ur \u2208 U and vr \u2208 V, so (u + v)r = ur + vr is in the set. Thus, this set is an ideal.\n\nII. {uv : u \u2208 U and v \u2208 V}\n\nThis is the product of two ideals. It's not necessarily true that this set is an ideal. Consider the case where R is the ring of integers Z, U = 2Z (the even integers), and V = 3Z (multiples of 3). Then UV = {6n : n \u2208 Z}, but 1 * 6 \u2208 Z does not belong to UV, showing that this set does not absorb multiplication from all sides. Therefore, this is not necessarily an ideal.\n\nIII. {x : x \u2208 U and x \u2208 V}\n\nThis is the intersection of two ideals. It's easy to see that the intersection of ideals is still an ideal because:\n- If x, y \u2208 U \u2229 V, then x, y \u2208 U and x, y \u2208 V. So x + y \u2208 U and x + y \u2208 V, meaning x + y \u2208 U \u2229 V.\n- If r \u2208 R and x \u2208 U \u2229 V, then rx \u2208 U and rx \u2208 V since U and V are ideals. Thus, rx \u2208 U \u2229 V.\n\nSo, the correct answer is D. I and III only."
