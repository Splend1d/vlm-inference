In this case, we're given that \\(g(f(a)) = a\\) for all \\(a \\in A\\). This implies that if \\(f(a) = f(b)\\) for some \\(a, b \\in A\\), then applying \\(g\\) to both sides gives us \\(g(f(a)) = g(f(b))\\), which simplifies to \\(a = b\\) due to our given condition. Therefore, if two elements in \\(A\\) map to the same element in \\(B\\) under \\(f\\), they will map back to the original elements in \\(A\\) under \\(g\\), implying that \\(g\\) cannot map two different elements in \\(B\\) to the same element in \\(A\\). Hence, \\(g\\) is indeed injective.\n\n### Statement 2: The function \\(g\\) must necessarily be surjective.\n\nFor a function to be surjective (onto), it means that every element in the codomain is the image of at least one element in the domain. Given our condition that \\(g(f(a)) = a\\) for all \\(a \\in A\\), we see that every element in \\(A\\) has a corresponding element in \\(B\\) that maps back to it through \\(g\\). However, this does not guarantee that every element in \\(B\\) is mapped to an element in \\(A\\) by \\(g\\). For instance, there could be elements in \\(B\\) that are not in the range of \\(f\\), and thus, \\(g\\) would not map to these elements from \\(A\\). Therefore, without additional information about the mapping properties of \\(f\\) and \\(g\\), we cannot conclude that \\(g\\) is necessarily surjective.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n- **Statement 1** is true because \\(g\\) being injective is directly implied by the given condition.\n- **Statement 2** is false because the given condition does not necessarily imply that \\(g\\) is surjective; it only guarantees that elements in \\(A\\) have preimages in \\(B\\) under \\(g\\), but not necessarily that every element in \\(B\\) is a preimage of some element in \\(A\\).\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\n**C.
