This lack of understanding can manifest in several ways, including not knowing what makes the community function (option A), not recognizing the valuable members or resources within the community (option B), and not appreciating what is important in community life (option C). Ultimately, this failure to understand and respect the community leads to the conqueror's downfall, as they are unable to sustain their dominance over time."
