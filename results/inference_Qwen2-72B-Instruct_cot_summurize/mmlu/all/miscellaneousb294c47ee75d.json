Increasing government spending can help achieve this by injecting more money into the economy, which can lead to increased consumption, investment, and overall economic growth. This is often referred to as expansionary fiscal policy.\n\nA. An increase in taxes would typically have the opposite effect, as it reduces disposable income and can dampen consumer spending, potentially deepening a recession.\nC. A decrease in the reserve requirement is a monetary policy tool that affects the banking system's ability to lend, not a fiscal policy measure.\nD. A decrease in the discount rate is also a monetary policy tool that makes borrowing cheaper for banks, but it is not directly related to fiscal policy."
