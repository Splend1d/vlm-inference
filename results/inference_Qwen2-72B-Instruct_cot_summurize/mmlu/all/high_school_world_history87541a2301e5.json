                    "text": "This question refers to the following information.\nAt the peak of their power, the domains of the Mongol khans, or rulers, made up a vast realm in which once-hostile peoples lived together in peace and virtually all religions were tolerated. . . . The law code first promulgated by Chinggis Khan ordered human interaction. The result was an important new stage in international contact. From eastern Europe to southern China, merchants and travelers could move across the well-policed Mongol domains without fear for their lives or property. The great swath of Mongol territory that covered or connected most of Europe, Asia, and the Middle East served as a bridge between the civilizations of the Eastern Hemisphere. The caravans and embassies that crossed the Mongol lands transmitted new food, inventions, and ideas from one civilized pool to others and from civilized pools to the nomadic peoples who served as intermediaries. Secure trade routes made for prosperous merchants and wealthy, cosmopolitan cities. They also facilitated the spread of foods [and] inventions . . . a major force for economic and social development and the enhancement of civilized life.\n\u2014Robert Guisepi, 1992\nWhich of the following was a long-term consequence of the Mongol conquest of Russia in the 1200s?\n\nA. Russia was excluded from Western European developments (like the Renaissance).\nB. Russia benefited by becoming the administrative center of Mongol political activity.\nC. Islam became the dominant religion of Russia.\nD. Russia developed a centralized bureaucracy.\n"

                    "text": "The long-term consequence of the Mongol conquest of Russia in the 1200s that is most directly related to the provided information is D: Russia developed a centralized bureaucracy.\n\nThe Mongols were known for their efficient administration and governance, which often involved setting up centralized bureaucracies to manage their vast territories. This influence extended to the regions they conquered, including Russia. The Mongols' administrative practices likely had a significant impact on the development of Russian governance structures, contributing to the eventual centralization of power in the hands of the Russian tsars.\n\nWhile option A might seem plausible given historical context not included in the passage (the Mongol yoke did isolate Russia from some Western European influences), the direct consequence mentioned in the text relates more closely to the establishment of a well-organized administrative system under Mongol rule, which influenced Russian statecraft. Options B and C do not accurately reflect the consequences of the Mongol conquest based on the information provided; there is no indication that Russia became the administrative center of Mongol political activity, nor that Islam became the dominant religion of Russia as a result of the Mongol conquest."
