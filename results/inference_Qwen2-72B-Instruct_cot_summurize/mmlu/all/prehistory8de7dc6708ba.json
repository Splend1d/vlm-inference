Some resource-rich environments allow for the creation of surpluses that can lead to economic inequalities and social complexity.\n\nEthnographic evidence suggests that in societies where there is an abundance of resources, including food, some individuals or groups may be able to accumulate more than they need, creating a surplus. This surplus can then be used to gain power and influence over others, leading to economic inequalities and increased social complexity. While agriculture is often associated with the ability to produce surplus food, it is not the only way, as some hunter-gatherer societies in particularly resource-rich environments have also been known to generate surpluses."
