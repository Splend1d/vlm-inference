In routine buying, consumers have developed habits and routines for purchasing certain products or brands, and they do not require much thought or effort to make the purchase decision. They may even buy the product on autopilot without actively thinking about it. This type of buying behavior is often associated with low involvement products that are purchased frequently, such as groceries or household supplies."
