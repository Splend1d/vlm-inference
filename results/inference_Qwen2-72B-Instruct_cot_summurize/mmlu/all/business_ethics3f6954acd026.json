Supply loops, Recapture, Waste\n\nReplacing traditional linear supply chains with circular \"supply loops\" enhances the importance of product recapture (recovery, reuse, or recycling) and necessitates a fundamental redesign of every activity a firm engages in that produces waste. This approach is part of the transition towards a more sustainable, circular economy where resources are kept in use for as long as possible, extracting the maximum value from them before recovering and regenerating products and materials at the end of their service life."
