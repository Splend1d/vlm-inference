It includes several structures, such as the amygdala, hippocampus, and hypothalamus, that play key roles in emotional responses, including fear and aggression. Electrically stimulating the limbic system can evoke strong emotional reactions, including fear and aggression, in animals. In this case, if a cat becomes terrified in the presence of a mouse after being electrically stimulated, it is likely that the stimulation occurred in the limbic system."
