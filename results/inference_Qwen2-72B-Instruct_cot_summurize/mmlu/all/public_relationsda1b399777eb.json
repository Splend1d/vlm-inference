It turns out he had been drinking, and the arresting police officer found drugs in the car. The actor's publicist issued a statement claiming the actor was just tired and that the drugs belonged to someone else.

This is an example of a reactive PR strategy, which is typically employed to manage a crisis or address negative publicity after it has occurred. While options C and D both suggest \"manipulative,\" only option B accurately describes the nature of the PR response in this context. Option A, \"proactive,\" would not fit as it implies actions taken in advance to prevent issues, rather than in response to them."
