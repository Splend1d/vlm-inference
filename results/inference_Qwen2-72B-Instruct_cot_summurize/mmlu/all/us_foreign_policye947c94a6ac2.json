They place greater emphasis on ideology and beliefs\n\nIdeational approaches to US foreign policy during the Cold War emphasize the role of ideas, beliefs, and ideologies in shaping policy decisions. This perspective argues that the United States was driven by its commitment to promoting democracy, capitalism, and anti-communism as superior political and economic systems. In contrast, realist accounts focus more on material interests, power, and the balance of power between states. Realists would argue that the US actions were primarily driven by the need to maintain its position as a global superpower and to counterbalance the influence of the Soviet Union."
