                    "text": "The speed of sound in air does not depend on the frequency or the wavelength of the sound wave, but it does depend on the properties of the medium through which the sound is traveling. The primary factor affecting the speed of sound in air is the temperature of the air. Warmer air allows sound to travel faster than cooler air. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. air temperature.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that while the speed of sound isn't directly dependent on frequency or wavelength, these properties are related through the speed of sound by the equation:\n\n\\[ v = f \\lambda \\]\n\nwhere \\(v\\) is the speed of sound, \\(f\\) is the frequency, and \\(\\lambda\\) is the wavelength. This means that if you know two of these values, you can calculate the third. But fundamentally, the speed of sound in air is determined by the physical properties of the air, such as its temperature, pressure, and humidity. For this question, though, the best answer given the options is C. air temperature. If \"D. All of these\" were correct, it would imply that the speed of sound changes with frequency or wavelength, which it does not."
