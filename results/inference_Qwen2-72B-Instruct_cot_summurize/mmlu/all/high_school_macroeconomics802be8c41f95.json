The higher the MPC, the greater the spending multiplier because a larger portion of any income received is spent, leading to further rounds of spending and income generation. Conversely, if the marginal propensity to save increases, the multiplier effect decreases as more of the additional income is saved rather than spent. The velocity of money and real interest rates do not directly determine the size of the spending multiplier, although they can influence overall economic activity."
