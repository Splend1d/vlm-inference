This is described by the Lorentz force law.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that while the magnetic force can change the direction of the electrons, it does not change their kinetic energy. The work done by a magnetic field on a moving charge is always zero because the force is always perpendicular to the displacement. Therefore, option B (energy) is incorrect, and the correct answer is:\n\nC. Both of these\n\nIs not correct because the magnetic force does not change the energy of the electrons. So, the right choice is actually:\n\nA. direction"
