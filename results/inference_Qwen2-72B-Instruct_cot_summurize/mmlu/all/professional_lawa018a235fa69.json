The following day, the gardener conveys the property to a landscaper; she does not record her deed. Then on February 4, the gardener executes an identical conveyance of the orchard to a friend. The friend gives the gardener a check for $100,000 for the property and records the conveyance, even though he has actual knowledge of the prior conveyance to the landscaper. The landscaper, however, records her deed on February 6. The friend then conveys his interest in the farm to an investor, who gives a purchase price of $115,000 to the friend. On February 5, the investor purchases the farm without notice of the conveyance to the landscaper and duly records the deed. Suppose that the jurisdiction in which the property is located has a pure race statute as their deed recordation law. Under these circumstances, which of the aforementioned parties would ultimately prevail?\n\nA. The investor.\nB. The landscaper.\nC. The friend.\nD. The gardener.\n"

In this scenario:\n\n- The man conveys the orchard to the gardener, who records the conveyance.\n- The gardener conveys the property to the landscaper, who does not record her deed immediately.\n- The gardener executes another conveyance of the orchard to a friend, who records the conveyance and has actual knowledge of the prior conveyance to the landscaper.\n- The friend conveys his interest in the farm to an investor, who purchases the farm without notice of the conveyance to the landscaper and duly records the deed.\n\nGiven that the investor records the deed without having notice of the prior unrecorded conveyance to the landscaper and does so before the landscaper records her deed, the investor would prevail under a pure race statute. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nA. The investor."
