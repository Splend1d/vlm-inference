Selection is how you choose people for the study and assignment is what group they go in.\n\nRandom selection refers to the process of choosing participants from a larger population in such a way that each individual has an equal chance of being selected for the study. This ensures that the sample is representative of the population and increases the generalizability of the results.\n\nRandom assignment, on the other hand, involves the process of placing participants into different groups (such as experimental and control groups) in such a way that each participant has an equal chance of being assigned to any group. This helps to ensure that the groups are equivalent at the start of the experiment and reduces the likelihood of systematic differences between them that could threaten internal validity."
