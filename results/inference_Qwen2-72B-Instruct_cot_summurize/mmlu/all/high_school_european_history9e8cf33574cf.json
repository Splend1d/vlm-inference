Nor were there just three such stars; four wanderers complete their revolutions about Jupiter, and of their alterations as observed more precisely later on we shall give a description here. Also I measured the distances between them by means of the telescope. . . .\nSuch are the observations concerning the four Medicean planets recently first discovered by me, and although from this data their periods have not yet been reconstructed in numerical form, it is legitimate at least to put in evidence some facts worthy of note. Above all, since they sometimes follow and sometimes precede Jupiter by the same intervals, and they remain within very limited distances either to east or west of Jupiter, accompanying that planet in both its retrograde and direct movements in a constant manner, no one can doubt that they complete their revolutions about Jupiter and at the same time effect all together a twelve-year period about the center of the universe.\n\u2014Galileo Galilei, 1610\nWhich of the following conclusions drawn in part from the observations above was the most revolutionary over time?\n\nA. There were four smaller stars that seemed to move around Jupiter.\nB. The Earth is not the center of the universe.\nC. The heavens are occupied by bodies revolving around each other rather than by God alone.\nD. The Earth is but one tiny planet in an infinite universe or even multiverse.\n"

The Earth is not the center of the universe.\n\nThis conclusion challenged the long-held geocentric model of the universe, which posited that the Earth was at the center with everything else revolving around it. Galileo's observations supported the heliocentric model proposed by Copernicus, where the Sun is at the center of the solar system, and planets, including Earth, revolve around it. This shift in understanding had profound implications for science, philosophy, and theology during the Scientific Revolution."
