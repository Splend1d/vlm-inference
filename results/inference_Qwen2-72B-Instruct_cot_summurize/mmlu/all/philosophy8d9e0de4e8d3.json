This view is grounded in his belief that God, who is the ultimate good, created everything and declared it \"good\" as stated in the book of Genesis. Augustine further elaborates that evil is not a substance or a created thing but rather a privation or absence of good. Therefore, all created things, being made by God, inherently possess goodness. However, Augustine also acknowledges that the goodness of creation can be marred by sin, which is a turning away from God and thus a turning away from true goodness. Nonetheless, even in their fallen state, created things still retain some degree of goodness because they still exist and have been created by God."
