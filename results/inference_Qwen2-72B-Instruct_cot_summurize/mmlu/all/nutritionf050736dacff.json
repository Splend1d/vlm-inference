The estimated strength of the association between an exposure and the outcome. A strong association may suggest a causal relationship, but it is not definitive proof.\n\nB. Evidence that the exposure of interest has appeared before the outcome (temporality). This criterion ensures that the cause precedes the effect, which is essential for establishing causality.\n\nC. Evidence showing that reductions in the exposure level will reverse the risk of the outcome (reversibility). If removing or reducing the exposure leads to a decrease in the risk of the health outcome, this can support a causal relationship.\n\nIn addition to these criteria, epidemiologists also consider consistency (the association is found consistently across different studies), specificity (the exposure is specifically related to the outcome and not other outcomes), dose-response relationship (higher levels of exposure are associated with higher risks), and biological plausibility (the relationship makes sense based on current scientific knowledge)."
