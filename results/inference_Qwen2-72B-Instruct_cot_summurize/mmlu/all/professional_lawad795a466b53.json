Hundreds of tourists poured into the area to work on the large block of ice. They made a gigantic ice palace for a variety of Disney princesses. To handle the needs of a great number of tourists, food vendors came from all over and set up their carts. To solve the problem of congestion, safety, and insufficient security, the town passed an ordinance restricting all street vendors to a specified parking lot area. The food vendors and others were losing money under the regulation. Would a commerce clause challenge to the parking lot requirement be successful by the food stand owners?\n\nA. No, because there is a legitimate state or local interest here which is promoted by an even-handed procedure to control the flow of traffic for public safety, and the impact on commerce is incidental.\nB. No, because the food stands do not have a significant commerce clause claim in that they are still able to sell food, and what they do does not affect interstate commerce.\nC. Yes, because the state is interfering with the food cart owners' legitimate business operations, which impact heavily on interstate commerce.\nD. Yes, because the local interest is favored in a discriminatory manner against all of the food cart owners from other states.\n"

No, because there is a legitimate state or local interest here which is promoted by an even-handed procedure to control the flow of traffic for public safety, and the impact on commerce is incidental.\n\nThe Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution gives Congress the power to regulate commerce among the several states. However, it also implies limits on the states' ability to pass legislation that excessively burdens or discriminates against interstate commerce. In this scenario, the town's ordinance restricting street vendors to a specific parking lot is aimed at addressing issues of congestion, safety, and security, which are legitimate local interests. The regulation appears to apply even-handedly to all vendors, without specifically targeting out-of-state businesses. Therefore, while it may incidentally impact commerce, it does not necessarily violate the Commerce Clause as long as it serves a legitimate local purpose and does not discriminate against interstate commerce. The courts would likely consider whether there are less restrictive alternatives available and whether the burden on interstate commerce is excessive in relation to the local benefits. However, based on the information provided, the challenge is unlikely to succeed solely on the grounds of a Commerce Clause violation."
