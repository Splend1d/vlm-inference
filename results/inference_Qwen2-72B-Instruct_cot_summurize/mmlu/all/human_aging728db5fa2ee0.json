This is often referred to as \"ageism,\" which can manifest in various forms of discrimination against older individuals. While positive stereotypes about aging do exist, such as the idea that older people are wise or have a lot of life experience, negative stereotypes\u2014such as assuming that all older people are frail, forgetful, or resistant to change\u2014are more common and can have significant impacts on how society views and treats its elderly population."
