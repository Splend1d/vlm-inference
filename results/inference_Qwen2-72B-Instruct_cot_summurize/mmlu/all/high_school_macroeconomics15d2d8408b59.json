In economic theory, if everyone expects lower inflation in the future, it could lead to lower wage demands, less price increases by businesses, and thus contribute to lower actual inflation rates. This is because expectations about inflation can affect behavior, and thus impact actual inflation.\n\nRegarding the other options:\nA. the Phillips curve will shift to the right - This is not necessarily true. The Phillips curve shows the relationship between unemployment and inflation. Lower expected inflation might shift the curve, but it depends on how expectations affect labor market conditions.\nB. the actual rate of inflation will increase - This contradicts the premise that prices are expected to rise more slowly.\nC. the actual inflation rate will remain steady unless supply shocks set in - This could be true under certain conditions, but it doesn't directly address the effect of lowered inflation expectations."
