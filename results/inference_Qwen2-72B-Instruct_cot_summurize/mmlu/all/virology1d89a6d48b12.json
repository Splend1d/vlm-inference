Eradicated smallpox - Smallpox is one of the most devastating diseases in human history, but thanks to a global vaccination campaign led by the World Health Organization (WHO), it was declared eradicated in 1980.\n\nC. Increased hygiene - Viruses have certainly encouraged us to improve our hygiene practices, such as washing our hands more frequently and thoroughly, using hand sanitizers, wearing masks, and maintaining social distancing during outbreaks.\n\nD. A better understanding of how cellular genes aid virus replication and so become a target for new drugs - Advances in virology and molecular biology have helped us understand how viruses interact with host cells and replicate, which has led to the development of antiviral drugs that target specific viral proteins or cellular pathways used by viruses. However, polio has not been eradicated globally yet, although significant progress has been made towards this goal. The last case of wild poliovirus was reported in Afghanistan in January 2021, and only two countries (Afghanistan and Pakistan) remain endemic for wild poliovirus."
