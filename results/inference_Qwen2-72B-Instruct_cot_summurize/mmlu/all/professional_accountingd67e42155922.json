Include the paragraph immediately after the opinion paragraph in the audit report.\n\nAn emphasis-of-matter paragraph is added to the auditor's report when there is a matter that is relevant to the users' understanding of the financial statements but does not affect the auditor's opinion. This paragraph should be included immediately after the opinion paragraph in the audit report to ensure that it is clearly visible and easily accessible to the readers. The purpose of the emphasis-of-matter paragraph is to highlight a significant matter that has been appropriately presented or disclosed in the financial statements but may not be readily apparent to the users. It is not necessary for the auditor to modify the introductory paragraph or indicate that the emphasis-of-matter paragraph is required by law or regulation. Additionally, the auditor would only notify the appropriate regulatory authority if there was a modification to the opinion based on the matter, which is not the case for an emphasis-of-matter paragraph."
