This process is known as sweating. Additionally, the body may also increase heart rate (C) to enhance blood flow and aid in heat dissipation. Increasing respiration rate (B) can also help in dissipating some heat, but it's not the primary mechanism for thermoregulation in response to high temperatures. Decreasing salt retention (A) is not a direct compensation for increased environmental temperature, although it can be affected indirectly due to changes in hydration status."
