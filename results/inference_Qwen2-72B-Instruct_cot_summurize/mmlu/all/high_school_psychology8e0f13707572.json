MRI\n\nAn MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) scan is typically used to examine the brain for structural damage, such as bruising, bleeding, or swelling, which could occur as a result of a car crash. MRI uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to create detailed images of the brain's structure.\n\nWhile other scans like PET (Positron Emission Tomography), EEG (Electroencephalogram), and fMRI (Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging) can also provide valuable information about the brain, they are not primarily used for assessing structural damage. PET scans are often used to measure metabolic activity, EEG measures electrical activity in the brain, and fMRI is used to measure brain function by detecting changes associated with blood flow."
