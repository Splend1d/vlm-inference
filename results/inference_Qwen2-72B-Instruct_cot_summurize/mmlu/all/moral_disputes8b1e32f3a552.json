Singer has written extensively on global poverty and argues that developed nations harm poor nations in several ways, including:\n\n1. Failing to provide sufficient aid: Singer argues that developed nations have a moral obligation to provide more aid to poor nations to alleviate poverty and prevent unnecessary suffering.\n\n2. Imposing unfair trade policies: Developed nations often impose trade policies that benefit themselves at the expense of poor nations, such as subsidies for their own agricultural industries that make it difficult for farmers in poor nations to compete.\n\n3. Exploiting natural resources: Developed nations often exploit the natural resources of poor nations without providing adequate compensation or benefits to local communities.\n\n4. Promoting economic systems that exacerbate inequality: Developed nations often promote economic systems that prioritize profit over social welfare, leading to increased inequality and poverty in poor nations.\n\nTherefore, none of the options presented accurately reflects Singer's argument."
