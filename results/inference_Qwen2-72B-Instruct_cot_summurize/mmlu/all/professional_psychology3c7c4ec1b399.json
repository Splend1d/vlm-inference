                    "text": "The correct answer is B. about 68% of the individuals with a given true score will have observed scores within 15 points of the true score.\n\nExplanation: The standard error of measurement (SEM) refers to the standard deviation of the distribution of observed scores around the true score. It indicates how much an individual's observed score might vary from their true score due to measurement error. When we say that the SEM is 15 points, it means that for approximately 68% of the individuals, their observed score will fall within one SEM (15 points) above or below their true score. This is based on the assumption that measurement errors are normally distributed.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it refers to the proportion of scores falling within a certain range of the mean score, which is related to the standard deviation rather than the SEM.\n\nOption C is incorrect because it suggests that 15% of the scores are in error, which is not what the SEM represents. The SEM does not indicate the percentage of scores that are in error but rather the precision of the measurement.\n\nOption D is incorrect because it implies that differences up to 30 points represent the same true score, which is not necessarily true. While the SEM can help us understand the reliability of score differences, it does not directly equate to saying that differences up to a certain number of points represent the same true score."
