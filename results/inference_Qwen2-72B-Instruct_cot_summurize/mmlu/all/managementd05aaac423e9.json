Reward\n\nThe Job Characteristics Model, developed by Richard Hackman and Greg Oldham in 1976, identifies five core job dimensions that can lead to three critical psychological states which, in turn, lead to various outcomes such as job satisfaction, performance, and motivation. The five core job dimensions are:\n\n1. Skill variety: The degree to which a job requires a variety of different activities utilizing a range of an employee's skills and talents.\n2. Task identity: The degree to which a job requires completion of a whole and identifiable piece of work.\n3. Task significance: The degree to which a job has a substantial impact on the lives or work of other people.\n4. Autonomy: The degree to which a job provides substantial freedom, independence, and discretion to the individual in scheduling the work and determining the procedures to be used.\n5. Feedback: The degree to which a job provides the individual with direct and clear information about the effectiveness of his or her performance.\n\n'Reward' is not one of these core job dimensions in the Job Characteristics Model. However, it is important to note that rewards (both intrinsic and extrinsic) can be influenced by the presence or absence of these job characteristics."
