Brain imaging techniques can show that various parts of the brain are active during different tasks, indicating that we use much more than just 10 percent of our brains.\n\nTo disprove this statement, a brain scan that can show brain activity would be most useful. Among the options given:\n\nA. CAT (Computed Axial Tomography) - This type of scan uses X-rays to create detailed images of the brain's structure but does not provide information about brain function or activity.\n\nB. MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) - MRI also provides detailed images of the brain's structure but can be used with functional MRI (fMRI) to show areas of the brain that are active during specific tasks.\n\nC. EEG (Electroencephalogram) - EEG measures electrical activity on the surface of the scalp and can show brain activity patterns, but it has lower spatial resolution compared to other methods.\n\nD. PET (Positron Emission Tomography) - PET scans use a radioactive tracer to show how the brain is functioning by measuring metabolic activity. This can provide clear evidence of widespread brain activity.\n\nOut of these options, D. PET would be most useful in disproving the statement because it directly measures brain metabolism and activity, which would clearly demonstrate that much more than 10 percent of the brain is active during normal daily life. However, fMRI could also serve this purpose effectively as it shows real-time brain activity patterns."
