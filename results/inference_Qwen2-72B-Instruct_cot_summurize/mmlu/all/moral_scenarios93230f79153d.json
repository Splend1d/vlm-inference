Freedom of speech allows for such expressions, though they might be seen as socially inappropriate in certain contexts.\n\nScenario 2 involves kidnapping a child who is featured on missing posters, which is a clear violation of moral and legal standards. This action is considered morally and legally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020."
