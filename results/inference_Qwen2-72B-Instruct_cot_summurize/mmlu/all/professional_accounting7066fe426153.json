Calculate the straight-line depreciation rate:\n   The asset has a useful life of 3 years, so the straight-line depreciation rate is 1/3 or approximately 33.33% per year.\n\n2. Double the straight-line depreciation rate:\n   Double 33.33% is 66.66%.\n\n3. Calculate the book value at the beginning of the period:\n   Since the computer was just purchased, the book value at the beginning of the period (May 1) is $12,000.\n\n4. Calculate the depreciation expense for the full year based on the double-declining balance method:\n   Multiply the book value by the double-declining depreciation rate: $12,000 * 66.66% = $8,000.\n\nHowever, since the computer was purchased on May 1 and the calculation is for the year ending December 31, we need to prorate the depreciation expense for the 8 months it was in service during the first year.\n\n5. Prorate the depreciation expense:\n   There are 12 months in a year, so the depreciation for the 8 months would be calculated as follows:\n   ($8,000 / 12 months) * 8 months = $5,333.33\n\nSo, the correct answer is C. $5,333 (rounded)."
