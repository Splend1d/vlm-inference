It was instead a labor law that protected the rights of workers to organize into unions and engage in collective bargaining with employers. The other three options listed (The Sherman Act, The Clayton Act, and The Robinson-Patman Act) are indeed landmark antitrust acts that aimed to prevent anti-competitive business practices and maintain fair competition in the marketplace."
