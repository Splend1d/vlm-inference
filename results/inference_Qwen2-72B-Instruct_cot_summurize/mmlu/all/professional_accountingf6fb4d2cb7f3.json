Given that the quick ratio is 1-to-1, we have:\n\\[ 1 = \\frac{\\text{Quick Assets}}{322,000} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Quick Assets} = 322,000 \\]\n\nSince Quick Assets are Current Assets minus Inventory and Prepaid Expenses, we can set up the following equation:\n\\[ \\text{Quick Assets} = \\text{Current Assets} - (\\text{Inventory} + \\text{Prepaid Expenses}) \\]\n\nSubstituting the values we know:\n\\[ 322,000 = 966,000 - (\\text{Inventory} + \\text{Prepaid Expenses}) \\]\n\\[ \\text{Inventory} + \\text{Prepaid Expenses} = 966,000 - 322,000 = 644,000 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount for inventory and prepaid expenses is $644,000, which corresponds to option B."
