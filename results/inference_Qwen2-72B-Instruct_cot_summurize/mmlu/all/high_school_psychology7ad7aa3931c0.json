Dissociative disorders are characterized by a disruption in the usually integrated functions of consciousness, memory, identity, or perception of the environment. Symptoms can include amnesia for important personal information and a sense of detachment from one's emotions, body, or surroundings. Frequent loss of a sense of personal identity is also a common symptom of dissociative identity disorder (DID), which is a type of dissociative disorder. However, it's important to note that only a qualified mental health professional can make an accurate diagnosis after a thorough evaluation."
