To find out how many miles she drives in 5 days:\n\n\\[ \\text{Daily round trip} = 18 \\, \\text{miles} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Total for 5 days} = 18 \\, \\text{miles/day} \\times 5 \\, \\text{days} = 90 \\, \\text{miles} \\]\n\nHowever, since we are asked for an estimate rounded to the nearest 5 miles, we round 90 miles to the nearest 5 miles. Since 90 is exactly on a multiple of 5, it doesn't change when rounded. But to answer the question as asked, we look at the options provided:\n\nA. 75 miles (which is 90 miles rounded down, but not the closest option)\nB. 100 miles (which is more than 90 miles, but also not the closest option)\nC. 125 miles (which is significantly more than 90 miles)\nD. 180 miles (which is twice what Abby would drive in 10 days, not 5)\n\nNone of the options perfectly match 90 miles, but since we're rounding to the nearest 5 miles, the closest match to 90 miles from the given options is:\n\nA. 75 miles\n\nHowever, this choice is not accurate because it's actually further away from 90 than 100 miles is. The correct answer based on the given options and the principle of rounding to the nearest 5 miles would be:\n\nB. 100 miles\n\nBut please note, the actual calculation shows Abby drives 90 miles in 5 days, which isn't listed among the provided options. The closest estimate to the true value (90 miles) from the options given is 100 miles."
