Admitting to external problems, especially mental health issues or family conflicts, can be seen as a source of shame and dishonor. This cultural context can lead individuals, particularly Asian-Americans who adhere to these traditional values, to feel intense feelings of shame and guilt when acknowledging such problems to a counselor or therapist.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that experiences of shame and guilt in the context of seeking help for family problems can occur across various cultural groups, including those listed in options B, C, and D. Cultural norms and values play a significant role in how individuals perceive and respond to mental health issues and family challenges."
