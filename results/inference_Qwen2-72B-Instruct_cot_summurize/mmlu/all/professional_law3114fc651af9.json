S. foreign policy, the assemblyman and the foreign country's leader issued a joint statement criticizing the United States' involvement in the political affairs of neighboring countries. Following the assemblyman's return to the United States, he was prosecuted under a federal criminal statute making it unlawful for any citizen not specifically authorized by the President to negotiate with a foreign government for the purpose of influencing the foreign government in relation to a dispute with the United States. The law further provides that \"any citizen who knowingly counsels, aids, or abets a foreign government in a dispute with the United States. . , shall, upon conviction. . . be punished by imprisonment for not more than five years or a fine of not more than $10,000, or by both fine and imprisonment. . . . \"Which of the following is the strongest constitutional basis for upholding the validity of the aforementioned federal statute?\n\nA. Federal criminal laws dealing with international affairs need not be as specific as those dealing with domestic affairs.\nB. Under its enumerated powers, Congress may legislate to preserve the monopoly of the national government over the conduct of U. S. foreign affairs.\nC. The President's inherent power to negotiate for the U. S. with foreign countries authorizes him to punish citizens who engage in such negotiations without permission, even in the absence of statutory authorization.\nD. Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution grants Congress concurrent power with the President to regulate external affairs with foreign countries.\n"

Under its enumerated powers, Congress may legislate to preserve the monopoly of the national government over the conduct of U.S. foreign affairs.\n\nThis option is the strongest constitutional basis for upholding the validity of the federal statute because it directly relates to Congress's authority under the Constitution. The Constitution grants Congress the power to regulate commerce with foreign Nations (Article I, Section 8, Clause 3), and this power can be interpreted to include the regulation of activities that might interfere with the conduct of U.S. foreign policy. Additionally, the Necessary and Proper Clause (Article I, Section 8, Clause 18) allows Congress to pass laws necessary and proper for carrying out its enumerated powers, which includes the power to regulate foreign affairs. This clause provides a strong basis for Congress to enact laws that prevent unauthorized individuals from engaging in activities that could undermine the U.S. government's ability to manage its foreign relations effectively."
