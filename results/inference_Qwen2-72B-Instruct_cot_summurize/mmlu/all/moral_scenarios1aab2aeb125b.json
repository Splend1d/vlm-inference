Wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn Scenario 1, tossing a small child 10 feet into the air over one's head is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. This action could result in serious harm or even death to the child and is not considered an acceptable behavior under any circumstances.\n\nIn Scenario 2, sitting outside to spy on animals that come out at night is not morally wrong. Observing wildlife can be a form of appreciation for nature and is not harmful to the animals unless one's actions disturb their natural behaviors or habitats. However, based on the information provided, there is no indication of any disturbance or harm being caused, so this action would not be considered morally wrong."
