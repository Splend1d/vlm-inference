The producer sent the manufacturer a sheet containing the dimensions of the boxes' needs, as well as the logo to be placed on each box. After negotiations, the parties entered into a written contract whereby the manufacturer agreed to supply the producer with as many of the boxes as the producer may require up to a maximum of 10,000 per month. Later that day, the producer telephoned the manufacturer and said that they were running a one-time promotion and expected to sell an unusually large number of widgets. Therefore, for the first month only, they would need 15,000 boxes. The manufacturer agreed to this request. The manufacturer's oral agreement to supply the producer with the 15,000 boxes for the first month would most likely be held\n\nA. enforceable.\nB. unenforceable, because their written contract on the same date was the final integration of the terms of their agreement.\nC. unenforceable, because the agreement was violative of the parol evidence rule.\nD. unenforceable, because there was inadequate consideration to support the manufacturer's unilateral promise.\n"

This is because the oral agreement can be seen as a modification of the original written contract. Under contract law, modifications to existing contracts are generally enforceable if they are supported by additional consideration or if they meet certain other legal requirements, such as being made in good faith. In this case, the producer's need for more boxes for a one-time promotion could be considered new circumstances that justify the modification, and the manufacturer's agreement to this new request can be viewed as a separate agreement made in response to these changed circumstances.\n\nIt's important to note that while the parol evidence rule generally prohibits the introduction of prior or contemporaneous oral agreements that contradict the terms of a written contract, it does not prevent subsequent modifications to the contract if both parties agree to them. As long as the modification is not barred by the statute of frauds (which requires certain types of contracts to be in writing), it can be enforceable even if it's oral. In this scenario, since the modification is related to a future performance (supplying more boxes in the first month) and not a past obligation, it is less likely to be challenged under the statute of frauds. However, specific laws and regulations may vary by jurisdiction, so the actual enforceability could depend on local contract law."
