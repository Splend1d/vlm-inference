However, if we must choose one common criticism:\n\nB. They have high variance.\n\nIn certain situations, MLE can indeed lead to estimators with high variance, especially when dealing with small sample sizes or distributions that are sensitive to outliers. This is because MLE estimates are obtained by maximizing the likelihood function, which can sometimes result in estimates that are highly influenced by random fluctuations in the data.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that MLE estimators are often desirable because under certain regularity conditions, they are consistent, asymptotically normal, and efficient. This means that as the sample size increases, MLE estimators tend to converge to the true parameter values, have a normal distribution around the true value, and have the smallest possible variance among all unbiased estimators.\n\nRegarding the other options:\n- A. MLE estimators are not necessarily biased; in fact, under certain conditions, they can be unbiased.\n- C. MLE estimators are often consistent, meaning they converge in probability to the true parameter value as the sample size grows.\n\nSo, while there might be specific scenarios where MLE estimators exhibit bias or lack consistency, these are not general characteristics that would universally make MLE estimates undesirable. The most common criticism is that they can have high variance, particularly in small samples or with data that contain outliers."
