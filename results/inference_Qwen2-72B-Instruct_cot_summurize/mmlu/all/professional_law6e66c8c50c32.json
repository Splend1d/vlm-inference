After approving the license to the utility company, the city council then passed a measure by which the utility company was required to insert in its monthly billing statements a letter from a private consumer group criticizing the high cost of electrical service. The cost of printing and mailing the monthly letter was paid entirely by the consumer group. Nonetheless, the utility company vehemently objected to having such a critical letter enclosed in their monthly billing statements. However, the city council warned the utility company that unless it complied with the directive, the city would revoke its license for electrical service. The utility company filed suit in federal court seeking a hearing prior to its license being revoked by the city council. Which of the following constitutional provisions would provide the utility company with the strongest grounds with which to challenge the city council measure?\n\nA. The due process clause.\nB. The equal protection clause.\nC. The privileges and immunities clause of ArticleIv.\nD. The commerce clause.\n"

The due process clause.\n\nThe due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment provides that no state shall \"deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\" In this case, the utility company could argue that its property right in the exclusive license to provide electrical service is being taken away without adequate procedural protections. Moreover, the requirement to include a critical letter in their billing statements could be seen as an infringement on their freedom of speech and association, which are also protected under the due process clause.\n\nWhile the other constitutional provisions listed may have some relevance to the situation, they do not provide as strong a basis for the utility company's challenge as the due process clause does. The equal protection clause requires that similarly situated individuals be treated equally under the law, but there is no indication that the utility company is being treated differently than others in a similar position. The privileges and immunities clause protects citizens' rights to travel and conduct business across state lines, which is not at issue here. The commerce clause grants Congress the power to regulate interstate commerce, but it does not directly address the actions of a local government like the city council."
