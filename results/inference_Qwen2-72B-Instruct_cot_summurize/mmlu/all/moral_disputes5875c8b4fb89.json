It posits that life itself has intrinsic worth, and this worth is not contingent upon the species, intelligence, or utility to humans. This viewpoint challenges anthropocentrism, which places humans at the center of moral concern, by advocating for a more inclusive approach to ethics that recognizes the value of all forms of life."
