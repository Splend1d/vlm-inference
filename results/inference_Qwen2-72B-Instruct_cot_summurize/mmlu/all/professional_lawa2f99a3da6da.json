The contract stipulated that delivery would be \"F. O. B. at the dealer's shop,\" with payment to be made one week after tender. When the dealer received the tapestry, he noticed that it had been damaged in transit. The dealer immediately contacted the collector and notified him that he was rejecting the tapestry because it had ripped apart and was becoming unwoven. The collector told the dealer that he would get back to him with re-shipping instructions. The collector did not make any further contact with the dealer. After four weeks, the dealer then sold the tapestry to a buyer for $120,000. If the collector sues the dealer for damages, the collector should recover\n\nA. $120,000, for conversion.\nB. $108,000, because the dealer is entitled to a reasonable sum not exceeding 10% on the resale.\nC. $100,000, which is the contract price.\nD. $20,000, which covers the difference between the contract price and the sale price.\n"

In this case, the collector delivered a damaged tapestry, and the dealer properly rejected it. The dealer then had the right to resell the tapestry and recover from the seller the difference between the contract price and the resale price, plus any incidental damages. \n\nIn this case, the dealer resold the tapestry for $120,000, which is $20,000 more than the contract price of $100,000. However, the dealer is also entitled to a reasonable sum not exceeding 10% of the contract price as reimbursement for any expenses incurred in connection with the resale. Therefore, the dealer is entitled to keep $10,000 (10% of $100,000) as reimbursement for expenses, resulting in a total recovery of $108,000 ($120,000 - $10,000 + $20,000). \n\nTherefore, if the collector sues the dealer for damages, the collector should recover $108,000."
