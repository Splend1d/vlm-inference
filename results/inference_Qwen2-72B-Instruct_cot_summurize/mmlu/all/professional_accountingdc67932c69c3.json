Separate columns for governmental activities, business-type activities, and discretely presented component units.\n\nThe statement of activities in the government-wide financial statements is designed to present information about the government's operational results from its various activities. It typically includes separate columns for governmental activities (which are financed primarily through taxes and intergovernmental revenues), business-type activities (which are financed primarily through user charges), and discretely presented component units (which are organizations that are financially accountable to the primary government but operate in a manner similar to a private sector entity). This format helps users understand the different types of activities the government engages in and how they are financed."
