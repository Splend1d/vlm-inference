The pain is usually relieved with defecation and does not occur at night or interfere with sleep. She says she is frustrated by her symptoms and has stopped traveling because of her frequent, urgent need to use the bathroom. She has no history of serious illness and takes no medications. Her temperature is 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), pulse is 70/min, respirations are 14/min, and blood pressure is 120/80 mm Hg. The lower abdomen is mildly tender to palpation; there is no rebound tenderness or guarding. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Results of laboratory studies are within the reference ranges. Test of the stool for occult blood is negative. Antigliadin antibodies are not present. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy?\n\nA. Nefazodone\nB. Nortriptyline\nC. Phenelzine\nD. Sertraline\n"

                    "text": "The patient's symptoms are consistent with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), a common functional gastrointestinal disorder characterized by chronic abdominal pain and altered bowel habits in the absence of any organic disease. The fact that her symptoms are relieved with defecation and do not occur at night, along with the lack of significant physical findings and normal laboratory results, further support this diagnosis.\n\nPharmacotherapy for IBS is aimed at symptom control. Antidepressants can be used to manage the abdominal pain and discomfort associated with IBS. Among the options provided:\n\nA. Nefazodone - This is an antidepressant, but it is not commonly used for IBS due to its side effect profile.\nB. Nortriptyline - This is a tricyclic antidepressant that can be effective in managing the pain component of IBS.\nC. Phenelzine - This is a monoamine oxidase inhibitor, which is not typically used for IBS.\nD. Sertraline - This is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) that may help with the psychological aspects of IBS but is not as effective for pain relief as other antidepressants.\n\nGiven the choices, **Nortriptyline** (Option B) would be the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient's symptoms, as it can help with the abdominal pain and discomfort associated with IBS without causing significant constipation, which could exacerbate her diarrhea."
