As an aid to weaning patients from a ventilator.\n\nA tracheostomy is often performed to help patients breathe who are on mechanical ventilation for an extended period of time, such as in cases of critical illness or severe lung disease. It can also be used to facilitate weaning patients off the ventilator by providing a more direct airway that reduces the work of breathing. However, it's important to note that a tracheostomy may also be necessary in other scenarios, including severe respiratory failure, prolonged need for mechanical ventilation, airway obstruction, or as part of head and neck cancer treatment. Options A, B, and D do not typically require a tracheostomy."
