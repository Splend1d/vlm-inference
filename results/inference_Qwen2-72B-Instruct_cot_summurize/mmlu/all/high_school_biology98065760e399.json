Artificial selection involves humans choosing specific traits they desire in the cattle, such as larger size or faster growth rate, and breeding animals that exhibit those traits. Directional selection is a type of artificial selection where breeders select for extreme traits, moving the population's average trait value further away from the original mean, resulting in an overall improvement in desired qualities like meat quality or yield. Stabilizing selection, on the other hand, aims to maintain the status quo by selecting against extreme variations, which is not directly mentioned in the context of improving meat quality in this case."
