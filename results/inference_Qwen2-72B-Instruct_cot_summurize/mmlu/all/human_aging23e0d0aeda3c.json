You have no hobbies\n\nRetirement can be a major life change, and having interests or hobbies can help retirees maintain a sense of purpose and fulfillment. Without hobbies or other activities to engage in, some people may find retirement to be unfulfilling or boring. However, it's important to note that everyone's situation is unique, and there may be other reasons why someone might choose to continue working past retirement age. Ultimately, the decision to retire should be based on a variety of factors, including financial readiness, health, and personal preferences."
