They can choose to end the hypnotic state at any time if they wish to do so. Hypnotic induction does not involve the therapist controlling the client's behavior, nor is it inherently harmful to clients. Additionally, intelligence does not correlate with hypnotizability; people of all intelligence levels can be responsive to hypnosis."
