Prior to beginning they read a list of Miranda rights to him on a form that the suspect had in front of him. After the reading, he initialed each paragraph indicating he understood. At the bottom of the form was an express written waiver of the Miranda rights, which he signed. He had been interrogated in the past and was familiar with the procedure. During the four hours of interrogation he was given bathroom breaks, coffee, and a sandwich. At the end of the process, he made a logical and seemingly cogent confession to all of the burglaries in a taped statement. The defendant later moved to suppress the confession, arguing that he was coming down from drugs at the time and was intellectually unable to understand and comprehend the nature of the warnings or the waiver. What is the most likely decision of the court under the totality of the circumstances?\n\nA. The outward signs all indicate that the suspect understood the procedure and gave a voluntary confession despite his disabilities.\nB. There are too many questionable deficiencies in the suspect's ability to understand what was going on and the confession must be suppressed.\nC. He was too confused to understand what was going on and the confession was coerced by the persistence of the police.\nD. The signing of a written waiver of Miranda rights is always proof that the suspect gave a voluntary confession.\n"

The outward signs all indicate that the suspect understood the procedure and gave a voluntary confession despite his disabilities.\n\nThis is because the suspect had previous experience with interrogations, was given regular breaks, food, and drink, and appeared to make a logical and cogent confession. Additionally, he initialed each paragraph of the Miranda rights and signed an express written waiver. These actions suggest that he understood the process and voluntarily waived his rights. However, the court would have to carefully consider the suspect's mental capacities and the claim that he was under the influence of drugs at the time, but based on the information provided, option A seems the most likely outcome. It's important to note that courts evaluate these situations on a case-by-case basis, taking into account all relevant factors."
