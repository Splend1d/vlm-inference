Cryptocurrencies, Expensive, Secure, Financial Crime\n\nCryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin are indeed becoming increasingly mainstream, and with their rise comes a myriad of ethical implications. One implication is that they can be quite expensive, both in terms of the energy consumption required for mining and the high transaction fees on some networks during periods of high demand. They are also often touted for their security features, such as decentralization and cryptographic security measures, which can protect users from certain types of fraud and theft. However, this same anonymity and lack of regulation can facilitate financial crimes, including money laundering, tax evasion, and illicit transactions."
