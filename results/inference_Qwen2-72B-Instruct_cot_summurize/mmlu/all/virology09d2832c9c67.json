                    "text": "The origins of Lassa and Ebola viruses are not definitively known, but here's what we do know:\n\nLassa virus: The natural reservoir for the Lassa virus is the multimammate rat (Mastomys natalensis). These rodents are common in West Africa and can carry the virus without getting sick. They shed the virus in their urine and droppings, and humans can get infected through contact with contaminated materials or direct contact with an infected rodent.\n\nEbola virus: The exact origin of the Ebola virus is not known, but it is believed that fruit bats (family Pteropodidae) are the most likely natural reservoir. These bats can carry the virus without showing symptoms and have been found to be infected with Ebola virus in several African countries. However, it is important to note that other animals, such as primates, may also play a role in the transmission of the virus to humans.\n\nSo, based on this information, the closest answer would be:\n\nLassa virus: Not listed among the options, but the correct answer would be \"rodents.\"\nEbola virus: C. Fruit bats (although other animals may also be involved in transmission).\n\nFor the sake of choosing from the given options, we could say that both viruses have been linked to animals, with Lassa specifically linked to rodents (not listed) and Ebola to fruit bats (option C)."
