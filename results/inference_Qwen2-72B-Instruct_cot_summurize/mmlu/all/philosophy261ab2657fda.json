Gauthier argues that rational individuals can reach an agreement on how to cooperate for mutual benefit, which leads to the development of moral norms. In this context, deliberative justification refers to the process by which rational agents can justify their actions based on mutual agreements rather than on traditional moral principles. Thus, once moral requirements emerge from this process of deliberation and agreement, they replace the need for individual deliberative justification. However, it's important to note that Gauthier's view does not necessarily refute or ignore morality; instead, it provides an alternative way of understanding its origins and justifications based on rational self-interest and cooperation. So, option B is the closest to Gauthier's position, but it should be understood within the context of his overall theory of morality as an agreement among rational agents."
