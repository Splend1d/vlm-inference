Critical Legal Studies\n\nThe Critical Legal Studies (CLS) movement argues that law is not neutral or objective but is instead a tool used by those in power to maintain their dominance. CLS scholars often view legal rules as arbitrary and argue that they can be used to perpetuate social, economic, and political inequalities. They contend that the law is not a fixed set of principles but is instead shaped by social forces and power dynamics. This perspective stands in contrast to more traditional legal theories that view the law as a stable and coherent system of rules."
