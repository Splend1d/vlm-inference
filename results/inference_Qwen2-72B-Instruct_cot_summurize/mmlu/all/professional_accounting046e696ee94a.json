Deviations from pertinent controls at a given rate ordinarily result in misstatements at a lower rate.\n\nIn assessing the tolerable rate of deviations for a test of controls, an auditor should consider that deviations from pertinent controls typically lead to misstatements in the accounting records, but these misstatements may occur at a lower rate than the deviations themselves. This is because not all control deviations will necessarily result in material misstatements, and some controls may compensate for others when they fail. However, a higher deviation rate generally indicates a higher risk of material misstatement, which could affect the auditor's assessment of control risk and the overall audit strategy. The other options provided are incorrect based on auditing standards and principles:\n\nA. Deviations from pertinent controls can and often do affect the risk of material misstatement in the accounting records, so this statement is false.\n\nC. When the degree of assurance desired in a sample is high, the auditor should allow for a lower level of sampling risk, not a high level. A high degree of assurance requires more precise results, which means less tolerance for sampling risk.\n\nD. Increasing the number of items selected for the test of controls does not usually increase the tolerable rate of deviations; rather, it can help reduce sampling risk and provide a more accurate estimate of the actual deviation rate."
