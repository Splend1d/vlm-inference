The superego is the part of the psyche that acts as a moral conscience, embodying the ideals and values the individual has internalized from society and culture. It often urges the individual to act altruistically, selflessly, and in accordance with societal norms and ethical standards. In this case, the angel's advice to give the money to the homeless man aligns with the superego's role in promoting moral and socially responsible behavior."
