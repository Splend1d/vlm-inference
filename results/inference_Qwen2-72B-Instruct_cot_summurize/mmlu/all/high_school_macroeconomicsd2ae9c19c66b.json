The GDP deflator incorporates current year quantities in its calculations, whereas the Consumer Price Index (CPI) uses a fixed basket of goods and services. This means that the GDP deflator can reflect changes in the composition of the economy's output over time, while the CPI measures price changes for a constant set of goods and services."
