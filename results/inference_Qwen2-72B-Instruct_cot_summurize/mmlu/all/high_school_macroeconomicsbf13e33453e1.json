This scenario is most closely associated with:\n\nA. a leftward shift in the aggregate supply curve.\n\nThis shift can occur due to various factors such as an increase in input costs (like oil prices), negative supply shocks, or other disruptions that make it more expensive for producers to create goods and services, leading to higher prices and reduced output. The resulting stagflation is a period where inflation is high (due to the higher prices), but economic activity is weak (due to reduced output), which can also lead to higher unemployment."
