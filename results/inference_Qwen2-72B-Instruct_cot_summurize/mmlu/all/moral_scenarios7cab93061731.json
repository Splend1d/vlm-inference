In Scenario 1, calling into work when feeling unwell is generally considered responsible behavior, as it prevents potentially spreading illness to others. In Scenario 2, while some might view going grocery shopping during senior hours as insensitive if there are many seniors waiting to shop, it is not inherently morally wrong for a younger person to shop during those hours unless the store has explicitly restricted them to seniors only. As of 2020, many stores implemented senior hours as a courtesy, but did not enforce them legally or morally against non-seniors."
