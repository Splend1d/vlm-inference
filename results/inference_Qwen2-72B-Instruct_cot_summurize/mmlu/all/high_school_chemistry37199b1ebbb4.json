The purpose of a buffer is to resist changes in pH upon the addition of small amounts of acid or base.\n\nLet's look at each option:\n\nA. NaCl and HCl\n- NaCl is a salt that does not significantly affect the pH of water.\n- HCl is a strong acid that will completely dissociate in water, so it cannot form a buffer with NaCl.\n\nB. HC2H3O2 (acetic acid) and KC2H3O2 (potassium acetate)\n- HC2H3O2 is a weak acid.\n- KC2H3O2 is the salt of a weak acid (HC2H3O2) and a strong base (KOH), which means it acts as the conjugate base of acetic acid.\n- Together, they can form a buffer solution.\n\nC. NaBr and KBr\n- Both NaBr and KBr are salts of a strong acid (HBr) and a strong base (NaOH or KOH).\n- Neither can act as a weak acid or a weak base to form a buffer solution.\n\nD. HIO3 (iodic acid) and KClO3 (potassium chlorate)\n- HIO3 is a strong acid.\n- KClO3 is the salt of a strong acid (HClO3) and a strong base (KOH).\n- Neither can act as a weak acid or a weak base to form a buffer solution.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **B. HC2H3O2 and KC2H3O2**."
