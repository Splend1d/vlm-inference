The building was called a \"twin\" home, i.e., it was divided into two separate residential units. However, the front entrance was located entirely on one of the lots; there was a door through the party wall that the occupants of the adjoining residence used to access their home. Owner sold the lot on which the stairway was located to the buyer, and owner continued to reside in the remaining part of the building. The deed did not contain a reservation of a right to use the doorway. The parties later disputed whether owner could continue to use the entrance that was located on the lot that he sold. What will a court most appropriately decide regarding the rights of the disputing parties?\n\nA. The owner retained an implied right to an exclusive license by necessity to use the doorway.\nB. The buyer can prevent access to owner because the deed was defective in not reserving a right to use the doorway.\nC. The court will automatically order a new deed be drafted containing court-ordered language that includes a reservation of rights.\nD. The court will conclude that an implied easement is created by law for the benefit of owner to use the doorway.\n"

The court will conclude that an implied easement is created by law for the benefit of owner to use the doorway.\n\nIn this scenario, the owner has been using the doorway as a necessary means of access to their residence. When the property was divided and sold, the deed did not explicitly reserve a right to use the doorway, but the necessity of such access may lead a court to imply an easement by necessity or an easement appurtenant. An easement by necessity arises when a landlocked parcel needs access to a public road, but an easement appurtenant can also be implied where there is a continuing need for access between two previously unified parcels that have been severed. Given that the owner's residence would be effectively inaccessible without the use of the doorway, a court is likely to find that an implied easement exists for the benefit of the owner to continue using the doorway."
