All of the above were among the causes.\n\nThe food-price spike of 2007-2008 was caused by a combination of factors including long-term neglect of agricultural and rural development, which led to reduced productivity and supply constraints; the increased use of food crops for biofuel production, which diverted crops away from food markets; and speculative investment in commodities, which drove up prices in futures markets. Other contributing factors included poor weather conditions, high energy prices, and rising demand from emerging economies."
