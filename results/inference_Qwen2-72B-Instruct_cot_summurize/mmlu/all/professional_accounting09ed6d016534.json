According to the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) rules and regulations, members of an issuer's audit committee may not accept any consulting, advisory, or other compensatory fee from the registrant for services other than as a member of the board. This rule is designed to ensure that audit committee members remain independent and unbiased in their oversight role.\n\nHere's a brief explanation of the other options:\n\nA. Establish procedures for employees to anonymously report fraud: Audit committees are encouraged to establish procedures for the receipt, retention, and treatment of complaints received by the issuer regarding accounting, internal accounting controls, or auditing matters, including procedures for the confidential, anonymous submission by employees of concerns about questionable accounting or auditing matters.\n\nB. Be responsible for the compensation of any registered public accounting firm employed by the registrant to provide an audit report: The audit committee does have the responsibility to pre-approve all audit and non-audit services provided by the independent auditor and is typically involved in determining the compensation of the auditor. However, this involvement does not disqualify them from serving on the audit committee.\n\nD. Engage independent counsel as deemed necessary to carry out their duties: Audit committees are allowed to engage independent counsel and other advisors as they deem necessary to carry out their responsibilities. This is considered a best practice for ensuring the independence and effectiveness of the audit committee."
