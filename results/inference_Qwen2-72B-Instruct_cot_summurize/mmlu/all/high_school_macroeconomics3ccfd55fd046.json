Workers may voluntarily leave their jobs to seek better opportunities, relocate, or change careers, leading to temporary periods of unemployment. This type of unemployment is not necessarily a sign of economic weakness but rather a reflection of the dynamic nature of the labor market. Even when the economy is strong, there will still be some level of frictional unemployment."
