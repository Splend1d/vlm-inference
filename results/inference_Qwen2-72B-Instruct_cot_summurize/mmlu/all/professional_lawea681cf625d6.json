In this case, the most appropriate remedy would be:\n\nC. Specific performance.\n\nHowever, specific performance is typically granted when monetary damages are inadequate, such as in cases involving unique items or real estate. For a used car, which is not necessarily unique, the court may instead award damages. Therefore, if specific performance is not granted, the next best option would be:\n\nA. Damages measured by the difference between the market price and the contract price for the car.\n\nThis is known as \"expectation damages,\" which aim to compensate the non-breaching party for the loss of the bargain. It should be noted that without more context, it's difficult to determine whether specific performance would be granted or not. In many jurisdictions, for a used car, the courts would likely award expectation damages rather than specific performance."
