Symptoms may include diarrhea, vomiting, fever, and abdominal pain. Astrovirus infection is usually self-limiting and mild, but it can lead to more serious dehydration in infants and young children. The other options listed (acute pneumonia, hepatitis, and rashes) are not typical symptoms associated with astrovirus infection."
