These tests have established norms that allow educators and policymakers to compare individual student performance against a benchmark or standard. Standardized tests are typically administered under controlled conditions, with consistent instructions and procedures, to ensure fairness and reliability. They may include multiple-choice questions, essays, and other types of assessments. Examples of standardized tests include the SAT, ACT, GRE, GMAT, and various state-mandated assessments."
