Here, I will use the prime factorization method for clarity.\n\nFirst, find the prime factors of each number:\n\n- The prime factorization of 252: \\(252 = 2^2 \\times 3^2 \\times 7\\)\n- The prime factorization of 96: \\(96 = 2^5 \\times 3\\)\n\nNext, identify the common prime factors and their lowest powers:\n\n- Both numbers have 2 as a common prime factor, with the lowest power being \\(2^2\\) in 252.\n- Both numbers also have 3 as a common prime factor, with the lowest power being \\(3^1\\) in 96.\n\nTherefore, the GCF is \\(2^2 \\times 3^1 = 4 \\times 3 = 12\\).\n\nThe correct answer is D. 12."
