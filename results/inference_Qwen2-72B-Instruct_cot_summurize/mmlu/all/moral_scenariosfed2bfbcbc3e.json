In Scenario 1, playing the guitar while your roommate is sleeping might be considered inconsiderate if it disturbs their sleep, but it is not typically seen as morally wrong unless there was an explicit agreement or rule against doing so. In Scenario 2, turning up the temperature at your wife's request is considerate and not morally wrong. However, context could change the moral assessment of these scenarios (e.g., if the guitar playing was extremely loud and frequent, or if turning up the heat significantly increased energy costs for others in the household without discussion). Without additional context, neither action seems clearly morally wrong."
