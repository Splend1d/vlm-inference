                    "text": "A teenage girl was babysitting a two-year-old baby. She took the baby in a stroller to the public park, as she often did. On this day, she negligently \"nodded off\" for just a few seconds on a park bench with the stroller next to her. She felt some movement and snapped awake to see a man taking the baby from the stroller. The man was large and menacing-looking. The babysitter, who is thin and petite, froze and did not put up a struggle as the man stated, \"I will kill you if you move.\" The babysitter did scream and call for help as the kidnapper fled with the child. Within a few yards he tripped and dropped the baby on its head. The baby died at the hospital of massive head injuries. Is it probable that the prosecutor will charge the babysitter with a crime, and if so, what will be the charge?\n\nA. Yes, this is felony murder in that the babysitter's unacceptable behavior was committed during the commission of the kidnapping felony.\nB. No, the babysitter did not commit a criminal act under the circumstances \u0080\u0094 her negligence was not gross enough to rise to the level of criminality and she had no criminal intent.\nC. No, because she did not do anything wrong in dozing off and she had no duty to protect the baby at the expense of her own life.\nD. Yes, she would be charged with negligent homicide because it was foreseeable that if she fell asleep for even just a few seconds, the baby would likely be kidnapped and killed.\n"

While the question seems to imply a straightforward answer based on the given options, the reality is that the legal outcome could depend on various factors, including the specific laws of the jurisdiction where the incident occurred.\n\nHowever, based on the information provided:\n\n**Option A: Felony Murder** - This option is not applicable because the babysitter was not committing a felony at the time of the incident. Felony murder applies when someone dies during the commission or attempted commission of a felony by the defendant. In this case, the babysitter was not committing a felony; she was merely negligent.\n\n**Option B: No Criminal Act** - This option suggests that the babysitter's negligence did not reach a level of criminality. Whether this is true depends on the jurisdiction's standards for criminal negligence. Some places might hold that a babysitter has a heightened duty of care for the safety of the child and that falling asleep while responsible for a child could meet the threshold for criminal negligence.\n\n**Option C: No Duty to Sacrifice Her Life** - This option addresses the babysitter's response to the kidnapper's threat. It is generally true that one is not legally obligated to sacrifice their life to prevent a crime. However, this does not address the initial negligence in falling asleep.\n\n**Option D: Negligent Homicide** - This is a possible charge depending on how the law defines negligent homicide. If the jurisdiction holds that a person can be held criminally liable for failing to exercise reasonable care, which results in death, then the babysitter might be charged with negligent homicide. The foreseeability of harm is a key factor here, but whether the babysitter could have reasonably foreseen that falling asleep for a few seconds would result in the baby's death is debatable.\n\nGiven these considerations, **Option D** (Negligent Homicide) is the most plausible charge that the prosecutor might consider, based on the information provided. However, it is crucial to note that the actual decision to charge and the specific charge would depend on a thorough investigation and the interpretation of local laws by the prosecutor."
