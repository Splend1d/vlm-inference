These symptoms may include nervousness, irritability, restlessness, difficulty sleeping, increased heart rate, and tremors. While Addison's disease (option C) can also cause some anxiety-like symptoms, such as fatigue and muscle weakness, it is less likely to produce classic anxiety symptoms compared to hyperthyroidism. Options A and B do not typically result in anxiety-like symptoms."
