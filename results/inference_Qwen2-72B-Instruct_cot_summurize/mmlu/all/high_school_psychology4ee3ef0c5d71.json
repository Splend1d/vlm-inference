Incentive theory suggests that people are motivated to behave in certain ways because of external rewards or incentives. In this case, Al's mother is providing an external reward (money) as an incentive for Al to earn good grades (As and Bs) on his school tests and projects.\n\nCannon-Bard theory deals with emotions and their relation to physiological responses and is not related to motivation.\nInstinct theory suggests that behaviors are innate and not learned, which does not apply to this scenario.\nDrive reduction theory suggests that people are motivated by the need to reduce internal drives or tensions caused by unmet needs, such as hunger or thirst. While it might be argued that Al has a \"need\" for money, this theory is less directly applicable than incentive theory in this context."
