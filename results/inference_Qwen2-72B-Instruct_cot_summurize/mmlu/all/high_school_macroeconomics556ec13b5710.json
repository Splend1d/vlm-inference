This can lead to an increase in demand for the country's goods, thus increasing exports. Conversely, imports become more expensive, which might reduce their demand. Depreciation of the dollar would make American products cheaper for international buyers and could potentially decrease the trade deficit if the increase in exports outpaces the cost increase for imports. However, options A, B, and D could also be influenced by depreciation but they are less directly affected compared to option C."
