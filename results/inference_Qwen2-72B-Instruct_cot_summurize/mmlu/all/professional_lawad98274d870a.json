After six months, the owner gave the woman a written option to purchase the condo for $100,000 before the expiration of the lease. With the owner's approval, the woman spent $10,000 to have the kitchen remodeled to her personal specifications. One month before the end of the lease, the owner notified the woman that he was revoking the option to purchase the condo. One week later, the woman delivered a written notice of acceptance of the option, but the owner refused to sell. If the woman initiates suit for breach of contract, which of the following is her strongest argument that an enforceable contract was formed between her and the owner?\n\nA. Because the woman had until the expiration of the lease to accept the offer, the owner's revocation would be ineffective.\nB. Because the owner was a merchant, the written offer was irrevocable for a period not exceeding three months.\nC. Because the owner's offer invited a return promise as acceptance, the woman manifested her intent to accept by remodeling the kitchen.\nD. After the woman paid to have the kitchen remodeled, an option contract resulted, because the owner knew the woman was relying on the offer to her detriment.\n"

After the woman paid to have the kitchen remodeled, an option contract resulted, because the owner knew the woman was relying on the offer to her detriment.\n\nThis argument is based on the concept of reliance or promissory estoppel, which holds that if one party reasonably relies on a promise to their detriment, the promisor may be bound by that promise even in the absence of consideration. In this case, the woman relied on the owner's offer by spending $10,000 to remodel the kitchen, which indicates she intended to exercise the option to purchase. This reliance can support her claim that an enforceable contract was formed despite the owner's attempt to revoke the option."
