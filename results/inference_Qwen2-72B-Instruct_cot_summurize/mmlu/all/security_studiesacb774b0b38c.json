The term refers to a set of formal or informal principles to which governmental actors subscribe in their decision-making on a particular subject.\n\nIn the context of liberalism, an international regime is understood as a framework of rules, norms, procedures, and institutions that govern specific areas of international relations. These regimes help facilitate cooperation among states by providing predictability and stability in their interactions, particularly in areas such as trade, security, human rights, and environmental protection. They are not necessarily formal organizations but can be more diffuse systems of governance that emerge from state practices and agreements."
