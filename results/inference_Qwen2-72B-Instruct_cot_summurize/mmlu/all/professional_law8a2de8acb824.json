The widow was unaware of the certificate agreement until after the employee died.\nB. There was no privity of contract between the widow and the hotel.\nC.

There was insufficient consideration to support the certificate agreement.\n\nExplanation: Consideration refers to something of value that is exchanged between parties in a contract. For a contract to be legally binding, there must be consideration from both sides. In this case, the hotel provided the promise to pay $5,000 upon the employee's death as long as he was still employed by the hotel. However, it is unclear whether the employee provided any new consideration for this promise. The employee's past service cannot serve as consideration for a new promise because it has already been compensated by the hotel. If the employee did not provide any additional consideration, such as agreeing to continue employment for a certain period or performing additional duties, then the agreement may be considered gratuitous and unenforceable due to lack of consideration."
