Treaties do not have to assume a particular form or be designated as such. \n\nAccording to international law, a treaty does not need to follow a specific form; it can be written or oral. However, most treaties are written to ensure clarity and to avoid misunderstandings. Moreover, while the term \"treaty\" is commonly used, agreements between states may also take other forms, such as conventions, protocols, covenants, declarations, accords, or exchanges of letters. What matters most is the intention of the parties to create legal obligations, regardless of the terminology or form used."
