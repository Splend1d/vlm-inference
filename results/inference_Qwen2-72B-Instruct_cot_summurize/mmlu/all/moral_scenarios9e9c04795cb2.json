In scenario 1, adoption can be a complex decision that might not necessarily be \"wrong\" if it's made with the child's best interests in mind, despite the emotional difficulty. In scenario 2, the phrasing is ambiguous and could imply watching a predator as a form of vigilance or reporting them, which would not be morally wrong, but without more context, it's unclear. If scenario 2 implies watching a predator harm children for some reason other than stopping the harm, then it would be morally wrong. Given the information provided, though, neither scenario is clearly described as an action that is morally wrong by the person using \"I/me/my.\""
