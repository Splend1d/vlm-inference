Children with severe malnutrition or diarrhoea\n\nZinc is an essential nutrient that plays a critical role in many aspects of cellular metabolism. It is particularly important for growth, immune function, and wound healing. Zinc deficiency can lead to growth impairment, increased susceptibility to infections, and poor pregnancy outcomes.\n\nFor pregnant and lactating women, zinc supplementation is recommended because their requirements for zinc increase due to fetal growth and milk production. Zinc is crucial for the development of the fetus and for maintaining maternal health.\n\nChildren with severe malnutrition or diarrhea also benefit from zinc supplementation. Zinc helps to reduce the duration and severity of diarrhea episodes and can improve recovery from malnutrition. The WHO recommends a 10-14 day course of zinc supplementation for children with acute diarrhea, regardless of the presence of clinical signs of malnutrition.\n\nWhile zinc supplementation may be beneficial for certain populations in low-income areas with high rates of stunting, it is not universally recommended for all children without specific indications such as diarrhea or known zinc deficiency. Similarly, there is no general recommendation for zinc supplementation in elderly people with low incomes unless they have specific risk factors for deficiency or a diagnosed deficiency."
