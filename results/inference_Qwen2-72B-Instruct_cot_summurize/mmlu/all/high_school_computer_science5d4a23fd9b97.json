The conclusion is incorrect; using the test case [0, 1, 4, 5] is not sufficient to conclude the program is correct.\nD.

The conclusion is incorrect; using the test case [0, 1, 4, 5] is not sufficient to conclude the program is correct. \n\nThe reason is that the program has an error in the first line where it initializes the variable \"sum\" with the second element of the list (numList[1]) instead of zero. This means that if the list has fewer than two elements or if the second element is not zero, the program will produce an incorrect result. Therefore, additional test cases should be used to verify the correctness of the program."
