                    "text": "The amount of solar radiation received by a planet decreases with the square of its distance from the Sun. This relationship is known as the inverse square law. Since Jupiter's orbital distance is 5 AU, which is 5 times farther than Earth's distance from the Sun (1 AU), the solar flux at Jupiter's distance is \\(\\frac{1}{5^2} = \\frac{1}{25}\\) of what it is at Earth's distance.\n\nTo find out how much brighter the Sun would need to be to compensate for this difference and provide the same solar flux at Jupiter's distance as Earth receives, we set up the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Solar Flux at Earth} = \\text{Solar Flux at Jupiter} \\times \\text{Brightness Factor}\n\\]\n\nGiven that the solar flux at Earth is 1380 W/m\u00b2 and the solar flux at Jupiter is \\(\\frac{1}{25}\\) of that, we can solve for the brightness factor:\n\n\\[\n1380 = \\left(1380 \\times \\frac{1}{25}\\right) \\times \\text{Brightness Factor}\n\\]\n\nSolving for the Brightness Factor gives us:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Brightness Factor} = 25\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the Sun would have to be 25 times brighter for Europa to receive the same solar flux that we currently receive on Earth. The correct answer is B. 25 times brighter."
