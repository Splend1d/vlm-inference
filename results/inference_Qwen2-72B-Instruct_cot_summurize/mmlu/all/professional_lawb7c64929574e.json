Congress has enacted the statute solely for the purpose of enabling members of Congress to travel back and forth to the Capital without being tied up in heavy traffic each day. Before Congress enacted this law, the Washington, D. C. , City Council had previously passed an ordinance designating Pennsylvania Avenue as a two-lane street. Which of the following is the most accurate statement regarding the constitutionality of the federal statute designating Pennsylvania Avenue a one-way street?\n\nA. It is valid because Congress has exclusive power over the District of Columbia.\nB. It is valid because it is a proper exercise of Congress's enumerated property power.\nC. It is invalid because the Washington, D. C. , City Council has exclusive power over the public thoroughfares within the District of Columbia.\nD. It is invalid because it is a discriminatory burden on interstate commerce.\n"

It is valid because Congress has exclusive power over the District of Columbia.\n\nUnder Article I, Section 8, Clause 17 of the U.S. Constitution, Congress has the power to \"exercise exclusive Legislation in all Cases whatsoever, over such District (not exceeding ten Miles square) as may, by Cession of particular States, and the Acceptance of Congress, become the Seat of the Government of the United States.\" This clause gives Congress broad authority over the District of Columbia, including the power to legislate on matters concerning its streets and thoroughfares.\n\nWhile the Washington, D.C., City Council does have some degree of local governance, ultimate authority rests with Congress, which can enact laws that supersede those of the city council when exercising its constitutional powers. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.\n\nOption B could also be considered partially correct, as Congress's power to regulate property it owns or controls is an enumerated power. However, option A more directly addresses the issue at hand, which is Congress's authority over the District of Columbia itself.\n\nOptions C and D are incorrect because they do not accurately reflect the constitutional framework that grants Congress supreme legislative authority over the District of Columbia."
