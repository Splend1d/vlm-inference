Institutional constraints and resource constraints (option A) can limit what actions are possible. Information and time horizon (option B) affect how decisions are made and what outcomes can be anticipated. Vectors of economic incentives (option D) describe the motivations for economic behavior. In contrast, \"Goals\" is not a constraint or factor but rather the desired outcome that decision-makers aim to achieve. While goals are important in guiding economic decisions, they are not a type of constraint or incentive in the same way as the other options."
