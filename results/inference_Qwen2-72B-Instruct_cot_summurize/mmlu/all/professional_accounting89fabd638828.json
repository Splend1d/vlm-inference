July.\n\nAccording to the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), lease expenses for operating leases should be recognized over the term of the lease on a straight-line basis. However, the lease expense should only begin once the company starts benefiting from the use of the leased asset, which is typically when the lease commencement date occurs or when the lessor makes the asset available for use by the lessee.\n\nIn this case, although the company received control of the property on January 1, it did not start benefiting from its use until the staff moved in on May 1. However, the monthly rental payments do not begin until July 1. Therefore, the recognition of rental expense for the new offices should begin in July when the payments actually commence. Prior to that, any costs incurred for leasehold improvements would be capitalized as an asset and amortized over the useful life of the improvements or the lease term, whichever is shorter."
