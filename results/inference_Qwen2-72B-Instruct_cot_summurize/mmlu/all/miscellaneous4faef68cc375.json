Nebular hypothesis\n\nThis theory, also known as the nebula theory or solar nebular disk model (SNDM), suggests that the solar system formed from a large, rotating cloud of gas and dust, called a solar nebula, about 4.6 billion years ago. This process led to the formation of the Sun and the planets, as well as other objects in the solar system."
