The delegation's goal was twofold: to study the problem and to formulate regulations in a bilateral agreement that would protect the endangered species and provide for a permanent commission that would continually monitor enforcement of the proposed regulations. After compiling their findings and drafting the necessary regulations, the President and the leader of the foreign government entered into a treaty to form a permanent commission to oversee the problem and to grant it the necessary enforcement powers. The validity of this treaty would most likely be upheld under which of the following principles?\n\nA. The presidential power to conduct foreign affairs.\nB. An ancillary power of the President under his treaty-making power.\nC. The treaty-making power, but only if the treaty is ratified by two-thirds of the Senate.\nD. The treaty-making power, but only if the treaty is ratified by a majority in Congress.\n"

This is the constitutional process for the ratification of treaties, ensuring that the executive and legislative branches both have a role in the treaty-making process."
