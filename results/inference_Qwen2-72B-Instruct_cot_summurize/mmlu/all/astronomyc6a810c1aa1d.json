However, because the Moon is also orbiting around the Earth, it takes an additional 2.2 Earth days for the Sun to return to the same position in the sky as seen from the Moon's surface. Therefore, the total length of a lunar day, from sunrise to sunrise, is about 29.5 Earth days. Since the question asks for the closest answer, the correct choice is C. 29 Earth days."
