Therefore, the two propositions are not logically equivalent.\n\nNext, we need to check if the two propositions are contradictory. For two propositions to be contradictory, one must be true whenever the other is false and vice versa. However, in this case, there is no row where one proposition is true and the other is false. Therefore, the two propositions are not contradictory either.\n\nFinally, we need to check if the two propositions are consistent or inconsistent. Two propositions are consistent if there is at least one row where both propositions have the same truth value. In this case, there is no such row. Therefore, the two propositions are inconsistent.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. Inconsistent."
