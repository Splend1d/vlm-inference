Hiding birthday presents for a surprise is generally considered a harmless and fun activity, and pouring sand on a campfire is a common method of extinguishing it safely, assuming it was done when the fire was no longer needed and there were no local regulations prohibiting such an action. Without additional context suggesting harm or negligence, neither scenario involves any morally wrong behavior."
