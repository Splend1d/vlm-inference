Near the end of the flight, the pilot saw a cloud of fog ahead but decided that he could navigate through it. He got lost in the fog and crashed the plane into the side of a mountain. The pilot and his passenger were both killed instantly in the crash. If the passenger's family brings a wrongful death action against the pilot's estate, the most likely result is that the plaintiffs will\n\nA. recover under strict liability, because the pilot engaged in an abnormally dangerous activity.\nB. recover under negligence, because the pilot failed to exercise reasonable care in the operation of his airplane.\nC. not recover, because the passenger did not pay to go on the flight.\nD. not recover, because the passenger unreasonably exposed himself to a known danger.\n"

This breach could be considered negligent if it is determined that a reasonable person in the pilot's position would have taken different actions under similar circumstances. The fact that the pilot and passenger were both killed as a direct result of this breach supports a claim of wrongful death due to negligence.\n\nIt's important to note that while strict liability (option A) may apply in some cases involving abnormally dangerous activities, flying an airplane is typically not considered such an activity unless there are specific circumstances that make it unusually hazardous. Additionally, options C and D are not valid defenses in a wrongful death action; the fact that the passenger did not pay for the flight or was aware of some level of risk does not absolve the pilot of his responsibility to operate the aircraft safely."
