This is known as the problem of circular reasoning, where the argument relies on its own premise for validation. In this case, if our only source of knowledge is our internal perspective, then any attempt to validate that perspective using that same perspective would be circular and therefore invalid. This is why we often rely on external perspectives, such as scientific research or other people's experiences, to help us evaluate the validity of our own internal perspectives. However, even these external perspectives may not necessarily be objective or true, as they too can be influenced by subjective biases and limitations. Ultimately, the question of whether our own perspective is useful, true, or valuable may remain uncertain and subject to ongoing inquiry and evaluation."
