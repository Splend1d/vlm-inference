However, it's important to note that she was not the wife of a sitting president at the time; her husband, Franklin D. Roosevelt, had died in 1945. Nonetheless, she remains the only former First Lady to have ever run for elected office. However, Hillary Clinton, who is also listed as an option, has run for and held political office, including serving as a U.S. Senator from New York and as Secretary of State, although she was not the First Lady at the time of those elections."
