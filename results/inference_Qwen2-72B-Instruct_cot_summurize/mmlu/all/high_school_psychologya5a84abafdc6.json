When this process is blocked or thwarted, it can lead to psychological distress and disorders. They emphasize the importance of fulfilling basic needs such as love, acceptance, and self-esteem in order to achieve mental health. This perspective contrasts with other approaches that might focus on biological factors (A), cognitive distortions (B), or classical/operant conditioning (C)."
