We of the Progressive party here dedicate ourselves to the fulfillment of the duty laid upon us by our fathers to maintain the government of the people, by the people and for the people whose foundations they laid. We hold with Thomas Jefferson and Abraham Lincoln that the people are the masters of their Constitution, to fulfill its purposes and to safeguard it from those who, by perversion of its intent, would convert it into an instrument of injustice. In accordance with the needs of each generation the people must use their sovereign powers to establish and maintain equal opportunity and industrial justice, to secure which this Government was founded and without which no republic can endure.\n\"This country belongs to the people who inhabit it. Its resources, its business, its institutions and its laws should be utilized, maintained or altered in whatever manner will best promote the general interest. It is time to set the public welfare in the first place.\"\nProgressive Party Platform, 1912\nIn harmony with the sentiments of the excerpt above, which of the following best characterizes the \"Square Deal\" of Theodore Roosevelt?\n\nA. Conservation, trust-busting, consumer protection\nB. Protective tariffs, centralized banking, conservation\nC. Equal opportunity, women's suffrage, laissez-faire economics\nD. Laissez-faire economics, support of labor unions, conservation\n"

Among the options provided, choice A (Conservation, trust-busting, consumer protection) best characterizes the key aspects of Roosevelt's Square Deal.\n\nRoosevelt was a strong advocate for conservation, famously protecting vast areas of land under the Antiquities Act and establishing numerous national parks, forests, and monuments. Trust-busting, or the breaking up of monopolies and large trusts, was another significant component of his policy agenda, aimed at ensuring fair competition and preventing corporate abuses. Consumer protection also falls under the umbrella of the Square Deal, as Roosevelt supported measures to ensure the safety and efficacy of food and drugs, culminating in the passage of the Pure Food and Drug Act and the Meat Inspection Act.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Conservation, trust-busting, consumer protection"
