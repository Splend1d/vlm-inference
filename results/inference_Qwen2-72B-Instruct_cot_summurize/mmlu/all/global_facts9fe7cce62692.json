Unfortunately, I don't have access to such specific historical survey data. However, I can tell you that there has been significant debate and controversy over the use of algorithms in criminal justice, with concerns raised about bias, fairness, and transparency. According to a Pew Research Center survey conducted in 2019, about 60% of U.S. adults said that computer programs should not be used to make decisions about sentencing or parole. This is close to option C, which suggests that 56% of U.S. adults may have held this view in 2018. So, the closest answer choice would be:\n\nC. 56%"
