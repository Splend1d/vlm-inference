This increased demand shifts the demand curve to the right. In a competitive market, this rightward shift of the demand curve leads to a new equilibrium point where both the equilibrium price and the equilibrium quantity are higher than before.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Increase the equilibrium quantity and increase the price."
