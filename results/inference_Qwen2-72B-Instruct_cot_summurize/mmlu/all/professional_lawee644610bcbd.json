The plaintiff's father commences this action as a parent in his own right and on behalf of his son. At trial, the plaintiff's attorney called the only witness to the accident, the plaintiff's friend, aged seven. The friend was four years of age at the time of the accident. It was determined that the friend lacked the capacity to perceive and relate the accident at the time it actually occurred. The court should rule that the friend would be\n\nA. competent to testify, because he had personal knowledge of the accident.\nB. competent to testify, because a seven-year-old is presumed to be chronologically mature.\nC. incompetent, because he lacked the capacity to perceive and relate the accident at the time of its occurrence.\nD. incompetent, because all children under the age of 10 are deemed incompetent to testify.\n"

In this case, since the child witness is determined to have lacked the capacity to perceive and relate the accident when it happened, they would be deemed incompetent to testify about the event. Age alone is not determinative; the focus is on the individual's ability to observe, recall, and communicate the events in question."
