After emitting one alpha particle, the atomic number of the element would be reduced by 2.\n\nA beta particle emission increases the atomic number by 1 because a neutron is converted into a proton and an electron (beta particle) during this process. Since there are two consecutive beta particle emissions, the atomic number would increase by 2.\n\nTherefore, the net change in the atomic number after these emissions would be:\n\nInitial change due to alpha emission: -2\nChange due to first beta emission: +1\nChange due to second beta emission: +1\n\nNet change: -2 + 1 + 1 = 0\n\nSo the correct answer is A. zero."
