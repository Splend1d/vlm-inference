The school psychologist has worked with the boy and knows him well. Anthony has a mild learning disability and receives academic support. He is doing well on a daily basis but has difficulty performing on tests. The school psychologist discusses ways in which Ms. Harcar could incorporate study-skills training into classroom activities. With regard to study-skills training, the school psychologist should stress which of the following principles while advising Ms. Harcar?\n\nA. The study skills of students with disabilities are improved when they are given a single, specific study strategy to follow for all subjects.\nB. Students with disabilities often develop study skills on their own and need only some guidance and reinforcement by the teacher.\nC. Training in study skills needs to include helping students to guide their own thinking to organize their own study behaviors and to use varied study approaches.\nD. Study strategies are best taught in a small group by having students practice collaborative problem-solving activities modeled by the teacher.\n"

This principle emphasizes the importance of fostering self-regulation and adaptability in students' study habits, which is crucial for students like Anthony who may struggle with testing situations despite their day-to-day academic success. By guiding students to think critically about their own learning processes and encouraging them to experiment with different strategies, teachers can help these students become more independent and effective learners. This approach also acknowledges that what works for one subject or type of material might not work for another, promoting flexibility in study methods."
