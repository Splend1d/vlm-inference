Differences in weight\n\nWeight can vary significantly among different age groups, but it is also heavily influenced by factors such as diet, exercise, and cultural norms, which can differ between cohorts (groups of people who experienced the same events or trends at the same stage of life). For example, differences in dietary habits and physical activity levels across generations can lead to cohort differences in weight that are not necessarily related to aging.\n\nIn contrast, options B, C, and D are generally associated with biological changes that occur with age:\n\nB. Shrinkage of the thymus gland is a normal part of the aging process, where the thymus shrinks and is replaced by fat tissue.\nC. Enlargement of the heart can occur with age due to conditions like hypertension or other cardiovascular diseases.\nD. The size of the nose and ears can increase with age because the cartilage in these areas continues to grow throughout life."
