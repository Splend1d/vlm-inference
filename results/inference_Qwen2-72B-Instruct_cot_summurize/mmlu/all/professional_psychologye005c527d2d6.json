While the past can be relevant, it is typically viewed through the lens of how it affects the person's present functioning and awareness. The focus is on what is happening now, rather than delving into historical events unless they have a clear connection to the client's current issues. However, this does not mean that talking about the past is always seen as avoidance; it can also be a part of the therapeutic process when it helps the client gain insight into their present situation. But in general, Gestalt therapists encourage clients to focus on the here and now."
