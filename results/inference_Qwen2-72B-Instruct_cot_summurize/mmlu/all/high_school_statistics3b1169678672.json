A smaller confidence level means a smaller \\(Z\\) value, which leads to a smaller margin of error.\n\nII. A smaller sample standard deviation (\\(\\sigma\\)) directly results in a smaller margin of error.\n\nIII. A smaller sample size (\\(n\\)) actually increases the margin of error because it is in the denominator of the fraction, so this would not result in a smaller margin of error.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB.
