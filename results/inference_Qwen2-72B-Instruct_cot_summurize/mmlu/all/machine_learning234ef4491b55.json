VGGNets use 3x3 convolutional kernels throughout the network, which are smaller than the 11x11 kernels used in the first layer of AlexNet.\n\nStatement 2 is also true. Data-dependent weight initialization procedures, such as Xavier/Glorot initialization (2010) and He initialization (2015), were introduced before the introduction of Batch Normalization in 2015. These initialization methods take into account the distribution of inputs to help stabilize the learning process, making them data-dependent."
