Group polarization refers to the tendency for people to adopt more extreme positions after discussing an issue with like-minded others. This occurs because people tend to feel more confident in their beliefs when they see that others share them, leading to a reinforcement of those beliefs.\n\nIn contrast, when people discuss issues with those who hold different views, they often experience cognitive dissonance, which can lead to a softening of their positions as they consider alternative perspectives.\n\nGiven these dynamics, we would expect that:\n\n- Group A, whose members all initially oppose the death penalty, would likely become more firmly entrenched in their opposition after discussing the issue together. This is because they will reinforce each other's views and may even find new arguments to support their position.\n  \n- Group B, which has members on both sides of the issue, would likely moderate their positions. This is because members will be exposed to opposing viewpoints, which can lead to a softening of their initial positions as they consider the merits of the other side's arguments.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C: Group A would become more firmly entrenched, while Group B members would moderate their positions."
