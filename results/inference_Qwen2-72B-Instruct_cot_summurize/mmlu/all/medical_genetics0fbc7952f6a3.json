This can result in an individual with mixed genetic material. Mosaicism, on the other hand, refers to a condition where there are multiple genetically distinct cell populations in an individual derived from a single zygote due to post-zygotic mutations or chromosomal abnormalities. Diploidy is the state of having two sets of chromosomes, and aneuploidy refers to an abnormal number of chromosomes."
