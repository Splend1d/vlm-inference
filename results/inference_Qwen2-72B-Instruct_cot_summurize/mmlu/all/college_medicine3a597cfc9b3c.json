Blastocyst, corpus luteum maintenance.\n\nHuman chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is a hormone produced by the trophoblast cells of the blastocyst (the early-stage embryo) shortly after implantation. Its primary function is to maintain the corpus luteum in the ovary, which continues to produce progesterone. Progesterone is essential for maintaining the endometrial lining of the uterus, supporting the pregnancy, and preventing menstruation. Without hCG, the corpus luteum would degenerate, leading to a drop in progesterone levels and the onset of menstruation."
