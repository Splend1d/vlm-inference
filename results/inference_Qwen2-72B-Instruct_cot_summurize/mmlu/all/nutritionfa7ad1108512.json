Fibre helps to bulk up the stools and speeds up the transit time through the bowel, which can help reduce the contact time between potential carcinogens in the diet and the cells lining the bowel.\n\nA. Vitamin C may have some protective effects against cancer due to its antioxidant properties, but its role in specifically reducing the risk of colorectal cancer is less clear.\n\nC. Alcohol is actually considered a risk factor for several types of cancer, including colorectal cancer.\n\nD. Oestrogen has been studied in relation to colorectal cancer risk, but its role is complex and not definitively protective. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) containing oestrogen may slightly increase the risk of colorectal cancer in postmenopausal women."
