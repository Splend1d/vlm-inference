Therefore, the unity of a subring must be the same as the unity of the ring. This makes Statement 1 true.\n\nA field is a commutative ring with unity in which every non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse. An integral domain is a commutative ring with unity that has no zero divisors. Since a field has no zero divisors (other than 0 itself, which by definition is not a zero divisor), it is indeed an integral domain. Thus, Statement 2 is also true.\n\nThe correct answer is A. True, True."
