Expectations of higher future income among juice drinkers\n\nWhen people expect their future income to be higher, they tend to increase their current consumption, including luxury or non-essential goods such as orange juice. This leads to an increased demand at every price level, resulting in a shift to the right of the demand curve.\n\nA. A bumper crop of oranges in Florida would lead to a shift to the right of the supply curve, not the demand curve.\nB. A decrease in the price of Tang (a substitute for orange juice) would make Tang more attractive relative to orange juice, potentially shifting the demand curve for orange juice to the left.\nC. Expectations of lower future prices for orange juice would cause consumers to delay their purchases, thus shifting the demand curve to the left."
