A vasectomy is a surgical procedure that involves cutting and sealing the vas deferens, which are the tubes that carry sperm from the testicles to the prostate gland. This results in a significant decrease in sperm production, but it does not affect testosterone production or the rigidity of erections. The ability to have an orgasm is also not affected by a vasectomy."
