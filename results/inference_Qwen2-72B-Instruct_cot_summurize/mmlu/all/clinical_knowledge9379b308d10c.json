                    "text": "The correct answer is C. Carnosine.\n\nCarnosine acts as an intracellular buffer, helping to maintain pH homeostasis in muscle cells during periods of high metabolic activity like intense exercise. When the rate of glycolysis is high, lactic acid is produced which can lower the pH. Carnosine helps to neutralize this excess acidity and limit pH changes.\n\nGlutamine (A) is an amino acid involved in various metabolic processes but does not act primarily as a buffer.\nGlucose (B) is the primary energy source for glycolysis but does not have buffering capacity.\nAmylase (D) is an enzyme that breaks down starches into sugars and does not play a role in buffering pH changes."
