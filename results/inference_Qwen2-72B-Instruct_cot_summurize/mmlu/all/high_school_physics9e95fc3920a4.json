This rubber band can wind and unwind around the axle supporting the wheels. This toy is given a shove, after which the toy rolls across a flat surface and up a ramp. It is observed that the toy does not go a consistent distance up the ramp\u2014in some trials it ends up higher than in other trials, even though the shove imparts the same kinetic energy to the cart each time. Which of the following is a reasonable explanation for this phenomenon?\n\nA. Depending on how the rubber band is initially wound, more or less potential energy can be transferred from the rubber band to the kinetic energy of the car\u2019s motion.\nB. The normal force on the cart\u2019s wheels will be different depending on how much the rubber band winds or unwinds.\nC. How much energy is transferred from kinetic energy to gravitational potential energy depends on the vertical height at which the cart ends up.\nD. Some of the cart\u2019s initial kinetic energy will be dissipated due to work done by friction.\n"

Depending on how the rubber band is initially wound, more or less potential energy can be transferred from the rubber band to the kinetic energy of the car\u2019s motion.\n\nThe amount of potential energy stored in the rubber band varies depending on how tightly it is wound. When the cart is given a shove, the rubber band may unwind to a different extent in each trial, releasing different amounts of potential energy as kinetic energy. This variation in the amount of energy transferred from the rubber band to the cart's motion would result in inconsistent distances traveled up the ramp."
