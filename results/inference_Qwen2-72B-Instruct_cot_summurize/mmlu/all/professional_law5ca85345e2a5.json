Equal protection problem\n\nWhen certain fundamental rights are denied to some individuals but not others, it typically indicates a violation of the principle of equal protection under the law. This concept is enshrined in the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which states that no state shall \"deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\" This provision requires that all individuals be treated equally by the law, without arbitrary discrimination based on race, gender, religion, or other irrelevant factors. Thus, when fundamental rights are selectively denied, it raises an equal protection problem."
