If we were to ignore the CPU processing time and only consider the network capacity, then we could potentially reach the network's maximum capacity of 1,000 packets per second * 1000 bytes/packet = 1,000,000 bytes/second. But given the information and the options provided, C. 100,000 bytes/second is the best choice based on the calculated data transfer rate."
