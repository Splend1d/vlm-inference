The West, notably Canada, Britain, and the US, have conducted research into the weaponization of Anthrax, Tularemia, Q-fever, Venezuelan equine encephalitis, and anti-agricultural agents. However biological weapons were generally viewed in the West as lacking military utility. Instead strategists have concentrated on nuclear and conventional capabilities.\nB. The Soviet Union carried out the most extensive research program into genetic engineering to weaponize naturally occurring diseases. However, the Soviets most likely saw their biological weapons program as a counter to the global-strike complex that was emerging in NATO in the 1970s or as a way to inhibit recovery in a nuclear exchange. Biological weapons programs should therefore be regarded in a Cold War context.\nC. Biological weapons make use of living organisms or toxins to weaken or kill, but because these organisms and toxins occur in nature it makes it difficult to differentiate between naturally occurring disease and subversive activities which, moreover, make a state's capacity hard to verify.\nD. All of these options.\n"

The West, including countries like Canada, Britain, and the US, did indeed conduct research into the weaponization of various biological agents such as Anthrax, Tularemia, Q-fever, Venezuelan equine encephalitis, and anti-agricultural agents. However, the perceived lack of military utility of biological weapons led Western strategists to focus more on nuclear and conventional capabilities.\n\nB. The Soviet Union had an extensive research program that included genetic engineering to weaponize naturally occurring diseases. This program could be seen as a response to the perceived threat from NATO's global-strike complex during the Cold War or as a means to hinder recovery in the event of a nuclear exchange.\n\nC. Biological weapons, by using living organisms or toxins that can also occur naturally, pose significant challenges for national security. It can be difficult to distinguish between naturally occurring outbreaks and deliberate attacks, complicating efforts to verify a state's capacity and intentions regarding biological weapons.\n\nAll three points contribute to the complex impact of biological weapons on national security within the international community."
