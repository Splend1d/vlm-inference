When the catheter is blocked.\n\nA bladder washout, also known as an irrigation or instillation, is typically performed when there's a blockage in the catheter that prevents urine from flowing freely. This can happen due to sediment, blood clots, or other substances that accumulate inside the catheter. By flushing the catheter with sterile saline or another appropriate solution, the blockage can often be cleared, allowing urine to flow again and preventing complications such as infection or discomfort for the patient. It's important to note that this procedure should be done under the guidance of healthcare professionals, especially if being performed at home."
