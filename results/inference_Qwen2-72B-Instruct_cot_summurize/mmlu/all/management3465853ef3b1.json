Satisficing refers to the strategy of seeking a satisfactory or adequate solution rather than an optimal one, which can be useful in situations where finding the best possible solution is too time-consuming, costly, or complex. In negotiations, satisficing can lead to a compromise that meets the needs of all parties involved to some degree, even if it's not the ideal outcome for any one party."
