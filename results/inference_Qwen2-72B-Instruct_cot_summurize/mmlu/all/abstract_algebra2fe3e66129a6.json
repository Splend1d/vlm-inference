Anti-symmetric: A relation is anti-symmetric if for all a, b in A, if (a, b) \u2208 ~ and (b, a) \u2208 ~, then a = b. In our case, we do not have any pair where both (a, b) and (b, a) are in ~ except when a = b (which is not present in the given relation since no element is related to itself). However, the absence of such pairs does not automatically make the relation anti-symmetric; rather, it makes the statement about anti-symmetry vacuously true. But, the definition of an anti-symmetric relation also requires that there be no elements where a \u2260 b and both (a, b) and (b, a) are in ~. Since there are no such pairs in our relation, it does not violate the condition for being anti-symmetric, but we typically consider a relation with no self-related elements as vacuously satisfying this property. The question asks whether it is \"not anti-symmetric,\" so the answer to this part would be that the relation does not fail to be anti-symmetric based on the given information.\n\nB. Transitive: A relation is transitive if for all a, b, c in A, if (a, b) \u2208 ~ and (b, c) \u2208 ~, then (a, c) \u2208 ~. Let's check:\n- We have (1, 2) and (1, 3), but we do not have (1, 1) or (2, 3).\n- We have (1, 2), but we do not have another pair starting with 2.\n- We have (4, 2), but we do not have another pair starting with 2.\nSince there is no counterexample where (a, b) \u2208 ~ and (b, c) \u2208 ~ but (a, c) \u2209 ~, the relation is transitive based on the given pairs.\n\nC. Reflexive: A relation is reflexive if for every a in A, (a, a) \u2208 ~. Clearly, this is not the case since none of the elements in A are related to themselves in the given relation.\n\nD. Symmetric: A relation is symmetric if for all a, b in A, if (a, b) \u2208 ~, then (b, a) \u2208 ~. This is clearly not the case since (1, 2) \u2208 ~ but (2, 1) \u2209 ~, and similarly for other pairs.\n\nGiven these analyses:\n\nA. Not anti-symmetric: Incorrect based on the analysis above.\nB. Transitive: Correct based on the analysis above.\nC. Reflexive: Incorrect based on the analysis above.\nD. Symmetric: Incorrect based on the analysis above.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.
