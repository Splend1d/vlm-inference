The unique and varied species he observed on the islands, particularly the finches with their differently shaped beaks adapted to different food sources, provided him with key insights into how species could change over time to better fit their environments. Had the Beagle bypassed the Galapagos Islands, Darwin might not have developed his ideas on adaptation and speciation as fully or as convincingly."
