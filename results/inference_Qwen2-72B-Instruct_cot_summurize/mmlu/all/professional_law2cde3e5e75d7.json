The reason for not including involuntary manslaughter is that this offense typically involves unintentional deaths resulting from negligence or recklessness, neither of which seems applicable in a situation where someone intentionally uses a gun to shoot another person.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Murder and voluntary manslaughter."
