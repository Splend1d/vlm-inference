Claim that senescence follows a predetermined plan\n\nProgrammed theories of senescence, such as the telomere theory or the disposable soma theory, suggest that aging is a result of genetically programmed processes that lead to a decline in physiological functions over time. In contrast, unprogrammed theories attribute aging to the accumulation of random damage from environmental factors, oxidative stress, and errors in cellular processes."
