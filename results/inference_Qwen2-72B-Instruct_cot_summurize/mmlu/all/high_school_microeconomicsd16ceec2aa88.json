In fact, it is the opposite of what typically happens at the profit-maximizing point where price (P) should be equal to or greater than marginal cost (MC) for a firm to continue producing that good or service. The other options (A, C, and D) are characteristics associated with the kinked demand curve model.\n\n- A kinked demand curve assumes there is a range of marginal costs over which MR = MC (option A), meaning firms produce where marginal revenue equals marginal cost.\n- The kinked demand curve model also implies interdependence of rivals (option C), as it assumes that if one firm raises its price above the current level, competitors will not follow, leading to a loss of customers for the firm raising prices; however, if one firm lowers its price below the current level, competitors will match the price cut to avoid losing market share.\n- Pricing at the kink (option D) refers to the idea that firms tend to set their prices at the point where the demand curve is relatively inelastic (the kink), as this is where they believe they can maximize profits without triggering competitive reactions from rivals."
