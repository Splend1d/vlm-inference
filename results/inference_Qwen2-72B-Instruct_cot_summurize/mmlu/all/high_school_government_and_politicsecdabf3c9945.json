In fact, it's the opposite - some countries with high voter turnout have laws that impose fines or other penalties for non-voters. However, this is not the case in the United States. Low voter turnout can lead to a perception of the government as illegitimate, a lack of true democracy, and a lack of minority representation, as those who do vote may not accurately represent the views and interests of the entire population."
