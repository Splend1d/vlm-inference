                    "text": "First, let's determine the dimension of \\(V\\). The vector space \\(V\\) consists of all real polynomials of degree at most 3. A general polynomial in \\(V\\) can be written as \\(p(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d\\), where \\(a, b, c, d \\in \\mathbb{R}\\). Since there are four coefficients, it follows that \\(\\dim(V) = 4\\).\n\nNext, we need to find the dimension of \\(W\\), the subspace of \\(V\\) consisting of all polynomials \\(p(x)\\) such that \\(p(0) = p(1) = p(-1) = 0\\).\n\nGiven that \\(p(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d\\), we have:\n\n1. \\(p(0) = 0 \\implies d = 0\\).\n2. \\(p(1) = 0 \\implies a + b + c + d = 0\\).\n3. \\(p(-1) = 0 \\implies -a + b - c + d = 0\\).\n\nSubstituting \\(d = 0\\) into the last two equations gives us:\n- \\(a + b + c = 0\\)\n- \\(-a + b - c = 0\\)\n\nAdding these two equations yields \\(2b = 0 \\implies b = 0\\). Substituting \\(b = 0\\) back into either equation, we get \\(a + c = 0 \\implies c = -a\\).\n\nThus, any polynomial in \\(W\\) can be written as \\(p(x) = ax^3 - ax = a(x^3 - x)\\). This means that every polynomial in \\(W\\) is a scalar multiple of \\(x^3 - x\\). Therefore, \\(\\dim(W) = 1\\).\n\nFinally, we add the dimensions of \\(V\\) and \\(W\\) together: \\(\\dim(V) + \\dim(W) = 4 + 1 = 5\\).\n\nThe answer is B. 5."
