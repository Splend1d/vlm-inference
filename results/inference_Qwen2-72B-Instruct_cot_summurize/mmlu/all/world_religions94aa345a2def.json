It is often associated with the charismatic movement in Christianity, which emphasizes the direct experience of the Holy Spirit and the exercise of spiritual gifts such as prophecy, healing, and tongues. Therefore, option C is the correct answer. Options A and D are not related to the concept of charism, while option B is one possible manifestation of charism but does not fully capture its meaning."
