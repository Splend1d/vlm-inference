These artistic expressions may have served as a unifying cultural force among the various Olmec groups living in different territories, despite their linguistic and ethnic diversity. While some aspects of Olmec society, such as agriculture and trade, may have contributed to social and economic structures, it is the religious beliefs and practices reflected in their art that are often cited as a common thread binding the Olmec people together."
