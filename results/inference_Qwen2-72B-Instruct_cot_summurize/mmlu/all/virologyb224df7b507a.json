However, it wasn't recognized as a retrovirus until much later, in the 1960s and 1970s, when scientists including Howard Temin and David Baltimore independently proposed the existence of reverse transcriptase, an enzyme that transcribes RNA into DNA. This discovery was pivotal in understanding how retroviruses work. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nA. In chickens as Rous sarcoma"
