Impeachment, conviction, and removal from office by Congress\n\nFederal judges, including those on the Supreme Court, can be subject to impeachment by the House of Representatives and subsequent trial and conviction by the Senate, leading to their removal from office. This is outlined in Article III, Section 1 of the U.S. Constitution, which states that federal judges \"hold their offices during good behavior.\" This means they serve lifetime appointments unless they are impeached and convicted for misconduct. The other options listed (B, C, and D) are not constitutional methods for removing federal judges from office."
