                    "text": "Henry's law states that the solubility of a gas in a liquid is directly proportional to the pressure of that gas above the liquid. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:\n\n\\[ c = k P \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\(c\\) is the concentration of the dissolved gas,\n- \\(k\\) is Henry's law constant for that gas, and\n- \\(P\\) is the partial pressure of the gas.\n\nGiven:\n- Henry's law constant (\\(k\\)) for CO2 in water at 25\u00b0C is 30.0 atm M^\u22121,\n- Partial pressure of CO2 (\\(P\\)) is 2.0 atm,\n\nwe need to find the concentration of dissolved CO2 (\\(c\\)).\n\nRearranging the formula to solve for \\(c\\):\n\n\\[ c = k P \\]\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\n\\[ c = (30.0 \\, \\text{atm M}^{-1}) \\times (2.0 \\, \\text{atm}) = 60.0 \\, \\text{M/atm} \\times 2.0 \\, \\text{atm} = 60.0/3 = 20.0/1 = 20.0/3 = 6.666... \\approx 0.067 \\, \\text{M} \\]\n\nHowever, there seems to be a miscalculation in the final step. Correctly, it should be:\n\n\\[ c = 30.0 \\times 2.0 = 60.0 \\, \\text{M/atm} \\times 2.0 \\, \\text{atm} = 60.0 \\, \\text{M} / 30.0 = 2.0 \\, \\text{M} / 1.0 = 2.0 / 3.0 = 0.666... \\]\n\nBut looking at the answer choices, we can see that none matches this result directly. Given the answer choices, it seems the correct interpretation of the calculation should align with the options provided, which suggests recalculating with an emphasis on matching the given options:\n\n\\[ c = 30.0 \\times 2.0 = 60.0 \\, \\text{M} \\]\n\nThis value is clearly not matching any option directly; however, if we look closely at the provided options, the question seems to have been interpreted correctly in terms of the formula application but may have involved a typo or misunderstanding in the expected outcome. Given the direct calculation, none of the options A through D exactly match the calculated value of 60.0 M (which is clearly not within the range of the provided options). \n\nAssuming a misinterpretation or typo in either the question or the expected calculation, the closest match to the correct application of Henry's law using the provided constants would be:\n\n\\[ c = 30.0 \\times 2.0 = 60.0 \\, \\text{M} \\]\n\nHowever, considering the provided options, the closest match based on potential rounding or simplification errors could be C. 0.067 M, although this does not directly reflect the correct calculation based on the given Henry's law constant and pressure.\n\nTo align with the provided options and assuming a simplification or typo in the question, the intended answer based on the options provided would be:\n\nC. 0.067 M\n\nThis answer assumes a potential misinterpretation or typo in the question or calculation steps leading to a discrepancy between the direct application of Henry's law and the provided answer choices. For the sake of choosing from the given options, C. 0.067 M would be selected, acknowledging the discrepancy in the direct calculation compared to the provided options."
