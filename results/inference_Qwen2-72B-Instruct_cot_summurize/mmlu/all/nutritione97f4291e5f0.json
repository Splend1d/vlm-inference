                    "text": "A. A key step in the synthesis of glycogen is the formation of UDP-glucose\n\nThis statement is correct. UDP-glucose (uridine diphosphate glucose) serves as the activated form of glucose that is used for the addition of glucose units during glycogen synthesis. This process is catalyzed by the enzyme glycogen synthase.\n\nLet's briefly address the other statements:\n\nB. In muscle in the fasting state, glycogen is broken down to glucose 6-phosphate, then free glucose.\n\nThis statement is incorrect. Muscle cells do not release free glucose into the bloodstream. When muscle glycogen is broken down, it results in glucose 6-phosphate, which is used locally within the muscle cells for energy production via glycolysis and subsequent pathways.\n\nC. Glycogen is stored mainly in the liver and brain.\n\nThis statement is partially correct but misleading. Glycogen is indeed stored mainly in the liver and muscles, not the brain. The brain does not store significant amounts of glycogen because it has a high metabolic rate and relies primarily on a constant supply of glucose from the bloodstream.\n\nD. Glucagon increases the synthesis of glycogen.\n\nThis statement is incorrect. Glucagon actually promotes the breakdown of glycogen (glycogenolysis) in the liver, increasing blood glucose levels during fasting or low-blood-sugar conditions. Insulin, not glucagon, stimulates glycogen synthesis."
