The post office quickly returned the notice to the city as being \"unclaimed.\" The city decided that the notice was sufficient, and sold the property. The owner had been out of the country and did not claim his certified mail. When he found out he sued the city on the basis that there was insufficient notice. Will the owner succeed in having the foreclosure declared void by the court?\n\nA. No, because the sending of certified notice to the property's address was reasonably calculated to reach him, which satisfies due process concerns.\nB. No, because the owner knew that he wasn't paying his taxes and that constituted de facto notice that that his property was subject to governmental taking.\nC. Yes, because in most circumstances an \"unclaimed\" notification is insufficient to satisfy the demands of due process.\nD. No, because the city had a right to expect that an owner will leave his property in the hands of someone who will notify him if his interest is in jeopardy.\n"

Yes, because in most circumstances an \"unclaimed\" notification is insufficient to satisfy the demands of due process.\n\nWhile sending a certified notice to the property's address is generally considered a reasonable method of providing notice, due process requires that the government make a good faith effort to provide notice to a property owner before taking action that could result in the loss of property. In this case, since the notice was returned as \"unclaimed,\" it suggests that the owner did not receive the notice. The city should have made further attempts to contact the owner or determine his whereabouts, especially given that he was out of the country and may not have had access to his mail. Failure to do so could be seen as a violation of due process rights."
