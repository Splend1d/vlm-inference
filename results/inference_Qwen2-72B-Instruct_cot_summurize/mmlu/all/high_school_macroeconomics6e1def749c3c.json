                    "text": "When taxes are cut in an economy that is already at full employment, it can lead to an increase in aggregate demand as consumers have more disposable income to spend. This increased demand can put upward pressure on prices if the economy is already operating at or near its potential output. However, in the long run, if the economy is at full employment, it means that all available resources (labor, capital, etc.) are being utilized.\n\nIn this scenario, the most likely outcome would be that the tax cut leads to higher prices due to increased demand without a significant change in real output because the economy cannot produce more than its potential output in the long run. The additional demand might also cause the central bank to respond by tightening monetary policy to prevent inflation from rising too much, which could further limit any expansionary effects on output.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. raise the price level.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that some economists argue that tax cuts can also lead to supply-side effects that might increase the economy's potential output over time, such as encouraging investment or work effort. But these effects are generally considered in the context of long-term changes to economic policy rather than immediate impacts on an economy already at full employment."
