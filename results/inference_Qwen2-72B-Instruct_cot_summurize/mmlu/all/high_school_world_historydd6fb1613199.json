Although our [principal] wish is to serve God and the pleasure of the king of Kongo, none the less you will make him understand\u2014as though speaking in our name\u2014what he should do to fill the ships, whether with slaves, or copper, or ivory.\"\nInstructions from King Manuel of Portugal to his envoy in Kongo, 1512\nThe interactions described in the letters are best understood in the context of which of the following?\n\nA.

Development of the slave trade in Sub-Saharan Africa\n\nThe interactions described in the letters are directly related to the development of the slave trade in Sub-Saharan Africa. The letter from King Afonso I of Kongo highlights the issue of his people being seized and sold to Europeans, while the instructions from King Manuel of Portugal to his envoy suggest a focus on filling ships with goods, including slaves, for profit. These excerpts illustrate the early stages of European involvement in the African slave trade."
