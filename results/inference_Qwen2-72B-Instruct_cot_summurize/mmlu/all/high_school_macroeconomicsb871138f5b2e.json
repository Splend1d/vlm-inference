Employment and inflation are low.\n\nDuring a typical contraction phase of the business cycle, also known as a recession, employment levels tend to fall as businesses cut back on production due to reduced demand for goods and services. Inflation also tends to be low during this time because there is less demand for goods and services, which can lead to lower prices. Consumption and private investment typically fall during this period as well, but those options were not presented as correct answers."
