In all cases, a binary search of a sorted list requires fewer comparisons than a linear search.\nB. Generally, the advantage of using a binary search over a linear search increases as the size of the list increases.\nC. A linear search will generally run faster than a binary search because a linear search requires fewer lines of code to implement.\nD. Using a linear search is preferable to using a binary search if there is a chance that the target may not be found in the list.\n"

This statement is not always true; if the target is near the beginning of the list, a linear search might require fewer comparisons than a binary search for very small lists.\nB. This statement is true. Binary search has a time complexity of O(log n), while linear search has a time complexity of O(n). As the size of the list increases, the number of comparisons required by a linear search grows much more rapidly than those required by a binary search.\nC. This statement is false. The performance of an algorithm is not determined by the number of lines of code, but rather by its time and space complexity.\nD. This statement is false. Whether the target is found or not does not affect the performance of either search method. However, if the list is not sorted, then a linear search would be necessary since a binary search requires a sorted list to function correctly."
