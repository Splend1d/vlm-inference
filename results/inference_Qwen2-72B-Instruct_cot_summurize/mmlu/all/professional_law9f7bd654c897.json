The host supplied the bats, balls and gloves. An argument arose at home plate after a controversial call by the umpire, who was inebriated like all of the other participants. The host of the party became enraged at the umpire's decision and hit him in the face, breaking his nose. The umpire pressed charges when he became sober, and the authorities charged the host with criminal battery. At trial, the defense raised the defense of voluntary intoxication, arguing that the host lacked the mentality to form an intent to commit a criminal battery. Will the defense of voluntary intoxication be successful under these facts?\n\nA. Yes, criminal battery is a specific intent crime to which voluntary intoxication may be asserted as a defense.\nB. Yes, voluntary intoxication is always at least a partial defense to any crime that requires mens rea.\nC. No, the host was grossly negligent in allowing a group of drunk men to play a dangerous game of hardball, which precluded him from the benefit of the defense.\nD. No, criminal battery in this case is a general intent crime and the defense of voluntary intoxication is not available.\n"

No, criminal battery in this case is a general intent crime and the defense of voluntary intoxication is not available.\n\nVoluntary intoxication is generally not a defense to general intent crimes, such as criminal battery, because these crimes do not require proof of a specific mental state beyond the general intent to perform the act that constitutes the crime. In the scenario described, the host intentionally swung the bat and hit the umpire, which is sufficient to establish the general intent required for criminal battery. The fact that the host was intoxicated does not negate the fact that he intentionally performed the act that caused harm. Therefore, the defense of voluntary intoxication would likely not be successful in this case."
