This rapid rotation causes a centrifugal force that pushes material away from the axis of rotation. As a result, the planets bulge at the equator and flatten at the poles, giving them a slightly oblate or \"squashed\" appearance. The other options listed do not directly contribute to this specific characteristic of Jovian planets."
