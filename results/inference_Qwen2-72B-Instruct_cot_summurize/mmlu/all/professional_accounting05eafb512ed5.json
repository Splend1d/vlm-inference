Review that service auditor\u2019s report on controls placed in operations.\n\nThe most efficient way for a user auditor to incorporate the audit of a service organization into their audit plan is to review the service auditor's report on controls placed in operation (commonly known as a SOC 1 or SSAE 18 report). This allows the user auditor to rely on the work performed by the service auditor, provided the report is satisfactory, and adjust the scope of their own audit accordingly. This approach saves time and resources compared to auditing the service organization's controls independently."
