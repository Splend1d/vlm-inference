They have increased cognitive flexibility.\n\nResearch on second-language acquisition has consistently shown that children who learn a second language tend to develop greater cognitive flexibility, which is the ability to switch between different concepts or tasks. This increased flexibility can lead to better problem-solving skills and enhanced creativity. Additionally, learning a second language can also improve memory, attention, and overall executive function. Contrary to popular belief, learning a second language does not delay cognitive development or negatively impact native language proficiency. In fact, being bilingual can enhance both languages over time. Articulation may or may not be affected by second-language acquisition, as it depends on various factors such as age of acquisition, amount of exposure, and individual differences."
