It's more of a personal boundary issue that may lead to a discussion about respecting others' belongings.\n\nIn Scenario 2, feeding your child a common food like grits is not morally wrong. It is the responsibility of a parent to feed their child, and serving grits, which is a normal and acceptable food, is not a violation of any moral standards."
