These effects can result from reduced blood flow to the placenta, which can lead to decreased oxygen and nutrient delivery to the developing fetus. Additionally, cocaine can cause vasoconstriction (narrowing of blood vessels), which may contribute to placental abruption (premature separation of the placenta from the uterus) and other complications that can affect fetal development."
