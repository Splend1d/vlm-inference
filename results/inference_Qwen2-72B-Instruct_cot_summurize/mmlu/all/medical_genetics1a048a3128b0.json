X-linked recessive\n\nIn X-linked recessive inheritance, the gene in question is located on the X chromosome and males (who have one X and one Y chromosome) express the trait if they inherit the recessive allele from their carrier mother. Since males pass their Y chromosome to their sons and not their X chromosome, this leads to a pattern where the trait can be transmitted directly from father to son only if the mother is also a carrier or has the recessive trait. However, it's important to note that in most cases, due to the nature of X-linked recessive traits, a male with such a trait will typically transmit it to all of his daughters (making them carriers) but none of his sons, unless the mother is also a carrier or affected. Nonetheless, the question seems to focus on the potential for direct male-to-male transmission, which is a feature that can occur under specific circumstances in X-linked recessive inheritance patterns, especially when considering multi-generational transmission through carrier females."
