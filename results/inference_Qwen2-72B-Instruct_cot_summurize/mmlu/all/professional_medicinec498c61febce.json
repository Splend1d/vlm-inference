S2 is widely split and does not vary with respiration. A soft mid-diastolic murmur is heard along the lower left sternal border. Examination shows no other abnormalities.

The widely split S2 that does not vary with respiration, along with the presence of a systolic ejection murmur and a soft mid-diastolic murmur, are characteristic findings in patients with ASDs. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is:\n\nB. Atrial septal defect\n\nIt's important to note that further diagnostic tests such as an echocardiogram would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis."
