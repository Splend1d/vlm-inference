Generally, under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) in the United States, both parents have equal rights to access their child's educational records unless there is a court order stating otherwise. However, ethical guidelines of the American Psychological Association (APA) require psychologists to protect the confidentiality of their clients' information and release it only with informed consent or as required by law.\n\nAssuming that there is no court order restricting the non-custodial parent's access to the child's educational records, Dr. Miller would be acting legally if she complies with the father's request. However, whether she acts ethically depends on whether she has obtained appropriate consent from the child's custodial parent(s) or the child himself (if he is of an age where he can provide assent), and whether releasing the information is in the best interest of the child.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most accurate choice would likely be:\n\nB. legally but potentially unethically, depending on the specific circumstances regarding consent and best interest of the child. However, without knowing all the details, it's impossible to definitively say whether it would be unethical in this case."
