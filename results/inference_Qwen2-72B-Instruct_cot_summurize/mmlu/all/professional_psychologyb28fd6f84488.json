Physiological tolerance and withdrawal\n\nTolerance refers to the need for increased amounts of a substance to achieve intoxication or desired effect, while withdrawal is the characteristic set of signs and symptoms that occur upon cessation or reduction of substance use in a dependent individual. These physiological responses are strong indicators of physical dependence and addiction.\n\nWhile the other options may also be indicative of substance use disorder, physiological tolerance and withdrawal are more directly related to the biological changes associated with addiction. Positive urine tests can indicate recent use but not necessarily addiction. Serious occupational impairment and denial can be consequences or behaviors associated with addiction but do not necessarily prove the presence of an addiction on their own."
