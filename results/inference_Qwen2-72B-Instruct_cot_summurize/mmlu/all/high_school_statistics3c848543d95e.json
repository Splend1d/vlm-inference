In this case, p = 0.3 and n = 95, so the SE is sqrt[(0.3 * 0.7) / 95] = 0.0486.\n\nNext, we need to find the z-score, which is the number of standard deviations our sample proportion is away from the hypothesized mean. The formula for the z-score is (sample proportion - hypothesized proportion) / SE. In this case, the z-score is (0.35 - 0.3) / 0.0486 = 1.03.\n\nFinally, we need to find the area under the normal curve that's more extreme than our sample result. Since the alternative hypothesis is p > 0.3, we want the area to the right of our z-score. Using a standard normal table or calculator, we find that the area to the left of a z-score of 1.03 is 0.8485, so the area to the right is 1 - 0.8485 = 0.1515.\n\nHowever, none of the answer choices match this value. It's possible that there was a rounding error in one of the intermediate calculations, but based on the information given, the closest answer choice to our calculated P-value of 0.1515 is:\n\nB. 0.1446"
