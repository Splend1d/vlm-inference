Since every second number is divisible by 2, half of the numbers from 1 to 100 will be divisible by 2. So, there are \\( \\frac{100}{2} = 50 \\) numbers divisible by 2.\n\nNext, we need to exclude those numbers which are divisible by both 2 and 3, i.e., numbers divisible by 6. To find out how many numbers are divisible by 6 in the given range, we divide 100 by 6: \n\\[ \\left\\lfloor \\frac{100}{6} \\right\\rfloor = 16 \\]\nSo, there are 16 numbers between 1 and 100 that are divisible by both 2 and 3.\n\nTherefore, the number of integers between 1 and 100 that are divisible by 2 but not by 3 is:\n\\[ 50 - 16 = 34 \\]\n\nThe total number of integers in the set is 100, so the probability that a randomly selected integer is divisible by 2 and not divisible by 3 is:\n\\[ \\frac{34}{100} = \\frac{17}{50} \\]\n\nThus, the correct answer is D. \\(\\boxed{\\frac{17}{50}}\\)."
