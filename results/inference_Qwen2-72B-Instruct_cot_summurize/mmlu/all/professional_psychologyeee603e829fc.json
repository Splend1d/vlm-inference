Social Skills training\n\nWhile some of the options listed may be components of specific behavioral therapies, the two most common and well-supported behavioral treatments for depression are increasing pleasurable activities and social skills training. These approaches help individuals to re-engage with their environment in positive ways and improve their interpersonal relationships, both of which can alleviate symptoms of depression.\n\nA. Flooding is an exposure technique used in treating anxiety disorders, not typically for depression.\nD. Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP) is primarily used for Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), not depression, although it might have some applications in anxiety-related depressive symptoms."
