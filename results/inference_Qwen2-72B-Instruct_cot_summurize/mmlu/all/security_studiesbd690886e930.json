The crisis has revealed the failure of international cooperation to prevent a global catastrophe, in the form of massive economic collapse and contagion. Liberalism often emphasizes the importance of international cooperation and institutions in maintaining stability and preventing crises. However, the global economic crisis showed that such mechanisms were not robust enough to prevent or mitigate the effects of a major economic downturn.\n\nD. Increasing state involvement in key industrial and financial sectors, including nationalisation and state-funded development. Liberalism generally advocates for free markets and limited government intervention in the economy. However, during the crisis, many governments around the world had to take significant measures to stabilize their economies, including bailing out banks and other critical industries. This contradicts the liberalist view that markets should operate with minimal government interference.\n\nWhile A. Governmental cyberspace restrictions, in the form of censorship and monitoring, are increasing, this option is less directly related to the economic crisis itself and more to broader trends in government control over information and communication channels. It may be seen as a challenge to liberalism's emphasis on freedom of speech and information flow, but it does not specifically address the economic aspects of the crisis.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer would be C. All of these options, if we consider that the question is asking for how the crisis challenges liberalism broadly, including its views on both economics and political freedoms. However, given the specific focus on the economic crisis in the question, B and D are the most relevant responses."
