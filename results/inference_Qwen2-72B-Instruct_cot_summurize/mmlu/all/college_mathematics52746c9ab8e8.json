This can be done by using related rates and the formula for the volume of a cone.\n\nGiven that the cone's height \\(H = 2\\) cm and radius \\(R = 1\\) cm, and the water drips out of the cone at a rate of \\(\\frac{dV}{dt} = -3 \\, \\text{cm}^3/\\text{min}\\).\n\nThe volume of the water in the cone at any moment can be given as:\n\\[V = \\frac{\\pi}{3}r^2h\\]\n\nHowever, since we're dealing with a smaller cone inside the larger cone, the radius \\(r\\) and height \\(h\\) of the water cone will be proportional to the radius \\(R\\) and height \\(H\\) of the larger cone. In fact, because it's a similar shape, we have:\n\n\\[\\frac{r}{R} = \\frac{h}{H}\\]\n\nSince \\(R = 1\\) cm and \\(H = 2\\) cm, we get:\n\\[r = \\frac{h}{2}\\]\n\nSubstitute \\(r = \\frac{h}{2}\\) into the volume equation:\n\\[V = \\frac{\\pi}{3}\\left(\\frac{h}{2}\\right)^2h = \\frac{\\pi}{3}\\frac{h^3}{4} = \\frac{\\pi h^3}{12}\\]\n\nNow, differentiate both sides with respect to time \\(t\\):\n\\[\\frac{dV}{dt} = \\frac{\\pi}{12} \\cdot 3h^2 \\cdot \\frac{dh}{dt} = \\frac{\\pi h^2}{4} \\cdot \\frac{dh}{dt}\\]\n\nWe know that \\(\\frac{dV}{dt} = -3 \\, \\text{cm}^3/\\text{min}\\), so substitute and solve for \\(\\frac{dh}{dt}\\):\n\\[-3 = \\frac{\\pi h^2}{4} \\cdot \\frac{dh}{dt}\\]\n\nSolve for \\(\\frac{dh}{dt}\\):\n\\[\\frac{dh}{dt} = \\frac{-12}{\\pi h^2}\\]\n\nWhen the water level is half a centimeter below the top of the cone, the height of the water is \\(1.5\\) cm. Substitute \\(h = 1.5\\) cm into the equation:\n\\[\\frac{dh}{dt} = \\frac{-12}{\\pi (1.5)^2} = \\frac{-12}{\\pi \\cdot 2.25} = \\frac{-12}{2.25\\pi} = \\frac{-16}{3\\pi} \\, \\text{cm/min}\\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. \\(-\\frac{16}{3\\pi} \\, \\text{cm/min}\\)."
