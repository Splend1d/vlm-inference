The written contract entered included a \"payment clause,\" which provided that the videographer would be \"paid $10,000 for the filming and editing of a 60-minute video of the wedding and the reception. \" The man included in the contract a stipulation that the video would be filmed using high definition equipment. The contract made no other reference to compensation. Thereafter, the videographer filmed and edited the 60-minute video, using high definition equipment, and presented it to the man. The videographer then submitted to the man an invoice statement in the amount of $15,000. Besides the $10,000 contract figure, the bill included a $5,000 charge for the use of the high definition equipment. Denying any additional liability, the man sent the videographer a check for $10,000. The videographer then brought suit against the man to recover the additional $5,000. Which of the following arguments would be most persuasive to support the videographer's contention that when the written contract was executed, the man agreed to pay the videographer $5,000 for use of the high definition equipment in addition to the $10,000 fee?\n\nA. According to the customary trade practice of the video industry, a $10,000 fee for filming and editing means $10,000 in addition to a supplemental charge if high definition equipment is used.\nB. An oral agreement to that effect, if provable, would only supplement, not contradict, the \"payment clause\" as written.\nC. Under the UCC, extrinsic evidence, if available, of additional terms agreed to by the parties is admissible unless such terms \"would certainly vary or contradict those contained in the document. \"\nD. Assuming arguendo that the written \"payment clause\" was fully integrated and neither patently nor latently ambiguous, equitable considerations require admission of extrinsic evidence, if available, of the parties' intent, since the videographer would stand to lose $5,000 on the contract.\n"

If the videographer can prove that there was such an oral agreement, it could be used to support their claim for the additional $5,000.\n\nOptions A and C both rely on the idea that there are external factors (customary trade practices or the UCC) that allow for the introduction of additional terms that were not included in the original contract. However, these arguments may not be as persuasive as they do not directly address the specific terms of the written contract between the videographer and the man.\n\nOption D assumes that the written contract was fully integrated and unambiguous, but then argues that equitable considerations should allow for the introduction of extrinsic evidence of the parties' intent. While this argument may have some merit, it is less persuasive than option B because it relies on a more complex legal theory and may not be as straightforward to prove in court."
