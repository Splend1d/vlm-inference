This approach aligns with the theories of psychoanalysts, who focus on unconscious processes and believe that people's responses to such stimuli can uncover repressed thoughts and feelings. The other options\u2014social-cognitive, behaviorist, and humanist theorists\u2014are less likely to use projective tests because their theories do not emphasize the role of unconscious processes in shaping personality."
