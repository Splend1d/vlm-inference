In a vacuum, there is no fluid to exert this force, so the object experiences no buoyant force.\n\nThe object still has its mass (B) and weight (C), but the weight would be zero if the object is in a state of free-fall or orbit since weight is determined by the gravitational force acting on the object's mass. However, without specifying that it is in free-fall or under the influence of gravity, we can't definitively say it has no weight in a vacuum; it just wouldn't experience any normal force or support force that would typically counteract its weight on Earth.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nA. buoyant force"
