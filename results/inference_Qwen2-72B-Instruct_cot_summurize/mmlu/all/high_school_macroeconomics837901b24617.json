Higher taxes (which is a form of contractionary fiscal policy) and Buying Treasury securities (which is a form of expansionary monetary policy). When the government raises taxes, it reduces consumer spending and cools down the economy (contractionary fiscal policy). On the other hand, when the central bank buys Treasury securities, it increases the money supply in the economy, encouraging more spending and investment (expansionary monetary policy)."
