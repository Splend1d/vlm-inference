According to this view, an action is morally right if it results in the greatest net balance of pleasure over pain for all affected parties. This theory was developed by philosophers such as Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill, who argued that pleasure is the only intrinsic good and pain is the only intrinsic evil. Therefore, the rightness of an action can be determined by its ability to maximize pleasure and minimize pain."
