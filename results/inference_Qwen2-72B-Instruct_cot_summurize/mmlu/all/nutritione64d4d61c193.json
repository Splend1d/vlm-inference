The food supply chain typically includes:\n\n1. Production (farming, ranching, fishing)\n2. Processing (cleaning, packaging, adding ingredients)\n3. Distribution (wholesale, transport, storage)\n4. Retail (supermarkets, grocery stores)\n5. Consumption (households, restaurants)\n\nThese five stages provide points where data on food availability and consumption can be collected. Therefore, the answer to the question is:\n\nB. 5"
