The dot (\u2022) represents the logical conjunction \"and.\" So, Ea means \"Abdul is Egyptian,\" and Ec means \"Cleopatra is Egyptian.\" Together, Ea \u2022 Ec means \"Abdul is Egyptian and Cleopatra is Egyptian.\"\n\nThe other options are incorrect because:\nB. Ea \u2022 c - This would imply that \"c\" is a predicate, which it's not in this context.\nC. Ae \u2228 Ce - This uses the disjunction symbol (\u2228) which means \"or,\" implying \"Abdul is Egyptian or Cleopatra is Egyptian,\" which doesn't capture the intended meaning.\nD. Ex \u2022 Ey - This is a quantified statement that says \"there exists an x and there exists a y such that x and y are both true,\" but it does not specify what properties x and y have, nor does it identify them as Abdul and Cleopatra."
