                    "text": "Let's analyze each statement:\n\nA. Alcohol makes the tremor of benign essential tremor worse - This is generally not true. In fact, alcohol can temporarily reduce the severity of essential tremors for some people.\n\nB. Hemiballismus is due to a stroke causing paralysis of the distal half of the arm - This is incorrect. Hemiballismus is a type of movement disorder characterized by large, dramatic flinging motions usually affecting one side of the body. It is typically caused by lesions in the subthalamic nucleus of the brain, often resulting from strokes or other vascular events, but it does not cause paralysis of the distal half of the arm.\n\nC. A 'milkmaid' grip is sometimes found in dystonia - This is correct. The milkmaid grip refers to a specific hand posture seen in dystonia where the fingers are flexed and the thumb is adducted (pulled toward the palm), resembling the way a milkmaid might hold a bucket. Dystonia is a neurological movement disorder that causes involuntary muscle contractions, leading to abnormal postures and repetitive movements.\n\nD. Writer's cramp is an example of a focal dystonia - This is also correct. Writer's cramp is a type of focal dystonia that affects muscles involved in writing, causing involuntary spasms and difficulty with fine motor skills necessary for handwriting.\n\nThe true statements are C and D."
