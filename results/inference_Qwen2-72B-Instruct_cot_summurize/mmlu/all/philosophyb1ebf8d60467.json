Hypotheses, according to this view, merely attempt to explain sensory experiences using general concepts that are not further analyzed or justified. Dialectic, on the other hand, seeks to understand the true nature of reality by reaching the \"first principle\" or the absolute good through pure intellect, without relying on unexamined assumptions or hypotheses."
