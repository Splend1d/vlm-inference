One can have absolute advantage and no comparative advantage in producing x.\n\nHaving an absolute advantage in producing a good means you can produce it more efficiently than anyone else. However, comparative advantage is determined by opportunity cost\u2014the cost of producing one good relative to another. It's not possible to have an absolute advantage in producing a good and simultaneously have no comparative advantage in its production, because having an absolute advantage necessarily implies having a comparative advantage over someone who doesn't have that absolute advantage."
