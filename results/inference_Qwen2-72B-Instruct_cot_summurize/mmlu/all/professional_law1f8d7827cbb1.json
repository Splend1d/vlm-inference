A police officer told the driver to turn it down, which he did. While explaining this, the officer spotted a handgun next to the driver on the seat. State law allowed the carrying of a concealed or unconcealed weapon. The officer ordered him out of the car for safety concerns. The officer drew her gun and pointed it at him as he got out, threatening to shoot him if he was not compliant. Other officers approached with weapons drawn. The driver was put on the ground and handcuffed. Drugs were found inside the car and he was charged with drug possession. He filed a motion to suppress, claiming a Fourth Amendment violation. What is the most likely decision of the court?\n\nA. The driver was acting erratically by blasting music in the middle of an auto accident investigation, and when a gun was spotted this justified a custodial interrogation and a search of the car.\nB. The officer had a right to separate the driver from the gun, and the ensuing procedures and search were reasonably calculated to protect the officers and the other motorists.\nC. The officer in effect overreacted to the initial purpose of the stop, and initiated an arrest procedure without probable cause to do so, and thus the drugs will be suppressed.\nD. The drugs will be suppressed because the officer had no right to order the driver out of the car simply because a legal weapon was observed on the seat.\n"

The officer had a right to separate the driver from the gun, and the ensuing procedures and search were reasonably calculated to protect the officers and the other motorists.\n\nWhen the officer spotted the handgun, they had a reasonable concern for their safety and the safety of others. This justified the removal of the driver from the vehicle and the subsequent search for additional weapons or threats. The fact that the state allows the carrying of concealed or unconcealed weapons does not negate the officer's duty to ensure the scene's safety. The drugs found during this search may be admissible as they could be considered part of the officer's lawful actions to secure the scene and ensure public safety. However, the specific circumstances and jurisdictional laws would ultimately determine the legality of the search and seizure."
