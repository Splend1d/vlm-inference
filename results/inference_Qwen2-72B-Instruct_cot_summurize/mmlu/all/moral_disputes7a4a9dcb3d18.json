She says the claim is implausible.\n\nHursthouse argues against the idea that a moral theory needs to provide a set of rules or principles that can be applied in every situation to determine the right course of action. Instead, she advocates for a virtue ethics approach, which emphasizes the importance of developing good character traits and practical wisdom (phronesis) in order to make morally appropriate decisions in specific situations. According to Hursthouse, moral decision-making often requires a nuanced understanding of context and an ability to weigh various factors, rather than simply following a set of predetermined rules."
