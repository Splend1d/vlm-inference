This ensures that additional resources and personnel, such as a defibrillator and advanced life support providers, are on their way. Once help has been summoned, then CPR (which includes chest compressions and rescue breaths) can be initiated, and any advance directives such as a DNAR (Do Not Attempt Resuscitation) order can be checked. However, checking for a DNAR order should not delay the initiation of CPR if it has not been previously noted."
