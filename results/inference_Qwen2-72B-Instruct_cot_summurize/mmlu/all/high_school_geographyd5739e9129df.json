This type of boundary is drawn on a map or agreed upon by political entities before the area in question is well settled or before geographic knowledge and mapping techniques are advanced enough to accurately delineate the physical features of the landscape. Antecedent boundaries often follow simple lines of latitude or longitude or other geometric shapes, which can lead to mismatches with the natural environment or cultural divisions within the area."
