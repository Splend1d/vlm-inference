A young associate was leaving his office for the day when he was stopped by the defendant, who asked him to open his briefcase. The senior associate explained that some files from the law office had been stolen. Startled, the young associate refused to permit the senior associate to look in his briefcase. The young associate said that he had personal papers in his briefcase and he didn't want the senior associate to see them. Having his suspicions aroused, the senior associate raised his clenched fist and exclaimed, \"If you don't hand over that briefcase, I'm going to punch you in the mouth. \" The young associate, who, unknown to the senior associate, suffered from a serious heart condition, had a seizure and died as a result of fright produced by the threatened attack. Which of the following is the most serious crime for which the senior associate should be found guilty?\n\nA. Assault.\nB. Voluntary manslaught\u00c3\u00a7r.\nC. Involuntary manslaughter.\nD.

Involuntary manslaughter.\n\nInvoluntary manslaughter typically involves a death that occurs due to reckless behavior or criminal negligence where there was no intention to kill. In this case, the senior associate did not intend to kill the young associate but acted recklessly by threatening him with physical violence, which led to the young associate's death due to his pre-existing heart condition.\n\nWhile assault (A) is a part of the chain of events, it does not encompass the full extent of the consequences that resulted from the senior associate's actions. Voluntary manslaughter (B) usually involves a situation where the defendant intended to cause harm but not death, often in the heat of passion or under provocation, which does not seem to apply here. Murder (D) typically requires intent to kill or extreme indifference to human life, neither of which appears to have been present in this incident. Therefore, involuntary manslaughter best fits the circumstances described."
