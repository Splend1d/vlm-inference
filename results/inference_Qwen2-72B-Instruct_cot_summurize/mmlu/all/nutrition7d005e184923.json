Estimate the likelihood, or probability, of a toxic effect on exposed humans: This involves assessing the potential health effects based on the dose-response relationship and the exposure levels.\n\nB. To support risk management decisions for food substances: Risk assessment helps in understanding the risks associated with food additives, contaminants, and other substances, which can inform regulatory decisions and safety standards.\n\nC. To derive Allowable Daily Intakes (ADI): ADI is the amount of a substance that can be ingested daily over a lifetime without appreciable health risk. Risk assessment provides the scientific basis for setting these values.\n\nTherefore, all three options A, B, and C are correct, making D the right answer."
