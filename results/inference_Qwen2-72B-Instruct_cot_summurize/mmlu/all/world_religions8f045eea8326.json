Honen\n\nHonen (\u6cd5\u7136, 1133\u20131212) was a Japanese Buddhist priest who founded the Jodo-shu (\u6d44\u571f\u5b97), or Pure Land school of Buddhism in Japan. He emphasized the recitation of the nembutsu (the name of Amida Buddha) as the primary practice for attaining rebirth in the Pure Land. His teachings and those of his disciple Shinran, who further developed the Pure Land tradition into Jodo Shinshu, have had a significant impact on Japanese Buddhism."
