She also has had a 4.5-kg (10-lb) weight loss during the past 2 weeks and a 3-week history of vaginal bleeding. Pelvic examination shows a nodular cervix with an irregular, friable posterior lip, and a rock-hard, irregular, immobile pelvic mass that extends across the pelvis. Examination of biopsy specimens from the cervix and anterior wall of the vagina show well-differentiated keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma. Which of the following best describes the pathogenesis of this patient's disease?\n\nA. Inactivation of cellular p53\nB. Insertion of viral promotors adjacent to cellular growth factor genes\nC. Specialized transduction\nD. Transactivation of cellular growth factor genes by TAX\n"

HPV E6 and E7 oncoproteins interact with and inactivate p53 and Rb, respectively, leading to uncontrolled cell proliferation.\n\nGiven the information provided, the best answer would be:\n\nA. Inactivation of cellular p53\n\nThis is because high-risk HPV types (such as HPV 16 and 18) are known to cause cervical cancer through the inactivation of p53 and Rb proteins, leading to genomic instability and malignant transformation. The other options do not specifically relate to the pathogenesis of cervical cancer."
