Both adopt a liberal ideology.\n\nCritical Legal Studies (CLS) and American Realism do share some similarities, as they both challenge formalist approaches to understanding law, emphasizing the role of social factors and the actual workings of law in society (law in action). They also aim to demystify the law by revealing the influences that shape legal decisions beyond mere application of rules. However, it would be incorrect to say that both movements adopt a liberal ideology. CLS, in particular, often critiques liberal legal principles and ideologies, arguing that law serves to maintain power structures and inequalities."
