                    "text": "To solve this problem, we can use the impulse-momentum theorem, which states that the impulse (the product of average force and the time over which it acts) equals the change in momentum.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the velocity of the ball just before it hits the ground. The initial velocity \\(u = 0\\) since it is dropped from rest. We can use the equation for free fall motion: \\[v^2 = u^2 + 2gh\\] where \\(g\\) is the acceleration due to gravity (\\(9.81 \\, m/s^2\\)), and \\(h\\) is the height from which the ball is dropped (\\(3.2 \\, m\\)).\n\n\\[v^2 = 0 + 2(9.81)(3.2)\\]\n\n\\[v^2 = 62.784\\]\n\n\\[v = \\sqrt{62.784} \\approx 7.92 \\, m/s\\]\n\nThe velocity of the ball right before it hits the ground is approximately \\(7.92 \\, m/s\\). Since the ball bounces back up to nearly the same height, it will have a similar velocity when it leaves the floor but in the opposite direction. Thus, the change in velocity (\\(\\Delta v\\)) is:\n\n\\[\\Delta v = v_{final} - v_{initial}\\]\n\nSince the velocities are in opposite directions, we can write:\n\n\\[\\Delta v = 7.92 - (-7.92) = 15.84 \\, m/s\\]\n\nNow, using the impulse-momentum theorem, the impulse \\(I\\) is equal to the change in momentum (\\(\\Delta p\\)). The change in momentum is given by:\n\n\\[\\Delta p = m\\Delta v\\]\n\nwhere \\(m\\) is the mass of the ball (\\(0.08 \\, kg\\)). Therefore,\n\n\\[\\Delta p = 0.08 \\times 15.84 = 1.2672 \\, kg \\cdot m/s\\]\n\nThe impulse is also equal to the product of the average force (\\(F_{avg}\\)) and the time (\\(\\Delta t\\)) over which the force acts:\n\n\\[I = F_{avg} \\Delta t\\]\n\nSubstituting the values for \\(I\\) and \\(\\Delta t\\):\n\n\\[1.2672 = F_{avg} \\times 0.04\\]\n\nSolving for \\(F_{avg}\\):\n\n\\[F_{avg} = \\frac{1.2672}{0.04} = 31.68 \\, N\\]\n\nNone of the options provided (A, B, C, D) match the calculated value of \\(31.68 \\, N\\), indicating there might have been an error in either the question's options or the calculation process based on the given data.
