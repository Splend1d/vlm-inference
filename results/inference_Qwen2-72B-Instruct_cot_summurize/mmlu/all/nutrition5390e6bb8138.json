The caloric needs of pregnant women can vary based on their pre-pregnancy weight, activity level, and other factors. Generally, it is recommended that pregnant women consume an additional 340-450 calories per day starting in the second trimester (around week 13) to support fetal growth and development. However, this number can be higher or lower depending on individual circumstances. It's always best for pregnant women to consult with a healthcare provider or a registered dietitian for personalized nutrition advice."
