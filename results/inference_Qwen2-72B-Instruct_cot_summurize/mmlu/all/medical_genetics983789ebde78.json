This process uses short DNA primers, which bind to the target DNA sequence, and a thermostable DNA polymerase enzyme (such as Taq polymerase) to synthesize new strands of DNA. The reaction is carried out in cycles of temperature changes to facilitate the separation of the double-stranded DNA and the binding and extension by the polymerase. This results in exponential amplification of the targeted DNA sequence."
