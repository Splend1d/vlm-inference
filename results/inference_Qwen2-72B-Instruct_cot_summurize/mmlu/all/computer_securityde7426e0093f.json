The attacker resends a captured message, and the site accepts it and responds in the attacker's favor.\n\nA replay attack is a type of network attack where an attacker intercepts a data transmission between two parties and then maliciously or fraudulently retransmits the data to one of the parties at a later time. This can result in unauthorized access or actions being performed on behalf of the original sender. In many cases, replay attacks can be prevented through the use of session tokens, timestamps, sequence numbers, or other mechanisms that ensure the freshness of messages."
