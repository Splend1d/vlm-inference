One y-intercept and three regression coefficients.\n\nIn a multiple linear regression model, each predictor variable has its own regression coefficient that quantifies the relationship between that predictor and the outcome variable, controlling for the other predictors. The y-intercept represents the predicted value of the outcome when all predictors are equal to zero. In this case, there are three predictor variables: effectiveness of parental commands, consistency of parental discipline, and parental warmth. Therefore, there will be one y-intercept and three regression coefficients corresponding to these three predictors."
