By contrast, China, especially after the mid-1300s, was threatened mainly by highly mobile steppe nomads, against whom early gunpowder weapons, with their unwieldiness, proved of little utility. It therefore devoted its efforts to the improvement of horse archer units who could effectively combat the country's deadliest foe.\nWhat traditional view of world history does this passage seem to challenge?\n\nA. That China has always been less technologically adept than most Afro-Eurasian societies\nB. That China's rigid form of dictatorial rule suppressed any spirit of military or technological innovation\nC. That China was hindered by religious fundamentalism when it came to modernizing efforts\nD. That China was surpassed by Europe in global power because it turned a blind eye to the obvious benefits of technological change\n"

In contrast to Europe, where gunpowder weapons were useful in sieges, China found them less effective against the mobile steppe nomads and instead focused on improving its horse archer units. This suggests that China's approach to technology was pragmatic rather than neglectful or opposed to change."
