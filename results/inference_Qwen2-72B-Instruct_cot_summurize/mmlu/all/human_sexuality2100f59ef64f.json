Buffy's fantasies are fairly typical and tell us little about her sexual tendencies.\n\nSexual fantasies are a common part of human sexuality and can vary widely among individuals. Fantasizing about scenarios that differ from one's usual attractions or experiences does not necessarily indicate a person's sexual orientation or imply that they have a paraphilia (a sexual interest in non-human objects, suffering, or non-consenting persons). It also does not necessarily mean that someone is not getting enough sex. Fantasies can serve various functions, such as stress relief, arousal enhancement, and relationship bonding, and do not always reflect a person's real-life desires or behaviors."
