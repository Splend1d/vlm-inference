Framing. \n\nFraming involves the way information is presented or structured, which can influence how people perceive and interpret it. It plays a significant role in shaping public opinion, decision-making, and behavior. In the context of communication, framing refers to the process by which communicators select certain aspects of reality to emphasize while de-emphasizing others, thereby guiding the audience's interpretation and understanding of the message."
