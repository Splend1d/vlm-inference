For $2u \\not\\in (-\\infty, -1)$, we have two conditions:\n\n1. $2u \\geq -1$, or equivalently $u \\geq -\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nNow, let's analyze the condition for $-20u$. For $-20u \\not\\in (-\\infty, -1)$, we also have:\n\n2. $-20u \\geq -1$, or equivalently $u \\leq \\frac{1}{20}$.\n\nCombining both conditions (1 and 2), we get:\n\n$$-\\frac{1}{2} \\leq u \\leq \\frac{1}{20}.$$\n\nHowever, we notice that $\\frac{1}{20}$ is not included in any of the given options, and the question asks for an interval consisting of all $u$. This means we should be looking for the largest possible interval that satisfies the conditions.\n\nLooking at the options, option C directly corresponds to the interval we found, but it doesn't include the upper limit $\\frac{1}{20}$. Since our goal is to find the largest possible interval that satisfies the conditions, we need to look for an interval that includes both limits, $-\\frac{1}{2}$ and $\\frac{1}{20}$.\n\nThe correct answer should include both $-\\frac{1}{2}$ and as much as possible beyond $\\frac{1}{20}$ while still satisfying the original conditions. Among the given options, **A. $[-\\frac{1}{2}, 0]$** is the best fit because it satisfies both conditions (1 and 2) for all $u$ in the interval. However, it's important to note that none of the provided options exactly matches the derived solution interval $[-\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{20}]$, but A is the closest match considering the constraints given by the conditions.\n\nThus, the correct answer, based on the options provided, is **A. $[-\\frac{1}{2}, 0]$**, though this does not fully capture the derived solution interval due to the specific constraints of the multiple-choice format."
