The temperature of the mixture rose to reach a final temperature of 37 \u00b0C. Which of the following can be concluded?\n\nA. The sample lost more heat energy than the water gained because the sample temperature changed more than the water temperature did.\nB. The final temperature is less than the average starting temperatures; therefore the equilibrium constant must be less than 1.\nC. The sample temperature changed more than the water temperature did; therefore the heat capacity of the sample must be greater than the heat capacity of the water.\nD. Even though the sample temperature changed more than the water temperature did, the sample lost the same amount of heat energy as the water gained to obey the law of conservation of energy.\n"

Even though the sample temperature changed more than the water temperature did, the sample lost the same amount of heat energy as the water gained to obey the law of conservation of energy.\n\nExplanation:\nWhen two substances with different temperatures come into contact, heat will flow from the hotter substance to the cooler one until thermal equilibrium is reached. The amount of heat lost by the hotter substance (the liquid sample) is equal to the amount of heat gained by the cooler substance (water), assuming no heat is lost to the surroundings due to the insulated container.\n\nThis principle is a direct consequence of the law of conservation of energy, which states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed from one form to another. In this case, the heat energy is conserved within the system consisting of the liquid sample and the water.\n\nOptions A, B, and C are incorrect for the following reasons:\n- Option A incorrectly suggests that more heat was lost by the sample than gained by the water, which would violate the law of conservation of energy.\n- Option B refers to the equilibrium constant, which is not applicable in this context since we are dealing with a simple heat transfer process, not a chemical reaction.\n- Option C incorrectly concludes that the heat capacity of the sample must be greater than that of the water based solely on the change in temperature. Heat capacity is defined as the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of a substance by one degree Celsius per unit mass, and it cannot be determined solely from the temperature change without additional information about the amount of heat exchanged."
