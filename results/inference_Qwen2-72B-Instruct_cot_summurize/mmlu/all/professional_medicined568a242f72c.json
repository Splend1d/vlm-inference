On morning rounds you note that the delivery records report that she had mildly elevated blood pressure during labor and sustained an estimated third-stage blood loss of 500 mL. Today blood pressure is 132/84 mm Hg, she is afebrile, and deep tendon reflexes are normal. The uterine fundus is firm and at the level of the umbilicus, and her perineum is slightly edematous. Hematocrit is 33%. She is cuddling her infant and normal bonding seems to be occurring. Which of the following is the most important next step in management?\n\nA. Begin oral methyldopa\nB. Institute fundal massage\nC. Order daily sitz baths\nD. Provide education for well-baby care\n"

Since the mother is stable, with no signs of immediate postpartum complications such as severe hypertension, hemorrhage, or infection, the focus can shift to ensuring the health and well-being of the newborn. This includes educating the mother on proper feeding techniques, recognizing signs of illness in the newborn, and scheduling follow-up care.\n\nWhile the other options may be appropriate in certain circumstances, they are not the most critical actions at this time:\n\nA. Beginning oral methyldopa is not indicated since the blood pressure is within normal range for a postpartum woman (postpartum hypertension is common and often transient).\n\nB. Instituting fundal massage is typically done immediately after delivery to help prevent postpartum hemorrhage; it's not necessary now if the uterus is firm and there is no active bleeding.\n\nC. Ordering daily sitz baths can help with perineal healing but is not the most pressing concern when compared to newborn care education. However, it could be part of the postpartum care instructions provided to the mother. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Provide education for well-baby care."
