Before he had completely repaid the loan, the man conveyed the land to an investor, who expressly assumed the loan. The note and mortgage did not contain a due-on-sale clause. After the investor had made several payments on the loan, she defaulted on two payments. The lender notified the man and the investor of its intention to accelerate the loan pursuant to the terms of the note and mortgage unless the default was cured within 60 days. When neither the man nor the investor made the required payment, the lender accelerated the loan and initiated foreclosure proceedings, naming both the man and the investor as party defendants. The foreclosure sale resulted in a deficiency. The lender has sought a deficiency judgment against only the man, because the investor has become insolvent in the meantime. Will the court likely find the man liable for the deficiency?\n\nA. No, because the investor's express assumption of the loan released the man from liability.\nB. No, because the lender must first seek to obtain a deficiency judgment against the investor.\nC. Yes, because even after the assumption, the man remains liable as a surety of the investor in the absence of a release from the lender.\nD. Yes, because the note and mortgage did not contain a due-on-sale clause.\n"

Yes, because even after the assumption, the man remains liable as a surety of the investor in the absence of a release from the lender.\n\nWhen a person mortgages property to secure a loan and then conveys the property to another party who assumes the loan, the original borrower does not automatically get released from their obligation to repay the debt. Unless there is a specific agreement or release from the lender stating that the original borrower is no longer liable, the original borrower can still be held responsible for the debt. This is because the assumption by the investor does not extinguish the man's liability; rather, it creates a co-liability situation where both the man and the investor are responsible for the debt. Since the lender has not sought a deficiency judgment against the investor (who is now insolvent), and the man has not been released from liability, the court will likely find the man liable for the deficiency."
