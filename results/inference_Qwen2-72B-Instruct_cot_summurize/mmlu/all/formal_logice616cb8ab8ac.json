(\u2200x)(Px \u2283 Sxj) which translates to \"For all x, if x is a planet, then x is smaller than Jupiter.\" This accurately represents the statement \"All planets are smaller than Jupiter\" in predicate logic. The other options do not correctly capture the meaning of the original statement. Option A suggests that there exists at least one planet that is smaller than Jupiter, but it does not say anything about whether all planets are smaller than Jupiter. Option B incorrectly uses a conjunction instead of a conditional, and option C reverses the direction of the relationship between x and Jupiter."
