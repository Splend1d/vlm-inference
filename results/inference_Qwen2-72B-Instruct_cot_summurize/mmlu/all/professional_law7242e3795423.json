According to their agreement, the owner was to pay the money to the landscaper's son. The landscaper intended to have the $5,000 given to his son as a graduation present. After the landscaper completed the job, the landscaper requested that the owner pay the $5,000 to him instead of to his son. The owner paid the landscaper. The next day, the son learned of the contract between the landscaper and the owner, as well as the payment to his father. In an action by the son against the owner for $5,000, the plaintiff will most likely\n\nA. prevail, because the written contract between the owner and the landscaper operated as a valid assignment to the son.\nB. prevail, because the son was the intended beneficiary under the terms of the written contract between the owner and the landscaper.\nC. not prevail, because the owner and the landscaper effectively modified their agreement, thereby depriving the son of any rights he may have had.\nD. not prevail, because the son did not give any consideration.\n"

However, after the work was completed, the landscaper requested that the payment be made to him instead. The owner complied with this request. By doing so, both parties essentially modified the original agreement, even if it was not in writing. This modification means that the son no longer has a right to the payment, as the agreement between the owner and the landscaper, which would have provided the basis for the son's claim, was changed without his consent.\n\nFurthermore, the son did not provide any consideration (i.e., something of value) to either party, which is typically required for a person to have enforceable rights under a contract. Since the son was not a party to the original contract and did not contribute any consideration, his ability to sue for the funds is significantly weakened. The fact that he was intended to be a beneficiary does not automatically grant him legal standing or enforceable rights, especially when the agreement has been modified."
