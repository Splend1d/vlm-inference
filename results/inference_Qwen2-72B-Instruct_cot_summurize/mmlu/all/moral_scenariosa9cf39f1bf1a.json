Wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn Scenario 1, cutting someone's hair without their consent, especially while they are sleeping and unable to give informed consent, is a violation of their bodily autonomy and can be considered morally wrong. It could also cause them distress or harm, depending on the circumstances.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the statement \"I am not releasing the silver cure for viruses\" is not inherently morally wrong without additional context. If the person developed the cure themselves and has the right to determine when and how it is released, this might not be morally wrong. However, if there is an immediate need for the cure to save lives and the person is withholding it out of malice or for personal gain, that would be morally wrong. Without more information, we cannot definitively label this scenario as morally wrong based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020."
