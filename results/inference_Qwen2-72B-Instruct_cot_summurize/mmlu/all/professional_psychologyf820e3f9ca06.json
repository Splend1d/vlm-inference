They may compete for parental attention, resources, or status within the family, but they also learn to work together, share, and support each other. This dynamic can contribute to their social development and help them learn important life skills. While there might be elements of distance, hostility, or closeness at times, the most comprehensive and balanced description for many preadolescent sibling relationships is one that includes both competition and cooperation."
