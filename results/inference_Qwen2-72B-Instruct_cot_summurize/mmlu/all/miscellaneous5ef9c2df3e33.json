All of the words provided by the question begin with the prefix \"inter-\" which generally means \"between\" or \"among.\" Let's look at each word:\n\n1. **Intercontinental** - This term refers to something that occurs between or connects different continents. For example, an intercontinental missile is one that can travel between continents.\n\n2. **Interglacial** - This term refers to a period of time between glacial periods (ice ages) when the climate is warmer. It implies a phase that exists between two ice ages.\n\n3. **Interface** - An interface is where two systems meet and interact. It could be the point of contact between a user and a computer system, for example. It suggests the space where two things come together or interact.\n\n4. **Intercept** - To intercept something means to stop it between its origin and destination. In mathematics, an intercept is the point where a line crosses an axis on a graph.\n\nIn each case, the prefix \"inter-\" indicates a relationship involving more than one entity or area, suggesting interaction or connection between them."
