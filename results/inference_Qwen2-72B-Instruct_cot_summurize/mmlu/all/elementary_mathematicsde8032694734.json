The original picture has a width-to-length ratio of 4:6, which can be simplified to 2:3.\n\nLet's denote the unknown length of the new picture as \\(L\\). Since the new picture is proportional to the original one, the ratio of their widths should equal the ratio of their lengths:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{Original Width}}{\\text{Original Length}} = \\frac{\\text{New Width}}{\\text{New Length}}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{4}{6} = \\frac{10}{L}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the left side of the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{10}{L}\n\\]\n\nCross-multiplying gives us:\n\n\\[\n2L = 3 \\times 10\n\\]\n\n\\[\n2L = 30\n\\]\n\n\\[\nL = 15\n\\]\n\nThus, the length of the new picture is 15 cm, which corresponds to option C."
