The manager takes a random sample of 10 salespeople from each location independently and records the sales revenue generated by each person during the last four weeks. He decides to use a t-test to compare the mean sales revenue at the two locations. Which of the following assumptions is necessary for the validity of the t-test?\n\nA. The population standard deviations at both locations are equal.\nB. The population standard deviations at both locations are not equal.\nC. The population standard deviations at both locations are known.\nD. The population of the sales records at each location is normally distributed.\n"

The population of the sales records at each location is normally distributed.\n\nFor the t-test to be valid, it is assumed that the populations from which the samples are drawn are normally distributed. This is particularly important when the sample sizes are small (as in this case with only 10 salespeople sampled from each location). If the data are not normally distributed, the t-test may not provide accurate results.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that while A (equal variances) is an assumption of the pooled variance t-test, modern statistical software often uses methods that can adjust for unequal variances, such as Welch's t-test. Still, for the classical two-sample t-test, equal variances are assumed, but this option is not directly related to the validity of using a t-test versus another test. Option C (known population standard deviations) would suggest using a z-test instead of a t-test."
