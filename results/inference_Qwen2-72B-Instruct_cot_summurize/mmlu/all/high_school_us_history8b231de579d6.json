Realizing that the power to tax is the power to destroy and that the power to take a certain amount of property or of income is only another way of saying that for a certain proportion of his time a citizen must work for the government, the authority to impose a tax on the people has been most carefully guarded.\u2026 A government which lays taxes on the people not required by urgent necessity and sound public policy is not a protector of liberty, but an instrument of tyranny. It condemns the citizen to tyranny. One of the first signs of the breaking down of free government is a disregard by the taxing power of the right of the people to their own property.\u2026 Unless the people can enjoy that reasonable security in the possession of their property, which is guaranteed by the Constitution, against unreasonable taxation, freedom is at an end.\u2026 With us economy is imperative. It is a full test of our national character.\u2026 It is always the people who toil that pay.\n\u2014Calvin Coolidge, \"Economy in the Interest of All,\" June 30, 1924\nThe ideas expressed above were influenced by which of the following?\n\nA. Widespread prosperity in the 1920s\nB. Widespread economic hardship in the 1920s\nC. The rapid growth of the welfare state in the 1920s\nD. Highly publicized antitrust prosecutions\n"

Widespread prosperity in the 1920s\n\nThe ideas expressed by Calvin Coolidge in the passage are consistent with the political and economic context of the 1920s, a period of significant economic growth and prosperity in the United States known as the Roaring Twenties. Coolidge's emphasis on guarding against excessive taxation and protecting individual property rights reflects the laissez-faire economic policies that were popular during this era. These policies favored minimal government intervention in the economy, which was believed to promote business growth and individual prosperity.\n\nCoolidge's presidency (1923-1929) coincided with a period of strong economic expansion, characterized by rising productivity, increased consumer spending, and a surge in stock market investments. This prosperity led to widespread optimism about the future and a belief in the efficacy of free-market principles. As such, Coolidge's views were influenced by and resonated with the prevailing sentiment of the times that government should not interfere unduly with individual economic activities through excessive regulation or taxation."
