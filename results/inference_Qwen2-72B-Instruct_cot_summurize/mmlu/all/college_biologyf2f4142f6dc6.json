A decrease in partial pressure of carbon dioxide and a decrease in concentration of hydrogen ions\n\nWhen a person hyperventilates, they exhale more CO2 than normal, which leads to a decrease in the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the blood. Since CO2 is converted into bicarbonate (HCO3-) and hydrogen ions (H+) in the blood, a decrease in CO2 results in a decrease in H+ concentration, causing the blood to become less acidic (alkalosis)."
