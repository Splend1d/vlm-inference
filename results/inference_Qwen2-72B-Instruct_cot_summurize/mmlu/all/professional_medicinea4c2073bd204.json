He had a myocardial infarction 12 years ago. His pulse is 40/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 138/85 mm Hg. Physical examination shows evidence of cannon a waves. An ECG shows a P-wave rate of 90/min, and an R-wave rate of 40/min, with no apparent relation between the two. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\n\nA. Right bundle branch block\nB. Second-degree atrioventricular block, type I\nC. Second-degree atrioventricular block, type II\nD. Third-degree atrioventricular block\n"

The atria and ventricles beat independently of each other, resulting in a P-wave rate that is unrelated to the R-wave (QRS complex) rate. The pulse rate of 40/min indicates that the ventricular rate is slow, which is typical in this condition. Cannon A-waves refer to prominent A-waves in the jugular venous pulse that occur simultaneously with the T-wave on the ECG, which is a characteristic finding in third-degree AV block when the atria contract against closed tricuspid valves due to asynchronous atrial and ventricular contractions.\n\nOptions A, B, and C do not fit the clinical presentation:\n\nA. Right bundle branch block would not explain the symptoms or the ECG findings of independent atrial and ventricular rhythms.\nB. Second-degree AV block, type I (Mobitz type I or Wenckebach) would show progressive PR interval prolongation until a QRS complex is dropped, but the atrial and ventricular rates would still be related.\nC. Second-degree AV block, type II (Mobitz type II) involves sudden and intermittent failure of conduction without progressive PR interval prolongment, but again, there would still be some relationship between the atrial and ventricular rates, unlike what is seen in complete heart block."
