CBT is an effective treatment for depression, and research has shown it can be as effective as medication in treating MDD. It helps patients to identify and challenge negative thought patterns and behaviors, which can lead to improvements in mood and functioning.\n\nWhile CBT can also be beneficial for other disorders listed such as Bipolar Disorder and certain cases of Schizophrenia, it is not typically considered the first-line treatment for Dissociative Identity Disorder, which often requires a more complex and long-term therapeutic approach."
