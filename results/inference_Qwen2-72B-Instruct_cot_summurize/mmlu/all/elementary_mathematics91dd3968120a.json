If there are 9 ounces of vinegar, we can set up a proportion to find out how many ounces of oil should be used.\n\nLet \\(x\\) represent the number of ounces of oil. The proportion based on the given ratio is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{5} = \\frac{9}{x}\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\(x\\), we cross-multiply:\n\n\\[\n2x = 5 \\times 9\n\\]\n\n\\[\n2x = 45\n\\]\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{45}{2}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nx = 22.5\n\\]\n\nTherefore, 22.5 ounces of oil should be mixed with 9 ounces of vinegar, which corresponds to option C."
