                    "text": "The correct answer is D. Rising per capita GDP in China increasing imports from the United States.\n\nWhen per capita GDP rises in China, it leads to increased purchasing power among Chinese consumers. This can lead to higher demand for imported goods from the United States. As a result, there would be an increased demand for US dollars to pay for these goods. This increased demand for US dollars will cause the dollar to appreciate relative to the Chinese yuan in flexible currency markets.\n\nA. Lower interest rates in the United States relative to China - would typically cause the dollar to depreciate rather than appreciate as investors seek higher returns in countries with higher interest rates.\n\nB. Lower price levels in China relative to the United States - would make Chinese goods cheaper compared to US goods, potentially leading to an appreciation of the yuan against the dollar due to increased demand for Chinese exports.\n\nC. Growing American preference to consume more Chinese-made goods - would increase the demand for Chinese yuan to pay for these goods, leading to an appreciation of the yuan against the dollar."
