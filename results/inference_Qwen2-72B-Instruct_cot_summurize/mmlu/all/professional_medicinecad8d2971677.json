This is because there is an increased risk of seizures in infants who have had a seizure after a previous dose of the vaccine. Therefore, it is important to ask the parents about any history of seizures in their child before administering the DTaP vaccine.\n\nAllergy to eggs is not a contraindication for DTaP vaccine since it does not contain egg protein. Apgar scores and gestational age at birth are also not relevant to the administration of the DTaP vaccine."
