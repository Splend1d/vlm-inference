The net force F_net acting along the slope is thus m*g*sin(?) - \u00b5*m*g*cos(?). According to Newton's second law of motion, F_net = m*a, where m is the mass of the object and a is its acceleration. Solving for a gives us a = F_net/m = g*(sin(?) - \u00b5*cos(?)). Therefore, the correct expression for the acceleration of the object is a = g*(sin(?) - \u00b5*cos(?)).\n\nOption D represents this relationship accurately."
