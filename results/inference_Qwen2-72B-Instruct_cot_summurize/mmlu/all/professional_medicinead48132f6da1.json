Diffuse enlargement of the rectus muscles\n\nThis is because Graves' ophthalmopathy can cause inflammation and enlargement of the extraocular muscles, particularly the medial and inferior rectus muscles, which can be visualized on MRI as enlargement or thickening of these muscles. This is often accompanied by proptosis (exophthalmos) and other signs of orbital inflammation."
