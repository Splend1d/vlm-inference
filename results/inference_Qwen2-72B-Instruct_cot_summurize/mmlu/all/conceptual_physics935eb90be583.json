However, when it is uncharged, there is no net charge on the dome, and thus, no electric field is generated inside it.\n\nIt's important to note that when the dome is charged, the electric field inside the dome can still be zero due to the principle of electrostatic induction and the fact that the charges redistribute themselves on the surface of the conductor in such a way as to cancel out any internal electric field. But in the context of the question, which seems to be asking for a condition where the electric field is definitely zero, the correct answer is when the dome is uncharged."
