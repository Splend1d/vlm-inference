Close to the top of the mountain, the friend fell off of his ski lift, and sustained injuries. The young man then decided he had had enough of skiing, but his friend called out, \"...you have to help! You have to call someone! I cant walk and it is your fault I am up here!\" The man did not respond and went home. His friend froze to death with no help ever coming to him. The people on the lift behind them both heard and saw everything, and the prosecutors office investigated the incident as a possible negligent homicide. What is the most likely decision of the prosecutor?\n\nA. The prosecutor will not file charges because the two men were not related to each other in a way that might create a duty, nor was there a special relationship that would create a duty.\nB. The prosecutor will not file charges because the man broke no laws when he walked away and it does not matter what the relationship was between them.\nC. The prosecutor will file charges because there are eyewitnesses who will testify to the young man's callous behavior to his friend.\nD. The prosecutor will file charges because their friendship was a special relationship that created a legal duty for the man to act.\n"

The prosecutor will file charges because their friendship was a special relationship that created a legal duty for the man to act.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the legal system varies by jurisdiction, and whether or not charges are filed can depend on specific laws regarding the duty to rescue or aid another person in distress. In some places, there may be a legal duty to assist someone in danger if one has contributed to the situation or if assistance could be rendered without significant risk to oneself. Given the circumstances described, where the young man's friend explicitly called for help and accused him of being responsible for the situation, and considering the eyewitness accounts, the prosecutor might find grounds to charge the young man under such laws if they exist in the jurisdiction. \n\nIt should also be considered that while \"special relationships\" typically refer to relationships like parent-child, teacher-student, or doctor-patient, which legally obligate one party to protect or care for the other, some jurisdictions may interpret a close friendship as creating a moral or quasi-legal duty to assist in emergencies. This interpretation would be more subjective and could vary widely based on the specific laws and precedents set in the jurisdiction."
