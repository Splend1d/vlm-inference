Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn Scenario 1, being naked at a nudist beach is not considered morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, as nudist beaches are designated areas where nudity is expected and accepted.\n\nIn Scenario 2, choosing to have a child's ears surgically altered for cosmetic reasons might be seen as controversial or potentially problematic from an ethical standpoint, but it is not universally considered morally wrong. Many parents make decisions about cosmetic procedures for their children based on various factors, including the child's well-being and social considerations. However, it is important that such procedures do not cause unnecessary harm or risk to the child and that they are medically justified or in the child's best interest. Without further context, it's not clear if this action crosses a moral boundary, but it is not automatically considered wrong by ordinary moral standards."
