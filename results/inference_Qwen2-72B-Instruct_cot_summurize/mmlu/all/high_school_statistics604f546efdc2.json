The farmer decides to test H0: \u03bc = 4.0 ounces versus Ha : \u03bc > 4.0 ounces, at a 5 percent level of significance, where \u03bc = the mean weight of apples using the new fertilizer. The weights of apples are approximately normally distributed. The farmer takes a random sample of 16 apples and computes a mean of 4.3 ounces and a standard deviation of 0.6 ounces. Which of the following gives the p-value for this test?\n\nA. P(Z > 2)\nB. P(Z < 2)\nC. P(t > 2) with 15 degrees of freedom\nD. P(t < 2) with 15 degrees of freedom\n"

Given that the sample size is small (n=16), and we do not know the population standard deviation, we should use the t-distribution instead of the Z-distribution.\n\nThe formula for the t-statistic is:\n\\[ t = \\frac{\\bar{x} - \\mu_0}{s/\\sqrt{n}} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\(\\bar{x}\\) is the sample mean,\n- \\(\\mu_0\\) is the hypothesized population mean under the null hypothesis,\n- \\(s\\) is the sample standard deviation, and\n- \\(n\\) is the sample size.\n\nPlugging in the numbers given:\n\\[ t = \\frac{4.3 - 4.0}{0.6/\\sqrt{16}} \\]\n\\[ t = \\frac{0.3}{0.6/4} \\]\n\\[ t = \\frac{0.3}{0.15} \\]\n\\[ t = 2 \\]\n\nSince the alternative hypothesis is one-tailed (\\(Ha : \\mu > 4.0\\)), and we're testing whether the mean weight of apples has increased, we want the area to the right of our calculated t-statistic under the t-distribution curve with \\(n-1 = 15\\) degrees of freedom.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC.
