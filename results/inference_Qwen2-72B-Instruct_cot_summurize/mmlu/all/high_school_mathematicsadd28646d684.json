This means that the function repeats every $20$ units horizontally.\n\nNow consider the transformed function $g(x) = f\\left(\\frac{x}{5}\\right)$. We want to find the smallest positive $a$ such that shifting $g(x)$ by $a$ units to the right results in an identical graph. In other words, we need to find $a$ such that:\n\n\\[g(x-a) = g(x)\\]\n\nSubstituting the definition of $g(x)$ into this equation gives us:\n\n\\[f\\left(\\frac{x-a}{5}\\right) = f\\left(\\frac{x}{5}\\right)\\]\n\nThis equation holds true if the argument of $f$ inside both expressions differs by $20$ (since $f(x)$ repeats every $20$ units). Therefore,\n\n\\[\\frac{x-a}{5} - \\frac{x}{5} = -\\frac{a}{5} = -20\\]\n\nSolving for $a$ gives:\n\n\\[-\\frac{a}{5} = -20\\]\n\n\\[a = 100\\]\n\nThus, the smallest positive $a$ such that the graph of $y=f\\left(\\frac{x}{5}\\right)$ shifted $a$ units to the right is identical to its original graph is $\\boxed{100}$ units."
