Jurisdiction is ordinarily territorial\n\nThe ordinary geographical scope of jurisdiction is territorial, meaning that a state's legal authority typically extends over people and events within its own borders. This principle is based on the concept of sovereignty, where a state has supreme power to govern within its territory. Exceptions to this principle exist, such as when jurisdiction is based on nationality, passive personality, or universality, but the default assumption is that jurisdiction is territorial."
