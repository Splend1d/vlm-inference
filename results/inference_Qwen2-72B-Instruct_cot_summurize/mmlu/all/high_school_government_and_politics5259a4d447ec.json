Voting participation for racial minority voters has increased.\n\nThe Voting Rights Act of 1965 aimed to overcome legal barriers at the state and local levels that prevented African Americans from exercising their right to vote as guaranteed under the 15th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. It led to a significant increase in the number of African Americans and other minorities registered to vote, particularly in the South where the act was most applicable. The act did not address voter ID requirements (which have been implemented by various states since then), literacy tests were prohibited by the act, and the voting age was lowered to 18 by the 26th Amendment in 1971, not by the Voting Rights Act."
