At the time he was apprehended, the police found in his possession a book of matches with four matches missing. At trial, the prosecution introduced the book of matches into evidence. Following closing arguments, and before the jury retired for deliberations, the judge gave instructions concerning the law of the case. The judge instructed the jury that it could infer the defendant's intent to set the fire based on the fact that four matches were missing from the matchbook. This instruction was specifically objected to by the defense counsel. The judge's jury instruction concerning the defendant's intent was\n\nA. proper, because it constituted a rebuttable presumption of fact.\nB. proper, because it constituted a permissible inference.\nC. improper, because the prosecution must prove each element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\nD. improper, because the instruction shifts the burden of persuasion from the prosecution to the defendant defense.\n"

While this might be circumstantial evidence that could support an argument about the defendant's intent, it does not automatically or necessarily prove that intent. The prosecution still has the burden of proving every element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt, including the defendant's intent to commit arson. The instruction could potentially lead the jury to make an unwarranted leap in logic, substituting an inference for proof where none exists.\n\nAdditionally, D. is also a valid concern, but C. is more directly addressing the issue with the instruction itself. The instruction does not shift the burden of persuasion to the defendant, but it does risk allowing the jury to make an inference that substitutes for proof, which is the prosecution's responsibility. However, since the question asks for the primary reason why the instruction is improper, C. is the most accurate answer."
