Environmental concerns reduce the yearly amount of timber that can be harvested.\n\nThis would cause the supply curve of paper to shift to the left because it represents a decrease in the available resources needed to produce paper. When there is less timber available due to environmental concerns, paper producers will be able to make less paper at every price point, leading to a leftward shift in the supply curve.\n\nA. Would likely lead to a movement along the supply curve rather than a shift as it is related to expectations about future prices and not current production costs or capabilities.\n\nB. The price of pencils does not directly affect the supply of paper since they are not inputs into each other's production process; this would not cause a shift in the supply curve for paper.\n\nC. Improvements in technology would make production more efficient and could result in a rightward shift of the supply curve, not a leftward shift."
