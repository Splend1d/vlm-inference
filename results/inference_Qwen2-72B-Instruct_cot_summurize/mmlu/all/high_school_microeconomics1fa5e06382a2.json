An increase in the price of tubas.\n\nWhen the price of tubas increases, it typically means that the demand for tubas is greater than the supply, which can lead to higher wages for tuba makers as they are able to charge more for their products. This increased revenue can then be used to pay higher wages to the workers who make the tubas.\n\nA. An increase in the number of graduates at tuba maker training school could potentially decrease wages if it leads to an oversupply of tuba makers and increased competition for jobs.\nC. An increase in the price of tuba lessons would not directly affect the wages of tuba makers, although it could potentially increase demand for tubas and thus indirectly benefit them.\nD. An increase in the tax on tubas would likely decrease demand for tubas, which could lead to lower wages for tuba makers as there would be less demand for their products."
