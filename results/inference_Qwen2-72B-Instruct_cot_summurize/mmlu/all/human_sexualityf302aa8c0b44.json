This is known as congenital syphilis. It's important for pregnant women to receive proper prenatal care and screening for STDs to prevent transmission to their babies. While some other STDs like gonorrhea, chlamydia, and genital herpes can also affect newborns, they are more commonly transmitted during childbirth rather than through the placenta."
