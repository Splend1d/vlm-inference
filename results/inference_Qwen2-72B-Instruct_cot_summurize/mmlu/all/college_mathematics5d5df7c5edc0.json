                    "text": "The set S is neither open nor closed in the standard topology on R^2.\n\nTo see that S is not open, consider any point (x, y) in S where at least one of x or y is irrational. Any neighborhood around this point will contain points with both coordinates rational since rationals are dense in the reals. Therefore, no open ball around any point in S is completely contained in S, so S is not an open set.\n\nTo see that S is not closed, consider its complement, which consists of points (x, y) where both x and y are rational. This set is countable, and as such, it has no limit points within itself since between any two rationals there is an irrational number. However, every point in the unit square is a limit point of the complement because the rationals are dense in the reals. This means the closure of the complement includes all points in the unit square, but the complement itself does not include any irrationals. Thus, the complement is not closed, meaning S is not open.\n\nThe set S is also not connected. To see why, consider two disjoint non-empty open sets U and V defined as follows:\n- U = {(x, y) \u2208 S | x < 1/2}\n- V = {(x, y) \u2208 S | x > 1/2}\n\nBoth U and V are open in the subspace topology of S (since they are intersections of open sets in R^2 with S), and their union is S, showing that S can be separated into two non-empty open sets. Therefore, S is not connected.\n\nFinally, we must determine if S is totally disconnected. A space is totally disconnected if its only connected subsets are the singletons. Since S contains points (x, y) where either x or y is irrational, any line segment in the unit square that is parallel to one of the axes and has length greater than zero will intersect S in more than one point, unless it lies entirely on a rational coordinate. However, such line segments can be broken down into smaller segments that also intersect S in more than one point, and these smaller segments can continue to be subdivided indefinitely. This shows that there are connected subsets of S that are not singletons, and thus S is not totally disconnected.\n\nHowever, considering the options given:\n\nA. S is not closed.\nB. S is not open.\nC. S is not connected.\nD. S is not totally disconnected.\n\nGiven the options, the closest correct answer is:\n\nC. S is not connected."
