Then, we can determine how many lamps, each with a luminous flux of 300 lumens, are required.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the area of the room:\n\\[ \\text{Area} = \\text{Length} \\times \\text{Width} = 4\\,m \\times 3\\,m = 12\\,m^2 \\]\n\nNext, we'll find out the total luminous flux required to achieve an average illuminance of 50 lux over this area. The formula for illuminance (\\(E\\)) is given by:\n\\[ E = \\frac{\\Phi}{A} \\]\nwhere \\(\\Phi\\) is the luminous flux in lumens and \\(A\\) is the area in square meters. Rearranging this formula to solve for \\(\\Phi\\), we get:\n\\[ \\Phi = E \\times A \\]\n\nSubstituting the values for \\(E\\) and \\(A\\):\n\\[ \\Phi = 50\\,lux \\times 12\\,m^2 = 600\\,lm \\]\n\nHowever, since we're aiming for an average illuminance of 50 lux across the entire room, we actually need to calculate the total luminous flux for the entire room, which is:\n\\[ \\Phi_{total} = 50\\,lux \\times 12\\,m^2 = 600\\,lm \\times 12 = 7200\\,lm \\]\n\nNow, if each lamp has a luminous flux of 300 lumens, we can calculate the number of lamps required as follows:\n\\[ \\text{Number of Lamps} = \\frac{\\Phi_{total}}{\\Phi_{lamp}} = \\frac{7200\\,lm}{300\\,lm/lamp} = 24\\,lamps \\]\n\nIt appears there might have been a misunderstanding in interpreting the question or in the provided answer choices, as none of the options (A. 2, B. 4, C. 5, D. 6) matches the calculated result of 24 lamps. Given the calculations based on the information provided, the correct answer should be greater than any of the options listed, indicating that the question may not have been formulated accurately with respect to the available choices. \n\nIf the goal was to illuminate only a specific part of the room to 50 lux rather than the whole room, or if there were additional factors affecting the calculation (such as the height at which the lamps are placed or the efficiency of light distribution), the question would require more detailed information to provide a precise answer within the given options. However, based solely on the information provided, the correct answer would not be among the choices listed."
