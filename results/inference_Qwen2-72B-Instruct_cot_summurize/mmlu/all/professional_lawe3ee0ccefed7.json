As the tenant inspected the room one last time, he noticed a bookcase that he had screwed into the wall when he first moved in. While he pondered whether to remove the bookcase, the tenant concluded that it constituted a fixture and, therefore, was a permanent part of the realty. Nonetheless, the tenant decided that the bookcase would fit nicely in his new apartment, so he removed it from the bedroom wall. When the landlord learned that the tenant had removed the bookcase, he contacted the tenant and demanded that he return it to the apartment. The tenant refused. If the tenant is subsequently prosecuted for larceny, he will most likely be found\n\nA. guilty, because the chattel was the personal property of the landlord.\nB. guilty, because severance of the bookcase from the wall was sufficient asportation to constitute larceny.\nC. not guilty, because the tenant cannot be found guilty of theft for removing his own property.\nD. not guilty, because the bookcase was a fixture.\n"

Fixtures are generally items that have been attached to the property in such a way that they are considered part of the real estate, and they typically become the property of the landlord. However, if the item was added by the tenant with the intention of being removable and the tenant retains ownership, then it does not automatically become a fixture. Since the tenant installed the bookcase and intended to remove it, it can be argued that it remained his personal property. Therefore, he cannot be found guilty of larceny for taking his own property.\n\nIt's worth noting that the specific terms of the lease agreement could impact the outcome, and courts may consider factors such as the method of attachment, the damage caused by removal, and any relevant communications between the tenant and landlord regarding the bookcase."
