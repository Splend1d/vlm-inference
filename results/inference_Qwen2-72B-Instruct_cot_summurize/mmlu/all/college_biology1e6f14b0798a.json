Cyanobacteria have no nuclei.\n\nCyanobacteria, also known as blue-green algae, are prokaryotic organisms, which means they lack a true nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles. In contrast, green unicellular algae are eukaryotic organisms that have a well-defined nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles such as chloroplasts and mitochondria.\n\nA is incorrect because while some bacteria do reduce sulfur compounds, this is not a defining characteristic that distinguishes cyanobacteria from green algae.\nB is incorrect because both cyanobacteria and green algae have cell walls, although their composition may differ.\nD is incorrect because both cyanobacteria and green algae produce cell membranes."
