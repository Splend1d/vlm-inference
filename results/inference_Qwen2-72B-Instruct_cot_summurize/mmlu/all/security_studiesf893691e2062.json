More powerful states may indeed form or participate in alliances to extend protection to weaker states that are considered allies, often in exchange for strategic advantages or political support.\n\nB. States with limited resources or military capabilities may seek membership in an alliance to bolster their defense and security, leveraging the collective strength of the group against potential threats.\n\nC. The presence of a potential hegemonic power can drive states to band together in an alliance as a counterbalance, aiming to deter aggression or limit the influence of that dominant state. This is a common driver behind the formation of defensive alliances."
