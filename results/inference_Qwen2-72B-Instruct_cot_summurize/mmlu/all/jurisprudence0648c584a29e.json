Which of the following is most correct?\n\nA. Donny will be liable for battery, but not assault.\nB. Donny will be liable for assault, but not battery.\nC. Donny will be liable for assault and for battery.\nD. Donny will not be liable for either assault or battery because this is only a criminal matter.\n"

It involves an intentional act that creates a reasonable apprehension of imminent harmful or offensive contact in the victim's mind. Since Sally was put in fear of being injured by the knife, Donny can be held liable for assault. Battery, on the other hand, requires actual harmful or offensive contact. Since Sally was not hit by the knife, there was no battery. Therefore, Donny cannot be held liable for battery, but he can be held liable for assault. Additionally, while such actions could also lead to criminal charges, civil cases for assault and battery are separate and can be pursued independently."
