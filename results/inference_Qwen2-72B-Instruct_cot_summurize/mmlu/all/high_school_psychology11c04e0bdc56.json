It is responsible for higher-order functions such as sensory perception, cognition, memory, and consciousness. The other options listed (pons, forebrain, and reticular formation) are older structures that are more involved in basic life functions and survival. However, it's worth noting that the forebrain includes the cerebral cortex, so option C also refers to a structure that contains the newest evolutionary part of the brain. But when considering the specific regions, the cerebral cortex is the newest."
