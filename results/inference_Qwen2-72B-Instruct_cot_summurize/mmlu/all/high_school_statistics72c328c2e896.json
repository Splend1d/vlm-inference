Option II if it wants to maximize expected return\n- This is true because the expected return from Option II is $30,000, which is higher than the other options.\n\nB. Option I if it needs at least $20,000 to pay off an overdue loan\n- This is also true because Option I guarantees $25,000, which is more than enough to cover the $20,000 loan.\n\nC. Option III if it needs at least $80,000 to pay off an overdue loan\n- This is not true because the expected return from Option III is only $5,000, which is far less than the required $80,000. However, there is a 5% chance of getting $100,000, which would be enough to pay off the loan, but it's not about maximizing the expected return, it's about taking a risk that could potentially cover a larger debt.\n\nD. All of the above answers are correct.\n- Given the analysis, this answer is not entirely correct because Choice C does not hold true in terms of maximizing expected return or guaranteeing the needed amount.\n\nThe correct answer would be D, but with the understanding that Choice C is only valid if the company is willing to take a significant risk for the possibility of covering a large debt, not because it maximizes the expected return.\n\nIf we strictly follow the question's logic, then the answer would be A and B, but since those aren't offered as choices, the closest one is D, acknowledging the conditional validity of C."
