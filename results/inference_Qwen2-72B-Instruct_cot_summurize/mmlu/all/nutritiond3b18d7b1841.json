The presence of partially digested fat and starch in the duodenum, slows intestinal motility.\n\nThis is due to the release of hormones such as cholecystokinin (CCK) and secretin in response to the presence of fats and acids in the duodenum. These hormones slow down gastric emptying and intestinal motility, allowing more time for digestion and absorption.\n\nRegarding the other options:\nA. The migrating motor complex (MMC) actually occurs during fasting periods, not after meals. It helps to clear the intestines of undigested material.\nB. Insulin does not directly slow the emptying of the stomach. Gastric emptying can be influenced by several factors including the composition of the meal and hormonal signals, but insulin's primary role is in glucose metabolism.\nC. While it is true that the stomach increases its tone at the start of a meal, the purpose is not to expel its contents immediately, but rather to begin the process of mixing and breaking down the food into a semi-liquid mixture called chyme. The expulsion of chyme through the pylorus into the small intestine is a controlled process, not an immediate expulsion."
