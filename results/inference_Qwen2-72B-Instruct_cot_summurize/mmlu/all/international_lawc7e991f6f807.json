Treaties do not create obligations or rights for third States without their consent.\n\nAccording to the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, a treaty does not create either obligations or rights for a third State without its consent. However, a treaty may create rights in favor of a third State if that State expresses its agreement to accept the rights, or if the treaty provides that such rights shall extend to third States not parties to the treaty. In such cases, the third State becomes a beneficiary of the treaty, but it is not bound by any obligations unless it consents to be bound."
