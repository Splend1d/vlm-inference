In the case of satin bowerbirds, males that can create more attractive bowers with more appealing decorations are more likely to attract females for mating. This leads to a selective pressure on males to develop better bower-building skills and more elaborate ornamentation strategies, as these traits increase their reproductive success. Over time, these traits become more common in the population due to sexual selection."
