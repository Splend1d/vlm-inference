They only wanted to work in rice paddies without helicopters strafing them and bombs with napalm burning their villages and tearing their country apart. They wanted everything to do with the war, particularly with this foreign presence of the United States of America, to leave them alone in peace, and they practiced the art of survival by siding with whichever military force was present at a particular time, be it Viet Cong, North Vietnamese or American.\"\nJohn Kerry, 1971\nThe conflict described above is most likely a result of which of the following doctrines?\n\nA. Imperialism\nB. Containment\nC. Big-stick diplomacy\nD. Isolationism\n"

This doctrine was a policy adopted by the United States during the Cold War to prevent the spread of communism. It led to U.S. involvement in various conflicts around the world, including the Vietnam War, as mentioned in John Kerry's statement. The U.S. believed that supporting non-communist regimes and fighting communist forces would prevent the spread of communism, adhering to the Domino Theory. This belief justified the U.S. military presence and intervention in Vietnam to support the South Vietnamese government against the communist North Vietnamese and Viet Cong forces."
