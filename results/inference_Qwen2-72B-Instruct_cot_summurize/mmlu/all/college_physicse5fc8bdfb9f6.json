                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to use the time dilation formula from special relativity, which is given by:\n\nt' = \u03b3t\n\nwhere t' is the time interval measured in the moving frame (O'), t is the time interval measured in the stationary frame (O), and \u03b3 (gamma) is the Lorentz factor, defined as:\n\n\u03b3 = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere v is the velocity of O' relative to O, and c is the speed of light.\n\nIn this case, we know that the time interval measured by O is zero (since the two sources flash simultaneously in his frame), but the time interval measured by O' is 13 ns. Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n\n13 ns = \u03b3 * 0\n\nHowever, since anything multiplied by zero is zero, this equation doesn't help us directly. Instead, we can use the fact that the distance between the two sources is 10 meters, and the fact that O' sees one source flash before the other, to determine the relative velocity between the two frames.\n\nLet's assume that O' sees the source at x=0 flash first. Then, in O's frame, the light from both sources travels the same distance (5 meters) to reach O, so they arrive simultaneously. However, in O' frame, the light from the source at x=0 has less distance to travel than the light from the source at x=10 m, because O' is moving towards the former and away from the latter. Specifically, if O' moves a distance d in the time it takes for the light from the source at x=10 m to travel 5 meters, then the light from the source at x=0 only has to travel a distance of 5 - d to reach O'. Using the definition of velocity, we have:\n\nv = d/t\n\nwhere t is the time it takes for the light from the source at x=10 m to travel 5 meters, which is given by:\n\nt = 5 m / c\n\nSubstituting this into the equation for v, we get:\n\nv = d / (5 m / c)\n\nMultiplying both sides by 5 m / c, we get:\n\nv * (5 m / c) = d\n\nNow, we can use the fact that O' sees the source at x=0 flash 13 ns before the source at x=10 m to find the value of d. Specifically, if the source at x=0 flashes 13 ns before the source at x=10 m, then the light from the source at x=0 has an extra 13 ns to travel the distance d, compared to the light from the source at x=10 m. Using the definition of velocity again, we have:\n\nd = v * \u0394t\n\nwhere \u0394t is the time difference between the two flashes, which is 13 ns. Substituting this into the equation for v * (5 m / c), we get:\n\nv * (5 m / c) = v * \u0394t\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n5 m / c = \u0394t\n\nSubstituting the given values, we get:\n\n5 m / c = 13 ns\n\nSolving for v, we get:\n\nv = (5 m / c) / (13 ns) = 0.385c\n\nTherefore, the closest answer choice is C. 0.36c. Note that this is not exactly equal to our calculated value, but it is the closest option available."
