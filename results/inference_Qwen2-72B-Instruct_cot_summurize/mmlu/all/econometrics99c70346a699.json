This parameter is often constrained to lie between 0 and 1 to ensure the model's stability and to maintain positive conditional variances.\n\nThe intuition behind this constraint is that if \u03bb > 1, then the volatility feedback effect would lead to an explosive process where volatility grows without bound over time, which is not realistic for financial markets. On the other hand, if \u03bb < 0, it implies that higher volatility leads to lower expected returns, which might not be consistent with the risk-return trade-off typically observed in financial markets.\n\nTherefore, while the exact value of \u03bb depends on the specific dataset and the dynamics of the market being studied, it is most common for \u03bb to be between 0 and 1. This range ensures that higher volatility is associated with higher expected returns, reflecting the positive risk premium investors demand for bearing additional risk.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Between 0 and 1\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that while this is the typical range for \u03bb due to model stability and economic rationale, in some empirical studies, particularly those involving high-frequency or extreme market conditions, estimates outside this range have been reported, though they may require careful interpretation and validation."
