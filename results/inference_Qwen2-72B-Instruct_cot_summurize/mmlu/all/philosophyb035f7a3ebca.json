However, among the options provided,\n\nA. entirely subjective\n\nis not accurate according to Hume's view, as he believed there were universal principles of taste that could be developed and applied. Option C, \"entirely objective,\" is also not correct because Hume did acknowledge that personal feelings and experiences play a role in aesthetic judgments. Hume would likely argue that the criteria for aesthetic judgment are based on a combination of subjective responses and objective standards that can be agreed upon by people with well-cultivated tastes. Since none of the options directly reflects Hume's nuanced view, the closest answer in the context of the options given would be:\n\nA. entirely subjective\n\nbut this should be understood as an oversimplification of Hume's position."
