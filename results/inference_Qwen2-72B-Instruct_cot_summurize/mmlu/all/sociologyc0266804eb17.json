All of the above.\n\nThe privatization of law and order in the 1980s and 1990s occurred through various means, including the expansion of private security companies, the construction of private prisons, and the introduction of market disciplines to assess police performance. These measures were part of a broader trend toward neoliberal policies that emphasized market solutions to social problems, including crime and public safety. Private security companies took on roles traditionally held by public police forces, while private prisons sought to provide incarceration services at lower costs than publicly run facilities. The use of market disciplines for police performance aimed to increase efficiency and effectiveness by applying business management principles to law enforcement agencies."
