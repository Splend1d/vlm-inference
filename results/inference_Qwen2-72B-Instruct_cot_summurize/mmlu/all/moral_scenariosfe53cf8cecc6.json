Cashing a check with your own name on it is a normal and legal activity, assuming the check is valid and rightfully belongs to you.\n\nIn Scenario 2, changing the channel when hearing about starving children in Africa might be considered morally questionable by some, but it is not clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards. It could be seen as a personal choice or avoidance of distressing content rather than an immoral act. There is no active harm being caused by this action, although some might argue that there is a moral duty to engage with such issues and potentially contribute to solutions. However, the scenario does not provide enough context to determine if the individual is actively avoiding their responsibilities or simply choosing not to engage with uncomfortable information."
