This statement is not true because there is no such thing as a centrifugal force in an inertial reference frame. The centrifugal force is a fictitious force that appears to exist in a rotating reference frame, but it does not have an action-reaction pair like real forces do.\n\nB. This statement is not true because the centripetal acceleration and velocity are perpendicular to each other in uniform circular motion. The centripetal acceleration points towards the center of the circle while the velocity vector is tangent to the circle at any given point.\n\nC. This statement is not true because the velocity of the object in uniform circular motion is constantly changing direction, even though its magnitude remains constant. The acceleration, on the other hand, is directed towards the center of the circle and has a constant magnitude.\n\nD. This statement is true. An object undergoing uniform circular motion is always accelerating towards the center of the circle. For a satellite orbiting around a planet, this acceleration is due to the gravitational force between the satellite and the planet. The satellite is continuously falling towards the planet, but its forward velocity causes it to move in a circular path instead of crashing into the planet."
