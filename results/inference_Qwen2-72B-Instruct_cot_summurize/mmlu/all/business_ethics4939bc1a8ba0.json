Independent, Perpetual, Owns its own assets\n\nExplanation: A corporation is considered an independent legal entity that is distinct from its managers, employees, investors, and customers. As such, it has perpetual succession, meaning that the corporation continues to exist even after changes in ownership or management. Additionally, a corporation owns its own assets, which means that the assets are not owned by the shareholders personally but rather by the corporation itself."
