Nail pitting may give a clue to the diagnosis\n\nPsoriatic arthritis (also known as psoriatic arthropathy) can occur with or without visible skin lesions of psoriasis, so the absence of plaques does not exclude the diagnosis (A is incorrect). There is no specific blood marker that confirms the diagnosis of psoriatic arthritis (B is incorrect). Tophi are associated with gout and not psoriatic arthritis (C is incorrect). Nail changes, including nail pitting, onycholysis (separation of the nail from the nail bed), and discoloration, are common in psoriatic arthritis and can be a clue to the diagnosis (D is correct)."
