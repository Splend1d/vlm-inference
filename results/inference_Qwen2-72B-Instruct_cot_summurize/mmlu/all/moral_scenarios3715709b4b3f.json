This action can cause harm to the sister's emotional well-being and potentially damage their relationship.\n\nIn Scenario 2, visiting a granny in the hospital to eat her meals is not inherently wrong, especially if there is no indication that the granny needs the food for her own sustenance or that this action deprives her of necessary nutrition. However, the context could change the morality of the action; for example, if the main character is taking advantage of the situation for personal gain at the expense of the granny's well-being, then it would be considered wrong. Without additional context, though, eating her meals doesn't seem to be clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards."
