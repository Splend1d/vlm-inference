CH3CH2CHO (Ethanal)\n\nThis is because ethanal has a carbonyl group (C=O) which can accept a hydrogen bond, but it lacks a hydrogen atom attached directly to an oxygen or nitrogen atom, which would be required for it to donate a hydrogen bond. Therefore, it cannot hydrogen bond with another ethanal molecule. However, it can hydrogen bond with molecules that have both hydrogen bond donors and acceptors, such as:\n\nA. CH3CH2OH (Ethanol), which has an -OH group that can both donate and accept hydrogen bonds.\n\nB. CH3CH2COOH (Ethanoic acid), which also has an -OH group on the carboxylic acid functional group that can donate hydrogen bonds and the carbonyl (C=O) part that can accept them.\n\nSo, while ethanal cannot hydrogen bond with other ethanal molecules, it can participate in hydrogen bonding interactions with ethanol or ethanoic acid."
