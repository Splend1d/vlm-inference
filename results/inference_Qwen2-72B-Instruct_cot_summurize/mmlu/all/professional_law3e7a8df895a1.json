They were smoking marijuana when another car skidded and crashed into the man's car. The collision damaged the man's car and inflicted personal injuries upon him. The woman was likewise injured. In fact, the impact produced a state of unconsciousness in her that lasted several minutes. The woman sued the other driver seeking to recover for his alleged negligence. At trial, the woman testified to her injuries and to the other driver's negligence. In defense, the other driver called an attorney who lived next door to the woman. The attorney proposed to testify that after the accident, the woman consulted him about her claim and asked the attorney in confidence how she could falsely testify that she wasn't smoking marijuana at the time of the accident. Upon objection by the woman's attorney, the attorney's testimony is\n\nA. admissible as an admission.\nB. admissible as a statement against interest.\nC. inadmissible, because it violates the woman's privilege against self-incrimination.\nD. inadmissible, because it violates the attorney-client privilege for confidentialcommunications.\n"

This privilege is designed to encourage full and frank disclosure by clients to their attorneys so that legal advice can be given with all the necessary information. It applies even if the client is discussing illegal activities or intentions to lie. The privilege belongs to the client, not the attorney, and can only be waived by the client. Therefore, the attorney's testimony about what the woman said in confidence during her consultation is inadmissible due to this privilege."
