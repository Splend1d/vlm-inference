One in six over 65s is providing some form of informal care.\n\nThis statement is most likely to be true based on various studies and reports that have shown a significant number of older adults provide informal care to their spouses, relatives, or friends. According to a report by Age UK, around 1.3 million people aged 65 and over in the UK were providing unpaid care as of 2020, which is roughly one in six older people. The other statements either present an exaggerated figure (A), suggest an inappropriate exclusion from discharge planning (C), or make a generalized assumption about the health status of informal carers (D) that is not supported by evidence."
