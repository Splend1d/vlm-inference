This condition is known as lactose intolerance, which is common in many adults, particularly those of African, Asian, and Hispanic descent. Lactase is the enzyme responsible for breaking down lactose, a sugar found in milk and other dairy products. Without sufficient lactase, lactose ferments in the gut, leading to abdominal cramps, bloating, and diarrhea."
