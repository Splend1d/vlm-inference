This can help reduce biases such as leniency or severity because the rater cannot simply rate all employees highly or poorly; they must make choices between specific statements about performance. However, this method may not necessarily provide an easy development process (A), specific information for feedback (B), or an entirely objective measure of job performance (D), although it can contribute to a more fair and consistent evaluation process."
