Wider at the bottom than at the top\n\nWhen a population has had a slightly larger birth rate than death rate for several generations, it results in more young individuals being added to the population than older individuals leaving it. This creates a base-heavy shape in the population pyramid, with a wider base (representing younger age groups) and a narrower top (representing older age groups). This is characteristic of a growing population."
