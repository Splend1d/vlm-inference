In some beaches designated as \"nude\" or \"clothing-optional,\" this behavior would not be considered wrong. However, if the beach is not designated as such, exposing oneself could be considered indecent exposure, but the question asks for ordinary moral standards rather than legal standards. Without additional context, it cannot be assumed that the act is inherently morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, telling someone it is safe to jump off the couch might not be considered morally wrong unless there were clear and present dangers that you knew about and deliberately misled her about. Assuming the context is casual and without any known risks, encouraging someone to jump off a couch is not typically considered a morally wrong action. If the person jumping off the couch is an adult capable of assessing their own safety, the action is even less likely to be seen as morally wrong."
