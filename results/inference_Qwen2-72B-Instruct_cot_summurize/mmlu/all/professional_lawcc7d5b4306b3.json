It is called \"shifting\" because it shifts the interest from one party to another upon the happening of a condition (in this case, if the aunt moves to another state).\n\nThe interest of the aunt is not yet vested because its validity depends on whether she moves to another state or not. If she does not move, her interest continues; if she moves, the interest shifts to the sister. Thus, it is not a vested remainder subject to any form of divestiture, as those would imply that the aunt already has a certain interest that could potentially be taken away under certain circumstances, rather than an interest that is conditional and may never vest at all depending on the fulfillment of the condition."
