It is based on the theory that personality can be described by a set of traits, which are relatively stable characteristics that influence an individual's behavior across different situations. Therefore, a personality theorist who focuses on trait theory would be most interested in the results of the MMPI. Trait theorists believe that personality can be broken down into a number of key traits, such as introversion or extroversion, neuroticism, and conscientiousness, and that these traits can be measured using self-report inventories like the MMPI."
