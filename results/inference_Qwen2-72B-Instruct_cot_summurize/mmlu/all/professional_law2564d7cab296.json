The jury returned a verdict for the truck driver, and the court entered judgment. The motorcyclist then sued the company that employed the driver and owned the truck in federal court for personal-injury damages, and the company moved to dismiss based on the state-court judgment. If the court grants the company's motion, what is the likely explanation?\n\nA. Claim preclusion (res judicata) bars the motorcyclist's action against the company.\nB. Issue preclusion (collateral estoppel) establishes the company's lack of negligence.\nC. The motorcyclist violated the doctrine of election of remedies.\nD. The state-court judgment is the law of the case.\n"

Claim preclusion (res judicata) bars the motorcyclist's action against the company.\n\nExplanation: Claim preclusion, or res judicata, prevents a party from re-litigating a claim that has already been adjudicated by a court of competent jurisdiction. In this case, the motorcyclist had already brought an action against the truck driver for the same incident in state court and lost. While the company wasn't directly a party in the first lawsuit, it can still assert claim preclusion if it can show that it was in privity with the defendant in the first suit (the truck driver), meaning they have a sufficiently close relationship such that the first suit should be considered as having covered the interests of both the driver and the company. This would effectively bar the motorcyclist from bringing another lawsuit for the same cause of action against a party related to the original defendant."
