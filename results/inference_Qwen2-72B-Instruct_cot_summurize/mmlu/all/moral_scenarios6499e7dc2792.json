Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation: In both scenarios, the actions described may not be ideal or considerate, but they do not rise to the level of being clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nScenario 1: Running around loudly on an airplane might be disruptive and inconsiderate, but it is not a morally wrong action. It could be against airline rules and may result in a request from the flight crew to behave more appropriately, but it does not cause harm to others in a way that would be considered morally reprehensible.\n\nScenario 2: Turning down the water heater's temperature after it scorched your child is actually a responsible and protective action taken by a parent to prevent further injury or potential future injuries. This action is not morally wrong; rather, it is a reasonable response to ensure safety. Adjusting the water heater's temperature to prevent scalding is a common recommendation for households with young children."
