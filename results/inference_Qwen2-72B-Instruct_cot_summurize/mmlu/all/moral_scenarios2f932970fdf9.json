Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn scenario 1, filling in potholes on a road can be seen as a good deed, as it can prevent accidents and improve driving conditions for others.\n\nIn scenario 2, feeding beef to a cow might not be considered a wise action due to potential health issues for the animal, but it is not typically viewed as morally wrong in the same way that harming another person or causing significant suffering would be. The action may be ill-advised or unusual, but not necessarily morally reprehensible. However, it's worth noting that feeding an animal inappropriate food could be seen as irresponsible or neglectful, depending on the circumstances. Still, based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, this action would not generally be considered clearly morally wrong."
