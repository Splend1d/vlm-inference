This prohibition was enacted to prevent motorists from evading radar or speed checkpoints on county and state highways. A neighboring state has no such regulation in effect. By the same token, Congress has taken no action on the matter. A resident of the neighboring state has installed a radar detection device in his automobile. While driving to visit his mother he is arrested and charged with violating the aforementioned state statute. The resident files a complaint challenging the constitutionality of the state statute. As applied to the resident, the state prohibition against the use of radar detection devices is likely to be held\n\nA. constitutional, because it protects a legitimate state interest.\nB. constitutional, because the commerce clause does not invalidate a state regulation relating to interstate commerce unless Congress takes express action to do so.\nC. unconstitutional, because the state statute fails to give credit to the law of a neighboring state.\nD. unconstitutional, because it unduly burdens interstate commerce.\n"

The state has an interest in preventing speeding and ensuring that its traffic laws are enforced, which is why it has prohibited the use of these devices. The fact that a neighboring state allows them or that Congress has not acted on the matter does not automatically make the state's law unconstitutional. The state has the authority to regulate activities within its borders as long as it does not unduly burden interstate commerce or violate other constitutional provisions. In this case, the law can be seen as a reasonable measure to protect public safety and enforce traffic laws, which are legitimate state interests. Therefore, the statute is likely to be held constitutional as applied to the resident from the neighboring state who was arrested for using a radar detection device while driving in the state where it is banned."
