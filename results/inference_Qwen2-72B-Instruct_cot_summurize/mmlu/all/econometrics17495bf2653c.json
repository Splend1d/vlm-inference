The deterministic trend means that over time, the expected value of $y_t$ changes at a constant rate determined by $\\lambda$. This is not a stationary process because the mean of $y_t$ changes over time.\n\nGiven these details, the most accurate description of the process for $y_t$ from the options provided is:\n\nC. A deterministic trend process\n\nThis is because the presence of the time trend term ($\\lambda t$) indicates that there is a systematic, non-random change in the level of $y_t$ over time. This rules out options B (a stationary process) and D (a random walk with drift), as neither would include a deterministic trend term. Option A (a unit root process) refers to a process with a stochastic trend, which is not the case here since the trend is deterministic."
