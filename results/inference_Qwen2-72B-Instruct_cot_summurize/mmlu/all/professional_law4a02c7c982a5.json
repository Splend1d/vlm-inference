                    "text": "Recently, Congress enacted a statute requiring all boat owners to register their boats with a newly created federal boat registry. Among the purposes of the statute are the prevention of theft of boats in coastal waters and the protection of the rights of individual boat owners throughout the United States. Congress enacted the statute despite the fact that all states require boat owners to register their craft with the state department of motor vehicles. In addition, there is uncontradicted evidence that most stolen boats are kept or resold in the state in which the theft occurred. Nonetheless, an increasing number of boats are transported to other states and other countries for resale. Is the statute likely to be held constitutional?\n\nA. No, because most stolen boats remain within the state in which they were stolen.\nB. No, because the registration of boats is a matter reserved to the states by the Tenth Amendment.\nC. Yes, because Congress could determine that the transportation of stolen boats affects interstate commerce.\nD. Yes, because Congress has the power to regulate property for the general welfare.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is C. Yes, because Congress could determine that the transportation of stolen boats affects interstate commerce.\n\nUnder the Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution, Congress has the power to regulate commerce among the several states. The Supreme Court has interpreted this clause broadly, allowing Congress to regulate activities that have a substantial effect on interstate commerce. Here, while it's true that most stolen boats remain within the state where they were stolen, the increasing trend of boats being transported across state lines and to other countries suggests that this activity does affect interstate commerce. Therefore, Congress can enact laws to address this issue, including creating a federal boat registry, as part of its regulatory powers under the Commerce Clause.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because, while it is true that most stolen boats remain within the state, Congress still has the authority to regulate activities that have an impact on interstate commerce, even if that impact is not the primary effect of the activity.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because the Tenth Amendment reserves powers not delegated to the federal government to the states or the people. However, when Congress acts pursuant to one of its enumerated powers, such as the Commerce Clause, the Tenth Amendment does not limit its authority.\n\nAnswer D is partially correct but not the best answer. While Congress does have the power to regulate property for the general welfare, this answer does not specifically address the basis for Congress's authority in this case, which is the regulation of interstate commerce. Answer C more accurately identifies the constitutional basis for the statute."
