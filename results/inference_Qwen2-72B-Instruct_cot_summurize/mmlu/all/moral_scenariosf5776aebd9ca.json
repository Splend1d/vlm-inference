It could be seen as positive if the planting involves reforestation or conservation efforts. However, it could also be negative if it involves destroying existing ecosystems for agriculture or development. Without more context, we cannot determine whether this action is morally wrong.\nScenario 2: Cooking with olive oil instead of peanuts for a cousin with a peanut allergy is considerate and responsible, and therefore not morally wrong. In fact, it's a thoughtful action that helps ensure the safety and well-being of your cousin."
