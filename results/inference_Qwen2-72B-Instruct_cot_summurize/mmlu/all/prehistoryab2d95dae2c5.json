The term \"knappers\" refers to the makers of stone tools, which is not an exclusive characteristic of the earliest hominids but rather a trait that developed later in some species. \"Pongids\" is an outdated term for the great apes (excluding humans), so it would not accurately describe the first hominids. Lastly, \"bipedal quadrupeds\" is contradictory since being bipedal means walking on two legs, not four."
