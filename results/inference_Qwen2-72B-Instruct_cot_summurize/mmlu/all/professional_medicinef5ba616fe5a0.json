The patient was prescribed codeine after the procedure and instructed to take the medication every 4 hours, but she has continued pain despite adherence to this analgesic regimen. Other members of her family also have experienced poor pain control with codeine. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for this therapeutic failure?\n\nA. Decreased absorption of codeine\nB. Decreased metabolism of codeine to morphine\nC. Deficiency of \u03ba receptors\nD. Increased plasma protein-binding of codeine\n"

                    "text": "The most likely explanation for the therapeutic failure in this case is B. Decreased metabolism of codeine to morphine.\n\nCodeine is a prodrug that requires conversion by cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) enzymes in the liver to its active metabolite, morphine, which then binds to \u03bc-opioid receptors to produce analgesia. Some individuals carry genetic variations in the CYP2D6 gene that result in reduced or absent enzyme activity, leading to poor conversion of codeine to morphine. This genetic polymorphism can result in decreased efficacy of codeine as an analgesic, even when taken at recommended doses. Since other family members also experience poor pain control with codeine, it suggests a hereditary factor, further supporting the hypothesis of decreased metabolism due to genetic variation."
