Both the junction tree algorithm and variable elimination are methods used to perform inference in Bayesian networks. They both aim to compute the posterior probabilities of variables given evidence. Although they use different techniques, they should theoretically produce the same results if applied correctly to the same problem. The junction tree algorithm converts the Bayesian network into a junction tree (also known as a clique tree) and performs message passing between cliques. Variable elimination simplifies the computation by eliminating variables one by one from the joint distribution. Despite their differences, they are both exact inference methods that should yield identical results when convergence is achieved.\n\nStatement 2: True. Conditional independence in Bayesian networks can be determined using the concept of d-separation. Two nodes X and Y are said to be d-separated given a set of nodes Z if there is no active path between X and Y when conditioning on Z. This means that any information flowing from X to Y must pass through Z, making X and Y conditionally independent given Z. Therefore, if X and Y are conditionally independent given Z, they will indeed be d-separated given Z in the Bayesian network."
