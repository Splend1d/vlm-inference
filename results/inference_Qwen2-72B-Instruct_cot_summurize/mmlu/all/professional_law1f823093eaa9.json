During jury selection, one potential juror stated that five years earlier he had been an employee of the company and still owned sev-eral hundred shares of its stock. In response to questioning from the judge, the potential juror stated that he could fairly consider the evidence in the case. The wholesaler's attorney has asked the judge to strike the potential juror for cause. Should the judge strike the potential juror for cause?\n\nA. No, because the potential juror said that he could fairly consider the evidence in the case.\nB. No, because the wholesaler's attorney could use a peremptory challenge to strike the potential juror.\nC. Yes, because other potential jurors still remain available for the jury panel.\nD. Yes, because the potential juror is presumed to be biased because of his relationship to the company.\n"

Yes, because the potential juror is presumed to be biased because of his relationship to the company.\n\nIn this situation, the potential juror's past employment with the pharmaceutical company and current ownership of its stock create a presumption of bias that may prevent him from being impartial. This potential bias could affect his ability to fairly consider the evidence in the case, despite his assertion to the contrary. As such, the judge should strike the potential juror for cause to ensure a fair trial."
