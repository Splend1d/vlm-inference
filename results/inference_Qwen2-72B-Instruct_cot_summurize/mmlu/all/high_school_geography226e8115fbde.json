Main disease related to age and lifestyle\n\nIn developed countries, the majority of diseases are often related to aging populations and lifestyle factors, such as heart disease, cancer, and diabetes. This contrasts with developing countries where infectious diseases may be more prevalent due to lack of access to healthcare, sanitation, and clean water. Developed countries typically have advanced healthcare systems, higher life expectancies, and lower infant mortality rates. Options A, B, and D are characteristics more commonly associated with developing countries."
