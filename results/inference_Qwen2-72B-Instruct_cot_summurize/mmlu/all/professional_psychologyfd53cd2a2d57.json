While the other three options (Strong Interest Inventory, The Campbell Interest and Skill Survey, and Self-Directed Search) are based on or heavily influenced by Holland's RIASEC model, the Kuder instrument has its own unique framework for categorizing interests. However, it's worth noting that many vocational interest inventories, including the Kuder, can be mapped onto Holland's hexagon to some extent for interpretive purposes."
