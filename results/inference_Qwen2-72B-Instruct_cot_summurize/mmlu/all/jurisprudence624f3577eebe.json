According to Emile Durkheim, punishment serves to uphold social norms and the collective conscience. He believed that punishment should be proportionate to the crime, reflecting the idea of 'desert', which means that individuals should receive what they deserve based on their actions. This concept supports the maintenance of social order and the collective sense of justice.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that Durkheim also saw punishment as serving a social function beyond just retribution or desert. Punishment reinforces the boundaries of acceptable behavior in society and reaffirms the values and norms that are collectively held by the community. In this way, punishment helps to maintain social cohesion and solidarity. So while 'desert' is a key component of his theory, the broader function of punishment in reinforcing social bonds and norms is central to Durkheim's perspective."
