Research into defining the optimal patterns and levels of weight gain during pregnancy is indeed ongoing as guidelines are updated based on new evidence.\n\nB. Both inadequate and excessive weight gain during pregnancy have been associated with poorer health outcomes for both the mother and the infant. Inadequate weight gain can lead to low birth weight, while excessive weight gain can increase the risk of gestational diabetes, hypertension, and cesarean delivery.\n\nC. Excessive maternal weight gain during pregnancy has been linked to an increased risk of obesity in the offspring later in life, potentially affecting their long-term health and well-being.\n\nTherefore, all of the statements provided are accurate regarding maternal weight gain in pregnancy."
