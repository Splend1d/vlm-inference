The least squares dummy variables approach\n\nThe fixed effects panel model is often referred to as the \"least squares dummy variables\" (LSDV) approach because it involves including dummy variables for each individual unit of observation (e.g., each individual or firm) in the model. This allows the model to account for time-invariant heterogeneity across these units by estimating a unique intercept for each one."
