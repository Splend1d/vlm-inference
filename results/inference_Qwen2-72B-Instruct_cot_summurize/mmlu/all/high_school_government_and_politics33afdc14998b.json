The results of electoral college voting tend to distort the winner's margin of victory, when compared with the popular vote for president.\n\nExplanation:\nA. This statement is false. In most states, the candidate who wins the majority of the popular vote receives all of the state's electoral votes, known as the \"winner-take-all\" system.\nB. This statement is false. Each state's number of electoral votes is based on its representation in Congress, which is not equal across states. States with larger populations have more electoral votes than those with smaller populations.\nC. This statement is false. The electoral college was established by the Founding Fathers as part of the original Constitution, specifically in Article II, Section 1. It was not created by an amendment to the Constitution. However, the 12th Amendment, ratified in 1804, did modify the process for electing the President and Vice President through the electoral college."
