Follow up with those that did not return the survey to encourage them to respond.**\n\nThis is because response rates can significantly affect the validity of survey results. If only a portion of the sample responds, the results may not accurately represent the entire population if there are systematic differences between those who responded and those who did not. By following up with non-respondents, you increase the likelihood of obtaining a more representative sample.\n\nOption C could also be considered if follow-up efforts fail, as it aims to replace the non-respondents with new participants to maintain the original sample size, which can help improve the statistical power and precision of the survey estimates. However, it's generally better to first try to increase the response rate from the initial sample before expanding the sample size."
