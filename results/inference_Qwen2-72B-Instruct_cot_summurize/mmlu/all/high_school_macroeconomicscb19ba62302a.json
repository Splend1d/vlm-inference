The higher the MPC, the larger the tax multiplier. This is because when people spend more of their income (higher MPC), changes in taxes have a greater effect on overall economic activity. Conversely, if people save more of their income (higher MPS), changes in taxes will have a smaller effect on the economy, resulting in a smaller tax multiplier."
