Pay just compensation for the property\n\nWhen a regulation is deemed to have taken private property for public use without physically appropriating it, this is known as a regulatory taking. In such cases, the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution requires the government to provide \"just compensation\" to the property owner. This principle is based on the Takings Clause, which states that private property shall not \"be taken for public use, without just compensation.\" The payment of just compensation is the remedy when a regulation has the effect of a taking. Terminating the regulation or paying double damages are not standard requirements under the Takings Clause, although the regulation may be challenged and potentially struck down in court if it is found to be unconstitutional for other reasons."
