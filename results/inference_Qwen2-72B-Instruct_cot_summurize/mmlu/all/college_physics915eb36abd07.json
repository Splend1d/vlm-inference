Since the magnetic field is perpendicular to the plane of the coil, the magnetic flux through the coil at any given moment is:\n\n\\[\n\\Phi = B \\cdot A\n\\]\n\nThus, the initial magnetic flux is:\n\n\\[\n\\Phi_i = B_i \\cdot A = 0.01 \\, \\text{T} \\times 0.2 \\, \\text{m}^2 = 0.002 \\, \\text{Wb}\n\\]\n\nAnd the final magnetic flux is:\n\n\\[\n\\Phi_f = B_f \\cdot A = 0.06 \\, \\text{T} \\times 0.2 \\, \\text{m}^2 = 0.012 \\, \\text{Wb}\n\\]\n\nNow, find the change in magnetic flux:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta \\Phi = \\Phi_f - \\Phi_i = 0.012 \\, \\text{Wb} - 0.002 \\, \\text{Wb} = 0.010 \\, \\text{Wb}\n\\]\n\nFinally, use Faraday's law to calculate the average induced EMF:\n\n\\[\n\\text{EMF} = -N \\frac{\\Delta \\Phi}{\\Delta t} = -250 \\times \\frac{0.010 \\, \\text{Wb}}{0.25 \\, \\text{s}} = -250 \\times 0.04 \\, \\text{V} = -10 \\, \\text{V}\n\\]\n\nHowever, since we're looking for the magnitude of the induced EMF (and because the negative sign only indicates the direction of the induced current according to Lenz's law), the answer is:\n\nD. 10 V"
