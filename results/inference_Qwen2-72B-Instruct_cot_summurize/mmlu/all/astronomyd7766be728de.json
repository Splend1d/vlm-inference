If you were standing on Venus and could look up at Earth, Earth would always appear close to the Sun in the sky because we are the superior planet in this scenario. This means that Earth would never be far enough away from the Sun for you to see it as anything but a \"new\" phase, similar to how we see Venus as a crescent from Earth when it is between us and the Sun. From Venus, Earth would not go through phases like a full, half, or crescent Earth because it would always be too close to the Sun in the sky to be illuminated from that vantage point."
