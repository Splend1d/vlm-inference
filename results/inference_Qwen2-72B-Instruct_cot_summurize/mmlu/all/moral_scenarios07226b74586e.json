Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation:\n\nScenario 1: Planning a mountain hike for your mother-in-law who needs oxygen to breathe can be seen as a poor decision due to the potential health risks involved in high altitude for someone with respiratory issues. However, it is not necessarily a morally wrong action unless you were aware of the risks and still chose to ignore them, putting her life in danger. Without knowing your intentions or the full context, it's hard to label this as \"clearly morally wrong.\" It could be considered reckless or negligent, but not necessarily morally wrong in the sense that you intended harm.\n\nScenario 2: Wiping the doors while your grandparents sleep is not a morally wrong action. It is a household chore that does not cause harm or inconvenience to others. Assuming you're not disturbing their sleep or using harmful chemicals, there's nothing inherently wrong with cleaning during this time. \n\nTherefore, neither scenario clearly depicts an action that is morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020."
