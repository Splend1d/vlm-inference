This situation typically leads to:\n\nD. Output to begin to rise.\n\nBusinesses will likely respond by increasing production to replenish inventory levels and meet the higher-than-expected demand. If the decrease in inventories was truly unplanned, then the company would not have anticipated this need to produce more, so they will adjust their output to compensate. While option A (prices to begin to fall) might seem plausible in some scenarios, it is less likely in response to an unplanned decrease in inventories because the higher demand relative to supply typically puts upward pressure on prices rather than downward. Options C (saving to begin to fall) and D (output to begin to fall) do not directly follow from an unplanned decrease in inventories."
