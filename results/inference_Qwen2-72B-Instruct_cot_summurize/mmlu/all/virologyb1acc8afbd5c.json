A cytokine storm\n\nCytokine storms, also known as cytokine release syndrome, occur when the immune system responds excessively to an infection, releasing a large amount of pro-inflammatory cytokines into the bloodstream. This can lead to tissue damage and multi-organ failure, often seen in severe cases of viral infections such as COVID-19. While other factors like antibody-mediated reactions, killer T cell responses, and declines in immune system function can contribute to immune pathology, a cytokine storm is often the predominant cause in severe viral infections."
