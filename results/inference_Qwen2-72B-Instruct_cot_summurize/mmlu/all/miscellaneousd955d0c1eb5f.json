While it's true that viruses can potentially infect many types of files, executable files are among the most critical to scan due to their ability to directly impact system operations and spread malware.\n\nThat being said, modern malware can hide in various types of files, including those with seemingly harmless extensions like .jpg, .pdf, or .wav if they are manipulated to include executable code. However, in general, executable files (like .exe, .dll, .bat, .com, etc.) should be given high priority during a virus scan."
