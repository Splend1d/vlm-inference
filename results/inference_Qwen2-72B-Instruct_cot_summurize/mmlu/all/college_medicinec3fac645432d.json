Transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules bring specific amino acids to the ribosome based on the codons read from the mRNA. Ribosomes are the sites where translation occurs. RNA polymerase is involved in transcription, not translation. Chromatin, DNA, and amino acids are not directly involved in the process of translation either."
