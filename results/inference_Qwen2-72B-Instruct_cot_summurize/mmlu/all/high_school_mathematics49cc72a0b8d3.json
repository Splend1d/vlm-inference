The coefficient of the \\((x-8)^2\\) term in the Taylor expansion is given by \\(\\frac{y''(8)}{2!}\\) because the general form of the nth term of a Taylor series is \\(\\frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n!}(x-a)^n\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient we're looking for is:\n\\[\\frac{\\frac{2}{3}}{2!} = \\frac{\\frac{2}{3}}{2} = \\frac{2}{3} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{2}{6} = \\frac{1}{3}\\cdot\\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{6}\\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. \\(\\boxed{\\frac{1}{6}}\\). However, note that none of the options A, B, C, or D match exactly with \\(\\frac{1}{6}\\) as provided in the question. Given the options you've listed, there seems to be a discrepancy, but based on the calculations, the closest match to the correct calculation would be option D, assuming there might have been a typo or misunderstanding in the presentation of the options."
