It is often cited as encapsulating his belief in the importance of self-reflection and critical thinking in leading a meaningful life. The phrase comes from Plato's account of the trial of Socrates (in the dialogue known as the \"Apology\"), where Socrates is defending himself against charges of impiety and corrupting the youth of Athens. In the context of the trial, Socrates uses this statement to argue that he has been engaged in a lifelong pursuit of wisdom and self-knowledge, which he considers essential for a good life."
