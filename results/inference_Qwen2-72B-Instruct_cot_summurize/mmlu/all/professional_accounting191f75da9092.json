Providing factual accounts in testimony explaining positions taken during the performance of any services provided to the client.\n\nUnder the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, accounting firms are restricted from providing certain nonaudit services to their audit clients to ensure that their independence is not impaired. These restrictions include services such as financial information systems design and implementation, appraisals or valuations, actuarial services, internal audit outsourcing, management functions, human resources, and legal services unrelated to audit services.\n\nOptions A and B involve advocating the client's interests in litigation or regulatory investigations, which can create a conflict of interest and potentially impair the auditor's independence. Option D involves providing legal services, which is also restricted under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act unless it is directly related to the audit.\n\nOption C, however, refers to providing factual accounts in testimony, which is generally permissible as long as it does not involve advocacy or taking a position on behalf of the client. This is because auditors may be required to explain their audit procedures and findings in legal proceedings or regulatory investigations, and doing so in a factual manner does not necessarily compromise their independence."
