                    "text": "The molecular geometry of thionyl chloride (SOCl2) can be determined by using the VSEPR (Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion) theory. The central atom in SOCl2 is sulfur, which is bonded to one oxygen and two chlorine atoms. Sulfur has 6 valence electrons, oxygen has 6, and each chlorine has 7, giving a total of 6 + 6 + 7 + 7 = 26 valence electrons.\n\nWhen we draw the Lewis structure for SOCl2, we find that sulfur forms double bonds with oxygen and single bonds with each chlorine atom, using up 16 of the valence electrons (4 for the S=O double bond and 2 each for the two S-Cl single bonds). This leaves us with 10 valence electrons, or 5 electron pairs, around sulfur. However, since sulfur already has a complete octet, the remaining pair does not participate in bonding and becomes a lone pair.\n\nThus, sulfur has four regions of electron density around it: three bonding pairs (one double bond to oxygen and two single bonds to chlorine) and one lone pair. According to VSEPR theory, this arrangement corresponds to a tetrahedral electron geometry. However, because one of these regions is a lone pair and does not correspond to an actual atom, the molecular geometry is trigonal pyramidal, with the lone pair occupying the \"apical\" position and the three atoms forming a base.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Trigonal pyramidal."
