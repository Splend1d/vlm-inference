The cup overflows when the amount dispensed is more than 12 ounces. \n\nGiven:\n- Standard Deviation (\u03c3) = 0.3 ounces\n- Normal distribution\n\nWe want P(X > 12) < 0.01, where X is the random variable representing the amount dispensed.\n\nIn terms of Z-scores, this translates to finding Z such that P(Z > z) = 0.01. Looking up the Z-score for the upper tail area of 0.01 in a standard normal table or using a calculator, we find that z \u2248 2.326.\n\nThe formula for converting from X to Z is: \n\\[Z = \\frac{X - \\mu}{\\sigma}\\]\n\nWe want the probability that X > 12 to be less than 0.01, which means we set X = 12 and solve for \u03bc:\n\\[2.326 = \\frac{12 - \\mu}{0.3}\\]\n\nSolving for \u03bc gives us:\n\\[0.3 * 2.326 = 12 - \\mu\\]\n\\[0.6978 = 12 - \\mu\\]\n\\[\\mu = 12 - 0.6978\\]\n\\[\\mu = 11.3022\\]\n\nThis is closest to option B, 12 - 2.326(0.3) ounces, which simplifies to approximately 11.3022 ounces.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **B. 12 - 2.326(0.3) ounces**."
