However, if we must choose from the given options, the closest match would be:\n\nB. Discipline-based inquiry\n\nThis is because discipline-based inquiry involves teaching students the methods and processes that experts use in a particular field, which in this case is literature analysis. The teacher is guiding students through the process of analyzing short stories, much like a literary critic might do, to understand the defining characteristics of the genre. This approach helps students develop critical thinking skills and a deeper understanding of the subject matter."
