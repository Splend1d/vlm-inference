Cryptic coloration\n\nCryptic coloration, also known as camouflage, is the coloring scheme adopted by animals to blend into their environment and avoid detection by predators or prey. This can include patterns, colors, and even shapes that help an animal hide in plain sight. Aposomatic coloration refers to warning coloration used by unpalatable or dangerous animals to signal their toxicity or danger to potential predators. Batesian mimicry is when a harmless species evolves to imitate the warning signals of a harmful species to avoid predation. Deceptive markings refer to patterns or colors that mislead predators about the location of vital areas on an animal's body."
