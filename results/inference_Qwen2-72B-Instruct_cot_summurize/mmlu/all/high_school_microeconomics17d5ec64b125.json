Air pollution from a power plant is blowing downwind and harming the trees in your community. Tax the production of electricity.\n\nThis option correctly identifies air pollution as a negative externality, which affects third parties not involved in the production or consumption of electricity. By taxing the production of electricity, the government can create an incentive for power plants to reduce their emissions, either by improving their technology or by paying the tax, which would effectively increase the cost of producing electricity in a polluting manner. This approach can help internalize the external costs of pollution and encourage cleaner production methods."
