In Scenario 1, encouraging children to eat paint is dangerous and irresponsible, potentially causing harm to their health. In Scenario 2, taking pictures of someone, especially a minor, in a changing room without consent is a violation of privacy and can be considered voyeurism, which is both illegal and morally reprehensible."
