Personality.\n\nWhile personality can influence how consumers think and feel about products and brands, it is not a fundamental process in explaining how consumers learn about them. The other three options - cognition, perception, and learning - are key psychological processes that play a significant role in consumer behavior and decision-making. Cognition involves mental activities such as thinking, understanding, and remembering. Perception is the way individuals interpret and organize sensory information to make sense of their environment. Learning refers to the process by which experience modifies behavior. These three processes are essential in understanding how consumers acquire knowledge and form attitudes toward products and brands."
