Autosomal recessive\n\nConsanguinity, or the mating between individuals who are related to each other, increases the probability of inheriting two copies of a recessive allele. This is because closely related individuals are more likely to share alleles that are identical by descent. Therefore, consanguinity has a strong association with autosomal recessive disorders, as it increases the risk of offspring inheriting the same harmful recessive allele from both parents."
