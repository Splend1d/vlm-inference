It has announced that the South shall be excluded from the common territory, that the judicial tribunal shall be made sectional, and that a war must be waged against slavery until it shall cease throughout the United States. The guarantees of the Constitution will then no longer exist; the equal rights of the states will be lost. The slaveholding states will no longer have the power of self-government or self-protection, and the federal government will have become their enemy.\n\"We, therefore, the people of South Carolina, by our delegates in convention assembled, have solemnly declared that the Union heretofore existing between this state and the other states of North America is dissolved; and that the state of South Carolina has resumed her position among the nations of the world, as [a] separate and independent state, with full power to levy war, conclude peace, contract alliances, establish commerce, and to do all other acts and things which independent states may of right do.\"\nSouth Carolina defines the causes of secession, 1860\nIn the excerpt above, the reference to \"the sanctions of a more erroneous religious belief\" most probably refers to\n\nA. Southern Baptist justification of slavery on the grounds of white racial superiority\nB. the Puritan abolition of slavery in New England states\nC. Jewish acceptance of slavery in the Torah\nD. Christian abolitionist rejection of slavery on moral grounds\n"

Christian abolitionist rejection of slavery on moral grounds.\n\nDuring the antebellum period, many Northern Christians, including some clergy and members of various Protestant denominations, argued against slavery on moral and religious grounds, interpreting the Bible as condemning the institution. This view was in stark contrast to that of many Southern Christians who used the Bible to justify slavery. The reference to an \"erroneous religious belief\" suggests that the author of the excerpt considered the abolitionist interpretation of Christianity to be incorrect or misguided, and thus attributes the Republican Party's stance on slavery to this \"more erroneous religious belief.\"\n\nIt is important to note that the actual excerpt provided does not contain the specific phrase mentioned in the question, so this answer is based on the context and the time period described."
