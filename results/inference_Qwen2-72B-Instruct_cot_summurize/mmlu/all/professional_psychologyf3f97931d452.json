This includes assessing their physical health, strength, endurance, agility, and overall capacity to perform the essential duties required of a fire chief. These duties can include physically demanding tasks, as well as the ability to make quick decisions under pressure.\n\nWhile emotional fitness (A), general intelligence (B), and motivation (C) are all important factors for any position, especially one with leadership responsibilities like a fire chief, they are not as directly related to the immediate job requirements that could be impacted by age-related changes in physical capability. Ensuring that the fire chief can safely and effectively carry out the necessary physical aspects of the job is crucial for both their safety and the safety of others."
