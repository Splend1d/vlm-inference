Every apartment is bigger than some house.\n\nExplanation: The given proposition can be translated as \"For all x, if x is an apartment, then there exists a y such that y is a house and x is bigger than y.\" This means that for every apartment, there is at least one house that is smaller than it. Therefore, option A is the correct interpretation. \n\nOption B is incorrect because it suggests that every house is bigger than all apartments, which is not what the given proposition says. Option C is also incorrect because it suggests that every house is bigger than some apartment, but the given proposition only states that every apartment is bigger than some house. Option D is incorrect because it suggests that there is at least one house that is bigger than every apartment, but the given proposition does not make this claim."
