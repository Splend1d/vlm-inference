Bl \u2283 Sk\n\nWhere:\n- Bl represents \"Leroy is bad\"\n- Sk represents \"DJ Khaled shouts his name\"\n\nThe statement \"Leroy is bad only if DJ Khaled shouts his name\" can be understood as \"If it is not the case that DJ Khaled shouts his name, then Leroy is not bad,\" or equivalently, \"If DJ Khaled shouts his name, then Leroy is bad.\" In predicate logic, this conditional relationship is represented by the implication symbol (\u2283), where the antecedent (Sk) implies the consequent (Bl). Thus, the correct representation is \"Bl \u2283 Sk,\" which means \"Leroy being bad is implied by DJ Khaled shouting his name.\" However, for the sentence to match the English statement more directly, it should actually be \"Sk \u2283 Bl,\" meaning \"If DJ Khaled shouts his name, then Leroy is bad.\" But based on the options provided, D is the closest and technically correct assuming a typographical error in the presentation of the options."
