It allows individuals with lower incomes access to necessary services that they might not otherwise be able to afford, thereby serving their best interests. This approach is generally considered fair and equitable as it adjusts the cost of therapy according to each person's financial situation. However, it's important that such systems are transparent and do not discriminate against or favor any particular group of clients."
