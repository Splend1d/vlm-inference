Additionally, even if rationality were a morally relevant difference, it does not necessarily follow that it justifies treating animals solely as means to human ends, rather than as beings with their own interests and well-being that deserve consideration. Therefore, such an appeal would also fail to make the case for the moral relevance of this difference to the status of animals as moral patients."
