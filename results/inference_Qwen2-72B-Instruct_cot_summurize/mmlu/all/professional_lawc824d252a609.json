As they were approaching an intersection, their vehicle collided with a motorcycle whose rider was seriously injured in the accident. The rider sued the graduate for operating his motor vehicle in excess of the speed limit. In addition, the roommate brought suit against the rider for operating his motorcycle negligently and driving through a red light. The roommate subsequently reached an out- of-court settlement with the graduate and dismissed the lawsuit against him. At trial against the rider, the roommate testified that he observed the rider drive his motorcycle through a red light and then swerve into the path of the graduate's automobile. In rebuttal, the rider offered into evidence the roommate's complaint against the graduate alleging that the latter was driving \"at an excessively high rate of speed at the time the accident occurred. \"The complaint is\n\nA. admissible as an admission.\nB. admissible as a declaration against interest.\nC. admissible under the former testimony exception to the hearsay rule.\nD. inadmissible, because the suit was dismissed as part of a compromise.\n"

This is because the complaint contains a statement made by the roommate (in his capacity as a plaintiff in the dismissed case) that is against his own interest (i.e., it suggests that the graduate may have been partly responsible for the accident). Such admissions are generally admissible as evidence in court, even if they would otherwise be considered hearsay.\n\nThe other options are not applicable:\n\nB. Admissions are not considered declarations against interest because they are statements made by a party to the current litigation, rather than statements made by an unavailable declarant.\n\nC. The former testimony exception to the hearsay rule does not apply because the roommate is testifying in this trial and is available for cross-examination.\n\nD. The fact that the suit was dismissed as part of a compromise does not make the complaint inadmissible. The admission exception allows for such statements to be used as evidence, regardless of the outcome of the previous case."
