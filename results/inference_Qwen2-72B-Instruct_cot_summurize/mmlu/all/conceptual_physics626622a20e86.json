A sonic boom is produced when an aircraft travels through the air at supersonic speeds, which is faster than the speed of sound. As the aircraft moves through the air, it creates pressure waves that travel outward in all directions. When these pressure waves combine, they form a shock wave, which is heard as a loud sonic boom by people on the ground."
