Pollution: Wealthy nations may export their polluting industries to poorer countries where environmental regulations are lax or non-existent, leading to severe pollution and health problems for local populations.\n\n2. Climate change: The industrialization of wealthy nations has contributed significantly to global greenhouse gas emissions, leading to climate change that disproportionately affects poorer countries, which are often more vulnerable to its impacts.\n\n3. Resource depletion: Wealthy nations may exploit the natural resources of poorer countries without adequately compensating them or ensuring sustainable practices, leading to resource depletion and environmental degradation.\n\n4. Waste disposal: Wealthy nations may also export their hazardous waste to poorer countries for disposal, putting local populations at risk of exposure to toxic substances.\n\nTherefore, option D, pollution, is one kind of externality imposed on the world's poor by the economic activity of wealthy nations."
