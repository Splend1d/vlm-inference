(X \u2261 ~Y) \u2283 Z\n4. ~Z\n\nWe can see that from premise 4 and premise 3, we can infer by modus tollens that:\n5. ~(X \u2261 ~Y)\n\nThen, using premise 2 and 5, again by modus tollens, we get:\n6. ~W\n\nSo, ~W is an immediate one-step consequence of the given premises. None of the other options can be inferred directly from the premises in one step. Option A requires two steps (first inferring X \u2261 ~Y, then inferring Z, which is negated by premise 4). Options B and D do not follow from the premises with only one inference step."
