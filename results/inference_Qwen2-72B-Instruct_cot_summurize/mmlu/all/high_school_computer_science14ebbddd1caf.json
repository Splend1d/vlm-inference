Authentication\n\nWhen someone logs into a system using a stolen login and password, the authentication process is compromised because the system incorrectly verifies the identity of the attacker as a legitimate user. This allows unauthorized access to the system or data, which can lead to further security breaches such as loss of confidentiality, integrity issues, or nonrepudiation problems. However, the primary pillar that is directly compromised in this scenario is authentication."
