Chylomicrons and HDL\n\nHowever, the main type of lipoprotein that packages cholesterol and fatty acids absorbed from the intestinal lumen and is secreted from the enterocytes into the lymph is chylomicrons. The role of HDL (High-Density Lipoprotein) is more related to reverse cholesterol transport, picking up excess cholesterol from cells and transporting it back to the liver.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer would be:\n\nB. Chylomicrons\n\nThis answer focuses on the primary function of chylomicrons in fat absorption and transport. However, the option including HDL is likely mentioned because enterocytes also secrete some HDL particles, but their primary role in this context isn't as significant as that of chylomicrons."
