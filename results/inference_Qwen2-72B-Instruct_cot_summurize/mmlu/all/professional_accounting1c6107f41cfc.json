                    "text": "To find the correct pretax income for Mill Co., we need to adjust the reported pretax income for the errors found during the year-end audit.\n\n1. Ending inventory is overstated by $30,000. This means that cost of goods sold (COGS) was understated by $30,000 because too much inventory was counted as still in stock when it had actually been sold. To correct this, we need to increase COGS by $30,000, which will decrease pretax income by $30,000.\n   \n   Adjustment for inventory overstatement = -$30,000\n\n2. Depreciation expense is understated by $64,000. This means that expenses were lower than they should have been, and to correct this, we need to add $64,000 to depreciation expense, which will decrease pretax income by $64,000.\n\n   Adjustment for depreciation understatement = -$64,000\n\nSo, the total adjustment needed to correct pretax income is:\n\nTotal adjustment = -$30,000 (inventory) + (-$64,000) (depreciation)\n                 = -$94,000\n\nThe reported pretax income is $152,500. After making the adjustments, the correct pretax income would be:\n\nCorrected pretax income = Reported pretax income - Total adjustment\n                         = $152,500 - $94,000\n                         = $58,500\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. $58,500"
