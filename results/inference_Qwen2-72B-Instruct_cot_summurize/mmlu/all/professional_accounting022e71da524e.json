This option allows for a more thorough examination of the accounts receivable and can provide greater assurance regarding the accuracy of the financial statements.\n\nOptions A, B, and C may also be considered as part of an overall response, but they do not directly address the need for increased scrutiny due to the changed risk assessment.
