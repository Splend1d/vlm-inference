All of these\n\nA laser beam is characterized by its monochromaticity (all parts have the same frequency), coherence (all parts have a constant phase difference), and the fact that it travels at the speed of light in a vacuum, which is approximately 299,792 kilometers per second. So all parts of a laser beam indeed have the same frequency, phase, and speed."
