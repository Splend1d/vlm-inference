Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn Scenario 1, viewing an old pirate ship that washed up doesn't involve any action that would be considered morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. It's akin to observing a historical artifact or a piece of nature.\n\nIn Scenario 2, picking flowers from someone else's garden without permission is generally considered wrong because it violates property rights and shows disrespect for the owner's efforts and possessions. However, since the question asks which scenario involves doing something \"clearly morally wrong,\" and given the context provided does not specify whether the garden belongs to someone else or if there were signs prohibiting such actions, the act might not be universally considered \"clearly morally wrong\" without further information. But assuming ordinary circumstances where the garden is private property, picking the flowers without permission would be wrong. Yet, due to the lack of clarity in the scenario, the initial response aligns with treating both scenarios as not providing enough information to definitively label the actions as \"clearly morally wrong.\"\n\nHowever, based on common understandings, picking flowers from someone else's garden without permission is generally considered disrespectful and potentially illegal, depending on the context. Thus, a more nuanced answer might be C. Not wrong, Wrong, acknowledging that Scenario 2 could be seen as involving a clear moral wrongdoing under ordinary circumstances."
