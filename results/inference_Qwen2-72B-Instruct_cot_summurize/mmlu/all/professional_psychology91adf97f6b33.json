Piaget placed too much emphasis on the role of culture and social interactions in children\u2019s cognitive development\n\nThis statement is incorrect as a criticism of Piaget's theory because, in fact, one of the main criticisms of Piaget's theory is that he did not place enough emphasis on the role of culture and social interactions in cognitive development. His theory has been criticized for being too universal and not accounting for cultural variations in cognitive development. Vygotsky's sociocultural theory, in contrast, places significant emphasis on the role of culture and social interactions."
