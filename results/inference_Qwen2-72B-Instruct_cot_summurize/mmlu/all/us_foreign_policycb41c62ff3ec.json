This approach encourages regional powers to take responsibility for their own security and relies on a multipolar balance of power to maintain stability. The goal is to reduce the costs and risks associated with direct military involvement while preserving American influence and interests.\n\nHere's a brief overview of the other options:\n\nA. Maintaining a balance between the United States and other countries and not entering into alliances - This option suggests a policy of isolationism or neutrality, which is not necessarily consistent with offshore balancing. Offshore balancing still allows for selective alliances and partnerships, as long as they do not lead to overextension or entanglement in regional conflicts.\n\nB. Investing equally in domestic and international security with balanced protection against terrorism and other states - This option focuses more on resource allocation and does not specifically address the core principles of offshore balancing, such as promoting regional self-reliance and avoiding overextension.\n\nD. Isolate the US from the international system and not seek global power - This option describes a policy of isolationism, which is distinct from offshore balancing. While offshore balancing does advocate for restraint in international engagement, it does not necessarily entail complete isolation from the international system. Instead, it seeks to maintain influence through strategic intervention and diplomacy when necessary."
