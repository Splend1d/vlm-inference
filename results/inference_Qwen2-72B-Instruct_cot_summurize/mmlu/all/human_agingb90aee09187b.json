A loss of resources and slower processing speed - This refers to the reduced efficiency of cognitive processes and the brain's ability to allocate resources effectively. Older adults may have fewer resources available for tasks that require working memory, and their processing speed can slow down.\n\nC. A general decline in the ability to process information - This encompasses various aspects of cognitive function, such as attention, perception, and memory, which can all contribute to declines in working memory.\n\nD. A severe loss of neural connections and decreased blood flow - Age-related changes in the brain include the loss of synaptic connections and reduced cerebral blood flow, which can impair working memory function.\n\nWhile B (an increase in the inhibition of relevant information) might play a role in some cognitive declines, it is not typically associated specifically with the decline in working memory in older adults. Instead, it is often discussed in relation to the difficulty in inhibiting irrelevant information, which can also affect working memory performance.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer would be a combination of A, C, and D. However, if only one choice must be selected, then A (a loss of resources and slower processing speed) is perhaps the most directly related factor to the decline in working memory with advanced age."
