His temperature is 38.1\u00b0C (100.5\u00b0F), pulse is 95/min, respirations are 12/min, and blood pressure is 120/80 mm Hg. He appears malnourished. Rhonchi are heard at the left lower lobe of the lung on auscultation. Examination of the heart, lymph nodes, abdomen, and extremities shows no abnormalities. There is a 1-cm area of erythema over the sacrum with intact skin and no induration. Neurologic examination shows quadriparesis. Test of the stool for occult blood is negative. Which of the following is the most effective intervention for this patient's skin lesion?\n\nA. Frequent turning\nB. Use of wet to dry dressings\nC. Whirlpool therapy\nD. Broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy\n"

Frequent turning\n\nThis is a stage I pressure ulcer (also known as a pressure injury or bedsore). The primary goal in managing this type of lesion is to prevent it from progressing to more severe stages. Frequent repositioning is essential to relieve pressure on the affected area and promote healing. This involves turning the patient at least every two hours to redistribute body weight and avoid prolonged pressure on any one area.\n\nOptions B, C, and D are not indicated for the management of a stage I pressure ulcer:\n\nB. Use of wet to dry dressings is typically used for wounds with moderate to heavy exudate, which is not present in this case.\nC. Whirlpool therapy can be contraindicated in pressure ulcers due to the risk of infection and exacerbating tissue damage.\nD. Broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy is not warranted unless there is evidence of systemic infection or localized signs of infection such as redness, warmth, swelling, and purulent discharge around the wound. In this scenario, there is no indication of infection based on the description provided.\n\nIt is also important to ensure that the patient receives adequate nutrition and hydration, as well as regular assessment of the skin condition to monitor for changes and further interventions if necessary."
