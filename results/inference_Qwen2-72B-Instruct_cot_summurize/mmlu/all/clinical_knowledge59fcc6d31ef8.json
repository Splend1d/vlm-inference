One of the expected side effects of creatine use is an increase in body mass due to water retention in the muscles. This can lead to an increase in strength and muscle size over time as the body adapts to the increased availability of creatine for energy production during high-intensity exercise. While some individuals may experience other side effects such as muscle cramps or gastrointestinal distress, these are generally less common than the expected gain in body mass."
