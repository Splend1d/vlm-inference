This problem is decidable because we can simply compare the string w to the decimal expansion of \u03c0 up to the length of w. If they match, then w is a prefix of the decimal expansion of \u03c0; otherwise, it is not.\nII. Given a program and an input, is the program\u2019s output the decimal expansion of \u03c0? This problem is not decidable because it involves the halting problem. We cannot determine whether a program will halt or not in general, so we cannot determine whether its output will be the decimal expansion of \u03c0.\nIII. Given a program that takes as input a prefix of the decimal expansion of \u03c0, is the program\u2019s output always the same for every prefix? This problem is also not decidable. Even if we assume that the program halts on every input, we cannot determine whether the program's output will always be the same for every prefix of the decimal expansion of \u03c0. It could potentially behave differently for different prefixes."
