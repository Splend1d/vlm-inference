Over a year later, police detectives arrested a defendant after obtaining reliable information that the defendant was the robber who was responsible for killing the store's owner. Afterward, the defendant was taken to the station house where he was booked for the crime and then incarcerated. The next day, the prosecuting attorney made a decision to delay indictment until he could discover the identity of the defendant's accomplice. The defendant was then released from police custody. In this jurisdiction the statute of limitations for murder is five years. Five months later, the prosecuting attorney, after unsuccessfully attempting to secure information on the defendant's cohort, indicted the defendant, charging him with felony murder. Shortly before trial, the only eyewitness to the crime died. He would have testified that the defendant did not participate in the robbery. The defendant's motion to dismiss the indictment because of the delay between the date of the crime and the date of the indictment will most probably be\n\nA. granted, because the prosecutor is constitutionally required to press charges, if at all, within a reasonable time after probable cause is established.\nB. granted, because the delay in prosecuting the defendant actually prejudiced him.\nC. denied, because pre-indictment delay does not violate the Constitution, as long as it does not exceed an applicable statute of limitations.\nD. denied, because the delay was not excessive and was for a permissible purpose.\n"

Furthermore, the statute of limitations for murder in this jurisdiction is five years, which has not been exceeded. Additionally, while the death of the eyewitness could potentially prejudice the defendant's case, it does not necessarily mean that the delay caused this prejudice. If the eyewitness's testimony could have been secured earlier or if there were other means of securing the testimony (such as through a deposition), the court might still allow the case to proceed. However, the specific outcome would depend on the details of the case and the discretion of the judge."
