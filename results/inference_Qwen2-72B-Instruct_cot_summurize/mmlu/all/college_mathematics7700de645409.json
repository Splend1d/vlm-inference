In this case, we have:\n\nForce vector F = c(-1, 0, 1), where c is a constant with magnitude 1.\nPath r(t) = (t, t^2, t^3), for 0 \u2264 t \u2264 1.\n\nFirst, we find the differential displacement vector dr:\ndr/dt = (1, 2t, 3t^2)dt\n\nNow, we find the dot product of F and dr/dt:\nF\u00b7(dr/dt) = c(-1, 0, 1)\u00b7(1, 2t, 3t^2) = c(-1 + 0 + 3t^2)\n\nNext, we integrate this dot product over the interval [0, 1] to find the work done:\nW = \u222b[0 to 1] c(-1 + 3t^2)dt\n   = c[-t + t^3] evaluated from 0 to 1\n   = c[(-1 + 1) - (0)]\n   = c[0]\n\nHowever, since we know that |c| = 1, we need to consider the direction of c. Since F is parallel to (-1, 0, 1), the direction of c is also parallel to (-1, 0, 1). Therefore, the work done by F is:\n\nW = c[0] = |c| * cos(\u03b8)[0], where \u03b8 is the angle between F and dr/dt.\nSince F is parallel to (-1, 0, 1) and dr/dt is always in the direction of (1, 2t, 3t^2), the angle \u03b8 between F and dr/dt varies along the path. However, the dot product of F and dr/dt at any point along the path is always negative or zero, which means that the cosine of the angle between them is always non-positive. Therefore, the work done by F is:\n\nW = |c| * cos(\u03b8)[0] \u2264 0.\n\nAt t=0, the dot product is 0, and at t=1, the dot product is -1. Therefore, the work done by F is:\n\nW = \u222b[0 to 1] c(-1 + 3t^2)dt = [-1/4] evaluated from 0 to 1 = -1/4.\n\nSo the answer is A. -1/4."
