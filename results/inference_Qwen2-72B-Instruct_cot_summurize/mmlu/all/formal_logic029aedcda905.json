Some large apartments are bigger than some houses. \n\nExplanation: \nThe given proposition can be translated as \"There exists an x such that x is an apartment and x is large, and there exists a y such that y is a house and x is bigger than y.\" This means that there are some apartments that are large and bigger than some houses, which corresponds to option C. The other options do not accurately reflect the meaning of the given proposition. Option A reverses the relationship between apartments and houses, option B suggests that all large apartments are smaller than some houses, and option D does not specify that the apartments being compared are large."
