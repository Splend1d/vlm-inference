War is more likely to occur when a state is losing power, a decline in a state's ability to protect itself from attack, coercion and vulnerability increases its motivation to engage in aggressive behaviour.\nB. War may be more likely to occur in multipolar international systems where, among other reasons, states have the incentive and opportunity to buckpass.\nC. War is more likely when the offence-defence balance of the international system favours offence, thus creating a more competitive environment for states.\nD. All of these options.\n"

When a state perceives that it is losing power relative to others, it might be more inclined to engage in aggressive behavior as a preemptive strike or to secure its interests before its position deteriorates further.\n\nB. In a multipolar system, states may have incentives to avoid taking on burdens themselves (buckpassing) and instead encourage others to bear the costs of maintaining the balance of power. This can lead to misunderstandings, miscalculations, and potentially conflict if no state is willing to take action against an aggressor.\n\nC. When the offense-defense balance tilts toward offense, states may feel compelled to act aggressively to prevent being attacked or overwhelmed by adversaries. This creates a security dilemma where each state's actions to increase its own security can decrease the security of others, potentially leading to war.\n\nThus, all three conditions can contribute to the likelihood of war from a realist perspective."
