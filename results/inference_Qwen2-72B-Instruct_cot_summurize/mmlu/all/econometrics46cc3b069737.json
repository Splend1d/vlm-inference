The number of parameters to estimate may be large, resulting in a loss of degrees of freedom.\n\nIn a fixed effects model, an intercept is estimated for each individual (or entity) in the panel data set. If there are many individuals, this can result in a large number of parameters to estimate, which reduces the degrees of freedom available for estimating the coefficients on the other explanatory variables. This can lead to less precise estimates and wider confidence intervals. \n\nAnswer A is incorrect because while the fixed effects model may require some technical knowledge to estimate, this is not necessarily a disadvantage of the approach itself. \n\nAnswer B is incorrect because the fixed effects approach specifically addresses the issue of correlation between the composite error term and the explanatory variables by controlling for unobserved heterogeneity that is constant over time but varies across entities. \n\nAnswer D is incorrect because the fixed effects approach can capture both cross-sectional heterogeneity and temporal variation in the dependent variable, although it does not allow for the estimation of time-invariant variables."
