Carens is a prominent political theorist who defends a form of egalitarian cosmopolitanism, advocating for the rights of immigrants and a more just global order that recognizes the equal worth of all individuals regardless of their nationality or place of birth. His work often critiques the current international system, which he sees as privileging the interests of states and their citizens over the rights and needs of non-citizens, particularly migrants and refugees. Carens argues for more open borders and a redistribution of resources on a global scale to address inequalities between countries."
