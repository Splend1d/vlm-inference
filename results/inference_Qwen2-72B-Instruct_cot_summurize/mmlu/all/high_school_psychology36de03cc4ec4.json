The answer choices can jog a student's memory and help them recall the correct answer, even if they didn't remember it initially. This is in contrast to fill-in or completion questions, where students must generate the answer entirely on their own without any cues. However, it's important to note that multiple-choice questions may not always be better for assessing higher-order thinking skills, as they can sometimes be answered correctly through guessing or process of elimination."
