Residual magnetism of the generator.\n\nThe Ward-Leonard system uses a separately excited DC generator to power the armature of a DC motor. The field winding of the generator is controlled by a rheostat, which allows for smooth speed control of the motor. At very low speeds, the voltage generated by the generator due to residual magnetism may not be enough to overcome the back EMF of the motor, thus imposing a lower limit on the achievable speed. Adjusting the field current can help to overcome this limitation and achieve lower speeds. However, at very low speeds, the system may become unstable due to the high armature resistance and inductance, which can cause oscillations or \"hunting.\" But the primary limiting factor for the lower speed limit is indeed the residual magnetism of the generator."
