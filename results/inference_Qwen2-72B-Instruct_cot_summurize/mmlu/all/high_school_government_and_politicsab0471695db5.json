In the context of a member of the president's cabinet, \"gone native\" might be best described by option C: placing his or her department's priorities above the president's. This implies that the cabinet member has become too closely aligned with the interests and perspectives of the department they oversee, potentially at the expense of the broader policy goals of the administration they serve. However, it's important to note that the term \"gone native\" isn't a formal or universally agreed-upon political term, so its interpretation can vary."
