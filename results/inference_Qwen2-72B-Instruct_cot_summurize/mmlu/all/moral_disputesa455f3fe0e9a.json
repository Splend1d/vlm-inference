Therefore, the correct answer is A. Consequentialist theories focus on the outcomes or consequences of punishment, and aim to maximize overall well-being or happiness. They do not necessarily require that the punishment be proportional to the crime or that it treat the person as an end in themselves, although these may also be relevant considerations in some cases."
