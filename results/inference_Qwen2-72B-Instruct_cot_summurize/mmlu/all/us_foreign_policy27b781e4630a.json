At this conference, the IMF and the World Bank were established to promote international monetary cooperation and economic recovery after World War II. The US dollar was also pegged to gold, and other currencies were pegged to the dollar, effectively making it the world's reserve currency. GATT was established later, in 1947, to reduce trade barriers and promote free trade."
