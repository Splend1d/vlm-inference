In order to ensure the availability of sites for the disposal of spent fuel from the nuclear power plant, the state refused to supply electric power to out- of-state purchasers residing in states that would not accept spent fuel from the plant for storage or disposal. Assume that no federal statute applies. Which of the following is the strongest argument that the state's action is constitutional?\n\nA. A state may condition the sale to out-of-state purchasers of any products produced in that state on the willingness of those purchasers to bear the fair share of the environmental costs of producing those products.\nB. The generation of electricity is intrastate by nature and therefore subject to plenary state control.\nC. The state itself owns and operates the power system, and therefore its refusal to supply power to out-of-state purchasers is not subject to the negative implications of the commerce clause.\nD. The state's action is rationally related to the health, safety, and welfare of state citizens.\n"

The state itself owns and operates the power system, and therefore its refusal to supply power to out-of-state purchasers is not subject to the negative implications of the commerce clause.\n\nThis argument is the strongest because it addresses the issue of whether the state's actions violate the Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution, which generally prohibits states from discriminating against or unduly burdening interstate commerce. When a state acts as a market participant rather than a market regulator, it is generally exempt from the restrictions of the Commerce Clause. Since the state is operating the power system and making decisions regarding the sale of its own product (electricity), it can be argued that it is acting as a market participant and thus not subject to the negative implications of the Commerce Clause. However, this argument does not guarantee constitutionality, as courts may still consider other factors, including the impact on interstate commerce and the presence of any federal regulation that could preempt state action."
