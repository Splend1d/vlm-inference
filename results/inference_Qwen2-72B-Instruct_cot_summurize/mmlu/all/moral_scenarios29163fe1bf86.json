In Scenario 1, cheating on a test is considered unethical because it gives an unfair advantage and undermines the integrity of academic evaluation. In Scenario 2, firing a gun at a child's eye, even if hypothetically discussing a scenario at a shooting range, is abhorrent and morally reprehensible due to the potential for severe harm or death. It's important to note that shooting ranges typically have strict safety rules that prevent such actions from occurring."
