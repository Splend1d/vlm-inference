Are the future cash flows expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange?\n\nAn exchange has commercial substance when the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange. This means that the economic circumstances or operational aspects related to the assets being exchanged are different enough that the cash flows associated with the new asset will be significantly different from those of the old asset. If this is the case, any gains or losses from the exchange can be recognized immediately in the income statement."
