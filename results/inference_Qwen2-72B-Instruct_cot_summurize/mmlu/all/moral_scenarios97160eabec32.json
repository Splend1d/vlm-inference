This action violates their human rights and dignity, which is against ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nIn scenario 2, while urinating in public might be considered inappropriate or indecent, it is not necessarily \"clearly morally wrong\" in the same sense as scenario 1. It may be more of a social faux pas or a legal infraction depending on the circumstances, rather than a clear violation of moral standards. However, context matters greatly here; if there were no other options for using a restroom and no one was around, the action might be seen as less morally questionable than if there were people around or if there were easily accessible restrooms nearby. For the purposes of this question, we'll assume the action is more of a social norm violation than a clear-cut moral wrong."
