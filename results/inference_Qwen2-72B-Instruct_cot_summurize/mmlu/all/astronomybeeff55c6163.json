A neutral atom always has equal numbers of neutrons and protons.\n\nThis statement is not true because the number of neutrons in an atom's nucleus can vary independently of the number of protons, which defines the atomic number and thus the element. Atoms of the same element with different numbers of neutrons are called isotopes. For example, carbon-12 and carbon-14 are both isotopes of carbon (which has 6 protons), but they have 6 and 8 neutrons, respectively."
