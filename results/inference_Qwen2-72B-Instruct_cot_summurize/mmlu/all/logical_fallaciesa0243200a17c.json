This fallacy occurs when someone dismisses or minimizes another person's harm or suffering by pointing out something positive or beneficial that has come from the situation, suggesting that the harm isn't as bad as it seems because of this positive aspect. It can be seen as an attempt to console someone by trivializing their pain rather than addressing and validating their actual concerns or experiences."
