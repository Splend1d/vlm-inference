Indeed, for any positive integer $n$, the direct sum of $n$ copies of $\\mathbb{Z}$, denoted by $\\mathbb{Z}^{\\oplus n}$ or $\\mathbb{Z}^n$, is a free abelian group of rank $n$. Each element of this group can be uniquely written as a linear combination of the standard basis vectors with coefficients in $\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nStatement 2 is false. The Betti number of a finitely generated abelian group $G$ is defined as the maximal number of independent elements in $G$, which is the same as the rank of the free part of $G$. However, it is not necessarily equal to the number of elements in some generating set. For instance, consider the cyclic group $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}\\oplus \\mathbb{Z}$. This group is not free abelian because it contains torsion elements (elements of finite order), but it is finitely generated and has a generating set of two elements. However, its Betti number is only 1 since the free part is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}$. \n\nTherefore, the answer is C. True, False."
