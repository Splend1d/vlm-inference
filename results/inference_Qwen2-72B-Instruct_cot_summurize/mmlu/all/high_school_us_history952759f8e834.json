America's expansion to the West Coast was inevitable and divinely sanctioned.\n\nThe passage speaks of a \"far-reaching, the boundless future\" and an \"era of American greatness\" where the nation will \"manifest to mankind the excellence of divine principles.\" This language aligns with the concept of Manifest Destiny, which was the belief that the expansion of the United States across the North American continent was both justified and inevitable, often seen as a divine right or duty. The reference to \"the nation of many nations\" and the \"Union of many Republics\" also suggests the inclusion of various territories and peoples into a single, expansive American identity, consistent with the idea of territorial expansion."
