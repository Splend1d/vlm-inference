These included large complexes that housed temples, administrative buildings, and artisan workshops. The Huacas del Sol y la Luna (Temples of the Sun and the Moon) near Trujillo, Peru, are among the most famous of these complexes. The Huaca del Sol was once the largest adobe structure in pre-Columbian America.\n\nWhile some of the other options you listed are also significant archaeological sites or structures associated with other Mesoamerican civilizations, they were not built by the Moche:\n\nC. The Pyramid of the Sun is part of the Teotihuacan archaeological site in Mexico.\nD. The Temple of the Feathered Serpent (also known as the Temple of Quetzalcoatl) is also located at Teotihuacan."
