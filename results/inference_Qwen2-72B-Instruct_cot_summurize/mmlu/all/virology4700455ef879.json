Attention to handwashing and hygiene\n\nNorovirus is highly contagious and spreads easily through contaminated surfaces, food, and water, as well as person-to-person contact. The most effective way to control the spread of norovirus is through good personal hygiene practices, such as frequent handwashing with soap and water, especially after using the toilet and before eating or preparing food. While vaccines, quarantine measures, and antiviral drugs can be useful in controlling other diseases, currently there is no norovirus vaccine available, and antiviral drugs have not been proven effective against norovirus. Therefore, attention to handwashing and hygiene remains the most important measure for controlling norovirus outbreaks."
