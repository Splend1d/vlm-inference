Compressing the image in a way that may lose information but will suffer only a small loss of image quality.\nB. Creating the gray scale of an image by averaging the amounts of red, green, and blue in each pixel and assigning this new value to the corresponding pixel in the new image. The new value of each pixel represents a shade of gray, ranging from white to black.\nC. Creating the negative of an image by creating a new RGB triplet for each pixel in which each value is calculated by subtracting the original value from 255. The negative of an image is reversed from the original; light areas appear dark, and colors are reversed.\nD. Modifying part of the image by taking the pixels in one part of the picture and copying them to the pixels in another part of the picture.\n"

The negative of an image is reversed from the original; light areas appear dark, and colors are reversed.\n\nThis operation is reversible because you can take the negative of the transformed image again to get back the original image. Each pixel's RGB values are simply inverted, so no information is lost in the process."
