This statement is incorrect because the debt cannot be negative. The national debt represents the total amount of money the government owes, which is always a positive figure.\n- B. This statement is also incorrect because the relationship between the debt being positive and the deficit decreasing is not direct. The debt can increase even if the deficit is decreasing, as long as the government is still spending more than it earns.\n- C. This statement is incorrect because the deficit is not the accumulation of past debts. The deficit refers to the annual difference between what the government spends and what it earns in a fiscal year. The debt, on the other hand, is the accumulation of all past deficits minus any surpluses and other payments on the debt.\n- D. This statement is correct. When the government has a negative deficit, it means that it is earning more than it is spending in a given year. This results in a surplus, which can be used to pay down the existing debt, thus decreasing it."
