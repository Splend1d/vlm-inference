                    "text": "To find out at what constant speed the motor can lift up a 6 kg mass, we need to first calculate the power output of the motor. The input power is given by P = VI, where V is the voltage and I is the current. In this case, P = 120V * 1.0A = 120W. Since the efficiency of the motor is 75%, the output power is 0.75 * 120W = 90W.\n\nThe power output of the motor is also equal to the rate at which work is done, or dW/dt. If the motor is lifting a mass m at a constant speed v, then the work done is equal to the change in gravitational potential energy, which is given by \u0394U = mgh, where h is the height lifted. Since the speed is constant, we can write dU/dt = mgv. Therefore, the power output of the motor is also equal to mgv.\n\nSetting this equal to the output power of the motor, we have:\n\nmgv = 90W\n\nSolving for v, we get:\n\nv = 90W / (mg) = 90W / (6kg * 9.8m/s^2) \u2248 1.5 m/s\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. 1.5 m/s."
