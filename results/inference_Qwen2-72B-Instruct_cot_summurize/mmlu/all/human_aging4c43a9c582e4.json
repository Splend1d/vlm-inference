Personal concerns\n\nPersonal concerns, such as career, relationships, and health, tend to show the most change with age because they are closely tied to life stages and experiences that evolve over time. For example, a young adult might be primarily concerned with establishing a career and finding a romantic partner, while an older adult might be more focused on maintaining health and enjoying retirement. Traits, coping strategies, and identity also can change but often do so at a slower pace and may be more stable over the lifespan compared to personal concerns."
