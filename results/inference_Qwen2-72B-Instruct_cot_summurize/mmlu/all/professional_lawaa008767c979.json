An open elevator, which had been installed in the building by the elevator manufacturer, was used to haul workers and building materials between floors. While the worker was riding the elevator, it stalled between floors due to a manufacturing defect in the elevator. The worker called for assistance and was in no danger, but after waiting 15 minutes for help, he became anxious and jumped 12 feet to get out. He severely injured his back when he landed. In an action by the worker against the elevator manufacturer to recover for his back injury, is the worker likely to obtain a judgment for 100% of his damages?\n\nA. No, because such risks are inherent in construction work.\nB. No, because the worker was not in danger while on the stalled elevator. while on the stalled elevator.\nC. Yes, because the elevator stalled due to a manufacturing defect.\nD. Yes, because the worker was falsely imprisoned in the stalled elevator.\n"

Yes, because the elevator stalled due to a manufacturing defect.\n\nIn this scenario, the worker's injury is directly linked to a manufacturing defect in the elevator, which is a product liability issue. The elevator manufacturer could be held liable for the worker's injuries under strict liability or negligence theories if the defect made the elevator unreasonably dangerous and caused the worker's injury. However, the worker's decision to jump out may also be considered contributory negligence or assumption of risk, potentially reducing the amount of damages he can recover. Nonetheless, the question asks whether the worker is likely to obtain a judgment for 100% of his damages, and the primary cause of the injury\u2014the defective elevator\u2014puts the responsibility on the manufacturer. The other options do not accurately reflect legal principles that would apply to the situation."
