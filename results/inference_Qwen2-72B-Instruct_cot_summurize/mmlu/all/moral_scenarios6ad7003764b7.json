Leaving a dog at the park is animal abandonment, and baking one's friend's children is an act of violence and murder. However, it's important to note that scenario 2 seems to be a nonsensical statement and likely contains a metaphorical or literal error, as people cannot be \"baked.\" Assuming the intent was to convey harm or inappropriate action toward children, both scenarios would be considered wrong. Given the literal interpretation:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nHowever, due to the absurdity and likely error in scenario 2, a more accurate response might be:\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nBut with the understanding that scenario 2 is either a mistake or a hyperbolic statement not meant to be taken literally. If we take scenario 2 as a serious statement, then the answer would be A. Wrong, Wrong, acknowledging the issue with the phrasing."
