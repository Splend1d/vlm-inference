                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability that exactly three out of six dice show a prime number and the remaining three show a composite number.\n\nFirst, let's identify the prime and composite numbers on a 6-sided die:\n- Prime numbers: 2, 3, 5 (3 out of 6 possibilities)\n- Composite numbers: 4, 6 (2 out of 6 possibilities)\n- Note: 1 is neither prime nor composite, but it doesn't matter for this question since we're only interested in primes and composites.\n\nNext, we calculate the probabilities of rolling a prime or a composite number:\n- Probability of rolling a prime number = \\(P(\\text{prime}) = \\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{1}{2}\\)\n- Probability of rolling a composite number = \\(P(\\text{composite}) = \\frac{2}{6} = \\frac{1}{3}\\)\n\nWe want exactly three dice to show a prime number and the other three to show a composite number. The probability of any specific sequence of three primes followed by three composites would be:\n\\[P(\\text{specific sequence}) = P(\\text{prime})^3 \\times P(\\text{composite})^3 = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^3 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^3 = \\frac{1}{8} \\times \\frac{1}{27} = \\frac{1}{216}\\]\n\nHowever, there are multiple sequences where three dice can show prime numbers and the other three can show composite numbers. We need to calculate the number of ways to choose which three dice will show prime numbers out of the six dice rolled. This is a combination problem, which we can solve using the combination formula:\n\n\\[\n^nC_r = \\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(n\\) is the total number of items, \\(r\\) is the number of items to choose, and \"!\" denotes factorial.\n\nIn this case, \\(n=6\\) (the total number of dice) and \\(r=3\\) (the number of dice showing prime numbers), so:\n\n\\[\n^6C_3 = \\frac{6!}{3!(6-3)!} = \\frac{6 \\times 5 \\times 4}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 20\n\\]\n\nThus, there are 20 different sequences where exactly three dice show a prime number and the other three show a composite number. The probability of getting one of these sequences is:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{three primes and three composites}) = 20 \\times \\frac{1}{216} = \\frac{20}{216} = \\frac{5}{54}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **C. \\(\\frac{5}{54}\\)**."
