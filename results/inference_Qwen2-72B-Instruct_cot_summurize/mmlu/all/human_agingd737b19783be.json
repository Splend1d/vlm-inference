People who score high in agreeableness tend to be cooperative, compassionate, and have concern for the welfare of others. They also tend to take good care of themselves, which can manifest as self-care behaviors such as eating healthily, exercising regularly, getting enough sleep, and managing stress effectively.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that self-care is a complex behavior that can be influenced by multiple personality traits. For example, extraverted individuals might engage in social activities as part of their self-care routine, while conscientious individuals may follow strict routines to maintain their health. But among the options provided, agreeableness has the strongest positive correlation with self-care behaviors."
