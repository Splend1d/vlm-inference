Fibers, phloem parenchyma, companion cell, sieve tube\n\nHowever, it's important to note that fibers are not involved in the symplastic pathway for the movement of sucrose into the phloem. The typical symplastic pathway involves the movement of sucrose from the mesophyll cells directly into the phloem through phloem parenchyma cells, then into companion cells, and finally into sieve tubes. So, a more accurate answer would be:\n\nPhloem parenchyma, companion cell, sieve tube\n\nBut given the options provided, the closest one to the correct sequence is A, although it incorrectly includes fibers in the pathway."
