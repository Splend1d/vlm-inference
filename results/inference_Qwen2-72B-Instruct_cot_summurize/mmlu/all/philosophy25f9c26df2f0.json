None of the above.\n\nEpicurus believed that philosophy was essential for achieving a happy and tranquil life, and he encouraged its study by all people regardless of age. He founded a school of philosophy known as the Garden, where both men and women were admitted as students, and he emphasized the importance of living a simple, modest life in accordance with nature and reason. Epicurus held that philosophy should be both practical and enjoyable, and that it could provide guidance for every aspect of human life. Therefore, options A, B, and C do not accurately reflect his views on the role of philosophy."
