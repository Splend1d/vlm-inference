The Moon was once entirely molten.\n\nWhile it's true that the Moon likely experienced a period when it was largely or entirely molten, this fact alone does not specifically support the Giant Impact Hypothesis. The idea that the Moon was once a magma ocean can be consistent with other formation theories as well. However, when combined with other pieces of evidence like the similarity of oxygen isotopes between Earth and Moon rocks, which suggest a common origin, and the lack of volatile elements on the Moon (which would have been lost during a high-energy impact), the molten state of the Moon becomes more relevant to the Giant Impact Hypothesis. Still, in isolation, the statement \"The Moon was once entirely molten\" is not exclusive evidence for the Giant Impact Hypothesis. \n\nThe other options (A, B, and C) are indeed evidence that supports the Giant Impact Hypothesis:\n\nA. The relative size of the Moon to the size of Earth is large compared to most planets and their moons. This is unusual and suggests a different formation process than typical moons, which are usually much smaller relative to their parent planets.\n\nB. Most rocks on the Moon\u2019s surface are older than those on the Earth\u2019s surface. This indicates that the Moon formed early in the history of the solar system, consistent with the timing of the proposed giant impact event.\n\nC. The Moon has a much smaller iron core than the Earth even considering its size. This is expected if the Moon formed from material ejected during a giant impact, as lighter materials would have been more likely to be included in the debris that coalesced into the Moon."
