The increase in food production led to stored grains, which attracted rodents. Cats, being natural predators of rodents, were attracted to these settlements and began living in close proximity to humans. Over time, this relationship became mutually beneficial, with humans providing food and shelter for cats in exchange for pest control. This process was likely not intentional but rather an unintended consequence of human agricultural practices."
