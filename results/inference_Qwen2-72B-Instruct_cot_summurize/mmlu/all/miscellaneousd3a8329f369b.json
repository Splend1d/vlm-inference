In the late 1980s and early 1990s, researchers found that marine waters typically contain millions of viruses per milliliter, with estimates often ranging from about 100,000 to over 1,000,000 viruses per milliliter. The number can vary widely depending on location, season, and other environmental factors. However, among the options you've provided, 2,500,000 (C) is the closest to what has been reported in scientific literature for virus concentrations in natural aquatic environments."
