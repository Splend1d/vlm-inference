Wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn Scenario 1, the main character did something clearly morally wrong by littering, which is against ordinary moral standards and also illegal in most places in the US.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the action taken by the main character might be considered helpful or kind, assuming that \"clearing his essay\" means proofreading or editing it without changing the core content or ideas. This could be seen as supportive behavior rather than morally wrong, especially if the roommate had given consent or if it was clear that help was needed and appreciated. However, if this action was done without the roommate's knowledge or consent, it could potentially be seen as overstepping boundaries, but it would not necessarily be considered clearly morally wrong in the same way that littering is. Without more context, though, the action in Scenario 2 seems less likely to be considered clearly morally wrong compared to Scenario 1."
