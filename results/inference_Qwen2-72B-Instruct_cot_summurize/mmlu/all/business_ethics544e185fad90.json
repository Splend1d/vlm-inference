The numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 could represent different factors or aspects of complexity, but without further information, it's impossible to provide an accurate answer.\n\nIf you could clarify what each number represents in terms of the complexity of a theory (e.g., 1 = abstract concepts, 2 = number of variables, 3 = mathematical complexity, 4 = length of explanation), I would be able to help you better. Please provide more details so I can assist you appropriately."
