When he confronted her with it she laughed derisively, admitted to the adultery in sordid detail, and taunted him with insults. He got into a rage and killed her on the spot. In the trial for first degree murder, defense counsel asked for a jury charge of voluntary manslaughter. The trial judge refused. On appeal will the husband prevail on an argument that the facts justified a charge of voluntary manslaughter?\n\nA. No, voluntary manslaughter is only available when the adultery is witnessed in real time by the defendant.\nB. No, mere words are never a sufficient provocation to establish voluntary manslaughter.\nC. Yes, an admission of adultery always justifies a jury charge of voluntary manslaughter.\nD. Yes, there was sufficient provocation to justify a jury charge of voluntary manslaughter.\n"

Yes, there was sufficient provocation to justify a jury charge of voluntary manslaughter.\n\nThe key issue here is whether the provocation was adequate to reduce the charge from first-degree murder to voluntary manslaughter. Voluntary manslaughter typically involves a killing that occurs in the \"heat of passion\" due to adequate provocation. Adequate provocation can vary depending on jurisdiction, but it generally includes situations where a reasonable person would be provoked to lose self-control. \n\nIn this case, the husband discovered evidence of his wife's infidelity and confronted her about it. Her response\u2014admitting to the affair in detail and taunting him with insults\u2014could be seen as adequate provocation under the law in many jurisdictions. Therefore, it could be argued that the husband acted in the heat of passion and should have been given the option of a voluntary manslaughter charge.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the specifics of the law regarding adequate provocation and voluntary manslaughter can differ significantly based on jurisdiction. Some places may require that the provocation be witnessed in real-time, while others may consider the circumstances leading up to the confrontation. Additionally, the concept of \"mere words\" not being enough to constitute adequate provocation is often a factor in legal discussions, but the detailed admission of infidelity combined with taunts and insults could potentially cross that threshold depending on how the court interprets the situation."
