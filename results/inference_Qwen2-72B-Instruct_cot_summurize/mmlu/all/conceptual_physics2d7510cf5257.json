Electrons\n\nIn metals, thermal conduction is largely due to the movement of free electrons. In other materials, such as insulators, thermal conduction occurs through lattice vibrations (phonons) where the kinetic energy of atoms and molecules is transferred from one to another.\n\nHowever, since the question asks for the main component involved, and considering that in many conductive materials (like metals) electrons play a crucial role, option A is the most accurate answer among the given choices. Protons and neutrons (options B and C) do not significantly contribute to thermal conduction, and while ions can be involved in certain conditions (such as in ionic liquids or molten salts), they are not the primary agents in most solid materials."
