                    "text": "A man was under custodial interrogation as a suspect in the murder of a child. The police initially gave him a written list of his Miranda rights. They told him to read the list out loud, which he did. They then asked him if he understood the right to remain silent and to have a lawyer present and he nodded affirmatively. He refused to sign the writing but did not ask for an attorney. During the next three hours they interrogated him and got few answers; he was largely silent but did respond at times with a \"no\" or \"yes\" or a nod of the head. Then one of the detectives asked him if he was ready to ask God for forgiveness for killing the child. His eyes welled with tears and he said \"yes.\" This opened further questioning leading to his admission of guilt. He would not sign a written confession or a waiver of the right to remain silent. He was arrested for murder and moved to suppress the confession. Will the court suppress the confession as being involuntarily given?\n\nA. No, the circumstances indicate that he understood that he could stop the questioning and get a lawyer but he did not do so.\nB. No, whenever a written list of Miranda warnings is given to a suspect and he doesn't ask for a lawyer, this is proof that the suspect fully understands his rights.\nC. Yes, the confession must be suppressed because he was questioned for over three hours, making anything he said essentially involuntary.\nD. Yes, the use of religious deception to get a suspect to admit to crime renders the confession involuntary.\n"

The police's tactic of asking the suspect if he was ready to ask God for forgiveness for killing the child is considered coercive and manipulative, potentially exploiting the suspect's religious beliefs to elicit a confession. This can be seen as a violation of the suspect's Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination, and courts have often ruled that such tactics render confessions inadmissible as evidence.\n\nThe other options are incorrect because:\nA. While it is true that the suspect did not explicitly invoke his right to counsel or to remain silent, the use of religious appeals can still render a confession involuntary regardless of whether the suspect technically understood his rights.\nB. Giving a written list of Miranda warnings does not automatically ensure that a suspect fully understands his rights. The effectiveness of the warnings depends on various factors, including the suspect's mental state, education level, and understanding of legal terminology.\nC. The duration of the interrogation alone is not sufficient to determine whether a confession is involuntary. Courts consider multiple factors, including the methods used during the interrogation, the suspect's physical and mental condition, and any promises or threats made by law enforcement."
