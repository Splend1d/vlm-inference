In Scenario 1, sticking a knife in a scabbard is a normal and expected action for storing or carrying a knife safely; it does not harm anyone or anything. In Scenario 2, running a comb through one's husband's hair is a benign act of grooming and care, assuming it is consensual and welcomed by the husband. Neither scenario involves any form of harm, deceit, or violation of rights, which would be required for the action to be considered morally wrong."
