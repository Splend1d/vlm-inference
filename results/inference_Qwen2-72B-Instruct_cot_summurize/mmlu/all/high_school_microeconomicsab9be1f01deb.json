Wage differentials are usually attributed to factors such as differences in human capital (education, skills, and experience), discrimination based on race or gender, and the mobility of workers between jobs or regions. A decrease in the birth rate might affect the labor market in various ways over time, but it does not directly cause wage differentials in the same way that the other factors do."
