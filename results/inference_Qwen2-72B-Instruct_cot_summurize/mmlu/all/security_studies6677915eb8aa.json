Business networks\n\nWhile business networks can be affected by cyber-security issues, they do not form a core component of the technical discourse on cyber-security in the same way that computer experts, anti-virus industries, and computer networks do. Cyber-security is primarily concerned with the protection of computer systems, networks, and data from theft or damage, which involves technical aspects such as software vulnerabilities, encryption methods, and security protocols. Business networks may use these technologies, but they are not a concept specific to cyber-security."
