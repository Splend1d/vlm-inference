In a well-designed, well-conducted sample survey, sampling error is effectively eliminated.\n\nThis statement is false because sampling error cannot be completely eliminated; it can only be minimized. Sampling error occurs because we use a sample to estimate something about the population, and there will always be some degree of uncertainty associated with this estimation.\n\nB. In a well-designed observational study, responses are influenced through an orderly, carefully planned procedure during the collection of data.\n\nThis statement is false because observational studies do not manipulate variables or influence responses. Observational studies simply observe and record data without attempting to influence the outcomes. The purpose of a well-designed observational study is to minimize bias and confounding factors, not to influence responses.\n\nC. In a well-designed experiment, the treatments are carefully planned to result in responses that are as similar as possible.\n\nThis statement is false because the goal of a well-designed experiment is not to create similar responses but to determine the effect of one or more treatments on a response variable by comparing the results of different groups (e.g., treatment and control groups). The treatments are carefully planned to isolate their effects on the response variable and to ensure that any differences observed between groups are due to the treatment rather than other factors.\n\nTherefore, none of the statements provided are true."
