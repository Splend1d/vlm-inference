Wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn scenario 1, using someone else's toothbrush to clean the toilet is a clear violation of personal hygiene and respect for another person's property, which is considered morally wrong.\n\nIn scenario 2, locking a prisoner in their cell for the night could be part of standard prison procedures and may not be considered morally wrong if it is done in accordance with legal and ethical guidelines for the treatment of prisoners. However, this context is important and the morality could change depending on the circumstances (e.g., if the prisoner was being mistreated or unfairly imprisoned). Given the information provided, though, it appears to be a routine action that would not be considered morally wrong."
