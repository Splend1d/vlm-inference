Find the value of \\(t\\) when \\(y = 4\\).\n2. Calculate the derivative of \\(F(t)\\) with respect to \\(t\\) to find the slope of the tangent.\n3. Use the point-slope form of a line to write the equation of the tangent.\n\n### Step 1: Find \\(t\\) when \\(y = 4\\)\n\nGiven that \\(y = 2^t\\), we solve for \\(t\\) when \\(y = 4\\):\n\n\\[2^t = 4\\]\n\nTaking the logarithm base 2 on both sides:\n\n\\[\\log_2(2^t) = \\log_2(4)\\]\n\n\\[t = 2\\]\n\nSo, \\(t = 2\\) when \\(y = 4\\).\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the derivative of \\(F(t)\\)\n\nThe derivative of \\(F(t) = (t^2 + 1, 2^t)\\) is given by:\n\n\\[F'(t) = \\left(\\frac{d}{dt}(t^2 + 1), \\frac{d}{dt}2^t\\right)\\]\n\n\\[= (2t, 2^t \\ln 2)\\]\n\nAt \\(t = 2\\), the slope of the tangent line is:\n\n\\[F'(2) = (2*2, 2^2 \\ln 2) = (4, 4\\ln 2)\\]\n\nThe slope of the tangent line is the second component since it corresponds to the rate of change of \\(y\\) with respect to \\(x\\). Therefore, the slope of the tangent line at \\(t = 2\\) is \\(m = 4\\ln 2\\).\n\n### Step 3: Write the equation of the tangent\n\nWe have the slope \\(m = 4\\ln 2\\) and the point \\((x_0, y_0) = (t^2 + 1, 2^t) = (2^2 + 1, 4) = (5, 4)\\) when \\(t = 2\\).\n\nUsing the point-slope form of a line:\n\n\\[y - y_0 = m(x - x_0)\\]\n\nSubstituting the values we found:\n\n\\[y - 4 = 4\\ln 2(x - 5)\\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **B. \\(y \u2013 4 = 4\\ln 2(x \u2013 5)\\)**."
