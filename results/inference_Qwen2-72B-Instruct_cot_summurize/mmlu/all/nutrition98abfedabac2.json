The amount of protein an athlete needs can vary depending on factors such as the type and intensity of exercise, training status, and individual physiological differences. However, a commonly cited range for protein intake in athletes is:\n\nC. 1.2-1.7 g protein per kg bodyweight per day\n\nThis range is supported by guidelines from various sports nutrition organizations. For example, the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM), the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, and Dietitians of Canada jointly recommend that endurance athletes aim for 1.2-1.4 g/kg/day and strength/power athletes aim for 1.6-1.7 g/kg/day.\n\nIt's important to note that exceeding this range (option D) does not necessarily provide additional benefits and may be harmful or lead to unnecessary caloric intake. Conversely, consuming less than this range (options A and B) may not meet the increased protein needs of athletes. It's always recommended that athletes consult with a qualified sports dietitian or healthcare provider to determine their specific nutritional needs."
