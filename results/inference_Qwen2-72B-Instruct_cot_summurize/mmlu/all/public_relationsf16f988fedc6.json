This stage involves building credibility with the target audience, demonstrating that your product or service is dependable and worthy of their trust. Establishing reliability is crucial for long-term success in any advertising campaign, as it helps to build brand loyalty and positive word-of-mouth. While legitimacy and identity are also important aspects of branding and marketing, they do not specifically address the issue of being seen as trustworthy and believable. Agency, in this context, does not fit the description at all."
