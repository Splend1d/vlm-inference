The Pauli exclusion principle.\n\nIn helium, when two electrons occupy different orbitals with parallel spins (ortho-helium), they are not violating the Pauli exclusion principle because they are not occupying the same quantum state. However, when the electrons have antiparallel spins and occupy the same orbital (para-helium), they are more restricted by the Pauli exclusion principle, which leads to a higher energy state due to increased electron-electron repulsion. Therefore, the ortho-state has lower energy than the para-state."
