Recombining with another enterovirus\n\nPoliovirus, like other RNA viruses, can undergo genetic recombination when two different strains or types of the virus infect the same cell. This process can lead to the exchange of genetic material between the viral genomes, potentially resulting in a new strain that may have increased virulence or other altered properties. While mutations (A) and multiple nucleotide deletions and substitutions (D) can also contribute to increased virulence, recombination with another enterovirus is particularly significant because it can result in major changes in the viral genome in a single step. Altering the protein coat (C) could affect the virus's ability to bind to host cells, but this would not necessarily make the virus more virulent."
