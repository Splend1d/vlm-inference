The east-west orientation of the Alpine mountain system and the northern plains of western and central Europe enables marine-like climatic conditions to extend eastward into Germany and Poland. This is because the mountains act as a barrier to the cold polar air from the north, allowing warmer, moist air from the Atlantic Ocean to move eastward across the plains, moderating temperatures and increasing precipitation in these regions."
