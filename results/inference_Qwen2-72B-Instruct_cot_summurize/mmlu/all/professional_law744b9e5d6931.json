The contract contained a provision that clearly stated: \"This contract may not be assigned, and any violation of this prohibition voids the contract.\" After the contract was signed, the seller informed the buyer that the toasters would be manufactured by a competitor of the seller. Citing the non-assignment provision, the buyer claimed that it was no longer bound by the contract. Toasters manufactured by the competitor were of equal quality to toasters manufactured by the seller. Is the buyer bound by the contract?\n\nA. No, because \"this contract may not be assigned\" means that duties may not be delegated, and the seller delegated a duty.\nB. No, because the seller assigned a right despite the contractual prohibition.\nC. Yes, because even though the seller breached the contract, there are no damages since the competitor's toasters are of equal quality to the seller's toasters.\nD. Yes, because the non-assignment provision is not enforceable since public policy favors free assignment and delegation.\n"

No, because \"this contract may not be assigned\" means that duties may not be delegated, and the seller delegated a duty.\n\nThe non-assignment clause in the contract specifically prohibits the delegation of duties or obligations under the contract. By allowing a competitor to manufacture the toasters, the seller has effectively delegated its duty to perform under the contract, which is prohibited by the non-assignment clause. Therefore, the buyer is not bound by the contract because the seller violated a clear provision of the agreement. While the toasters may be of equal quality, the breach of the non-assignment clause is material and goes to the heart of the contract."
