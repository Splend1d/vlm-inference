Let's set up the equation with this information:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{3} = 2^{-t/8} \\]\n\nSolving for \\(t\\), we get:\n\n\\[ 2^{-t/8} = \\frac{1}{3} \\]\n\nTaking logarithms on both sides:\n\n\\[ -\\frac{t}{8} \\log(2) = \\log(\\frac{1}{3}) \\]\n\n\\[ t = -8 \\frac{\\log(\\frac{1}{3})}{\\log(2)} \\]\n\n\\[ t = -8 \\frac{-\\log(3)}{\\log(2)} \\]\n\n\\[ t = 8 \\frac{\\log(3)}{\\log(2)} \\]\n\nUsing a calculator to evaluate the logarithms:\n\n\\[ t \\approx 8 \\times \\frac{0.4771}{0.3010} \\]\n\n\\[ t \\approx 8 \\times 1.585 \\]\n\n\\[ t \\approx 12.68 \\]\n\nTherefore, it will take approximately 12.68 years for two thirds of the substance to decay. The correct answer is D. 12.68."
