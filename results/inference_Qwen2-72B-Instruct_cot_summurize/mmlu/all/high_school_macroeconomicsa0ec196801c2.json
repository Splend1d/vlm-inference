England: 2 pounds for 1 Big Mac. With an exchange rate of 0.5 British Pounds per dollar, this means 1 dollar = 2 pounds. So, 2 pounds / 2 pounds per dollar = $1 per pound * 2 pounds = $2. However, since the calculation should be based on converting pounds to dollars, you do it as follows: 2 pounds * (1 dollar / 0.5 pounds) = $4.\n\nC. Mexico: 50 pesos for 1 Big Mac. With an exchange rate of 10 Mexican Pesos per dollar, this means 1 dollar = 10 pesos. So, 50 pesos / 10 pesos per dollar = $5.\n\nD. China: 200 yuan for 1 Big Mac. With an exchange rate of 100 Chinese Yuan per dollar, this means 1 dollar = 100 yuan. So, 200 yuan / 100 yuan per dollar = $2.\n\nComparing these prices, the Big Mac is most expensive in Mexico at $5.\n\nThe correct answer is C. Mexico ($5)."
