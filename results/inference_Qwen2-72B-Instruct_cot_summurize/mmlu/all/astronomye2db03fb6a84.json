                    "text": "The length of a solar day on a planet can be calculated using the formula:\n\nSolar day = (Orbital period / Rotation period) * Sidereal day\n\nFor Planet X, the orbital period is 100 Earth days, the rotation period is also 100 Earth days, and the sidereal day is 100 Earth days. Substituting these values into the formula gives:\n\nSolar day = (100 / 100) * 100 = 100 Earth days\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. About 100 Earth days. However, it's worth noting that this calculation assumes that the planet's orbit and rotation are perfectly synchronized, which may not necessarily be the case in reality. If the planet's rotation and orbit are not synchronized, then the length of a solar day could be different from the calculated value. But based on the information given in the question, the answer is B. About 100 Earth days. \n\nHowever, the correct answer is actually D. There is no solar day on Planet X because the planet's rotation period is equal to its orbital period, meaning that one side of the planet always faces the star while the other side always faces away. This phenomenon is known as tidal locking, and it results in a permanent day side and night side on the planet, with no true solar day."
