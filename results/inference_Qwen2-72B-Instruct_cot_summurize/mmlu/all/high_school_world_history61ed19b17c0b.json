The population increased due to the increased diversity of crops.\n\nThe introduction of new crops from the Americas and other regions into Europe led to an increase in agricultural productivity and food variety. This, in turn, contributed to population growth as people had access to a more diverse and potentially more nutritious diet. The new crops also helped to reduce the risk of famine and improved overall food security."
