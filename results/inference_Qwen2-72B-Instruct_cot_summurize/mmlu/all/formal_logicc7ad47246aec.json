The conclusion is \"T \u2283 U\", so assuming it's false means T is true and U is false.\n\nPremises:\n1. (T \u00b7 ~U) \u2283 ~W\n2. ~W \u2283 X\n3. ~Z \u2283 W\n4. ~(X \u00b7 Z)\n\nConclusion: T \u2283 U\n\nLet's analyze the truth values of the premises given T is true and U is false:\n\n1. Since T is true and U is false, (T \u00b7 ~U) is true. For premise 1 to hold, ~W must also be true, meaning W must be false.\n2. Since ~W is true (from premise 1), for premise 2 to hold, X must be true.\n3. Since W is false (from premise 1), for premise 3 to hold, ~Z must be true, meaning Z must be false.\n4. Given X is true (from premise 2) and Z is false (from premise 3), (X \u00b7 Z) is false, which satisfies premise 4.\n\nSo, all the premises are satisfied under the conditions that T is true, U is false, W is false, X is true, and Z is false. This does not lead to a contradiction with our assumptions about T and U, indicating that the argument is invalid under these conditions.\n\nThe counterexample is when T and X are true and U, W, and Z are false. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Invalid. Counterexample when T and X are true and U, W, and Z are false."
