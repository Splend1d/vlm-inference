The owner was subsequently arrested and charged with violating the state obscenity law. At his trial, the owner's defense was that the sale of the materials complained of was constitutionally protected speech. Which of the following, if established, would be most helpful to the owner's defense?\n\nA. The particular materials involved depicted normal, not deviant, sexual conduct.\nB. The particular materials involved consisted of serious scientific studies of human sexual urges.\nC. The police did not have a search warrant when they entered the bookstore to purchase the particular materials involved in this obscenity prosecution.\nD. 85% of the citizens of the state believe that the sale of sexually explicit material does not contribute to antisocial sexual behavior.\n"

                    "text": "The most helpful fact to the owner's defense would be B. The particular materials involved consisted of serious scientific studies of human sexual urges.\n\nUnder U.S. law, as established by the Supreme Court in cases such as Miller v. California (1973), material is not obscene if it has serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value. This means that even if the material is sexually explicit, if it can be shown to have serious scientific value, it would be protected under the First Amendment as free speech. In this case, if the materials were indeed serious scientific studies of human sexual urges, they could potentially be exempt from being classified as obscene and therefore protected from prohibition under the state obscenity law. \n\nOptions A and D might influence public opinion or the jury's perception of the material's value, but they do not directly address the legal standards set forth in obscenity law. Option C pertains to the legality of the police action, which could potentially lead to the suppression of evidence if the search and seizure were deemed unconstitutional, but it does not address the constitutionality of the sale of the materials themselves."
