Since the capacitors are identical, they will have the same capacitance, \\(C\\).\n\nInitially, the charge on the first capacitor is \\(Q = CV_0\\). When the first capacitor is connected to the two others, the total charge is conserved, but it is now distributed among three capacitors. Let's denote the final voltage across each of the capacitors as \\(V_f\\). Since the two capacitors are in series, their combined capacitance is \\(C/2\\). Thus, the equivalent capacitance when all three capacitors are considered is \\(C + C/2 = 3C/2\\).\n\nThe total charge remains the same before and after the connection, so we can write:\n\\[ Q = (3C/2) V_f \\]\n\nSince \\(Q = CV_0\\), we substitute \\(Q\\) into the equation:\n\\[ CV_0 = (3C/2) V_f \\]\n\nSolving for \\(V_f\\), we get:\n\\[ V_f = \\frac{2}{3} \\cdot \\frac{CV_0}{C} = \\frac{2}{3} V_0 \\]\n\nThus, the final voltage on the first capacitor is \\(\\boxed{\\text{D. } 2V_0/3}\\)."
