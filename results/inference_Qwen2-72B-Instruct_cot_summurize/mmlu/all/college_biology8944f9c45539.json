NER is responsible for repairing bulky DNA lesions, such as thymine dimers, which are formed when UV light causes covalent bonds to form between adjacent pyrimidine bases, predominantly thymine. Individuals with XP have an impaired ability to repair these thymine dimers, leading to an increased risk of skin cancer and other disorders associated with sun exposure.\n\nWhile the other types of DNA damage listed (deamination of cytosine, depurination, and single-strand breaks) can occur in the genome, they are not specifically associated with the pathology of xeroderma pigmentosum. These lesions are typically repaired by other DNA repair pathways, such as base excision repair (BER) or double-strand break repair mechanisms."
