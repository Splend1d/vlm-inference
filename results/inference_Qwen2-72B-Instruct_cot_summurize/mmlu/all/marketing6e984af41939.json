Customer participation and environmental relationship.\n\nPine and Gilmore's four realms of experience are based on the dimensions of customer participation and environmental relationship. These dimensions create a matrix with two axes: the degree of customer participation in the experience, ranging from passive to active, and the degree of environmental relationship, ranging from real to transformed. The four resulting realms are: education (high participation, high environmental transformation), escapism (low participation, high environmental transformation), entertainment (low participation, low environmental transformation), and esthetic (high participation, low environmental transformation)."
