The homeowner paid the contractor only $20,000, truthfully saying that she did not like the finish on the cabinets and was therefore not satisfied. If the contractor sues the homeowner for the balance of the contract price, will the contractor be likely to prevail?\n\nA. No, because a condition to the homeowner's obligation to pay was not satisfied.\nB. No, because the contractor breached his duty of good faith and fair dealing by supplying unsatisfactory materials.\nC. Yes, because the homeowner breached the covenant of good faith and fair dealing by rejecting the cabinets without justification.\nD. Yes, because the homeowner was the first party to breach the contract.\n"

Yes, because the homeowner breached the covenant of good faith and fair dealing by rejecting the cabinets without justification.\n\nThe clause \"subject to the homeowner's complete personal satisfaction\" is often interpreted as a subjective standard, but it is limited by the requirement of good faith. This means that the homeowner cannot withhold payment arbitrarily or capriciously; there must be a reasonable basis for dissatisfaction. If the work performed by the contractor met industry standards and there were no defects beyond normal variations in taste or preference, the homeowner's withholding of payment could be seen as a breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. The contractor would have to demonstrate that the work was done properly and that the homeowner's dissatisfaction was not justified under the circumstances."
