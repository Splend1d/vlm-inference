Taking out the trash, including used paper plates, is a routine household task and not morally questionable. Purchasing diamonds from a jeweler is also not inherently morally wrong, assuming the transaction is legal and ethical (e.g., the diamonds are not conflict diamonds). Without additional context suggesting illegal or unethical behavior, neither scenario involves an action that would be considered clearly morally wrong."
