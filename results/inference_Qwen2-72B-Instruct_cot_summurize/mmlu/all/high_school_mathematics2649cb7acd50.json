To find the degree of $h(x)$, we need to consider which of these three terms will have the highest degree, as the degree of the entire expression will be determined by the term with the highest degree.\n\nComparing the expressions for the degrees of the three terms, we see that $6n$ could potentially be the highest if $n > 6$. Therefore, the degree of the polynomial $h(f(x))$ could be the one determining the overall degree of $f(g(x)) + g(h(x)) + h(f(x))$.\n\nSetting $6n = 36$ gives us $n = 6$. However, this does not automatically imply that $6n$ (or $h(f(x))$) is the term with the highest degree, because $3n$ (or $g(h(x))$) could also equal $36$ if $n = 12$. \n\nGiven the options, we can rule out $n=6$ since it would make $6n = 36$, but $3n$ (for $n=6$) would only be $18$, which is not the degree of the final polynomial. The only option that ensures $6n$ or $3n$ matches the degree of the final polynomial is when $n=12$, making $6n=72$ and $3n=36$. However, since the degree of the entire expression is specified to be $36$, and knowing that the degree is determined by the term with the highest degree, the correct interpretation is that $3n=36$ is the term determining the overall degree.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is $n = 12$, which corresponds to choice D."
