This is in contrast to inferior goods, which have a negative income elasticity of demand. The demand curve for normal goods can be either elastic or inelastic, depending on other factors such as the availability of substitutes and the proportion of income spent on the good. Similarly, the supply curve for normal goods can be elastic or inelastic based on production costs and other factors."
