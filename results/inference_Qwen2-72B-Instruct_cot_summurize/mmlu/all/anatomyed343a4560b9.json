During gastrulation, the single-layered blastula is transformed into a three-layered structure (triploblast) consisting of an outer layer called the ectoderm, a middle layer called the mesoderm, and an inner layer called the endoderm. This process sets the stage for further development of the organism's body plan. Neurulation, which follows gastrulation, involves the formation of the neural tube from the ectodermal layer."
