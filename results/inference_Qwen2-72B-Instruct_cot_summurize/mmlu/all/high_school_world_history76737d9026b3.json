The Safavids did not reject all central tenets of Islam; rather, they promoted a different interpretation of it. The Safavids were a Shia dynasty, and their promotion of Twelver Shiism was seen as heretical by the Sunni majority in the Ottoman and Mughal Empires. This religious difference was a significant source of conflict between the Safavids and their Sunni neighbors. The quote provided emphasizes the Ottomans' concern over what they perceived as heresy and innovation within the Safavid Empire."
