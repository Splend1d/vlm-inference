International society consists of a constellation of sovereign States and other international organizations, which are dispersed in a rather horizontal order of authority.\n\nThis answer best describes the structure of international society. While there are certainly power dynamics at play, the key feature of the international system is the sovereignty of states, which means that no single state has authority over another. This creates a horizontal order of authority where states interact as equals, even if they have vastly different levels of power or influence. International organizations, such as the United Nations, exist to facilitate cooperation between states but do not have authority over them. This horizontal structure is often referred to as \"anarchy\" in the sense that there is no overarching authority governing the interactions between states, but it does not mean that there is no order or structure at all."
