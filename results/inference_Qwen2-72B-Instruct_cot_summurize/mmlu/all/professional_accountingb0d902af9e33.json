                    "text": "To determine the impact on Sussman Co.'s cash-basis income when restating to the accrual basis, we need to consider the differences between cash and accrual accounting principles.\n\nCash-basis accounting recognizes revenues when cash is received and expenses when they are paid. Accrual-basis accounting recognizes revenues when earned (regardless of when cash is received) and expenses when incurred (regardless of when they are paid).\n\nGiven the information:\n\n- Credit sales of $5,600 were made in January but not collected yet. Under accrual accounting, this revenue would be recognized immediately.\n- Collections of $1,900 relating to January credit sales. This amount was already included in cash-basis income.\n- Accrued salaries of $1,200 were incurred but not yet paid. Under accrual accounting, this expense would be recognized immediately.\n\nThe difference in income under the accrual basis compared to the cash basis can be calculated as follows:\n\n1. Add the credit sales that have not been collected yet ($5,600) since they would be recognized as revenue under the accrual method but not under the cash method.\n2. Subtract the accrued salaries ($1,200) since they would be recognized as an expense under the accrual method but not under the cash method until paid.\n\nThus, the increase in income from restating to the accrual basis would be:\n\n$5,600 (credit sales) - $1,200 (accrued salaries) = $4,400\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\nC. $4,400"
