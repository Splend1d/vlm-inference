Prosperity ripened the principle of decay; the causes of destruction multiplied with the extent of conquest; and, as soon as time or accident had removed the artificial supports, the stupendous fabric yielded to the pressure of its own weight. . . . The victorious legions, who, in distant wars, acquired the vices of strangers and mercenaries, first oppressed the freedom of the republic, and afterwards violated the majesty of the purple. The emperors, anxious for their personal safety and the public peace, were reduced to the base expedient of corrupting the discipline which rendered them alike formidable to their sovereign and to the enemy; the vigour of the military . . . was relaxed . . . ; and the Roman world was overwhelmed by a deluge of Barbarians.\n\u2014Adapted from Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, by Edward Gibbon\nThe reasons given in the above passage for the fall of the Roman Empire could also be applied to which other classical empires?\n\nA.

Both the Han and Gupta empires, like Rome, experienced a decline due to overextension, internal decay, loss of military discipline, and invasions by barbarian groups.\n\nThe Han Dynasty in China (206 BCE - 220 CE) faced similar problems. After reaching its height under Emperor Wu, the Han began to decline due to corruption, the loss of central authority, and the rise of powerful regional warlords. Military discipline deteriorated, and the empire became vulnerable to invasions by nomadic tribes such as the Xiongnu.\n\nSimilarly, the Gupta Empire in India (c. 320-550 CE), often referred to as the \"Golden Age\" of India, also suffered from overextension, internal strife, and invasions. The Gupta emperors struggled to maintain control over their vast territories, and the weakening of the central government allowed for the rise of local powers and the eventual invasion by the Hunas (related to the Huns who also contributed to the fall of Rome).\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\nC. Han and Gupta"
