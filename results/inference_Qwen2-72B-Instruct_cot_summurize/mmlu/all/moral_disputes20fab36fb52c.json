Vindictive protectiveness refers to the practice of shielding students from speech or ideas that might be considered offensive or harmful, which can create an environment where students are not exposed to diverse viewpoints and may become overly sensitive to perceived slights. This can lead to a lack of resilience and critical thinking skills, making it more difficult for students to navigate the complexities of the real world and engage in productive dialogue with those who hold different beliefs."
