This practice is known as Naam Japna, which means \"to repeat the Name.\" It is considered one of the five daily duties prescribed by Guru Gobind Singh. By continuously repeating or meditating on the Divine Name, a Sikh seeks to purify their mind, detach from worldly desires, and merge their consciousness with the divine consciousness. This practice is central to achieving spiritual liberation in Sikhism. While meditating on the sacred hymns (option B) is also an important part of Sikh practice, it is often seen as a means to facilitate the remembrance of the Divine Name. Options C and D are not specifically mentioned as primary disciplines for spiritual liberation in Sikhism, although they may be considered part of a broader understanding of life and spirituality."
