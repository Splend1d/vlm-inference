One of the important components of this is the zone of proximal development. Which of the following statements accurately describes an individual in the zone of proximal development?\n\nA. A baseball player hits baseballs from a tee in order to build muscle memory.\nB. A concert flute player falls short of finishing a piece that has a very complex ending without mistakes\nC. A high school English student submits a paper for review by his professor.\nD. A high diver takes instruction from her coach to improve her form on a specific move.\n"

Therefore, the statement that best describes an individual in the ZPD is:\n\nD. A high diver takes instruction from her coach to improve her form on a specific move.\n\nThis scenario illustrates that the high diver is working within their ZPD because they are receiving guidance from a more knowledgeable other (the coach) to improve a skill that is just beyond their current capabilities. This type of guided learning is central to Vygotsky's theory of sociocultural development."
