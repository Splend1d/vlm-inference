Jericho is often cited as one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world, with evidence of a settled community dating back to around 8000 BCE. It had a complex social structure and was surrounded by a stone wall and tower, indicating a high level of organization and cooperation among its inhabitants.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that there were other early complex societies in different parts of the world that may predate Jericho, such as those in Mesopotamia and Egypt. But among the options provided, Jericho is the earliest."
