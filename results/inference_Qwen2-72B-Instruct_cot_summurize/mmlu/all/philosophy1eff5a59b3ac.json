She suggests that a life devoted solely to fulfilling one's duties or maximizing happiness may lack meaning or personal fulfillment. Instead, she proposes the concept of a \"meaningful life,\" which involves pursuing projects or activities that are intrinsically valuable and engaging in relationships with others.\n\nGiven this perspective, it would seem that Wolf does not fully endorse any of the options given. However, if we had to choose, option C might be the closest, but it needs to be qualified. Wolf would likely argue that while morality can provide some guidance on how to live, it should not be the only consideration. A meaningful life also involves pursuing personal interests and values that may not always align with traditional moral norms.\n\nSo, the answer would be D. None of the above, as Wolf's view is more nuanced than any of the options provided."
