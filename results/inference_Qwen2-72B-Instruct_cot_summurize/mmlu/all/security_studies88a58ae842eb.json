Security studies creates and perpetuates claims that shape warfare, defining legitimacy, favouring some subjects and marginalising others.\n\nPost-structuralists critique traditional security studies for reinforcing power structures and narratives that serve dominant interests while excluding alternative perspectives. They argue that security studies can contribute to the construction of threats, enemies, and legitimate forms of violence, thereby shaping the very conflicts it purports to study. This process can lead to the marginalization of certain groups or issues, as well as the perpetuation of unequal power relations."
