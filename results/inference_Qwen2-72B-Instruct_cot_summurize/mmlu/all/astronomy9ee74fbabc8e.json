The correct answer among the options given is:\n\nC. There are many geologic features on Mars that are difficult to explain unless liquid water was once stable at the surface.\n\nThis includes river valleys, lake beds, mineral deposits indicative of aqueous environments, and features that resemble glaciers or ground ice. These features suggest that Mars had a thicker atmosphere and higher temperatures in the ancient past, allowing for liquid water to exist on the surface.\n\nWhile A, B, and D also contain elements of truth, they are not the primary reasons scientists believe Mars was once warmer and wetter:\n\nA. Mars does show evidence of significant volcanism, but this alone does not necessarily imply that the climate was warmer and wetter. Volcanic activity can contribute to warming through greenhouse gases, but it is not the main reason for thinking Mars had a warmer climate.\n\nB. Early observations of Mars did indeed include speculations about changing vegetation and canals, but these were largely discredited and are not considered reliable evidence for a warmer, wetter Mars. The idea of canals was based on misinterpretations of telescopic observations.\n\nD. While it is true that planets cool over time, this statement is too generalized to specifically apply to Mars and does not account for the specific evidence found on the Martian surface that indicates past warmth and moisture."
