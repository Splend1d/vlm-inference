Hydrogen.\n\nThe average speed of gas molecules in a mixture can be determined using the formula for the root mean square speed (\\(v_{rms}\\)) of a gas molecule, which is:\n\n\\[ v_{rms} = \\sqrt{\\frac{3RT}{M}} \\]\n\nwhere \\(R\\) is the ideal gas constant, \\(T\\) is the absolute temperature, and \\(M\\) is the molar mass of the gas.\n\nSince the temperature (\\(T\\)) is the same for all gases in the mixture, the only variable that affects the speed of the molecules is the molar mass (\\(M\\)). The smaller the molar mass, the greater the average speed of the molecules.\n\nThe molar masses of hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen are approximately 2 g/mol, 32 g/mol, and 28 g/mol, respectively. Therefore, hydrogen, with the smallest molar mass, will have the highest average speed among the three gases."
