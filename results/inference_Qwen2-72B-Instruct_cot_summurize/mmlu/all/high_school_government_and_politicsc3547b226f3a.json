It absolves the individual of any penalties or punishments associated with the conviction, including any legal disabilities resulting from the conviction. A reprieve, on the other hand, is a temporary suspension of a sentence, typically capital punishment, but it can also apply to other sentences. It does not forgive the crime or the sentence; it merely delays its execution."
