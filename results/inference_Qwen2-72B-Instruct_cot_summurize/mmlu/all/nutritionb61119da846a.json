However, it's important to note that these patterns can vary based on various factors such as age, income, and education level.\n\nAs of the latest data available from the NDNS (2018/2019), it was found that:\n\nA. Meat consumption in Wales and Scotland is generally similar to other parts of the UK, although there may be differences in types of meat consumed (e.g., more lamb in Scotland).\n\nB. Confectionary consumption in Wales and Scotland is not necessarily lower than in other parts of the UK. In fact, some studies have suggested that confectionary intake may be higher in certain areas of Scotland due to cultural and socioeconomic factors.\n\nC. Fruit and vegetable consumption tends to be lower in Wales and Scotland compared to the recommended daily intake. According to the NDNS, only around 27% of adults in Wales and 24% of adults in Scotland met the \"5-a-day\" recommendation for fruit and vegetable intake in 2018/2019.\n\nD. Potato consumption in Wales and Scotland is relatively high, reflecting traditional dietary patterns in these regions. However, this does not necessarily mean that other food groups are consumed in lower quantities.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, the answer to your question would be C. Fruits and vegetables. However, it's important to note that dietary patterns can vary widely within regions and that individual differences in diet should also be taken into account."
