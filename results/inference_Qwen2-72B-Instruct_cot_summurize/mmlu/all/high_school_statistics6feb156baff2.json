This means that if you triple the sample size (i.e., multiply it by 3), the width of the confidence interval will be divided by the square root of 3.\n\nThe square root of 3 is approximately 1.732. Therefore, tripling the sample size will divide the interval size by approximately 1.732.\n\nSo the correct answer is:\n\nD. It divides the interval size by 1.732."
