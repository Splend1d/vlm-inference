Risk factors for eating disorders include psychological factors (like perfectionism), sociocultural factors (like dieting during adolescence and parental attitudes or behaviors), and biological factors. However, simply being female does not inherently increase one's risk for an eating disorder; rather, it is the interplay of various factors that can contribute to the development of such disorders."
