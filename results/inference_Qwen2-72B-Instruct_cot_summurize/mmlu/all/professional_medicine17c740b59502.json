Avoids the concern for reversion to virulence\n\nKilled (inactivated) vaccines contain pathogens that have been killed, so there is no risk of the virus reverting to a virulent form and causing disease in the vaccinated individual. This is a significant advantage over live attenuated vaccines, which use weakened forms of the virus that can, albeit rarely, revert to a virulent state. For a newly identified virus causing a severe respiratory illness, avoiding any risk of causing disease through vaccination is crucial."
