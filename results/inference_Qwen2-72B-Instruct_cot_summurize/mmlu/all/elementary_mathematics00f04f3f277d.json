This is because this group is more likely to represent the overall audience attending the game, which includes fans of both teams as well as neutral spectators. The other options involve biased samples that may not accurately reflect the preferences of the entire crowd. For example, A. only surveys the cheerleaders for the home team, B. only surveys people wearing hats for the visiting team, and D. excludes people who live in the home team's city, potentially missing a large portion of the home team's fan base."
