Because \\(H\\) is normal, \\(k_1h_2k_1^{-1} \\in H\\), so \\((h_1k_1)(h_2k_2)\\) can be written as \\(h_3k_3\\) for some \\(h_3 \\in H\\) and \\(k_3 \\in K\\), thus remaining in \\(HK\\).\n\n- Identity: Since both \\(H\\) and \\(K\\) contain the identity element \\(e\\) of \\(G\\), \\(HK\\) also contains \\(e\\).\n\n- Inverses: Given any \\(hk \\in HK\\), since \\(H\\) is normal, there exist \\(h' \\in H\\) and \\(k' \\in K\\) such that \\((hk)^{-1} = k^{-1}h^{-1} = h'k'\\). Thus, inverses are contained in \\(HK\\).\n\nTherefore, if one of the subgroups (\\(H\\) in our case) is normal in \\(G\\), then \\(HK\\) is indeed a subgroup of \\(G\\).\n\n**Verdict:** **True**\n\n### Statement 2\n\n\"All groups of order \\(p^2\\) where \\(p\\) is prime are Abelian.\"\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n- Let \\(G\\) be a group of order \\(p^2\\), where \\(p\\) is a prime number.\n- By the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow \\(p\\)-subgroups (subgroups of order \\(p\\)) divides \\(p\\) and is congruent to 1 modulo \\(p\\).\n- This implies there exists at least one Sylow \\(p\\)-subgroup, say \\(H\\), which is of order \\(p\\).\n- Since \\(|G| = p^2\\) and \\(|H| = p\\), by Lagrange's theorem, the index of \\(H\\) in \\(G\\) is \\(p\\), which is the smallest prime divisor of \\(|G|\\).\n- According to a well-known result, if the index of a subgroup is the smallest prime dividing the order of the group, then the subgroup is normal. Therefore, \\(H \\trianglelefteq G\\).\n- Let \\(K\\) be another subgroup of \\(G\\) of order \\(p\\). Since the intersection of \\(H\\) and \\(K\\) must have order dividing both \\(|H| = p\\) and \\(|K| = p\\) (and cannot be all of \\(H\\) or \\(K\\) because they have the same order), their intersection is trivial (\\(\\{e\\}\\)).\n- Since \\(|H| = |K| = p\\) and \\(|H \\cap K| = 1\\), we have \\(|HK| = |H||K|/|H \\cap K| = p^2\\). This means \\(G = HK\\).\n- Since \\(H\\) and \\(K\\) are both abelian (as they are of prime order) and their intersection is trivial, \\(G\\) is the direct product of \\(H\\) and \\(K\\), which is abelian.\n\n**Verdict:** **True**\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe correct answer is **A. True, True**."
