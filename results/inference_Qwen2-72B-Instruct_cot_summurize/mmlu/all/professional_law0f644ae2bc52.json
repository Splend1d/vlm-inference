The newborn calves need constant attention and care. One day one of the employees inadvertently leaves the fence door open and a newly-born calf breaks free and goes to his neighbor's land. The breeder went to the neighbor's land to retrieve the calf for its safety and to make sure it was unharmed. However, he was arrested on a trespass charge after entering the land. The breeder appealed. Will the court dismiss the charge?\n\nA. Yes, because he had a limited privilege to enter the land to prevent harm to his chattel.\nB. Yes, because the tender pet doctrine allows temporary entry to retrieve baby animals.\nC. No, because the neighbor had a right to keep any living chattels that crossed onto his land.\nD. No, because his status as a breeder made him unqualified for a limited license.\n"

Yes, because he had a limited privilege to enter the land to prevent harm to his chattel.\n\nThe law generally recognizes that owners have a certain privilege to enter neighboring property under limited circumstances to recover or prevent harm to their property, including livestock. This privilege is often referred to as \"chasing one's chattel.\" Since the breeder was attempting to retrieve his calf, which is considered personal property, and was doing so to prevent harm to the animal, he likely had a legal justification for his actions. However, the specifics of the case, such as the reasonableness of the entry, whether there was an alternative method of retrieval, and the laws of the jurisdiction, would all be factors the court would consider."
