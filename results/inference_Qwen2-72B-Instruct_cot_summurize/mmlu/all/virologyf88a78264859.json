They emerge from animals to cross the species barrier infrequently\n\nZoonotic viruses are those that can be transmitted from animals to humans, and occasionally, from humans back to animals. SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), caused by the SARS-CoV coronavirus, is an example of a zoonotic disease that originated in animals (likely bats) and made the jump to infect humans. This type of transmission event is known as a spillover event."
