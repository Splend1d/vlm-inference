After the college senior resided in the apartment for six months, he assigned his interest in the premises to a college junior on June 1,2008. The college junior paid the rental on the apartment for two months and then assigned his interest to a college sophomore. The sophomore took possession on August 1, 2008 and paid the rental for August but did not pay the rental for the next three months of occupancy. Then on December 1, 2008 the college sophomore assigned the premises to a college freshman who took possession but didn't pay any rental to the landlord during the period of his occupancy from December 1,2008 to April 1,2009. On April 5, 2009, the landlord brings an action against the college freshman to recover the outstanding rent that is due on the premises. The freshman is most likely liable for\n\nA. $8,000. 00\nB. $7,000. 00\nC. $5,000. 00\nD. $4,000. 00\n"

This is a total of 5 months at a monthly rental rate of $1,000. Therefore, the freshman is most likely liable for:\n\n5 months x $1,000/month = $5,000.\n\nSo the answer is C. $5,000.00. However, it's important to note that the landlord may also have claims against the other assignees (the college senior, junior, and sophomore) for the rent that accrued during their respective periods of occupancy. But based on the information given, the freshman is only liable for the rent during his occupancy."
