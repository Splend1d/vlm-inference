Collision B: the ball and the rod each experience the same torque, time of collision, and change in angular momentum.\n\nExplanation:\n- In Collision A (elastic collision), Newton's third law states that the forces experienced by each cart during the collision are equal and opposite. The duration of the collision is the same for both carts. Conservation of linear momentum dictates that the total change in momentum of one cart equals the negative of the change in momentum of the other cart. However, the change in kinetic energy may not be the same for each cart since kinetic energy is not necessarily conserved in collisions (except in perfectly elastic collisions).\n- In Collision B (inelastic collision), when the ball sticks to the rod, the system begins to rotate as a whole. The torque experienced by the ball and the rod will be equal and opposite due to Newton's third law. The duration of the collision is the same for both the ball and the rod. The conservation of angular momentum applies, meaning the total angular momentum before the collision equals the total angular momentum after the collision. This implies that the change in angular momentum of the ball equals the negative of the change in angular momentum of the rod. The change in rotational kinetic energy is also relevant but is not specifically mentioned in the options as being equal between the two objects."
