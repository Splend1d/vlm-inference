The leasehold agreement between property owner and shopkeeper provided that the latter was not permitted \"to assign this lease to anyone except a corporation with an \u0080\u0098A' credit rating from a well- known credit rating company. \" One month later, the shopkeeper leased the premises to a corporation that did not have the required credit rating. The shopkeeper-corporation lease was for a period of five years, with a rental of $15,000 per month, payable by the corporation to the shopkeeper. In addition, the corporation agreed to abide \"by all of the terms and conditions of the lease between the property owner and the shopkeeper. \"One year later, the corporation leased the premises to a non-profit organization for the balance of the term of the corporation \u0080\u0094shopkeeper lease. The non-profit organization took possession of the said premises the same day that the corporation vacated its occupancy. Pursuant to the corporation \u0080\u0094nonprofit leasehold agreement, the latter was obligated to pay a monthly rental of $17,500 directly to the corporation.

                    "text": "Option C is not correct regarding the legal relationships of the various parties.\n\nExplanation:\n\nA. Privity of estate and privity of contract exist between the property owner and the shopkeeper: This statement is correct. The property owner and the shopkeeper have a direct contractual relationship through their lease agreement, which establishes both privity of contract and privity of estate (the legal relationship between the parties who have rights or obligations in relation to the same piece of real property).\n\nB. Privity of estate and privity of contract exist between the shopkeeper and the corporation: This statement is also correct. Despite the fact that the original lease agreement between the property owner and the shopkeeper prohibited assignment without certain conditions being met, the shopkeeper still entered into a lease agreement with the corporation. Therefore, there is privity of contract between the shopkeeper and the corporation. Additionally, when the corporation takes possession of the premises, privity of estate is created as well.\n\nC. Privity of estate, but not privity of contract, exists between property owner and the corporation: This statement is incorrect. There is no privity of contract between the property owner and the corporation because they do not have a direct contractual relationship. However, since the corporation leased the premises from the shopkeeper and took possession, privity of estate could be argued to exist between the property owner and the corporation if the property owner recognizes the corporation's tenancy. However, given the specific language in the lease prohibiting assignment without meeting certain criteria (an 'A' credit rating), it is likely that the property owner would not recognize the corporation's tenancy, thus negating privity of estate as well. But the primary point here is the lack of privity of contract, which is correctly identified in this option.\n\nD. Neither privity of estate nor privity of contract exists between the property owner and the nonprofit organization: This statement is correct. Since the property owner did not enter into any direct contract with the nonprofit organization, there is no privity of contract. Furthermore, since the property owner likely does not recognize the validity of the sublease due to the breach of the initial lease agreement's conditions, there is no privity of estate either.\n\nHowever, the question asks for the statement that is NOT correct. Therefore, the answer is Option C, as it incorrectly states that privity of estate exists between the property owner and the corporation while ignoring the conditionality of such a relationship based on the terms of the original lease agreement."
