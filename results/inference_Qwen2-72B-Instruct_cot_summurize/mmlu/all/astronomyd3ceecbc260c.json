Its distance from you.\n\nThe relationship between the actual brightness (intrinsic luminosity) of an object and its apparent brightness (apparent magnitude) is related to its distance through the inverse square law. According to this law, if you know the intrinsic luminosity of an object and measure its apparent brightness, you can calculate how far away it is. This principle is used in astronomy to determine the distances to stars and galaxies using standard candles like Cepheid variables or supernovae."
