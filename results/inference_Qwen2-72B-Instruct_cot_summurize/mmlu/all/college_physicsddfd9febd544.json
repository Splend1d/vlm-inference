When it enters the region with both an electric field \\(E\\) in the \\(+x\\)-direction and a magnetic field \\(B\\) in the \\(+y\\)-direction, the Lorentz force on the proton due to these fields is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\mathbf{F} = q(\\mathbf{E} + \\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B})\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(q\\) is the charge of the proton, \\(\\mathbf{E}\\) is the electric field, \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) is the velocity of the proton, and \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) is the magnetic field.\n\nGiven that the proton's trajectory is not affected by the fields, we can infer that the net force acting on the proton is zero. This implies that the electric force and the magnetic force must be equal and opposite. In this case, since the electric field is in the \\(+x\\)-direction, the electric force will also be in the \\(+x\\)-direction. To balance this force, the magnetic force must be in the \\(-x\\)-direction.\n\nThe magnetic force on a moving charge is given by \\(\\mathbf{F}_m = q\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B}\\), which for our case becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\mathbf{F}_m = q(v_z \\hat{z}) \\times (B_y \\hat{y})\n\\]\n\nTaking the cross product gives us:\n\n\\[\n\\mathbf{F}_m = qv_z B_y (\\hat{z} \\times \\hat{y}) = qv_z B_y (-\\hat{x})\n\\]\n\nwhich indeed points in the \\(-x\\)-direction, balancing the electric force.\n\nNow, if the experiment is repeated using a potential difference of \\(2V\\), the proton will have twice the kinetic energy when it enters the fields region, meaning its velocity \\(v'\\) will be increased (since kinetic energy is proportional to \\(v^2\\)). However, the direction of the velocity remains in the \\(+z\\)-direction. Therefore, the magnetic force on the proton will still point in the \\(-x\\)-direction, but with greater magnitude due to the higher velocity.\n\nThus, the proton would be deflected more strongly in the \\(-x\\)-direction, making the correct answer:\n\nB. deflected in the \\(-x\\)-direction."
