The test was done as part of a routine screening for enrollment in a homeless shelter. Physical examination shows 10 mm of induration at the puncture site; the examination is otherwise normal. The parents tell you they are shocked by this finding since both of their skin tests were nonreactive. They say they were born in this country and tell you that their daughter has always been in good health. She has not had much medical care in the past 2 years but she has been healthy. Until moving into this shelter they had been \"squatters\" in vacant buildings. Which of the following is the most appropriate step at this time?\n\nA. Call her previous physician to obtain more history\nB. Order a chest x-ray\nC. Order a test for HIV antibody\nD. Repeat the PPD skin test\n"

A positive PPD skin test in a child who has not been previously exposed to tuberculosis (TB) or vaccinated with Bacille Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) vaccine, especially one living in conditions that may increase the risk of TB exposure, such as homelessness or squatting in vacant buildings, should prompt further evaluation for active TB disease. A chest x-ray is the initial imaging study of choice to evaluate for pulmonary TB.\n\nOption D, repeating the PPD skin test, is generally not recommended if the first test was performed less than 2 weeks ago, as a repeat test would not provide additional information and could result in a falsely enhanced response due to the boosting effect of the initial test.\n\nOptions A and C are also important steps in managing this patient but should follow after evaluating for active TB disease with a chest x-ray. Calling the previous physician can help gather more history and confirm whether the child has received the BCG vaccine, which can cause a false-positive PPD test. Testing for HIV should also be considered given the child's living conditions and the fact that HIV infection increases the risk of TB activation. However, these actions are secondary to the immediate need to rule out active TB disease."
