However, among the choices given:\n\nA. absorbed - This is not the direct reason for the color we see because absorption reduces the amount of light available for us to see as a particular color.\n\nB. reflected - Some of the blue and green light is reflected from the surface of the water, contributing to the color we see, but this is not the primary reason for the greenish-blue color.\n\nC. scattered - This is the correct answer. The blue and green wavelengths of light are scattered by water molecules and suspended particles in the water. This scattering allows more of the blue and green light to reach our eyes compared to other colors, which have been absorbed or scattered less efficiently.\n\nD. refracted - Refraction refers to the bending of light as it passes through different media, such as from air into water. While refraction occurs when light enters the water, it does not directly explain why the water appears greenish-blue.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. scattered."
