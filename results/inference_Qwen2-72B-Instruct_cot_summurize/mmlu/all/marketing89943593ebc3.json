The four categories in this framework are:\n\nA. Question Marks: These are SBUs with high market growth rates but low market shares. They require significant investment to increase their market share and determine if they can become future stars. If not nurtured properly, they may become dogs.\n\nB. Stars: These are SBUs with high market growth rates and high market shares. They are typically the leaders in fast-growing markets and require substantial investment to maintain their position. As the market growth slows down, stars can turn into cash cows.\n\nC. Cash Cows: These are SBUs with low market growth rates but high market shares. They generate significant cash flows because they dominate mature markets. Cash cows provide the resources needed to invest in question marks and stars.\n\nD. Dogs: These are SBUs with low market growth rates and low market shares. They typically generate little cash and consume resources without providing significant returns. Companies often divest or liquidate dogs to focus on more profitable SBUs.\n\nThe terms \"Quick Winners\" and \"Charging Bulls\" do not belong to the BCG Matrix. However, they might be used in other strategic frameworks or business contexts. In the context of the BCG Matrix, the closest match for \"Quick Winners\" would be Cash Cows, as they generate significant cash flows, while \"Charging Bulls\" could refer to Stars, as they are the leaders in fast-growing markets. However, it's important to note that these terms are not part of the official BCG Matrix terminology."
