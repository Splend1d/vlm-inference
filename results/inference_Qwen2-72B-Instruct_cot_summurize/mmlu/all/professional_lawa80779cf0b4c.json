The law established a commission, consisting of five individuals, that was in charge of licensing and overseeing the activities of the casinos. The members of the commission were to be appointed by the mayor. Pursuant to his statutory power, the mayor appointed four private citizens and a clergy member to the Commission. There is a constitutional challenge to the appointment of the clergy member as violating the establishment clause of the First Amendment. The mayor's action is\n\nA. unconstitutional, because the appointment of a clergy member to the commission fosters excessive governmental entanglement with religion.\nB. unconstitutional on its face, because members of the commission are vested with enforcement powers.\nC. constitutional, because the primary effect of appointing only one religious member to the commission does not, per Se, advance or inhibit religion.\nD. constitutional, because commission membership is an appointive privilege and not an elective right.\n"

The Establishment Clause of the First Amendment prohibits the government from making any law \"respecting an establishment of religion.\" This means that the government cannot favor or promote one religion over another or religion in general over non-religion. By appointing a clergy member to the commission, the mayor could be seen as promoting or endorsing religion, which would violate the Establishment Clause. Additionally, having a clergy member on the commission could create an appearance of religious bias in the commission's decisions, which could also violate the Establishment Clause."
