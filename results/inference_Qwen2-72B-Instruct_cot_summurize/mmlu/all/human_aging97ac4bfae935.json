Among the options provided, the most likely answer is:\n\nD. Erikson\n\nErik Erikson's theory of psychosocial development has indeed received considerable support from both longitudinal and cross-sectional studies. Erikson proposed that individuals go through eight stages of psychosocial development throughout their lives, with each stage involving a specific psychosocial crisis that must be resolved. Longitudinal studies have followed individuals over time to see how they develop through these stages, while cross-sectional studies have compared different age groups at a single point in time.\n\nIt's important to note that while Erikson's theory has been influential and widely studied, it has also faced criticism and not all aspects of it have been universally supported by research. Nonetheless, it remains one of the most well-known and researched theories in developmental psychology. \n\nAs for the other options:\nA. Peck - M. Scott Peck was a psychiatrist and author known for his book \"The Road Less Traveled,\" but he did not propose a major theory of human development.\nB. Foos - There is no widely recognized psychological theory associated with this name.\nC. Levenson - Robert W. Levenson is a psychologist known for his work on emotion regulation and physiological responses to emotions, but he did not propose a major theory of human development comparable to Erikson's."
