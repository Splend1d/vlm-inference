More consumer choices, greater price elasticity of demand, more competitors.\n\nWhen there are low or nonexistent barriers to entry in a market, it becomes easier for new firms to enter and compete. This leads to an increase in the number of competitors, which typically results in a wider variety of products and services available to consumers (more consumer choices). With many competitors, each firm has less control over the market price, and consumers can easily switch between different providers if prices rise, indicating a greater price elasticity of demand."
