According to John Stuart Mill's argument in his work \"On Liberty,\" even a false opinion should not be censored because the process of exposing and refuting false opinions helps to strengthen our understanding of the truth. Mill believed that by allowing free speech, even for opinions that may be wrong or offensive, we can test the validity of our own beliefs and arrive at a more complete understanding of the truth. In other words, we don't really know the true view unless we can explain why false views are false. Option A and C are incorrect because they suggest a level of uncertainty about knowledge that Mill did not hold, while option D includes all three options, but only option B accurately reflects Mill's argument."
