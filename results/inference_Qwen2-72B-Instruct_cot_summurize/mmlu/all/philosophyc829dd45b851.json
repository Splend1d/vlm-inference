He argued that justice serves as a social institution that helps regulate behavior to prevent conflicts and promote cooperation among individuals. Therefore, while justice may have other values, one of its primary values is indeed its usefulness to society. However, it's important to note that Hume did not believe that justice has value solely because of its utility to society, which is why option C is not correct."
