Glycolysis is the metabolic pathway that converts glucose or glycogen into pyruvate or lactate, which can then be further metabolized for energy production. This process occurs in the cytoplasm of cells and is an essential part of cellular respiration. In the absence of oxygen, pyruvate can be converted into lactate through a process called lactic acid fermentation. In the presence of oxygen, pyruvate enters the mitochondria where it is oxidized to acetyl-CoA and enters the citric acid cycle (also known as the Krebs cycle). However, the direct product of glycolysis is pyruvate, not acetyl CoA."
