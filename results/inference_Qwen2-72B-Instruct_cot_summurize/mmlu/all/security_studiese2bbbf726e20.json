Here's how each of the provided statements contributes to understanding this historical context:\n\nA. Peace research was inter-disciplinary and politically orientated with immediate policy responsibility accountable to the major powers of the political system.\n\nThis statement highlights the practical orientation of peace research during the 1980s. The Cold War tensions and the nuclear arms race made the pursuit of peace an urgent global concern. Peace researchers were often expected to provide actionable insights that could inform policy decisions aimed at reducing conflict and promoting disarmament. Their work crossed disciplinary boundaries, integrating insights from political science, sociology, economics, psychology, and other fields to offer comprehensive analyses and solutions.\n\nB. Peace research, in contrast to university IR (International Relations), was under a great deal of pressure to deal with relevant issues with a high expectation of immediate delivery of policy answers.\n\nThis aspect emphasizes the urgency and immediacy of the challenges faced by peace researchers. Unlike academic International Relations, which might have been more theoretical or focused on long-term trends, peace research had to respond quickly to pressing global issues such as arms control negotiations, regional conflicts, and the threat of nuclear war. This pressure to deliver timely and effective policy recommendations was driven by the high stakes of international security during the Cold War era.\n\nC. There was a distance from policy responsibility but European security studies gained political relevance due to the politicization of security issues during the period defined by the peace movement.\n\nThis statement suggests that while peace researchers might not have had direct policy-making roles, their work became increasingly influential due to the heightened public interest in security matters sparked by the peace movement. The anti-nuclear and anti-war sentiments prevalent during the 1980s led to a greater demand for expertise on how to manage and mitigate conflict. As a result, European security studies, which often included peace research, gained visibility and political relevance as policymakers and the public sought guidance on navigating the complex security landscape.\n\nD. The setting was simultaneously informed by political theory as the dominant discipline and isolated from developments in theory in the different disciplines.\n\nThis observation points to the intellectual environment in which peace research operated. While political theory played a significant role in shaping the discourse and analytical frameworks used in peace research, there was also a sense of isolation from broader theoretical developments in other disciplines. This could mean that peace researchers sometimes missed out on new methodologies or conceptual tools that could have enriched their work. However, it also suggests a strong focus on the practical application of existing theories to real-world problems, which was crucial given the immediate policy demands of the time.\n\nIn summary, peace research during the 1980s was characterized by its interdisciplinary approach, its responsiveness to urgent policy needs, its growing political relevance amidst the peace movement, and its engagement with political theory while sometimes being disconnected from theoretical advancements in other disciplines. These factors collectively highlight the critical role that peace research played in addressing the security challenges of the time."
