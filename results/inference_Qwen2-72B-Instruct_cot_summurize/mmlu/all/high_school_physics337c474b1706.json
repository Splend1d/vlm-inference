The distance \\(d\\) traveled by an object under constant acceleration \\(a\\), starting from rest (\\(v_0 = 0\\)), in time \\(t\\) can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[ d = \\frac{1}{2}at^2 \\]\n\nFor free-fall on Earth, \\(a = g \\approx 9.8 m/s^2\\).\n\nDuring the first second, the distance fallen is:\n\n\\[ d_1 = \\frac{1}{2}g(1)^2 = \\frac{1}{2}g \\]\n\nThis distance is what we've called \\(h\\). So,\n\n\\[ h = \\frac{1}{2}g \\]\n\nNow, to find out how far the object will fall during the next second (i.e., in the interval between 1 and 2 seconds), we need to calculate the total distance fallen in 2 seconds and subtract the distance fallen in the first second.\n\nDistance fallen in 2 seconds:\n\n\\[ d_2 = \\frac{1}{2}g(2)^2 = 2g \\]\n\nSo, the distance fallen during the next second is:\n\n\\[ d_{next} = d_2 - d_1 = 2g - \\frac{1}{2}g = \\frac{3}{2}g = 3h \\]\n\nThus, the object will fall \\(3h\\) during the next second of time.\n\nThe correct answer is C. 3h."
