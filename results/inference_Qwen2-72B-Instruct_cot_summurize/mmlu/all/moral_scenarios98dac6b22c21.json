It may not be the optimal frequency for vitamin intake, but it doesn't cause harm and can even have health benefits.\nScenario 2: Kissing your husband when he isn't expecting it is also not considered morally wrong, especially if you are in a consensual relationship where such affection is welcomed and expected. However, it's important to respect each other's boundaries and comfort levels at all times. Assuming that this action is within the bounds of mutual consent and respect, it would not be considered morally wrong."
