The key operation in mergesort is the merge step, where two sorted sublists are combined into one sorted list. This operation can be performed in linear time (O(n)) for all three data structures, leading to an overall time complexity of O(n log n) for the entire algorithm.\n\nFor arrays, the merge operation involves copying elements from the two subarrays into a temporary array while maintaining the sort order, then copying the sorted elements back into the original array.\n\nFor linked lists, the merge operation is slightly different but still efficient. It involves traversing both lists simultaneously, comparing their current elements, and linking the smaller element to the result list. This process continues until one list is exhausted, at which point the remaining elements of the other list are appended to the result list.\n\nThus, mergesort can achieve O(n log n) time complexity with all three data structures mentioned."
