In the case of a \"Mom & Pop\" business, these costs could include the wages the owners would have earned if they worked elsewhere, the rent they could have received if they leased their property instead of using it for their own business, or the interest income they would have earned on their capital had they invested it rather than using it to finance the business. These costs are not directly paid out like explicit costs (such as salaries, rent, and utilities), but they represent real economic costs because they reflect what could have been earned with those resources."
