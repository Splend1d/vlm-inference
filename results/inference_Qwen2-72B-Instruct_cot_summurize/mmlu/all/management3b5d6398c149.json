In such a setup, each worker has clearly defined responsibilities and may not need to rely heavily on others to complete their tasks. The line managers, being distant, might not be directly involved in the day-to-day activities of the workers, allowing them a degree of autonomy.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that even in seemingly independent work groups, there can still be interdependencies or collaborative elements, especially when considering the broader context of the organization and how different tasks contribute to overall goals. But based on the given options and the specific description provided, \"Independent\" is the most fitting term."
