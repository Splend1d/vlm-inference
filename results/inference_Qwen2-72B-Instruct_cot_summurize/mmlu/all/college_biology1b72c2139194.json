They provide access to phosphorus, an essential element that is limited in many kinds of soils.\n\nMycorrhizal fungi form symbiotic relationships with the roots of many plants and help them absorb nutrients like phosphorus and other minerals from the soil more efficiently. In return, the fungi receive carbohydrates produced by the plant through photosynthesis. This mutualistic relationship benefits both the fungi and the plants, especially in nutrient-poor environments."
