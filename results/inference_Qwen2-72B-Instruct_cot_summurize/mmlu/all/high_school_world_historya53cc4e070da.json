They have also built up their armies to a state of great efficiency and are possessed of war implements of great power and precision, in short have license to be formidable powers. If, therefore, we persistently cling to our antiquated systems, heaven only knows what a mighty calamity may befall our Empire.\n\u2014Adapted from a letter written by Lord Ii to Lord Tokugawa, 1847\nWhich event or period in Japan's history best reflects Lord Ii's concerns?\n\nA.

Commodore Perry forcing Japan to open its ports to trade.\n\nIn the mid-19th century, Japan had been largely isolated from the rest of the world for over two centuries under the sakoku policy. However, the arrival of Commodore Matthew Perry of the United States Navy in 1853 with a fleet of black ships forced Japan to negotiate and ultimately sign the Convention of Kanagawa in 1854, which opened two ports to American trade and ended Japan's isolationist policy. This event is known as the \"Perry Expedition\" or the \"Opening of Japan.\"\n\nLord Ii's letter, written in 1847, expresses concern about the modernization of foreign powers and the potential threat they pose to Japan if it continues to cling to outdated systems. The subsequent events involving Commodore Perry and the opening of Japan's ports to trade were indeed a significant turning point in Japanese history, leading to increased foreign influence and pressure on Japan to modernize and reform its military, economy, and society to meet the challenges posed by Western powers."
