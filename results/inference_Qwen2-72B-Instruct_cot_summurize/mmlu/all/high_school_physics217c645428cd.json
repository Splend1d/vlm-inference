However, there is another force exerted by the table on the block: the normal force, which is perpendicular to the table. Since the question seems to be asking specifically about the force related to friction, the answer would be:\n\nB. parallel to the table\n\nBut if considering all forces exerted by the table, the normal force should also be mentioned, which is:\n\nC. perpendicular to the table\n\nFor clarity and specificity to the question about friction, the primary answer is:\n\nB. parallel to the table"
