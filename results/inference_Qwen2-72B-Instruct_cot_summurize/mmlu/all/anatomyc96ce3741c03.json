As you move distally from the bronchi to the bronchioles in the respiratory system, the amount of cartilage decreases until it is absent in the smallest bronchioles. The walls of bronchioles are made up of smooth muscle, which can contract or relax to regulate airflow, and respiratory epithelium, which is involved in gas exchange."
