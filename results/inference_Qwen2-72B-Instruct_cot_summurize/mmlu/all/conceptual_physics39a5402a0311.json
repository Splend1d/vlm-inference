When a cannonball is fired, it exerts a force on the cannon, and the cannon exerts an equal force back on the cannonball. However, the accelerations experienced by the cannon and the cannonball will not be equal because acceleration depends on both the force applied and the mass of the object (F=ma). The cannonball, having much less mass than the cannon, will experience a much greater acceleration as a result of the same force."
