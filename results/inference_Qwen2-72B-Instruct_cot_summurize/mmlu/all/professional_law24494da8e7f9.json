When the officer accepted the job, the city's employee benefit plan provided a death benefit to the spouse of any employee who died as a result of any job-related injury. Last year, the city amended its employee benefit plan to deny its death benefit in cases where the death \"was caused by the employee's refusal to accept, for any reason other than its excessive risk to life or health, reasonably available medical care prescribed by a physician.\" After this amendment took effect, the officer was shot while on duty. Because of a sincerely held religious belief, the officer refused to allow a prescribed blood transfusion and, as a result, died from loss of blood. When the officer's spouse applied for the death benefit, the city denied the application on the basis of the amendment to the employee benefit plan. The officer's spouse has challenged the amendment, claiming that, as applied to the officer, it violated the officer's constitutional right to the free exercise of religion. Is the court likely to find the amendment to the employee benefit plan constitutional as applied to the officer?\n\nA. No, because it effectively discriminates against a religious practice.\nB. No, because it violates the vested contractual rights of city employees who were hired before the amendment took effect.\nC. Yes, because it does not single out religious reasons for the denial of benefits and is a reasonable limitation on the award of such benefits.\nD. Yes, because it imposes a condition only on the award of a government benefit and does not impose a penalty on an individual's conduct.\n"

Yes, because it does not single out religious reasons for the denial of benefits and is a reasonable limitation on the award of such benefits.\n\nThe court is likely to find the amendment to the employee benefit plan constitutional as applied to the officer because it applies equally to all employees regardless of their beliefs or reasons for refusing medical treatment. The amendment does not specifically target religious practices but rather sets a general standard for the denial of benefits in cases where an employee refuses reasonably available medical care for reasons unrelated to excessive risk to life or health. This type of limitation on benefits can be considered reasonable and within the city's authority to manage its employee benefit program. However, it is important to note that the specific outcome may depend on the details of the case and the applicable law in the jurisdiction where the case is heard."
