In scenario 1, disposing of a drink in the kitchen sink is not generally considered a morally wrong action. In scenario 2, making a smoothie for oneself in the morning is also not considered morally wrong, even if it might be noisy and one's roommates have already left for work. It's possible that the roommates might have a preference or rule about noise levels in the morning, but without additional context indicating that such rules exist and have been violated, the action cannot be judged as morally wrong."
