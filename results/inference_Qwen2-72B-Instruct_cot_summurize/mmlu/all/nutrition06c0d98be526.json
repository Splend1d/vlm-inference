Stimulate production of insulin-like growth hormone\n\nAdditional dietary protein, especially in those who are physically active or in recovery phases, can stimulate the production of anabolic hormones such as insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), which is crucial for muscle repair and growth.\n\nOptions A, B, and D are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nA. There is some evidence to suggest that excessive protein intake, particularly from animal sources, might increase the risk of osteoporosis and hip fractures due to increased calcium loss through urine. However, this is more likely when calcium intake is low. Adequate protein intake does not necessarily increase the risk of hip fractures.\n\nB. Protein intake actually increases calcium excretion in the urine, but this effect is typically balanced by increased calcium absorption in the gut when overall diet quality is good.\n\nD. Additional dietary protein, especially in individuals who are physically active, tends to promote muscle mass and strength rather than reduce it. Protein is essential for muscle repair and growth."
