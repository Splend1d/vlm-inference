The statement \"Not all lobsters are red\" means that there exists at least one lobster that is not red. \n\nLet's break down the options:\n\nA. ~(\u2200x)(Lx \u2283 Rx) - This translates to \"It is not true that for all x, if x is a lobster (Lx), then x is red (Rx).\" This correctly represents the given statement.\n\nB. ~(\u2203x)(Lx \u2283 Rx) - This translates to \"It is not true that there exists an x such that if x is a lobster (Lx), then x is red (Rx).\" This does not accurately capture the meaning of \"not all.\"\n\nC. ~(\u2203x)(Lx \u2022 Rx) - This translates to \"It is not true that there exists an x such that x is a lobster (Lx) and x is red (Rx).\" This does not convey the idea that not all lobsters are red.\n\nD. ~(\u2200x)(Lx \u2022 Rx) - This translates to \"It is not true that for all x, x is a lobster (Lx) and x is red (Rx).\" This does not accurately represent the given statement.\n\nTherefore, the best translation into predicate logic for \"Not all lobsters are red\" is A. ~(\u2200x)(Lx \u2283 Rx)."
