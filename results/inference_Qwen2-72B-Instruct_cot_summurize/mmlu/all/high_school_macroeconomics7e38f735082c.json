Increased investment in capital\n\nLong-run aggregate supply (LRAS) is determined by factors that affect a country's productive capacity, such as the quantity and quality of labor, capital, natural resources, and technology. An increase in investment in capital leads to higher productivity and potential output over time, which shifts the LRAS curve to the right.\n\nA. An increase in the real interest rate might discourage investment because borrowing costs become more expensive, which could reduce long-run aggregate supply rather than increase it.\nC. An increase in aggregate demand does not necessarily increase long-run aggregate supply; it may only lead to higher prices if the economy is already at or near full employment.\nD. An increase in the unemployment rate indicates underutilization of labor resources, which would not increase long-run aggregate supply but might instead decrease it due to a loss of skills and potential output."
