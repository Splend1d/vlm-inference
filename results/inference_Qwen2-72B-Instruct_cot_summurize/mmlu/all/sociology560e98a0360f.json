The general fertility rate (GFR) fell between 1964 and 2000 largely due to changes in social norms and behaviors, including an increase in the average age of marriage and the age at which women begin having children. These trends can be attributed to various factors such as improved access to education and career opportunities for women, increased use of contraception, and changing societal attitudes towards family size and gender roles.\n\nOption B is not necessarily true, as the number of women of childbearing age may have fluctuated but does not directly explain the decline in the fertility rate. Option C implies methodological issues with data collection, which is not the primary reason for the decline in fertility rates. Option D refers to health risks associated with poverty, which might affect fertility rates in certain populations but is not the main cause of the overall decline in GFR during that time period."
