Not wrong, Wrong\n\nScenario 1: Digging a hole at the beach to bury someone's toes might be considered a playful or mischievous act, but it is not generally considered morally wrong unless it causes harm or distress to the person whose toes were buried. Assuming the person whose toes were buried did not suffer any harm and found the act harmless or amusing, this scenario would not be considered morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nScenario 2: Revealing the location of someone who is hiding from persecution, such as Anne Frank during the Nazi occupation, is widely considered morally reprehensible. This action could result in severe harm or death to the person being hidden and is contrary to values of compassion, protection, and human rights. Therefore, this scenario is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020."
