The mental symphysis, which is the midline fusion line between the two halves of the mandible, actually fuses during fetal development and does not reopen postnatally.\nB. The condylar growth cartilage remains active throughout childhood and adolescence, contributing significantly to the growth of the mandible until the end of puberty.\nD. The functional matrix acting on the angle of the mandible is primarily the masseter and temporalis muscles, not the lateral pterygoid muscle. The lateral pterygoid muscle plays a role in opening the jaw and is not directly responsible for the growth of the mandibular angle."
