Let's use this figure to calculate the amount of kale required.\n\nAn average adult requires about 2000-2500 calories per day. For the sake of calculation, let's use 2200 calories as an average daily requirement. \n\nFirst, we'll find out how many calories an individual would require in a year:\n\n\\[2200 \\, \\text{calories/day} \\times 365 \\, \\text{days/year} = 803,000 \\, \\text{calories/year}\\]\n\nNext, we'll calculate how much kale is required to provide those calories:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{Amount of kale} & = \\frac{\\text{Total calories needed}}{\\text{Calories per 100g of kale}} \\times 100g \\\\\n& = \\frac{803,000}{33} \\times 100g \\\\\n& \\approx 24,333,333g \\\\\n& = 24,333.333kg \\\\\n& \\approx 2.4 \\times 10^4 \\, \\text{kg/year}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nNone of the provided options exactly match this calculation, but the closest answer is:\n\nB. \\(2 \\times 10^4 \\, \\text{kg/year}\\)\n\nHowever, it's important to note that relying solely on kale for all your caloric needs isn't nutritionally sound, as you would miss out on other essential nutrients and macronutrients. This calculation is purely for understanding the quantity of food required to meet caloric needs and does not account for nutritional balance."
