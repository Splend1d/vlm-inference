He was permitted to borrow law books and legal treatises to take home for his own personal use. One afternoon, the law student was preparing a brief in the firm's law library when he noticed a book lying on the conference table. Making sure no one was watching him, he took the book and placed it in his briefcase. He planned to take the book home that night with the intention of not returning it. If the law student is subsequently charged with larceny of the book, which of the following claims, if true, would LEAST aid him in his defense?\n\nA. The law firm had failed to give him his salary for two weeks, and he took the book as security for the debt.\nB. He intended to return the book after reading it.\nC. The law firm had given him possession of the book.\nD. The law firm had given him custody of the book.\n"

He intended to return the book after reading it.\n\nLarceny involves the unlawful taking and carrying away of someone else's personal property with the intent to permanently deprive the owner of it. Claim B directly contradicts the requirement for permanent deprivation since it indicates the student had an intention to return the book, thus it would least aid him in his defense against a charge of larceny. \n\nClaims A, C, and D could potentially offer defenses. Claim A suggests a lien or set-off situation where the book was taken as collateral for unpaid wages, which could be argued as a civil matter rather than theft. Claims C and D imply that the student had some form of lawful control over the book, which could challenge the element of \"unlawful taking\" in a larceny charge."
