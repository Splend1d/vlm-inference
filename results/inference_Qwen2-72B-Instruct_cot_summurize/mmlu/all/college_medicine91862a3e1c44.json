However, it's worth noting that the times recorded before the 20th century are often not considered as reliable as more recent records due to differences in track surfaces and timing methods. Also, A. R Bannister (Roger Bannister) was the first person to run a mile under 4 minutes in 1954, S. Coe (Sebastian Coe) is a former middle-distance runner who held multiple world records, and J. DiMaggio (Joe DiMaggio) was a professional baseball player."
