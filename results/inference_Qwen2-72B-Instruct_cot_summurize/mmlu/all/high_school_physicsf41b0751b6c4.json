Less than the block\u2019s gravitational potential energy when it was released, because the gravitational potential energy was converted both to thermal energy and to kinetic energy.\n\nWhen the object slides down the incline, its gravitational potential energy (PE) is converted into kinetic energy (KE). However, since the surface is rough, there is friction between the object and the incline. This friction does work against the motion of the object, converting some of the PE that would have gone into KE into thermal energy (heat). Therefore, the final KE of the object will be less than the initial PE due to the energy lost as heat to the surroundings.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because it assumes no energy is lost to friction, which contradicts the given condition of a rough surface.\n\nChoice B is also incorrect because it suggests that the KE at the bottom equals the initial PE, which is not true if energy is lost to friction.\n\nChoice D is incorrect because it implies that the work done by friction is greater than the gain in KE, which is not necessarily true. The work done by friction is equal to the difference between the initial PE and the final KE, not necessarily greater than the final KE itself."
