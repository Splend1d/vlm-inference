Therefore,\n\n\\[ Q = W \\]\n\nGiven that the work done \\(W\\) is 300 J (in magnitude) and the cycle is counterclockwise on a P-V diagram, it means the work is done by the system (expansion work). However, since we're looking at the heat transfer during this cycle, and knowing that the work is positive (the system does work on the surroundings), we can infer that for the equation to hold true with no change in internal energy, the heat must have been transferred into the system to compensate for the work done by the system.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\nA. 300 J into the system\n\nThis is because the system needs to gain 300 J of heat to do 300 J of work on the surroundings without changing its internal energy."
