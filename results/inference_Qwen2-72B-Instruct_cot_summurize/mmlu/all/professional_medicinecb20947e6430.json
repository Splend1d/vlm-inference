She also reports spotting that began 6 months ago and has progressed to heavy bleeding during the past 3 weeks. Medical history is significant for an abnormal Pap smear in her 20s; her most recent Pap smear was done 12 years ago during her second pregnancy, and she recalls the results as being normal. She takes no medications. The patient was married for 18 years; her husband died 4 years ago and had undergone vasectomy after the birth of their last child. The patient has not had any new sexual partners since her husband's death. BMI is 32 kg/m2 . Vital signs are temperature 37.2\u00b0C (99.0\u00b0F), pulse 90/min, respirations 14/min, and blood pressure 155/96 mm Hg. Speculum examination discloses normal vaginal mucosa. The cervix is friable with a 1-cm exophytic mass lateral to the cervical os at the nine o'clock position. Which of the following is the most critical factor in formulating a management plan for this patient?\n\nA. Hypertension\nB. Obesity\nC. Patient age\nD. Stage of disease\n"

Given the patient's history of abnormal Pap smear in the past, the presence of a friable cervix with an exophytic mass, and the symptoms of copious vaginal discharge and heavy bleeding, there is a high suspicion for cervical cancer. Determining the stage of the disease will guide the appropriate treatment approach, whether it be surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy or a combination of these modalities. Hypertension and obesity are important co-morbidities to manage but do not directly influence the management of the suspected cervical cancer. Age can influence treatment decisions but is secondary to the stage of disease in this context."
