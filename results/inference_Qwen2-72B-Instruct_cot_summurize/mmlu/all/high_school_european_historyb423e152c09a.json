The debate at the council where the Byzantines argued for the superiority of Plato over Aristotle contributed to this shift. Additionally, the founding of the Florentine Academy by Cosimo de Medici, which focused on the study of Plato, further supports the inference that the council helped to spur interest in classical philosophy among the humanists of the time. However, it was not the council itself that laid the foundation for the academy but rather the interest in Plato that was partly sparked by the events at the council. Option A is therefore not as accurate as option C. Options B and D are not supported by the passage."
