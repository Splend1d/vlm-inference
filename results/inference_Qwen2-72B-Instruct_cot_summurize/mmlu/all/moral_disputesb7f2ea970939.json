However, it's important to note that this perspective is not widely accepted or endorsed in ethical discussions about warfare. Most theories of war, including jus ad bellum (the justice of going to war) and just war theory, do incorporate moral considerations. Antiwar pacifism generally holds that war is inherently immoral and should be avoided."
