The defendant lifted the victim's shirt, and the victim gently pushed the defendant's hand away and then left the couch to make coffee. While the victim was making coffee, the defendant picked up her solid gold ring that she had carelessly left on the living room table. Intending to give it back to her with a diamond in it, he put it into his pocket and got ready to leave. Before the defendant went home, he stopped into a bar. There he met a patron who offered to sell him a two-month-old plasma TV for $200. The patron said that he would take only cash and that he also had some unboxed silverware and jewehy he could sell the defendant from his van, which was parked outside. The patron said, \"You better decide fast, because I've got to get out of town right away. \" The defendant, who knew that the TV was worth $1,000, gave the patron $200, and the patron gave the defendant the TV, which was not in a box. The patron did not tell the defendant he had just stolen the television from a house down the street. Based on the above facts, for which of the following crimes should the defendant be convicted?\n\nA. Battery upon the victim, and larceny of the ring.\nB. Larceny of the ring.\nC. Embezzlement of the ring.\nD. Receiving stolen property.\n"

Receiving stolen property.\n\nThe defendant knowingly purchased a plasma TV at a price far below its market value from a person who indicated urgency and secrecy in the transaction. This should have raised reasonable suspicion that the TV was stolen, and the defendant's decision to purchase it under these circumstances can be considered receiving stolen property.\n\nAs for the ring, the defendant intended to return it with a modification (adding a diamond), which does not fit the criteria for larceny or embezzlement since there was no intent to permanently deprive the owner of the property. However, taking the ring without permission is still a wrongful act, but the information provided does not suggest the defendant should be convicted of larceny or embezzlement regarding the ring based on the stated intentions.\n\nBattery upon the victim is not applicable as there was no use of force or violence against the victim; the defendant merely attempted to initiate physical intimacy, which the victim gently rebuffed."
