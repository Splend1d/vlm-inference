                    "text": "During the boiling process of a substance, such as liquid ammonia (NH3), the intermolecular forces that hold the molecules together in the liquid state are overcome by the kinetic energy of the molecules. In the case of NH3, these intermolecular forces are primarily hydrogen bonds.\n\nHydrogen bonds in liquid ammonia occur between the hydrogen atom of one molecule and the nitrogen atom of another, due to the high electronegativity of nitrogen which creates a partial negative charge on the nitrogen atom and a partial positive charge on the hydrogen atom bonded to nitrogen in another molecule.\n\nAs the liquid NH3 is heated to its boiling point, the kinetic energy of the molecules increases, leading to an increase in motion and collisions among the molecules. This increased energy allows the molecules to overcome the attractive hydrogen bond forces holding them in close proximity in the liquid state, allowing them to move freely as gas molecules. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer to the question is:\n\nD. The hydrogen bonds holding separate NH3 molecules together break apart. \n\nThis does not involve breaking the covalent N-H bonds within the individual NH3 molecules, which would require much more energy and lead to a chemical change rather than a physical change like boiling."
