It is a framework or a set of basic assumptions, concepts, values, and practices that define how we see and understand the world. Paradigms serve as models for how to approach problems and conduct research in a particular field. They are the generally accepted theories or worldviews that guide scientific inquiry and other areas of human endeavor. However, it's worth noting that \"paradigm\" can also refer to a typical example or pattern, which aligns with definition D. In some contexts, particularly in linguistics, a paradigm can also mean a set of forms of a word or words that follow a specific grammatical pattern."
