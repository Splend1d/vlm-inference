In this scenario, we can analyze each option:\n\nA. **The man catches a baseball thrown to him by a friend.**\n   - This action can change the angular momentum of the man-platform system because the baseball coming from outside the system introduces an external force (and thus torque) when it is caught. The angular momentum of the system can increase or decrease depending on the direction of the throw relative to the rotation of the platform.\n\nB. **The man thrusts his arms out away from his body.**\n   - This action does not change the total angular momentum of the man-platform system. Since there is no external torque acting on the system, the angular momentum remains constant. However, the distribution of mass changes, which affects the moment of inertia, leading to a change in rotational speed but not in angular momentum.\n\nC. **The man thrusts his arms out away from his body, and then quickly brings his arms back to his side again.**\n   - Similar to option B, the total angular momentum of the system remains unchanged throughout this process. When the man spreads his arms, the system's rotational speed decreases due to the increased moment of inertia, but when he brings them back, the speed increases, conserving the angular momentum.\n\nD. **The man jumps straight up in the air and lands back on the platform.**\n   - While jumping straight up, the man's center of mass moves along a line perpendicular to the platform's surface, which does not introduce any torque on the system since the force is directed along the radius of rotation. Therefore, this action does not change the angular momentum of the system.\n\nIn conclusion, the only action that could change the angular momentum of the man-platform system is:\n\n**A. The man catches a baseball thrown to him by a friend.**"
