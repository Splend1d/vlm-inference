Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Yes Yes\n\nThis means that statistical tables do cover financial trends and they cover more than just one fiscal year, unlike the financial statements which focus primarily on the most recent fiscal year. However, please note that some financial statements include comparative figures for prior periods, but the level of detail and the analysis of trends found in statistical tables are usually more extensive."
