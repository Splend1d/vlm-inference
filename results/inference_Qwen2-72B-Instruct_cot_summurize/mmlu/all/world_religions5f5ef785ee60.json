Peter\n\nThe Roman Catholic Church teaches that the Bishop of Rome, also known as the Pope, is the direct successor of Saint Peter, who was one of the twelve apostles of Jesus Christ and a leader in the early Christian church. According to tradition, Saint Peter was the first Bishop of Rome and the first Pope. This belief is based on the words of Jesus in the New Testament, where he says to Peter, \"You are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church\" (Matthew 16:18)."
