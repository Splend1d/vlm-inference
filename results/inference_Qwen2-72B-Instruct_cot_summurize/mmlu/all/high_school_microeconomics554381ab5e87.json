P = MC.\n\nIn an oligopoly, the price is typically greater than marginal cost (MC), as firms have market power and can set prices above competitive levels to earn economic profits. This condition, P = MC, is more typical of a perfectly competitive market where firms are price-takers and cannot influence the market price."
