Mistakes during translation do not contribute to genetic variation because they do not alter the DNA sequence. Genetic variation arises from changes in the DNA sequence itself, such as mutations during DNA replication (option B), chromosomal rearrangements like translocations (option C), and recombination during meiosis (option D). These alterations can then be passed on to offspring and contribute to genetic diversity within populations."
