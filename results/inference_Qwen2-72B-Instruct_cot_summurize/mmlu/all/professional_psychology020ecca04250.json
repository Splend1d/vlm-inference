For reducing activity levels a higher dose of the stimulant is required.\n\nActually, the effective dose of stimulant medication for treating ADHD symptoms such as hyperactivity, impulsivity, and inattention can vary widely among individuals. It's not necessarily true that a higher dose is required to reduce activity levels. The optimal dose is determined by the individual's response to the medication and its side effects. Often, the goal is to find the lowest effective dose that provides symptom relief without causing significant adverse effects."
