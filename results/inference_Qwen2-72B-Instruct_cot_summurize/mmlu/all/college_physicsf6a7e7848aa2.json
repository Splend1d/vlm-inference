                    "text": "To solve this problem, we can use the de Broglie wavelength equation, which relates the wavelength of a particle to its momentum:\n\n\\[ \\lambda = \\frac{h}{p} \\]\n\nwhere \\( \\lambda \\) is the wavelength, \\( h \\) is Planck's constant (\\( 6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\, \\text{J}\\cdot\\text{s} \\)), and \\( p \\) is the momentum of the particle.\n\nThe momentum of an electron with kinetic energy \\( K \\) can be found using the relativistic expression for momentum, but for non-relativistic particles (which these electrons should be, given the energies provided), we can use the classical approximation:\n\n\\[ p = \\sqrt{2mK} \\]\n\nwhere \\( m \\) is the mass of the electron (\\( 9.109 \\times 10^{-31} \\, \\text{kg} \\)) and \\( K \\) is the kinetic energy in joules.\n\nWe need the de Broglie wavelength to match approximately the lattice spacing of the crystal for diffraction to occur. Let's assume the lattice spacing \\( d \\) is equal to \\( 0.4 \\, \\text{nm} \\), or \\( 4 \\times 10^{-10} \\, \\text{m} \\). This gives us the condition:\n\n\\[ \\lambda \\approx d \\]\n\nSubstituting the expressions for \\( \\lambda \\) and \\( p \\) into this equation:\n\n\\[ \\frac{h}{\\sqrt{2mK}} \\approx 4 \\times 10^{-10} \\]\n\nSolving for \\( K \\):\n\n\\[ K \\approx \\frac{h^2}{8md^2} \\]\n\n\\[ K \\approx \\left( \\frac{6.626 \\times 10^{-34}}{8 \\times 9.109 \\times 10^{-31} \\times (4 \\times 10^{-10})^2} \\right)^2 \\]\n\n\\[ K \\approx \\frac{(6.626 \\times 10^{-34})^2}{8 \\times 9.109 \\times 10^{-31} \\times 16 \\times 10^{-20}} \\]\n\n\\[ K \\approx \\frac{43.9 \\times 10^{-68}}{145.7 \\times 10^{-51}} \\]\n\n\\[ K \\approx 301.3 \\times 10^{-17} \\, \\text{J} \\]\n\nConverting from Joules to electronvolts (\\( 1 \\, \\text{eV} = 1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\, \\text{J} \\)):\n\n\\[ K \\approx 301.3 \\times 10^{-17} / 1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\]\n\n\\[ K \\approx 1880 \\, \\text{eV} \\]\n\nThis calculation suggests that the kinetic energy would be much higher than any of the options provided. However, it seems there might have been a mistake in either the question's options or the interpretation of the necessary conditions for diffraction to occur at such low energies. Given the options, none directly match the calculated value, but option D (100 eV) is closest to what might be practically achievable for electron diffraction experiments considering typical laboratory setups and the options given. It's important to note that the calculation provided here uses a simplified approach and does not account for relativistic effects, which become significant at higher energies. In practice, the correct energy for observing diffraction patterns with electrons at lattice spacings around 0.4 nm would typically fall within the range of tens to thousands of eV, depending on the specific experimental setup and materials used."
