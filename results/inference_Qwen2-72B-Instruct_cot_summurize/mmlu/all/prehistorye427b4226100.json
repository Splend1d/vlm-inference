The term \"Lapita\" originally referred to a distinctive pottery style, but it has since been used to describe an entire cultural complex that spread across the western and central Pacific from around 1600 BCE to 500 CE. This complex is associated with the ancestors of modern Polynesians, Melanesians, and Micronesians."
