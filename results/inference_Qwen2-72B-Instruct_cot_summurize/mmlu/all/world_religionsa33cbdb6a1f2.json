Spontaneity\n\nIn Daoist philosophy, ziran (\u81ea\u7136) is often translated as \"spontaneity,\" \"naturalness,\" or \"self-so.\" It refers to a state where actions and behaviors are in harmony with one's true nature and the natural order of things, without being forced or artificial. This concept is central to Zhuangzi's teachings and represents an ideal state of being for individuals seeking to live in accordance with the Dao."
