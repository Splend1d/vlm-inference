Therefore, the correct answer is B. In classical conditioning, a neutral stimulus is paired with a stimulus that naturally elicits a response, so that eventually the neutral stimulus alone can elicit the response. In operant conditioning, a behavior is followed by a consequence (either a reward or punishment) which increases or decreases the likelihood of that behavior occurring again in the future."
