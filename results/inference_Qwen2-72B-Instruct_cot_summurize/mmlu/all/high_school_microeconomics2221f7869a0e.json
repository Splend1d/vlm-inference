The demand for labor is derived from the demand for the products produced by labor.\n\nThis statement is correct because firms hire labor to produce goods and services that they sell in the market. The amount of labor they demand depends on how much of their product they need to produce, which in turn depends on the demand for their product. If there is high demand for a product, the firm will need more labor to produce it, leading to higher demand for labor. Conversely, if demand for the product falls, the firm will need less labor, leading to lower demand for labor. Therefore, the demand for labor is not independent of the demand for other inputs or resources, the demand for the products produced by labor, or the availability of other inputs or resources."
