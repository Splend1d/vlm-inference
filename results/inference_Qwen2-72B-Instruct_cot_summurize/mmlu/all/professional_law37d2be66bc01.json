                    "text": "A baseball fan purchased two tickets for a World Series baseball game. The fan contacted his best friend and invited him to go to the game. The friend, who was a fanatic baseball fan, eagerly agreed. The fan told the friend that the game started at 7:00 p. m. and that he would pick him up at about 5:00 p. m. so they could get there early to watch batting practice. They were driving to the game together when the fan sped up to cross an intersection while the traffic signal was changing from amber to red. As he reached the intersection, the fan was traveling at 50 m. p. h. although the posted speed limit was 25 m. p. h. Simultaneously, a car entered the intersection on red and collided with the fan's vehicle. The friend suffered a broken pelvis in the collision. This jurisdiction has adopted the following \"modified\" comparative negligence statute:\"A negligent plaintiff is entitled to obtain a recovery provided plaintiff's negligence is not equal to or greater than that of the defendant's; otherwise no recovery is permitted. \"Suppose the friend brings suit against the driver of the car that entered the intersection on the red light to recover damages for his injury. Ajury returned a special verdict with the following findings: (1) The fan was 55 percent negligent in speeding; (2) The driver was 45 percent negligent in driving through the red light; and (3) The friend suffered $100,000 in damages. As a result, the court should enter a judgment for the friend in the amount of\n\nA. $100,000. 00\nB. $55,000. 00\nC. $45,000. 00\nD. nothing, because the fan was more negligentthan the driver.\n"

                    "text": "Based on the information provided and the \"modified\" comparative negligence statute described, the friend can only recover if his own negligence (which is not mentioned but presumably is zero since he was a passenger) is less than the defendant's (the driver who ran the red light). Since the friend's negligence isn't a factor here, we compare the negligence of the fan (who is not a party to this lawsuit) and the driver.\n\nThe jury found the fan 55% negligent and the driver 45% negligent. According to the modified comparative negligence rule, as long as the plaintiff's negligence (in this case, the friend's) is not equal to or greater than the defendant's (the driver's), the plaintiff can recover damages.\n\nSince the friend's negligence is not in question and the driver is found to be 45% negligent, which is less than 50%, the friend can recover damages. However, the recovery will be reduced by the percentage of the other party's (the fan's) negligence that contributed to the accident, which is 55%.\n\nThus, the friend's total damages of $100,000 are reduced by 55%, leaving 45% recoverable:\n\n$100,000 * 45% = $45,000\n\nTherefore, the court should enter a judgment for the friend in the amount of $45,000.\n\nThe correct answer is C. $45,000.00."
