The formula for the capacitance of a parallel plate capacitor is:\n\n\\[ C = \\frac{\\epsilon A}{d} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( C \\) is the capacitance,\n- \\( \\epsilon \\) is the permittivity of the dielectric medium,\n- \\( A \\) is the area of one of the plates,\n- \\( d \\) is the distance between the two plates.\n\nFrom this equation, it's clear that increasing the permittivity (\\( \\epsilon \\)) will increase the capacitance (\\( C \\)). Therefore, to obtain a high value of capacitance, the permittivity of the dielectric medium should be high."
