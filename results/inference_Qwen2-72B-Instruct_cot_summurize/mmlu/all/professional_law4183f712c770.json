Is the prosecutor's proposed cross-examination proper?\n\nA. No, because the witness's character for truthfulness cannot be attacked by specific instances of conduct.\nB. No, because the witness's failure to mention the alibi is collateral and ambiguous.\nC. Yes, as impeachment for bias and interest.\nD. Yes, as impeachment for prior inconsistency.\n"

Yes, as impeachment for prior inconsistency.\n\nThe prosecutor's proposed cross-examination is proper as it seeks to challenge the witness's credibility by pointing out a prior inconsistency in her statements. By asking why the witness did not mention the defendant's claim of an alibi when previously questioned by the police, the prosecutor is attempting to show that the witness may not be reliable or is biased in favor of the defendant. This type of questioning is permissible under the rules of evidence as it pertains to the witness's credibility and the weight her testimony should be given."
