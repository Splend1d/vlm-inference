By regarding the state as the most important actor, constructivism neglects internationalization in a globalized world.\n\nThis statement is not a widely articulated or valid criticism of constructivism because constructivism does not necessarily regard the state as the only important actor. In fact, constructivist scholars often emphasize the role of non-state actors and the importance of norms, identities, and social structures in shaping international relations. This perspective allows for a consideration of globalization and the influence of various actors beyond the state."
