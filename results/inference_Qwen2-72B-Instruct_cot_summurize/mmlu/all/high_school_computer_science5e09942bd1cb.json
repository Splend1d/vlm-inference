The specification should be modified to indicate what should be done if there is more than one index of larger values.\n\nThe best action is to clarify the requirements with the person who provided the problem specification. This ensures that your implementation meets their needs and avoids any potential confusion or errors down the line. Once the specification is clear, you can write the method accordingly. If the specification is not modifiable, then returning the index of the first occurrence of a value larger than the given item (or perhaps the smallest or largest of such values) could be reasonable default behavior, but this should be documented clearly in the method's comments or documentation."
