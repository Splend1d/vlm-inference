The duly recorded plan imposed elaborate limitations and restrictions upon the land in the plan, which was to be developed as a residential district. The restrictions were to extend to all persons acquiring any of the lots and to their heirs, assigns, and lessees. It was further provided that all subsequent owners would be charged with due notice of the restrictions. Among those restrictions in the general plan were the following:(22) A franchise right is created in a strip of land 10 feet in width along the rear of each lot for the use of public utility companies with right of ingress and egress. (23) No house or structure of any kind shall be built on the aforementioned strip of land running through the said blocks. The franchise right created for public utilitycompanies would most likely be an example of a(an)\n\nA. license.\nB. equitable servitude.\nC. easement appurtenant.\nD. easement in gross.\n"

In this case, the public utility companies are granted the right to use a specific strip of land for their operations, which is not tied to any particular parcel of land but instead benefits the utility companies directly. This type of easement allows the utilities to maintain, repair, and replace infrastructure such as power lines, water pipes, and gas lines within the designated area without owning the land itself."
