Nor were there just three such stars; four wanderers complete their revolutions about Jupiter, and of their alterations as observed more precisely later on we shall give a description here. Also I measured the distances between them by means of the telescope. . . .\nSuch are the observations concerning the four Medicean planets recently first discovered by me, and although from this data their periods have not yet been reconstructed in numerical form, it is legitimate at least to put in evidence some facts worthy of note. Above all, since they sometimes follow and sometimes precede Jupiter by the same intervals, and they remain within very limited distances either to east or west of Jupiter, accompanying that planet in both its retrograde and direct movements in a constant manner, no one can doubt that they complete their revolutions about Jupiter and at the same time effect all together a twelve-year period about the center of the universe.\n\u2014Galileo Galilei, 1610\nWhich of the following intellectual hallmarks of the Renaissance seem most in conflict with the questioning of the ancient philosophers, such as Aristotle, through experimentation in natural philosophy?\n\nA. Humanism\nB. Secularism\nC. Individualism\nD. Ar\u00eate\n"

In the context of natural philosophy and science, the ancient philosophers like Aristotle often relied on logic and reasoning rather than empirical observation and experimentation. Galileo's approach, which involved making detailed observations and measurements with a telescope, represented a shift toward empirical evidence and away from pure reason. This could be seen as a departure from the ar\u00eate of the ancient philosophers, who might have valued theoretical excellence over practical observation. However, it's important to note that this choice is somewhat artificial, as the other options (humanism, secularism, and individualism) don't directly address the relationship between ancient philosophy and the scientific method."
