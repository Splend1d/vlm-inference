These methods often involve the use of statistical analysis to interpret and draw conclusions from the data collected. Examples of quantitative research methods include surveys, questionnaires, and experiments. In contrast, qualitative research methods typically involve open-ended questions and focus on understanding the experiences and perspectives of a smaller number of participants through methods such as interviews and observations. Probability and non-probability refer to sampling techniques used in research, not types of research methods themselves."
