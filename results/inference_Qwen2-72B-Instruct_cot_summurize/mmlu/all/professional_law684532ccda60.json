In a dark alley, a defendant approached the victim and said, \"Give me the gold ring on your finger or I'll shoot you with this gun. \" The victim gave him the ring. However, the ring really belonged to someone else, as the victim was just borrowing it for the evening to impress his girlfriend. In addition, the gun that the defendant had in his possession was really a water pistol.\nB. A defendant broke into a house and took a stereo system. After he had placed the system in his car and was about to leave, the homeowner came home and saw him. She raced to the car and started to hit the defendant through the open window in an attempt to get her stereo back. The defendant punched her in the nose and drove away with the system.\nC. A defendant was walking behind a shopper in a mall when he suddenly reached for her gold chain, pulled it from her neck, and ran away into the crowd. The shopper suffered a slight cut on her neck where the chain broke.\nD. A defendant picked the lock on an apartment door. The noise startled the tenant, who had been sleeping. The defendant overpowered the tenant, tied him up, and forced him to disclose where he kept his money. The tenant told the defendant to look in the kitchen cabinet, which he did. The defendant found $120 in cash, took the money, and left the apartment.\n"

This is because one of the elements of robbery is that the property taken must belong to the victim. In this case, the ring really belonged to someone else, so the defendant cannot be guilty of robbing the victim of the ring. Additionally, the use of force or threat of force must be present, but the gun used by the defendant turned out to be a water pistol, which means that the victim was not actually threatened with a real weapon. However, the defendant may still face charges of theft or attempted theft since he intended to take the ring without permission. \n\nIn situations B, C, and D, the defendants used force or the threat of force to take property belonging to the victims, which satisfies the elements of robbery. Therefore, they would likely be found guilty of robbery if convicted in court."
