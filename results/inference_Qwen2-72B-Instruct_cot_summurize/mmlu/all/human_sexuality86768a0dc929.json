Asceticism.\n\nAsceticism is an ethical system that involves self-discipline, self-denial, and abstention from sensual pleasures, often for religious or spiritual reasons. Monks and nuns who take vows of celibacy, virginity, and poverty are following an ascetic lifestyle as part of their religious practice. This is common in both Eastern religions like Buddhism and Hinduism, as well as in Christianity, particularly within monastic orders."
