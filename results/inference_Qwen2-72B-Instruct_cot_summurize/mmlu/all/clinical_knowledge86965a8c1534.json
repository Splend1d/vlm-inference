The products of ADP degradation that increase in concentration in the blood during such activities include ammonia, which is produced from the deamination of amino acids, and hypoxanthine and uric acid, which are produced from the breakdown of purine nucleotides.\n\nUrea is also produced from ammonia in the liver through the urea cycle, but it is not directly a product of ADP degradation; rather, it is a byproduct of protein and amino acid metabolism. Creatinine is a breakdown product of creatine phosphate and muscle creatine, not directly related to ADP degradation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Ammonia, hypoxanthine, and uric acid."
