The good is inferior and the income effect is stronger than the substitution effect.\n\nIn the case of an inferior good, when the price decreases, the substitution effect suggests that consumers will buy more of this good because it becomes relatively cheaper compared to other goods. However, since the good is inferior, there is also an income effect at play: as the price drops, the purchasing power increases, leading consumers to buy less of the inferior good and more of other (presumably better) goods. If the income effect outweighs the substitution effect, then a decrease in price can lead to a decrease in quantity demanded, which would result in an upward-sloping demand curve for this particular good. This scenario is counterintuitive since typically demand curves slope downward, indicating that lower prices lead to higher quantity demanded."
