The proportion of older women is particularly low.\n\nNumerous studies have found that older women are underrepresented on television compared to their actual proportion in the population. This underrepresentation can lead to ageism and reinforce stereotypes about aging, particularly for women. While there may be some variation depending on the specific show or network, this trend has been consistently observed across various quantitative analyses of TV content. It's worth noting that while older men are also underrepresented, the disparity is often more pronounced for older women."
