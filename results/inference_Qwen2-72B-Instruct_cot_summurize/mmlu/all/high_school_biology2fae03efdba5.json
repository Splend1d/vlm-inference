Speciation is the evolutionary process by which new biological species arise. In this case, the new variant has become reproductively isolated from the original population, indicating that they have evolved into separate species.\n\nOut of the options provided (Fallow deer, Fruit flies, Grass, Spotted toads), fruit flies are commonly used as model organisms in genetic research due to their short generation time, ease of breeding in a laboratory setting, and well-understood genetics. They have been extensively studied for genetic mutations and evolutionary processes, including speciation. Therefore, it is most likely that **B. Fruit flies** would exhibit the process described by the researcher.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that all the options could potentially exhibit speciation given the right conditions and over sufficient time. But since fruit flies are a common subject in evolutionary biology studies, they are the best choice among the options given."
