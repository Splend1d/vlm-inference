Since the image is formed at the same distance behind the mirror as the object is in front of it, we have:\n\nDistance of object from mirror = 100 cm\nDistance of image from mirror = 100 cm (same as object)\n\nThus, the distance of the image from the object = Distance of object from mirror + Distance of image from mirror = 100 cm + 100 cm = 200 cm.\n\nSo the correct answer is C. 200 cm."
