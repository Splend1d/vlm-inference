Congress must pay benefits to anyone who qualifies to receive them.\n\nIndividual entitlements refer to specific programs, such as Social Security or Medicaid, where individuals have a legal right to receive benefits if they meet certain criteria. These programs require the federal government to provide funding to cover the cost of benefits for all eligible recipients. Congress does not have discretion in funding these programs based on budget surpluses or other financial considerations; it is obligated to pay for the benefits of those who qualify. Options A, B, and D describe different types of federal funding mechanisms but do not accurately define individual entitlements."
