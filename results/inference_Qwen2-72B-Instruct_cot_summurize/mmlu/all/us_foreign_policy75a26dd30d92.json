Conservatives advocate increases in defense spending; liberals are generally skeptical of increases in defense spending.\n\nConservatives often argue for a strong national defense and support higher defense budgets as a means to maintain military superiority and respond to potential threats. Liberals, on the other hand, may be more cautious about increasing defense spending, preferring to allocate funds to domestic programs such as education, healthcare, and social services, or to reduce budget deficits. However, these positions are not absolute, and individual politicians and voters may have different views on specific defense issues."
