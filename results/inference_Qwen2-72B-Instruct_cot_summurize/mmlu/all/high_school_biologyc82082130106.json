Pyrimidine : Purine.\n\nIn DNA, the ratio of pyrimidines (cytosine and thymine) to purines (adenine and guanine) should always be 1:1 due to the base pairing rules. Adenine always pairs with thymine, and cytosine always pairs with guanine. This ensures that for every two purines on one strand, there are two pyrimidines on the complementary strand, and vice versa. Thus, the overall ratio of pyrimidines to purines in the DNA remains constant."
