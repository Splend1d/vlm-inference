False dilemma (also known as false dichotomy or false binary) - This fallacy occurs when an argument presents two opposing options as the only possibilities, when in fact more options exist.\n\nB. Circular reasoning (also known as circular logic or begging the question) - This fallacy occurs when the conclusion of an argument is among its premises, making the argument uninformative and not actually proving anything.\n\nD. Bifurcation - This term is not typically used to describe a specific logical fallacy but rather refers to a division into two branches or parts. It could be confused with the \"false dilemma\" fallacy if it's being used to imply that only two options exist when others are possible. However, bifurcation isn't a standard term for a logical fallacy in the way that false dilemma, circular reasoning, and accident are."
