But among the given options, option D is the closest to being true, although it's not completely accurate as stated. Let me explain:\n\nA. Systemic Sclerosis actually affects females more than males, with a female-to-male ratio of about 4:1.\n\nB. Telangiectasia can be seen in Systemic Sclerosis, but they do not clinch the diagnosis on their own. The diagnosis requires a combination of clinical features and sometimes additional tests like autoantibody testing or imaging studies.\n\nC. Arachnodactyly (long, slender fingers) is not a feature of Systemic Sclerosis. This is typically associated with conditions such as Marfan syndrome.\n\nD. Patients with Systemic Sclerosis may indeed have a \"beaked\" nose appearance due to nasal cartilage atrophy, and their skin can appear shiny and tight (waxy) due to the underlying fibrosis. However, it's not accurate to say that all patients will have these features, and the description provided does not fully capture the spectrum of skin changes seen in this condition."
