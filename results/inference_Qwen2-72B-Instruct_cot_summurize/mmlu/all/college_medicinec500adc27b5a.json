Gold's electron configuration is:\n\n\\[ [Xe] 4f^{14} 5d^{10} 6s^{1} \\]\n\nHere, the \\(5d^{10}\\) indicates that there are \\(10\\) electrons in the \\(d\\)-orbitals with \\(n=5\\), all of which have \\(l=2\\). There are no other \\(d\\)-orbitals occupied since the \\(4f\\) and \\(6s\\) orbitals do not have \\(l=2\\).\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\nB. \\(10\\) electrons have a quantum number \\(l = 2\\), but this option isn't listed among your choices. The closest option given is:\n\nA. 9\n\nHowever, based on the information provided and the correct interpretation of the question, the precise answer would be \\(10\\), which isn't an option in your list. Therefore, none of the provided options exactly match the correct answer under the interpretation that the question asks about electrons in \\(d\\)-orbitals (\\(l=2\\)). Given the options you've provided, none of them accurately reflect the correct response."
