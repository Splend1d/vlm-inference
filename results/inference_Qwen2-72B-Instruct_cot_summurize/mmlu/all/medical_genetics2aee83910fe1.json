Low risk of insertional mutagenesis: Adenoviruses typically do not integrate into the host genome, reducing the risk of insertional mutagenesis, which is the disruption of normal cellular functions due to the random insertion of viral DNA.\n\nD. Easy assembly: Adenovirus vectors can be readily manipulated and produced in large quantities, making them suitable for clinical applications.\n\nIt's worth noting that while long-term expression (option A) is often desirable in gene therapy, adenoviruses generally do not provide this due to their inability to integrate into the host genome and the immune response they elicit. Similarly, while low immunogenicity (option C) is an advantage in gene therapy, adenoviruses are actually known for eliciting strong immune responses, which can limit their effectiveness for long-term treatments."
