In fact, by using up the newer milk, you were being resourceful and responsible with food waste.\n\nIn Scenario 2, driving home after drinking three bottles of wine is clearly morally wrong because it endangers not only your life but also the lives of others on the road. This action goes against ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, which discourage drunk driving due to the high risk of accidents and fatalities."
