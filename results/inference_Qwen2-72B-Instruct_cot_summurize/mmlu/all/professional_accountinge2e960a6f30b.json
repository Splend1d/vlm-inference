The purpose of this allocation is to provide more detailed information about the components of income and their related tax effects.\n\nHowever, operating income (Choice D) is not a separate component for which intraperiod income tax allocation is required. Operating income is part of income from continuing operations before interest and taxes. Therefore, it is included in the overall income from continuing operations, and intraperiod income tax allocation would be applied to income from continuing operations as a whole, rather than to operating income specifically.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Operating income."
