                    "text": "In 1995, an investor purchased a 100-acre tract located in a rural county. Shortly thereafter, the investor prepared a subdivision plan, which created 90 one-acre residential building lots on this tract with the remaining 10-acre lot proposed for a public school building. In the investor's sales brochure promoting the subdivision, he stated that \"in addition to the close proximity of the proposed school for subdivision residents, the county school district would not need to expend tax money to acquire this property for school construction. \" In 1996, the subdivision plan was recorded with the county recorder's office. During the next few years, the investor sold 50 residential lots to individual purchasers. In 2002, the investor conveyed the remaining 40 lots and the 10-acre tract to a builder by deed that included language identical to that contained in the first 50 deeds. By 2007, the builder had sold all of the 40 lots. Each of these deeds identified each lot as being a part of the subdivision. On January 9, 2008, the builder sold the 10-acre tract to a buyer. This deed made no mention of the subdivision. On January 15, 2008, the county school board voted to build a new school on the 10-acre tract. Two weeks later, the buyer began construction of a pizzeria on the 10-acre tract. In an action by the school board against the buyer to enjoin construction of the pizzeria on the 10-acre tract, the court would grant judgment for\n\nA. the buyer, because his own deed made no mention of the subdivision.\nB. the buyer, because the dedication was not made to the public in general.\nC. the school district, because the 10-acre tract was designated for public use.\nD. the school district, because the 10-acre tract constituted an equitable servitude.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is C. the school district, because the 10-acre tract was designated for public use.\n\nWhen the original investor created the subdivision plan and promoted it with the promise of a public school on the 10-acre tract, this created an expectation among the buyers of the residential lots that a school would be built there. The fact that the investor conveyed the 10-acre tract to the builder with language identical to that in the first 50 deeds suggests that the designation of the land for public use was part of the conditions and restrictions attached to the property. These conditions can create equitable servitudes that run with the land and bind subsequent owners, even if they were unaware of them at the time of purchase.\n\nThe fact that the builder's deed to the buyer did not mention the subdivision does not negate the prior dedication of the land for public use. If the dedication was accepted by the public (in this case, the school district), it cannot be revoked unilaterally by the seller or subsequent owner. The school district has a legitimate interest in enforcing the dedication since it was part of the original plan and was relied upon by the purchasers of the residential lots. Therefore, the court would likely grant judgment for the school district to enjoin construction of the pizzeria on the 10-acre tract."
