The benefit received from studying is greater than the opportunity cost of $8.\n\nWhen Nancy chooses to study for the exam instead of babysitting her niece, she foregoes the $8 she could have earned by babysitting. This means the opportunity cost of studying is $8. For Nancy to choose studying over babysitting, the perceived benefit (improvement in exam performance, knowledge gained, etc.) from studying must be greater than the $8 she would earn from babysitting. This does not imply indifference between studying and mowing the lawn (option C), nor does it suggest that her behavior is irrational (option D). Option B is incorrect because the opportunity cost is not $14\u2014it's the highest-valued alternative forgone, which in this case is $8."
