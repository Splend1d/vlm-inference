A large-scale movement of struggling African American and white farmers, as well as urban factory workers, was able to exert a great deal of leverage over federal legislation.\nC. The two-party system of the era broke down and led to the emergence of an additional major party that was able to win control of Congress within ten years of its founding.\nD. Continued skirmishes on the frontier in the 1890s with American Indians created a sense of fear and bitterness among western farmers.\n"

This development is reflected in the Populist Movement of the late 1800s, which sought to address the issues faced by farmers due to the monopolistic practices of railroads and other large corporations, as well as the collusion between these entities and political leaders.\n\nThe Populist Party, or People's Party, was formed in response to the plight of farmers who were being exploited by monopolies and railroad companies. They advocated for reforms such as the direct election of senators, the graduated income tax, and the unlimited coinage of silver to help alleviate the financial burden on farmers. This movement also sought to challenge the influence of big business and political corruption, which were seen as barriers to fair treatment and economic opportunity for ordinary citizens.\n\nWhile the other developments mentioned (B, C, and D) also occurred during this time period, they do not directly relate to the themes presented in the lyrics of \"The Hayseed.\" Development B does touch upon the Populist Movement, but the primary focus of the song is on the corruption and exploitation by big business and government, which aligns more closely with Development A. Development C refers to the breakdown of the two-party system and the emergence of a third major party, which did not happen in the context described by the song. Development D relates to conflicts on the frontier, which is not the main theme of the song either."
