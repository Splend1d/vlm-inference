It describes a process that creates estimates that are too high on average or too low on average.\n\nBias in statistics refers to a systematic error in estimation, meaning that the expected value of the estimator is not equal to the true parameter being estimated. This can result in estimates that are consistently too high or too low. While options B, C, and D all describe situations that can lead to bias, they do not directly define what bias is. Bias can indeed result from a non-representative sample (options B and D) or a lack of randomization (option C), but those descriptions are more specific instances rather than definitions of bias itself."
