I answer, the rule of liberty that all just government derives its authority from the consent of the governed, applies only to those who are capable of self-government. We govern the Indians without their consent, we govern our territories without their consent, we govern our children without their consent. How do they know that our government would be without their consent? Would not the people of the Philippines prefer the just, human, civilizing government of this Republic to the savage, bloody rule of pillage and extortion from which we have rescued them? And, regardless of this formula of words made only for enlightened, self-governing people, do we owe no duty to the world? Shall we turn these peoples back to the reeking hands from which we have taken them? Shall we abandon them, with Germany, England, Japan, hungering for them? Shall we save them from those nations, to give them a self-rule of tragedy?\u2026Then, like men and not like children, let us on to our tasks, our mission, and our destiny.\"\nAlbert J. Beveridge, \"The March of the Flag,\" 1898\nWhich of the following rationales does Beveridge employ in his argument?\n\nA. The closing of the western frontier impels the United States to expand its territory overseas.\nB. Governing territories confers economic benefits to both European and nonwhite nations.\nC. Powerful nations have a moral duty to govern less developed nations.\nD. Racial superiority confers responsibility to the United States and Europe over the affairs of developing nations.\n"

Beveridge argues that the United States has a moral duty to govern territories such as the Philippines because it is a more civilized and just form of governance than what existed previously. He suggests that the people of the Philippines might actually prefer American rule over the previous conditions, and he raises concerns about abandoning them to other powerful nations or to self-rule that could lead to tragedy. This rationale aligns with the idea of a moral duty to govern less developed nations."
