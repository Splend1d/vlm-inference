Use of an undifferentiated one-size-fits-all marketing strategy.\n\nRecognizing the importance of ethnic groups by marketers typically leads to more targeted and differentiated marketing strategies that cater to the specific needs, preferences, and cultural nuances of different ethnic markets. An undifferentiated one-size-fits-all marketing strategy does not take into account the unique characteristics of various ethnic groups and is therefore less likely to be effective in appealing to them. The other options (B, C, and D) are common results of acknowledging the significance of ethnic groups in marketing."
