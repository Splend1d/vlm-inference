There is an average of $15,000 in wealth to every family in America. That is right here today.\nWe do not propose to divide it up equally. We do not propose a division of wealth, but we do propose to limit poverty that we will allow to be inflicted on any man's family. We will not say we are going to try to guarantee any equality \u2026 but we do say that one third of the average is low enough for any one family to hold, that there should be a guarantee of a family wealth of around $5,000; enough for a home, an automobile, a radio, and the ordinary conveniences, and the opportunity to educate their children.\u2026\nWe will have to limit fortunes. Our present plan is that we will allow no man to own more than $50,000,000. We think that with that limit we will be able to carry out the balance of the program.\n\u2014Senator Huey P. Long of Louisiana, Radio Address, February 23, 1934\nPresident Franklin D. Roosevelt responded to political challenges like that of Senator Long by doing which of the following?\n\nA. Announcing that he would not run for re-election\nB. Launching the Second New Deal, a series of legislative acts including Social Security\nC. Diverting people's attention by allowing the Japanese to bomb Pearl Harbor\nD. Urging Congress to cut taxes and deregulate the economy\n"

Long, who advocated for wealth redistribution and anti-monopoly measures, President Franklin D. Roosevelt expanded his New Deal policies. The Second New Deal, introduced in 1935, included significant legislation such as the Social Security Act, which established a system of old-age benefits and unemployment insurance, and the Wagner Act, which protected workers' rights to unionize. These measures were designed to address economic inequality and provide a social safety net, thereby addressing some of the concerns raised by Long and others."
