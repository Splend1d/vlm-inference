However, object relations theory diverges from Freudian theory by emphasizing interpersonal relationships and the internalization of these relationships as central to personality development. Therefore, while both approaches consider early experiences important, object relations therapy places more emphasis on the dynamics of relationships and attachment.\n\nFor this question, the closest correct answer is:\n\nC. early childhood experiences\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that option A (issues of attachment and separation) is also a significant aspect of object relations therapy, but since the question asks for the primary focus shared with Freudian psychodynamic therapy, option C is more directly aligned with Freud's original theories."
