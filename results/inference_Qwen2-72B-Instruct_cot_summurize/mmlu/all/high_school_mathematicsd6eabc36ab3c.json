                    "text": "Given that $a = 7$ and $b = 13$, we need to find the number of even positive integers less than $ab$. First, let's compute $ab$:\n\n\\[ab = 7 \\times 13 = 91\\]\n\nSo, we are looking for the number of even positive integers less than $91$.\n\nSince the first even positive integer is $2$ and the last even positive integer less than $91$ is $90$, we can use the formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence to find the total number of even positive integers less than $91$. The formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence is:\n\n\\[a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d\\]\n\nWhere $a_n$ is the nth term, $a_1$ is the first term, $d$ is the common difference, and $n$ is the number of terms. In this case, $a_1 = 2$, $d = 2$ (since we are counting by even numbers), and $a_n = 90$. Plugging these values into the formula gives us:\n\n\\[90 = 2 + (n - 1)2\\]\n\nSolving for $n$:\n\n\\[88 = 2(n - 1)\\]\n\n\\[44 = n - 1\\]\n\n\\[n = 45\\]\n\nThus, there are $\\boxed{45}$ even positive integers less than $91$. Therefore, the correct answer is A. 45."
