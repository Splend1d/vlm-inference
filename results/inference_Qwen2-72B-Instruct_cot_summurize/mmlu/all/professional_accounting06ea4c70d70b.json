Auditor plans to give greater representation to large recorded amounts.\n\nStratification is a technique used in sampling where the auditor divides the population into subpopulations (strata) based on certain characteristics, such as size, type, or location. This allows the auditor to focus more on areas with higher risk or materiality. By giving greater representation to large recorded amounts, the auditor can ensure that these significant figures receive adequate attention and testing. This approach is particularly useful when there is a high variability within the population, as it increases the efficiency and effectiveness of the audit by targeting larger balances which are often more prone to misstatement."
