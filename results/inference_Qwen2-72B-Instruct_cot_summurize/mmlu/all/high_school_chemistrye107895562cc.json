To do this, a piece of dry limestone was weighed. Then carbon dioxide was collected until the limestone disappeared. The atmospheric pressure was measured at 0.965 atm. The temperature was 295 K. The volume of CO2 was measured to the nearest mL and corrected for the vapor pressure of water. The student continuously got low results from what was expected. Can you suggest why?\n\nA. Limestone is never pure CaCO3.\nB. Limestone is Ca(HCO3)2.\nC. Carbon dioxide is rather soluble in water.\nD. Perhaps there was not enough acid to dissolve all the limestone.\n"

                    "text": "The most likely reason for the student's results being consistently lower than expected is option C: Carbon dioxide is rather soluble in water.\n\nWhen carbon dioxide is collected over water, some of it dissolves in the water, which reduces the amount of gas that can be accurately measured. This effect becomes more significant as the partial pressure of the gas increases or as the solubility of the gas in water increases. Carbon dioxide has a moderate solubility in water, which means that a portion of the CO2 produced will dissolve into the water, leading to an underestimation of the total volume of gas produced.\n\nOptions A and B could also potentially contribute to lower than expected results if the limestone contained impurities that did not react with the acid (option A), or if the limestone was actually calcium bicarbonate (Ca(HCO3)2), which would not react significantly with the acid to produce CO2 (option B). However, these reasons would not necessarily lead to consistently low results across multiple trials unless the impurities were consistently present in significant amounts or the identification of the limestone was consistently incorrect.\n\nOption D, \"Perhaps there was not enough acid to dissolve all the limestone,\" could also result in lower than expected results if the acid was insufficient to completely react with the limestone. However, if the student waited until the limestone disappeared before measuring the volume of CO2, then this option is less likely to be the cause of consistently low results, assuming the reaction went to completion each time. \n\nIn summary, while all the options could potentially contribute to lower than expected results, option C is the most likely explanation given the information provided."
