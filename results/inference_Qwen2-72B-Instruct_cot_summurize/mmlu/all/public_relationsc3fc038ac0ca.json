This figure is not listed in your options, but it's closer to option A (270) than any other choice; however, it's important to note that the correct answer based on current data would be more than any option provided. The Newspaper Society, which represents local and regional media in the UK, has previously stated that there are around 1,100 local and regional newspaper titles published in the UK. So, none of the above options are exactly correct."
