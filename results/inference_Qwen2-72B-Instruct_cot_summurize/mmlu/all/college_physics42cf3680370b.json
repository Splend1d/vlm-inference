The information provided - the moon's minimum and maximum distances from the planet's center (which give us the semi-major axis and possibly the eccentricity of the orbit) and the moon's maximum orbital speed - allows for calculations involving Kepler's laws, Newton's law of universal gravitation, and circular motion principles to find properties related to the planet's mass, the moon's minimum speed, and the period of the orbit. However, without additional information such as the moon's radius or its density, the mass of the moon itself cannot be determined from these observations. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Mass of the moon."
