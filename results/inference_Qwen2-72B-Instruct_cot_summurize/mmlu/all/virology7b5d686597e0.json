This type of transmission occurs when the Yellow Fever virus, which is typically found in rural or jungle areas where it circulates between mosquitoes and non-human primates, adapts to being transmitted by mosquitoes commonly found in urban environments, such as Aedes aegypti. This mosquito species thrives in densely populated urban areas and can lead to rapid spread of the disease among humans when an outbreak occurs. Urban Yellow Fever can result in large-scale epidemics due to the high population density in cities, making vaccination campaigns crucial for prevention and control."
