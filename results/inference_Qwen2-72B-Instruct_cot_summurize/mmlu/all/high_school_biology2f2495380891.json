It is an inactivated X chromosome and results in females with half their cells having one X inactivated and the other half of their cells having the other X inactivated.\n\nThis statement best describes what a Barr body is and its significance. In females, one of the two X chromosomes is inactivated to balance gene expression between males (XY) and females (XX). This inactivation occurs randomly in each cell during early embryonic development, leading to a mosaic pattern where some cells express genes from the maternal X chromosome while others express genes from the paternal X chromosome. The inactivated X chromosome is then condensed and becomes visible as a dense spot within the nucleus, known as a Barr body."
