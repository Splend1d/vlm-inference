When people hide their opinions if they do not agree with the majority\n\nThe spiral of silence theory suggests that individuals are less likely to express their opinions publicly when they believe those opinions are in the minority, especially when the majority opinion is perceived as dominant or supported by powerful groups. This can lead to a situation where only one viewpoint is openly expressed, while others remain silent, creating an illusion of consensus."
