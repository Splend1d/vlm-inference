This is because the psychologist's objectivity could be compromised by the pre-existing relationship, potentially leading to biased testimony. Additionally, agreeing to testify could harm the therapeutic relationship and breach confidentiality. If the psychologist feels compelled to provide information to the court, they should consult with legal and ethical guidelines and consider whether it is possible to do so without compromising their role as the child's therapist."
