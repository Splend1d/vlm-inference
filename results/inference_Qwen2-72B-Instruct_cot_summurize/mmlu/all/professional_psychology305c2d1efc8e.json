The APA is concerned with all of these groups and many more. It aims to represent the interests of psychologists and promote psychological knowledge to improve the human condition. This includes focusing on various populations such as non-White research participants (A), the elderly (B), clients with a physical disability (C), and people afflicted with a chronic disease (D). The APA supports research, practice guidelines, and policies that address the needs of diverse populations. If you have a more specific question regarding the APA's involvement with any of these groups, feel free to ask!"
