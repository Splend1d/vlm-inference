Initially, the pH slowly decreases, then there is a rapid decrease to give a pH below 7 at the equivalence point.\n\nDuring the titration of a weak base with a strong acid, initially, the addition of the acid leads to a slow decrease in pH as the weak base neutralizes the added hydrogen ions (H+). However, as the equivalence point approaches and more acid is added, the pH will begin to drop much more rapidly because the buffering capacity of the base is diminished. At the equivalence point, all the base has been neutralized, and the solution is primarily composed of the salt produced by the reaction and water. Since the base was weak and the acid is strong, the conjugate acid formed will not significantly affect the pH, which will be determined largely by the excess strong acid. Therefore, the pH will be below 7 at the equivalence point."
