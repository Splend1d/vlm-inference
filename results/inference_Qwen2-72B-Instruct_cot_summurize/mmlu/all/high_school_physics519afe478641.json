It's what counters the component of the gravitational force that would otherwise push the object through the surface.\n\nWhen you increase the angle of the inclined plane, the component of gravity that acts along the plane increases, and the component that is perpendicular to the plane (which is what the normal force opposes) decreases. The normal force \\(N\\) can be calculated as:\n\n\\[ N = mg \\cos(\\theta) \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\(m\\) is the mass of the object,\n- \\(g\\) is the acceleration due to gravity,\n- \\(\\theta\\) is the angle of the inclined plane with respect to the horizontal.\n\nAs \\(\\theta\\) increases, \\(\\cos(\\theta)\\) decreases because \\(\\cos(\\theta)\\) is a decreasing function for angles in the range of 0 to 90 degrees (the typical range for inclined planes). Therefore, \\(N\\) also decreases. However, it doesn't decrease linearly; instead, it decreases according to the cosine function, which is a nonlinear relationship.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nD. decreases nonlinearly"
