In this case, the landowner breached the covenant by conveying the property with an outstanding mortgage. The farmer, as the grantee, is entitled to recover not only the principal amount paid to discharge the mortgage but also the interest incurred as a result of the breach. This is because the farmer had to pay off the mortgage to clear the title and enjoy the property as intended under the covenant against encumbrances. Therefore, the court will most likely allow recovery for the full amount paid, including both principal and interest."
