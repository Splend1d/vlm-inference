Here is a breakdown of how Howard's concept aligns with these options:\n\nA. Six small towns surrounded by green belts and linked to a larger central city:\nThis part of Howard's vision refers to the idea of creating self-contained communities surrounded by \"greenbelts\" of countryside, where the greenbelt would prevent urban sprawl and preserve natural landscapes. These communities would be connected to a larger central city through transportation links, allowing for economic and social interaction while maintaining the distinctiveness and autonomy of each community.\n\nB. Planning cities to have plenty of trees, flowers, and public gardens:\nHoward emphasized the importance of integrating nature into urban planning. He envisioned garden cities with ample green spaces, including parks, gardens, and tree-lined streets, which would enhance the quality of life for residents and provide a healthy environment.\n\nC. Each privately owned house to have its own front and back garden:\nIn Howard's concept, every home in the garden city would have access to private outdoor space, promoting a connection between residents and nature. This was seen as crucial for maintaining a balance between urban living and the benefits of rural environments.\n\nOption D, regarding tower blocks and vertical displacement, does not accurately represent Howard's original vision. Howard advocated for low-density development with an emphasis on green space and community rather than high-rise living. However, his ideas have been interpreted and adapted in various ways over time, leading to different interpretations and implementations of the garden city concept."
