                    "text": "The ion-electron method is used for balancing redox (reduction-oxidation) reactions, where electrons are transferred from one species to another. Let's analyze each reaction:\n\nA. BaCl2 + Al2(SO4)3 \u2192 AlCl3 + BaSO4\nThis is a double displacement reaction and does not involve electron transfer.\n\nB. H+ + OH- \u2192 H2O\nThis is an acid-base reaction that combines a proton (H+) with a hydroxide ion (OH-) to form water. It does not involve electron transfer either.\n\nC. NaOH + H3PO4 \u2192 Na2HPO4 + H2O\nThis is also an acid-base reaction and does not involve electron transfer.\n\nD. C2H2(g) + N2O(g) \u2192 CO2(g) + H2O(g) + N2(g)\nThis is a redox reaction because carbon in C2H2 is being oxidized to CO2, and nitrogen in N2O is being reduced to N2. This reaction involves the transfer of electrons, making it suitable for balancing using the ion-electron method.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. C2H2(g) + N2O(g) \u2192 CO2(g) + H2O(g) + N2(g)."
