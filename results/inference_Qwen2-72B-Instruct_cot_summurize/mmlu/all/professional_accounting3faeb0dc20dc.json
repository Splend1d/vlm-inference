The entity's intention to omit from the financial statements substantially all of the disclosures required by GAAP.\n\nThis is because the omission of required disclosures would result in financial statements that do not conform to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), which is a fundamental requirement for the preparation of financial statements. The accountant has a professional obligation to ensure that the financial statements compiled are presented fairly, in all material respects, in conformity with GAAP. If the entity intends to significantly deviate from these requirements, it would be inappropriate for the accountant to accept the engagement as doing so could compromise their professional integrity and potentially lead to legal or regulatory consequences."
