It was introduced in 1980 by the William J. Murray Company, which later became part of Nabisco. The candy bar was created as a promotional item for Jackson, who was playing for the New York Yankees at the time and had just helped lead them to a World Series victory in 1977.\n\nAs for the other options:\nA. Baby Ruth - Despite popular belief, the Baby Ruth candy bar was not named after baseball player Babe Ruth but rather after President Grover Cleveland's daughter, Ruth Cleveland.\nB. Clark Bar - This candy bar is named after its creator, David L. Clark, who developed it in 1917.\nD. Butterfinger - This candy bar's name does not have any connection to a baseball player. The origin of the name is unclear, but it may have been inspired by the phrase \"butterfingers,\" which is slang for clumsiness or dropping things."
