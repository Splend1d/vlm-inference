Not wrong, Wrong\n\nIn scenario 1, putting metal pieces into a washing machine might not be a good idea because it could damage the machine, but it is not necessarily a morally wrong action unless it causes harm or significant inconvenience to others without their consent. However, this scenario doesn't provide enough context to determine if there's any moral wrongdoing.\n\nIn scenario 2, pouring hot coffee for a baby is clearly morally wrong because it endangers the baby's health and safety. Babies should not consume hot beverages, especially coffee, which contains caffeine that can be harmful to them. This action disregards the well-being of the child and could result in physical harm, making it a clear violation of ordinary moral standards."
