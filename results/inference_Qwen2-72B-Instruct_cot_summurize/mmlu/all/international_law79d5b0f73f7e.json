Recognition is simply declaratory of statehood but not determinate.\n\nThis means that according to this theory, a state exists as a matter of fact and law, independent of whether or not it is recognized by other states. Recognition by other states is merely an acknowledgment of this pre-existing status and does not create or confer statehood. In essence, a state can be considered to exist even if no other state has formally recognized it. This theory emphasizes that statehood is based on objective criteria (such as having a defined territory, a permanent population, a government, and the capacity to enter into relations with other states) rather than on subjective acceptance by other states."
