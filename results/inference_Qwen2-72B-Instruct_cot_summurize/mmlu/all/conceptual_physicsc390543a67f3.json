                    "text": "The correct answer is A. If the Sun were to collapse into a black hole, it would have the same mass as before but would be much more compact. However, the gravitational force that it exerts on the planets would remain essentially the same because this force depends primarily on the mass of the Sun and the distance between the Sun and the planet. Therefore, if the Sun became a black hole, Earth would continue in its present orbit around the Sun, assuming that the collapse did not significantly affect the angular momentum or orbital velocity of the Earth.\n\nHowever, this scenario assumes that the Sun's collapse does not involve any other catastrophic events such as a supernova explosion, which could potentially affect the Earth's orbit or even its survival. Additionally, if the Sun were to become a black hole with a mass much greater than its current mass (which would require additional matter to fall into the black hole), then the Earth's orbit would be affected, and it could potentially be pulled into the black hole or disrupted by tidal forces. But based on the initial conditions stated in the question, option A is the most accurate response. \n\nNote: Option D suggests both C and D are true, but since we're considering the Sun collapsing into a black hole with no significant change in mass or distance from Earth, options C and D do not apply under these conditions."
