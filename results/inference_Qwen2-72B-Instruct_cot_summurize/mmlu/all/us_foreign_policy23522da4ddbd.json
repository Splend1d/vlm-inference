It indicated a shift towards military containment.\n\nNSC 68, or National Security Council Report 68, was a top-secret document produced by the United States National Security Council in April 1950. It outlined a comprehensive strategy for containing the perceived threat of Soviet expansionism during the Cold War. NSC 68 advocated for a significant increase in military spending and a more aggressive approach to countering Soviet influence around the world. This marked a significant shift in U.S. foreign policy from the previous emphasis on economic aid and diplomatic efforts to contain the spread of communism, as outlined in the Truman Doctrine and the Marshall Plan. The adoption of NSC 68's recommendations represented a turning point in U.S. Cold War strategy, emphasizing military containment over other forms of engagement."
