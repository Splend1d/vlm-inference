An out-of-town client takes the audit engagement team out to dinner at a renowned local restaurant.\n\nWhile it is generally true that accepting hospitality from a client could potentially impair an auditor's independence, a single, modest meal in a professional setting is typically considered acceptable under most professional standards. The key here is that the dinner should be reasonable and not lavish, and the intent should be to facilitate professional communication rather than to influence the auditor's judgment. In this case, option B seems to be the least likely to impair independence compared to the other options, which involve more significant expenditures and personal benefits. However, auditors should always be cautious and adhere to their firm's policies and professional guidelines regarding such interactions with clients."
