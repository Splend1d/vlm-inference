The total number of nodes in the tree can be calculated as the sum of a geometric series with the first term being 1 (the root node), the common ratio being K, and the number of terms being N+1 (including the root level). Thus, the total number of nodes is (K^(N+1) - 1)/(K - 1).\n\nTo find the number of non-terminal nodes, we subtract the number of terminal nodes from the total number of nodes. So, the number of non-terminal nodes is (K^(N+1) - 1)/(K - 1) - K^N = (K^N * (K - 1) - 1)/(K - 1).\n\nNow, let's calculate the ratio of the number of non-terminal nodes to the total number of nodes:\n\n[(K^N * (K - 1) - 1)/(K - 1)] / [(K^(N+1) - 1)/(K - 1)] = (K^N * (K - 1) - 1) / (K^(N+1) - 1)\n\nAs N approaches infinity, the terms that involve powers of K dominate, so we can ignore the \"-1\" terms in both the numerator and denominator. This simplifies to:\n\n(K^N * (K - 1)) / (K^(N+1)) = (K - 1) / K\n\nThus, the ratio of the number of nonterminal nodes to the total number of nodes in a complete K-ary tree of depth N is approximately (K - 1) / K."
