As the price goes down, the quantity demanded goes up, assuming all other factors remain constant. Option A, \"an increase in demand,\" refers to a shift in the entire demand curve due to factors other than price (such as changes in income, preferences, or prices of related goods), whereas option C refers to movement along the same demand curve."
