Succession\n\nSuccession refers to the process by which an ecological community undergoes change over time, often following a disturbance or the colonization of new areas. It does not directly describe an interaction between two species, but rather a broader ecological process involving many species and their environment.\n\nThe other options (Commensalism, Mutualism, and Parasitism) are all specific types of interspecies interactions:\n\n- Commensalism: One species benefits while the other is neither helped nor harmed.\n- Mutualism: Both species benefit from the interaction.\n- Parasitism: One species (the parasite) benefits at the expense of the other (the host)."
