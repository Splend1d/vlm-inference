This is because between any two real numbers, there exists a rational number. Since A is open, for every point x in A, there exists an open interval (x-\u03b5, x+\u03b5) that is also contained in A. Since we can find a rational number in this interval, and A contains all rational numbers, it follows that A must contain all real numbers, i.e., A = R.\n\nB. This statement is not necessarily true. Consider the set A = R \\ {\u221a2}. This set is closed (since {\u221a2} is a closed set and its complement is open), and it contains all rational numbers, but it is not equal to R because it does not contain \u221a2.\n\nC. This statement is not necessarily true. The set of all rational numbers Q is countably infinite, but we can construct an uncountable set that contains all rational numbers by taking the union of Q with an uncountable set of irrational numbers, such as the Cantor set. However, this set would still not necessarily be equal to R.\n\nD. This statement is false. An uncountable set does not have to be open. For example, the set of all irrational numbers is uncountable, but it is not open since it does not contain any open intervals."
