Three tellers identified the defendant as the robber, a latent fingerprint found on the bank counter linked the defendant to the scene, and bank money had been found in the defendant's car. The police had arrested the defendant immediately after the robbery, as the defendant was driving away from the bank. the bank. When the prosecution rested its case, the judge directed the jury to return a verdict of guilty. The defense attorney did not object at the time. The jury withdrew, discussed the case, and agreed to a guilty verdict. The jury returned to the courtroom and announced the guilty verdict. The defense attorney then voiced an objection to the judge's having directed the verdict. The court overruled the objection and sentenced the defendant to 20 years in prison. On appeal, what should the appellate court do?\n\nA. Affirm the conviction, because the defense attorney failed to timely object to the judge's action.\nB. Affirm the conviction, because the prosecution presented both circumstantial and direct evidence conclusively establishing the defendant's guilt.\nC. Reverse the conviction, because the defense attorney's failure to timely object to the judge's action constituted ineffective assistance of counsel.\nD. Reverse the conviction, because the judge's action in directing the verdict denied the defendant his constitutional right to a trial by jury.\n"

Reverse the conviction, because the judge's action in directing the verdict denied the defendant his constitutional right to a trial by jury.\n\nWhile the evidence against the defendant is indeed overwhelming, the judge's decision to direct the jury to return a verdict of guilty before hearing the defense's case or any potential rebuttal is problematic. In a criminal trial, the defendant has the constitutional right to have a jury decide the facts of the case based on the evidence presented by both the prosecution and the defense. By directing a verdict of guilty, the judge essentially removed the jury's role in fact-finding, which is a violation of the defendant's Sixth Amendment rights under the U.S. Constitution.\n\nThe fact that the defense attorney did not object at the time does not necessarily mean that the conviction should be affirmed. If the defense attorney's failure to object was due to a strategic decision, it might not automatically constitute ineffective assistance of counsel. However, the more critical issue here is the judge's infringement on the defendant's constitutional rights. Therefore, the appellate court should reverse the conviction on the grounds that the judge's action denied the defendant a fair trial by jury."
