In this sense, option A comes closest to capturing the original meaning of the term, which was associated with a new democratic internationalism led by the United States. However, the term has also been used to refer to conspiracy theories about a secretive global elite seeking to establish a one-world government, which is not represented in any of the options given. Therefore, the most accurate answer from the options provided would be:\n\nA.
