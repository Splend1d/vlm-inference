The Phillips-Perron (PP) test incorporates an automatic correction for autocorrelated residuals in the test regression, which is one of the main differences between the PP and the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) tests. The PP test does not require the pre-specification of lag length as it uses nonparametric methods to account for serial correlation and heteroskedasticity in the error term. This makes the PP test more robust to misspecification of the lag structure in the autoregressive model.\n\nOptions A, B, and D are incorrect:\n\nA. Both ADF and PP tests are single-equation approaches to testing for unit roots; they do not involve systems of equations.\nB. Neither test reverses the null and alternative hypotheses. In both tests, the null hypothesis is the presence of a unit root (non-stationarity), and the alternative hypothesis is stationarity.\nD. While it is true that PP tests can have better finite-sample properties than ADF tests under certain conditions, this statement is not specific enough to describe the main difference between the two tests. The main advantage of the PP test over the ADF test lies in its ability to handle autocorrelation and heteroskedasticity without requiring the specification of lag length."
