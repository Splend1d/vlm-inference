Since there are 7 desks in a row and Hector is sitting 2 seats to the right of Kim, let's assume Kim is sitting at desk number 1 (for simplicity). That means Hector would be sitting at desk number 3.\n\nNext, since Tonya sits 3 seats to the right of Hector, if Hector is at desk 3, then Tonya would be sitting at desk 6.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many seats to the left of Tonya Kim sits. If Tonya is at desk 6 and Kim started at desk 1, then Kim is 5 seats to the left of Tonya.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. 5."
