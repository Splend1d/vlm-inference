It also assists in demonstrating accountability and transparency, which can influence future funding decisions. However, it should be noted that the information provided by this statement is also beneficial to managers (option B) and can indirectly impact beneficiaries (option C) as well. State regulatory bodies (option D) may also require or use such financial statements for compliance and oversight purposes."
