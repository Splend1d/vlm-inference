The original Big Bertha, officially known as the \"Gesch\u00fctz M. 14\" (Gun Model 1914), was designed by the German arms manufacturer Krupp and was capable of firing shells weighing over 1,000 pounds to a range of about 9 miles. Its massive size and destructive power made it one of the most famous artillery pieces in history. The name \"Big Bertha\" is said to have been derived from the wife of the head of the Krupp family at that time, Bertha von Suttner, who was an Austrian pacifist and Nobel Peace Prize laureate."
