The Aztecs were known for their ability to extract tribute from conquered peoples in the form of valuable goods and resources. They also maintained control over their empire through a combination of military might, political alliances, and religious ideology. However, it's important to note that the Aztecs were not solely focused on oppression and conquest; they also had a rich culture that included C. ceramic production, a distinctive architectural style, and artistic expression, as well as D. religious beliefs that required extensive and escalating human sacrifice."
