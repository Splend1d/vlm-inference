As they were swimming, both men saw what appeared to be a large fin entangled in a nearby coral reef. Simultaneously, they shot their spear guns at the projecting wing-like figure. Unbeknownst to either of the friends, it was not a fish but rather another scuba diver. The victim was struck and slightly wounded by one of the spears. The victim asserts a claim for damages against the two friends. At trial, the judge should instruct the jury to rule\n\nA. in favor of both defendants if no evidence is presented showing who actually shot the spear that injured the victim.\nB. against both defendants jointly unless one of them proves that he did not shoot the spear that struck the victim.\nC. against each defendant for one-half of the amount of damages, because they both acted independently and not jointly.\nD. against each defendant for one-half of the amount of damages, because they both shot their spear guns simultaneously.\n"

Since it cannot be determined which of the two friends fired the spear that struck the victim, they are both potentially liable for the injury. They can be held jointly liable unless one of them can prove that they did not fire the spear that caused the injury. This is based on the principle of joint and several liability, where multiple parties can be held responsible for the same harm, and the plaintiff can recover the full amount of damages from any or all of the defendants."
