I \u2283 (J \u2283 ~H)\n4. ~G \u2283 ~J\n\nLet's assume that all propositions are true, and we will try to find a valuation that makes them all true simultaneously.\n\nFirst, let's analyze each proposition individually:\n\n1. For (E \u2283 F) \u2283 G to be true, either (E \u2283 F) must be false or G must be true.\n   - If (E \u2283 F) is false, then E must be true and F must be false.\n   - If G is true, then there are no restrictions on E and F.\n\n2. For (~E \u2228 F) \u2261 (H \u2228 I) to be true, both sides must have the same truth value.\n   - If (~E \u2228 F) is true, then either E must be false or F must be true.\n   - If (H \u2228 I) is true, then either H must be true or I must be true.\n\n3. For I \u2283 (J \u2283 ~H) to be true, either I must be false or (J \u2283 ~H) must be true.\n   - If I is false, then there are no restrictions on J and H.\n   - If (J \u2283 ~H) is true, then either J must be false or H must be false.\n\n4. For ~G \u2283 ~J to be true, either ~G must be false or ~J must be true.\n   - If ~G is false, then G must be true.\n   - If ~J is true, then J must be false.\n\nNow, let's check the given options:\n\nA. Inconsistent: We need to prove this by finding a contradiction in our assumptions.\n\nB. Consistent. Consistent valuation when E is true and F, G, H, I, and J are false.\n   - Proposition 1 is true because (E \u2283 F) is false (since E is true and F is false), and G is also false.\n   - Proposition 2 is true because both (~E \u2228 F) and (H \u2228 I) are false.\n   - Proposition 3 is true because I is false.\n   - Proposition 4 is true because ~G is true and ~J is also true.\n   - This valuation satisfies all propositions, so it is consistent.\n\nC. Consistent. Consistent valuation when E and H are true and F, G, I, and J are false.\n   - Proposition 1 is true because (E \u2283 F) is false and G is false.\n   - Proposition 2 is false because (~E \u2228 F) is false but (H \u2228 I) is true due to H being true.\n   - Proposition 3 is true because I is false.\n   - Proposition 4 is true because ~G is true and ~J is true.\n   - This valuation does not satisfy proposition 2, so it is inconsistent.\n\nD. Consistent. Consistent valuation when E and I are true and F, G, H, and J are false.\n   - Proposition 1 is true because (E \u2283 F) is false and G is false.\n   - Proposition 2 is true because both (~E \u2228 F) and (H \u2228 I) are false.\n   - Proposition 3 is true because (J \u2283 ~H) is true since J is false.\n   - Proposition 4 is true because ~G is true and ~J is true.\n   - This valuation satisfies all propositions, so it is consistent.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B and D. Both valuations make the set of propositions consistent. However, since the question asks for one option, the most appropriate answer would be B, as it directly satisfies the given conditions without additional assumptions about H."
