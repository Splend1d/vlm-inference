She selects a random sample of students and collects information about their family income. A 95 percent confidence interval computed from this data for the mean income per family is ($35,095, $45,005). Which of the following provides the best interpretation of this confidence interval?\n\nA. 95 percent of the students in her school are from families whose income is between $35,095 and $45,005.\nB. There is a 95% probability that the families of all the students in this school have an income of between $35,095 and $45,005.\nC. If we were to take another sample of the same size and compute a 95 percent confidence interval, we would have a 95% chance of getting the interval ($35,095, $45,005).\nD. There is a 95% probability that the mean income per family in the school is between $35,095 and $45,005.\n"

There is a 95% probability that the mean income per family in the school is between $35,095 and $45,005.\n\nThis means that if the sampling procedure was repeated many times, 95% of the calculated confidence intervals would contain the true mean income per family of the school's student population. However, it is important to note that once the interval is calculated, the true mean either is or is not within the interval. The 95% probability refers to the method used to construct the interval, not to the specific interval itself. \n\nOptions A, B, and C are incorrect because they misinterpret what a confidence interval represents. Option A confuses the sample mean with the population parameter. Option B suggests that the interval applies to each individual family's income, which is not the case. Option C misunderstands the concept of replication; each new sample would result in a different confidence interval, not necessarily the same one."
