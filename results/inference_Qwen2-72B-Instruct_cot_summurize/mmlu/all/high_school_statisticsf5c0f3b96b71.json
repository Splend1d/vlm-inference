By attempting to follow up with the non-respondents, you can reduce this potential bias and increase the representativeness of your sample. If you cannot obtain responses from the original non-respondents, then options A or B might be considered, but it's important to acknowledge the limitations of analyzing only the respondents (option A) or inflating the weight of the respondents to account for non-responses (option B). Option D could also potentially mitigate the bias caused by non-response, but it might not perfectly replicate the characteristics of the original sample, and it would require additional resources to select and survey a new group of participants."
