In this case, the first unit of labor produces an additional 300 units of output, the second unit adds an additional 50 units, and the third unit adds an additional 25 units. The fact that each additional unit of labor results in less additional output than the previous unit indicates diminishing marginal returns.\n\nTherefore, the correct interpretation of the given information is:\n\nD. This is short run diminishing marginal productivity."
