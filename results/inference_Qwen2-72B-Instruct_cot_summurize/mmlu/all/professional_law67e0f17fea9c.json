The mother and her husband own their home in joint tenancy. One night, the mother went out to dinner and left her daughter at home. Upon leaving the house, the mother locked the door to her bedroom. While the mother was gone, the daughter found a spare key to her mother's bedroom and opened the door. While rummaging through her mother's dresser, she found a bag containing white powder. Concerned that the bag might contain drugs, the daughter called her father to ask his advice. The husband instructed her to call the police. The daughter then telephoned the police station and reported what she had found. A patrol car was immediately dispatched to her home. The daughter allowed the police to come inside and led them to her mother's bedroom. She gave the officers the bag, which they took to the station house for a lab test. After the results confirmed that the bag contained cocaine, the mother was arrested and charged with illegal possession of a controlled dangerous substance. The mother's attorney has filed a motion to prevent the cocaine from being admitted into evidence. The motion should be\n\nA. denied, because the daughter, and husband, as co-owner, had the authority to allow the police inside the home and make the seizure.\nB. denied, because the daughter lived with her mother and had equal control over the premises.\nC. granted, because the daughter, as a minor, did not have apparent authority to permit the police to enter the home.\nD. granted, because the daughter did not have apparent authority to permit the police to enter her mother's bedroom.\n"

The fact that the daughter found a spare key and used it to access the room does not confer upon her the authority to invite law enforcement to conduct a search of that area. Additionally, while the husband may have authority over common areas of the home due to joint tenancy, he does not necessarily have authority over his ex-wife's locked personal space. Therefore, neither the daughter nor the husband could validly consent to the search of the mother's locked bedroom."
