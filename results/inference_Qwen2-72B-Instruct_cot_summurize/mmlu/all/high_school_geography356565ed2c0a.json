Immigration\n\nThe primary boundary problem along the United States\u2013Mexico border is immigration, including illegal crossings, human trafficking, and drug smuggling. While other issues like land use and ownership can play a role in border disputes, the most pressing and politically charged issue is immigration. Irredentism, which is the policy or desire of a state to incorporate within its boundaries areas inhabited by people who share a common ethnic identity with the state's population, is not a significant factor in this particular border dispute."
