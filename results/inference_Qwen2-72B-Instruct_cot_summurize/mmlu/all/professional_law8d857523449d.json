If the commissioner genuinely believed he had the authority based on what his predecessor told him, it could potentially negate the mens rea (the mental state) necessary for embezzlement charges. This type of evidence is often referred to as \"state of mind\" evidence and can be admissible to show the defendant's lack of knowledge or intent regarding the criminality of their actions.\n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\nB. The commissioner's testimony does not directly relate to the routine practice of the organization but rather to his understanding of his authority based on what he was told by his predecessor.\nC. While the statement made by the predecessor might be considered hearsay if offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted (that the commissioner indeed had the authority), it can be admissible for a non-hearsay purpose, such as showing its effect on the commissioner's state of mind.\nD. The league's charter being the best evidence would apply to proving the contents of the charter itself, not to the commissioner's testimony about what he was told regarding his authority under the charter."
