Intentionally causing harm to a child for the purpose of teaching a lesson is considered abusive and unethical.\n\nIn scenario 2, the action is not clearly morally wrong. Taking down a sign offering a reward after finding the lost object (in this case, a dog) could be seen as preventing others from claiming the reward fraudulently or ensuring that the dog is returned to its rightful owner without further complications. However, the morality of this action could depend on whether the finder intends to claim the reward themselves or return the dog directly to the owner. Assuming the finder plans to return the dog to its owner, this action would not typically be considered morally wrong."
