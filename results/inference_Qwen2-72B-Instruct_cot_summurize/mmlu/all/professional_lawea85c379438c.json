During the party, the defendant invited the victim into his bedroom to show her his tattoos. When she entered his bedroom, the defendant ripped off her blouse and threw her onto his bed. He then jumped on the victim and tried to pull off her skirt. When the victim began to scream, some of the guests rushed into the bedroom and pulled the defendant off the victim. At trial, the defendant testified that he wanted to have sexual intercourse with the victim but he believed that she was consenting. The defendant further testified that he had consumed a pint of whiskey earlier in the evening and was intoxicated at the time the incident occurred. If the jury believes that the victim did not consent but also believes that the defendant, in his intoxicated state, honestly believed that she was consenting, the defendant should be found\n\nA. guilty, because consent is determined by the objective manifestations of the victim and not the subjective beliefs of the defendant.\nB. guilty, because voluntary intoxication is no defense.\nC. not guilty, because he honestly believed that she was consenting.\nD. not guilty, because his belief that she was consenting was reasonable.\n"

This means that the defendant's belief about whether the victim was consenting is irrelevant if that belief was not based on the victim's actual behavior or words. Furthermore, voluntary intoxication is typically not a defense to criminal charges, including sexual assault. Therefore, even if the defendant was intoxicated and genuinely believed the victim was consenting, if the victim did not actually consent, the defendant can still be found guilty of attempted rape.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the specifics of how consent and intoxication are treated in sexual assault cases can vary depending on jurisdiction and legal precedent. Some courts may consider the reasonableness of the defendant's belief in consent, but this is often secondary to the actual lack of consent from the victim. In any case, the defendant's intoxication does not absolve him of responsibility for his actions."
