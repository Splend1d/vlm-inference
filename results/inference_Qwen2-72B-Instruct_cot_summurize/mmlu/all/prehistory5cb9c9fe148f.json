Savagery, Barbarism, and Civilization.\n\nLewis Henry Morgan, an American pioneer in the field of anthropology, proposed a theory of social evolution that categorized human cultural development into three main stages: Savagery, Barbarism, and Civilization. This framework was influenced by the prevailing ideas of progress and evolution during the 19th century and was detailed in his book \"Ancient Society\" published in 1877. Each stage was further divided into lower, middle, and upper sub-stages. Morgan's theory has been criticized for its Eurocentric bias and oversimplification of complex cultural developments but remains influential in the history of anthropological thought."
