This equation is a statement of the first law of thermodynamics for a closed system under conditions where work is done by the system at constant pressure.\n\nTherefore, this equation is applicable:\n\nB. only for constant pressure processes\n\nAt constant pressure, the term P\u0394V corresponds to the work done by the system on the surroundings, which is one component of the total energy change in the system. At constant volume, there would be no P\u0394V term since \u0394V would be zero, and the equation would simplify to \u0394H = \u0394U. At constant temperature, this equation does not necessarily simplify as it depends on the specific heat capacities and the nature of the process. So, the correct answer is B. only for constant pressure processes."
