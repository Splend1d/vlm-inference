Deployment of troops in the Persian Gulf: The US military presence in the Persian Gulf region has been significant since the 1990s, primarily to protect its interests in the oil-rich area and to maintain freedom of navigation through vital shipping lanes like the Strait of Hormuz.\n\nC. Asserting primacy through military and political interventions: The US has used military force and political influence to maintain its dominance over strategic energy resources and markets, often competing with rival powers such as Russia and China.\n\nD. Stabilizing friendly political actors and securing the status quo: The US has supported friendly governments in oil-producing countries to ensure stability and prevent disruptions in oil supplies. This has sometimes involved backing authoritarian regimes or intervening in conflicts to maintain the existing order.\n\nThese strategies have been pursued to ensure reliable access to energy resources, particularly oil, which is critical for the US economy and military capabilities. However, they have also led to criticism and controversy regarding their impact on regional stability, human rights, and international relations."
