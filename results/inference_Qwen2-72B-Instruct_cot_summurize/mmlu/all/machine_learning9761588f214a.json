Specifically, we have:\n\nP(A, B, C) = P(A, B | C) * P(C)\n\nThis rule states that the probability of all events happening together can be broken down into the probability of one event happening given that the others have already happened, multiplied by the probability of those other events happening.\n\nIn contrast, options A, B, and D are not equivalent to P(A, B, C) without additional assumptions about independence or conditional independence among the variables."
