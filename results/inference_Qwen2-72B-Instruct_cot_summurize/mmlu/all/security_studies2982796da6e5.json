The responsibility to prevent, which involves addressing the root causes of mass atrocities;\n2. The responsibility to react, which involves taking timely and decisive action when a state is manifestly failing to protect its population from mass atrocity crimes;\n3. The responsibility to rebuild, which involves assisting affected states and societies in recovering from mass atrocities and addressing their long-term consequences.\n\nSovereignty is not considered one of the core components of the R2P framework, although it is often discussed in relation to the implementation of R2P measures. The principle of sovereignty has been reinterpreted within the context of R2P to emphasize that sovereignty entails not only the right of states to govern themselves but also the duty to protect their populations from harm."
