Environmental security entails a consideration of the security of the global environment, as well as its nested sub-systems and social systems beyond the boundaries of the nation state.\nB. Environmental security is a critical security project in that it questions who and what is to be secured and from what threat by orthodox security policies, or whether linkages between environmental, security and development issues can be made.\nC. Environmental security is a practical endeavour to assess how environmental change causes violent conflict within and between countries, and the ways in which environmental security can undermine national security.\nD. All of these options. The environment is both an object to be secured and a source of risk, although it may mean different things to different people. Whilst deepening the concept of security it has both critical and practical dimensions although the utility of the concept is contested.\n"

It can be seen as an object to be secured, particularly in terms of preserving natural resources and ecosystems for future generations. It can also be viewed as a source of risk, as environmental degradation, climate change, and resource scarcity can lead to conflicts over resources, displacement of populations, and other security threats. Environmental security challenges traditional notions of security, which have typically focused on military threats, and highlights the interconnections between environmental, security, and development issues. As such, environmental security can be both a critical and practical endeavor, with implications for national and international security policies. However, the concept of environmental security is still being debated and developed, and its utility and application are subject to ongoing discussion and analysis."
