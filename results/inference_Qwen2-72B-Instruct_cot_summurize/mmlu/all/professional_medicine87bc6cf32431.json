Examination shows a vulvar pustule that has ulcerated and formed multiple satellite lesions. Nodes are palpated in the inguinal and femoral areas. A smear of fluid from the lesions establishes the diagnosis. Which of the following is the most likely causal organism?\n\nA. Chlamydia trachomatis\nB. Haemophilus ducreyi\nC. Neisseria gonorrhoeae\nD. Streptococcus pyogenes (group A)\n"

This sexually transmitted infection typically presents with painful genital ulcers and tender inguinal lymphadenopathy, which matches the patient's symptoms.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Haemophilus ducreyi\n\nIt's important to note that while Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae can cause sexually transmitted infections, they do not typically present with the characteristic ulceration and satellite lesions described in this case. Streptococcus pyogenes (group A) can cause skin infections but is not typically associated with sexually transmitted diseases or genital ulcers."
