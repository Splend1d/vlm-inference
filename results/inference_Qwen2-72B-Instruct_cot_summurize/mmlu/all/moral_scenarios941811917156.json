In Scenario 2, pushing a sled down a snowy hill is not inherently morally wrong without additional context; it could be a normal and expected action during winter play or work. However, if there were additional details that made the action harmful or dangerous to others, then it could potentially be considered wrong. Since no such details are provided, we cannot assume the action is wrong."
