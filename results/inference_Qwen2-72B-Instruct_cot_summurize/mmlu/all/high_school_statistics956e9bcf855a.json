We are 90% confident that politicians running for a congressional seat spend a mean dollar amount between $117,500 and $132,500.\n\nExplanation: A 90% confidence interval estimate for the mean cost of running for a congressional seat based on a simple random sample provides an interval within which we expect the true population mean to lie with 90% confidence. This does not mean that 90% of individual politicians' spending falls within this range (which would be a common misunderstanding). Instead, it means that if we were to repeat the sampling process many times, about 90% of the resulting confidence intervals would contain the true mean cost of running for a congressional seat. In this case, the confidence interval is calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Confidence Interval} = \\text{Sample Mean} \\pm (t_{\\alpha/2} \\times \\frac{\\text{Standard Deviation}}{\\sqrt{n}}) \\]\n\nwhere \\( t_{\\alpha/2} \\) is the t-value corresponding to half the significance level (\\( \\alpha/2 \\)) and n is the sample size. Assuming a normal distribution or a large enough sample size for the Central Limit Theorem to apply, and using a 90% confidence level, we can calculate the interval. However, the actual calculation is not provided here, but the interpretation of the result is option D."
