While market focus and position are critical for any business, they do not necessarily describe components of an agile organization in the same way that human resources (multi-skilling), organizational structure, and project-based culture do.\n\nMulti-skilling in human resources is essential for agility because it allows teams to be more versatile and responsive to changing needs. An agile organizational structure tends to be flatter and more decentralized, enabling faster decision-making and responsiveness. A project-based culture supports agility by focusing on delivering value in manageable increments and adapting to feedback.\n\nThat said, market focus and position can influence how an organization implements agility. For example, understanding the market and customer needs can guide the prioritization of features or projects in an agile environment. However, market focus and position are not inherently components of an agile organizational model in the same direct sense as the other options listed."
