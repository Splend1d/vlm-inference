HM pays insufficient attention to the role of the labourer, instead focusing on the capitalist as the source of power and most important actor. HM can also allude to capitalist power structures, to the detriment of supporting the human security of workers.\nB. HM too often accuses capitalism of acting solely in self-serving ways, and explains everything in terms of class struggle, to the detriment of wider analysis. Some versions of HM claim to have uncovered objective laws of history which are widely disputed in their accuracy.\nC. HM is inevitably reductionist and oversimplifies the complexities of capitalism, recognising only its negative aspects and harmful effects.\nD. All of these options.\n"

Let's break down each point:\n\nA. HM does focus on the capitalist as the source of power, but it also emphasizes the role of the proletariat or working class in historical change. The criticism here might stem from an interpretation that doesn't sufficiently highlight the agency of workers.\n\nB. This criticism suggests that HM overemphasizes class struggle at the expense of other factors that influence society and history. It also points out that some Marxist theories claim to have discovered \"objective laws of history,\" which not everyone agrees with.\n\nC. Reductionism and oversimplification are common critiques of HM, as it can be seen as focusing too narrowly on economic factors while ignoring other important social dynamics.\n\nIn sum, D is the correct answer because all three criticisms are valid concerns raised by critics of Historical Materialism."
