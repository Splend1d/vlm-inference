Stan was married to Morgana and had two children, Andrew and Beverly. Walter's will provided in part:\"The net income from this trust shall be paid to my son, Stan, for his life. Upon Stan's death, the net income is to be paid to any widow of Stan. Upon the death of Stan's widow, Trend Trust Company shall then pay the income (from said trust) to the living children of my sister, Harriet, in equal shares. \"Harriet's only surviving child, Grace, was born in 2001. Both Stan and Morgana died in an airplane crash in 2009. There is no statute modifying the common law in this jurisdiction. Harriet, on behalf of Grace, brings an appropriate action against the Trend Trust Company and Walter's estate to allow the distribution of the income from said trust to be paid to Grace. Is Harriet likely to prevail in this action?\n\nA. No, because Grace was not a life-in-being at the time of Walter's death.\nB. No, because the provisions under which Grace was intended to take violate the Rule against Perpetuities.\nC. Yes, because that was Walter's intent.\nD. Yes, because all other persons who would have had any claim to the income from the trust corpus are deceased.\n"

No, because Grace was not a life-in-being at the time of Walter's death.\n\nUnder the traditional rule, for a future interest in property to be valid, it must vest, if at all, within the lifetime of some person alive at the creation of the interest plus twenty-one years (and nine months for gestation). This is known as the Rule against Perpetuities. Additionally, there must be someone alive at the time the interest is created (the life in being) whose life can be used to measure the duration of the interest.\n\nIn this case, when Walter created the trust, he specified that after Stan's death, the income would go to any widow of Stan, and after her death, the income would go to the living children of his sister, Harriet. Harriet was alive at the time the trust was created, so she could serve as the measuring life. However, Grace was not yet born at the time the trust was created, and thus was not a life in being. As a result, the interest given to Grace fails to vest within the requisite period under the Rule against Perpetuities.\n\nTherefore, Harriet is unlikely to prevail in her action to allow the distribution of the income from the trust to be paid to Grace, because Grace was not a life in being at the time the trust was created, and the interest given to her violates the Rule against Perpetuities."
