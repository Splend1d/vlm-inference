                    "text": "The problem involves the reflection of light from a thin film, which can be analyzed using the principles of wave interference. When light reflects off a thin film, part of the light is reflected at the top surface while another part penetrates through, reflects at the bottom surface, and then exits back out. These two reflected waves interfere with each other.\n\nFor constructive interference (i.e., maximum reflection), the path difference between these two reflected waves must be an integer multiple of their wavelength in the medium. The path difference is twice the thickness of the film because the light travels through the film to the bottom and back again. However, since the reflection at the bottom interface (oil-glass) experiences a phase shift of half a wavelength due to the higher refractive index of the glass compared to the oil, the path difference for constructive interference becomes:\n\n\\[ \\Delta = 2nt + \\frac{\\lambda_n}{2} = m\\lambda_n \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\(n\\) is the refractive index of the oil,\n- \\(t\\) is the thickness of the oil film,\n- \\(\\lambda_n\\) is the wavelength of light in the oil,\n- \\(m\\) is an integer (for the first non-zero minimum thickness, \\(m=1\\)).\n\nFirst, we need to find the wavelength of the light in the oil, which is given by:\n\n\\[ \\lambda_n = \\frac{\\lambda_0}{n} = \\frac{480 \\text{ nm}}{1.2} = 400 \\text{ nm} \\]\n\nSubstituting into the equation for constructive interference and solving for \\(t\\):\n\n\\[ 2nt + \\frac{\\lambda_n}{2} = m\\lambda_n \\]\n\n\\[ 2(1.2)t + \\frac{400}{2} = 400 \\]\n\n\\[ 2.4t + 200 = 400 \\]\n\n\\[ 2.4t = 200 \\]\n\n\\[ t = \\frac{200}{2.4} \\approx 83.33 \\text{ nm} \\]\n\nHowever, this result does not match any of the options provided, suggesting a misinterpretation or oversight in the calculation process related to the conditions for constructive interference. For the first non-zero minimum thickness, where \\(m=1\\), the equation should correctly account for the phase shift upon reflection at the bottom surface without directly setting it equal to \\(m\\lambda_n\\). The correct expression for the path difference leading to constructive interference, considering the phase shift, is:\n\n\\[ 2nt = \\left(m - \\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\lambda_n \\]\n\nThus, substituting \\(m=1\\) (the smallest non-zero integer value for the first order of constructive interference):\n\n\\[ 2nt = \\frac{1}{2}\\lambda_n \\]\n\n\\[ 2(1.2)t = \\frac{1}{2}(400) \\]\n\n\\[ 2.4t = 200 \\]\n\n\\[ t = \\frac{200}{2.4} \\approx 83.33 \\text{ nm} \\]\n\nGiven the provided answer choices, there seems to be an error in the interpretation or presentation of the answer choices as they do not align with the calculated result. However, based on the closest match to the calculated result and considering possible rounding or simplification, the answer closest to the calculated thickness of approximately 83.33 nm is not listed among the options you've provided. Given the options, none directly matches the calculation, but if we interpret the question with respect to the options, the closest answer to the calculated value isn't listed, indicating potentially a discrepancy in the question's answer choices or a requirement for further clarification on the problem's context or conditions.\n\nNonetheless, for the sake of the exercise and based on the calculation process, the provided options do not include the calculated thickness, which suggests there might have been an expectation for a different approach or understanding of the question's requirements."
