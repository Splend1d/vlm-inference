Promptly advise the client of the error.\n\nTreasury Circular 230 requires that practitioners exercise due diligence in preparing or assisting in the preparation of any document for submission to the IRS and that they promptly inform their clients of any errors discovered in documents previously submitted to the IRS. This ensures that clients have the opportunity to address any issues with their tax returns and make necessary corrections. While documenting the error in the workpapers is also advisable for record-keeping purposes, it is not the primary requirement under Circular 230 when an error is discovered after the return has been filed. Preparing an amended return may be necessary, but only after advising the client of the error. Resigning from the engagement is not required or recommended in this situation unless there are other extenuating circumstances not mentioned in the question."
