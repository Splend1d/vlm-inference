To measure galactic distances.\n\nCepheid stars are particularly important to astronomers because they serve as standard candles, which means their intrinsic brightness can be determined from their period of pulsation. By comparing the known intrinsic brightness of a Cepheid star with its observed brightness, astronomers can calculate its distance. This method has been crucial in determining the scale of the universe and the distances to other galaxies."
