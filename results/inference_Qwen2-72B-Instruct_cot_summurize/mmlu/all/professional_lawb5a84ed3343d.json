Which of the following statements is most accurate?\n\nA. The performance of the roofer would be a constructive condition precedent to the performance by the homeowner.\nB. The performance by the homeowner would be an implied condition subsequent to the performance by the roofer.\nC. The performances of the homeowner and the roofer would be constructive concurrent conditions.\nD. The contract would be unenforceable, because it was oral.\n"

The performance of the roofer would be a constructive condition precedent to the performance by the homeowner.\n\nThis means that the roofer must complete the repairs (his part of the agreement) before the homeowner is obligated to pay the $10,000 (her part of the agreement). In other words, the roofer's performance is a condition that must occur before the homeowner's obligation to pay arises.\n\nAs for the other options:\nB. This suggests that the homeowner's payment is contingent upon some future event after the roofer has completed the work, which is not necessarily true in this case as the payment is typically due upon completion of the work, not some unspecified event afterward.\nC. This implies that both parties must perform their obligations simultaneously, which is not usually how such contracts work. Typically, one party performs first (the roofer), and then the other party pays (the homeowner).\nD. While it's true that certain types of contracts must be in writing to be enforceable under the Statute of Frauds (such as contracts that cannot be performed within one year), the mere fact that this contract was made orally does not automatically make it unenforceable. Oral contracts can be enforceable if they meet the requirements of contract law. However, it's worth noting that the specifics of contract enforceability can vary by jurisdiction and the nature of the contract."
