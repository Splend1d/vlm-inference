A painful digital examination suggests an anal fissure.\n\nA painful digital examination can indeed suggest an anal fissure, which is a common cause of rectal bleeding and pain during bowel movements. \n\nB is incorrect because bright red blood typically indicates a lesion closer to the anus, such as hemorrhoids or an anal fissure, not a caecal (ascending colon) lesion, which would more likely present with darker, tarry stools due to the longer transit time through the digestive tract.\n\nC is incorrect because proctoscopy, also known as rigid sigmoidoscopy, can be very valuable in assessing the cause of rectal bleeding by allowing direct visualization of the lower rectum and sigmoid colon.\n\nD is incorrect because although rectal cancer can cause rectal bleeding, it is not the most common cause. More common causes include hemorrhoids, anal fissures, and diverticulosis."
