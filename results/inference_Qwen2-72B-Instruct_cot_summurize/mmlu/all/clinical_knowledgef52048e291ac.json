This allows for close monitoring of the wound healing process and can help in early detection of any complications such as infection or excessive bleeding. However, the frequency can also depend on the specific circumstances of the patient and the type of wound. In some cases, more frequent assessments may be necessary, while in others, daily checks (Option B) might suffice. Hourly checks (Option C) are typically not required unless there are specific concerns about the wound, and assessing only when the dressing is changed (Option D) may not provide timely information about the wound status."
