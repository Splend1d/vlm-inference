It seeks to identify patterns of biodiversity and understand the historical and ecological processes that have produced these patterns. Charles Darwin's observations about the similarities between the flora of temperate South America and tropical South America, rather than temperate Europe, contributed to his understanding of the principles of biogeography and, later, to the development of his theory of evolution by natural selection."
