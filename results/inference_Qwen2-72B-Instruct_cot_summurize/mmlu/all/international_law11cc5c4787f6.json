In the context of human rights, cultural relativism posits that the interpretation and application of human rights can vary from one culture to another. So, the answer closest to this definition would be:\n\nC. Cultural relativism posits that the application of human rights is relative to the laws and cultural norms in each nation.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that while cultural relativism acknowledges cultural differences and the need for understanding within a cultural context, it does not necessarily mean that all cultural practices are justified or that human rights can be completely disregarded. The concept is often debated in terms of how to balance respect for cultural diversity with the protection of universal human rights."
