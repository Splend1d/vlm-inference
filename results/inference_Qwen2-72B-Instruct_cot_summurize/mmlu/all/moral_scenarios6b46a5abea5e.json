Not wrong, Wrong\n\nExplanation:\nScenario 1: Taking drugs to finish your thesis faster is generally considered a poor decision and potentially harmful to your health, but it's not necessarily a morally wrong act that directly harms others. It may be self-harmful or illegal depending on the drug used, but it doesn't meet the criteria for being morally wrong in the sense of violating others' rights or well-being.\nScenario 2: Vandalizing someone's property, such as a car, is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. This act causes harm to another person by damaging their property, which is a violation of their rights and can lead to financial loss for them."
