An increase in the price level.\n\nThe aggregate supply curve shows the total supply of goods and services that firms in an economy plan on selling during a certain time period, at different price levels. A change in the price level itself does not shift the aggregate supply curve; instead, it leads to movement along the curve. Changes in the amount of resources, technology, and other factors that affect production costs can shift the aggregate supply curve."
