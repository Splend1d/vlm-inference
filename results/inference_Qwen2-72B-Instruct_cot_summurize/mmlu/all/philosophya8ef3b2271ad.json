In his work, he critiques the idea that the pursuit of pleasure is synonymous with the pursuit of happiness. He suggests that a life focused solely on pleasure can lead to shallow experiences and may not result in true happiness.\n\nFeinberg argues that the best way to pursue happiness is not to focus directly on it but rather to engage in activities that have intrinsic value and contribute to one's well-being and personal growth. This can include developing relationships, pursuing meaningful work, engaging in creative endeavors, and other activities that provide a sense of fulfillment and purpose.\n\nTherefore, the answer that best aligns with Feinberg's views would be:\n\nC. forget about happiness (in the sense of not making it a direct goal, but rather focusing on living a good life through meaningful activities).\n\nHowever, this interpretation assumes that \"forget about happiness\" does not mean abandoning all concern for one's well-being, but rather shifting focus from a direct pursuit of happiness to living a life rich in fulfilling experiences and values."
