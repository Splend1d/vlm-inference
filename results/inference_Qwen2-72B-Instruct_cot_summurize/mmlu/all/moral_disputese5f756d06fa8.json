While the patient's capacity for self-determination (option B) is also important, it is not the primary focus of valuing autonomy in this way. Similarly, while the ability to provide the patient with options (option C) and the ability to share reasons with the patient (option D) are important aspects of respecting autonomy, they are not the primary focus of valuing autonomy by maximizing effective options."
