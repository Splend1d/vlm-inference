Although the owner used due care in keeping the animal in a securely fenced area, he knew of one prior incident where the animal got loose and bit someone. Is the dog's owner liable for the injuries to the mailman?\n\nA. No, he is not liable because he used due care and was not negligent under the circumstances.\nB. No, he is not liable because the man was on someone else's property at the time of the incident.\nC. Yes, he is liable because a dog owner is always liable for any injuries caused to a third person.\nD. Yes, he is liable because an owner who knows of the dog's dangerous propensities is strictly liable for ensuing damages.\n"

The dog owner is liable because he knew of the dog's dangerous propensities (as evidenced by a prior biting incident) and therefore is strictly liable for ensuing damages. Even if the owner took precautions to secure the dog, knowledge of the dog's aggressive behavior can make the owner liable for any subsequent attacks. This principle holds true regardless of where the incident occurred, as long as the dog belonged to the owner."
