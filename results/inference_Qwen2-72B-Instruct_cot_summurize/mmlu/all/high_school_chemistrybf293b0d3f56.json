The precipitate formed is silver chloride (AgCl), so we can use its molar mass to figure out how much of the precipitate's mass comes from chlorine.\n\nThe molar mass of AgCl = 107.87 g/mol for Ag + 35.45 g/mol for Cl = 143.32 g/mol\n\nGiven that 0.435 g of AgCl was obtained, we can find the moles of AgCl:\n\n\\[ \\text{Moles of AgCl} = \\frac{\\text{mass of AgCl}}{\\text{molar mass of AgCl}} = \\frac{0.435 \\, \\text{g}}{143.32 \\, \\text{g/mol}} \\approx 0.003035 \\, \\text{mol} \\]\n\nSince there is one mole of Cl per mole of AgCl, this means there are also 0.003035 moles of Cl in the precipitate.\n\nNow we can find the mass of Cl in the precipitate:\n\n\\[ \\text{Mass of Cl} = \\text{moles of Cl} \\times \\text{molar mass of Cl} = 0.003035 \\, \\text{mol} \\times 35.45 \\, \\text{g/mol} \\approx 0.1075 \\, \\text{g} \\]\n\nThis is the mass of chlorine that came from the original 2.35 g sample. To find the percentage of chlorine in the original sample, we divide the mass of Cl by the total mass of the sample and multiply by 100%:\n\n\\[ \\text{Percentage of Cl} = \\left( \\frac{0.1075}{2.35} \\right) \\times 100\\% \\approx 4.57\\% \\]\n\nThe closest answer choice is B. 4.60%."
