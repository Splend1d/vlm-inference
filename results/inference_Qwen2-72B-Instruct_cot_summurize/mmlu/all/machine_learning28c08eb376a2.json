Therefore:\n- For \\(H\\), we need \\(1\\) parameter to specify \\(P(H = \\text{True})\\).\n- For \\(P\\), we need \\(1\\) parameter to specify \\(P(P = \\text{True})\\).\n- For \\(W\\), we need \\(1\\) parameter to specify \\(P(W = \\text{True})\\).\n\nThe node \\(U\\) has two parents (\\(H\\) and \\(P\\)), so its CPD will be a function of these two parent nodes. There are \\(2 \\times 2 = 4\\) combinations of states for its parents. For each combination, we need one parameter to specify the probability that \\(U\\) is True. However, since the probabilities must sum to \\(1\\) for each combination of parent states, we actually only need \\(3\\) parameters because the fourth can be determined by subtracting the sum of the others from \\(1\\).\n\nThus, the total number of independent parameters is:\n\\[1 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 6.\\]\n\nNone of the provided options (A. 2, B. 4, C. 8, D. 16) match the correct answer of \\(6\\). It appears there may have been an oversight in the question's options, as none of them directly reflect the accurate count based on the structure of the given Bayesian network. The closest option to the correct answer is not listed among the choices provided."
