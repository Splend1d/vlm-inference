Solomon in his debate with Ronald Dworkin, but it's often misattributed to Joshua Cohen and Joel Feinberg as well. However, if we're considering the context where someone like Ian Shapiro or Jeremy Waldron might discuss Allan C. Hutchinson's views on censorship, it would make sense to talk about harm.\n\nIn this context, the kind of harm that presents significant difficulties for defending a pro-censorship position based solely on its claims is A. expressive harm. This is because expressive harm is more subjective and harder to quantify than other forms of harm like physical or causal harm. Expressive harm refers to the idea that speech can cause harm by expressing or endorsing discriminatory or hateful ideas, but it's often debated whether this kind of harm justifies limiting free speech.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\nA. expressive harm"
