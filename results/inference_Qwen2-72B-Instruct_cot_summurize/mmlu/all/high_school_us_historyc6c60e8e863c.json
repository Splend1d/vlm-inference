It is well to notice this advantage\u2014the advantage of complete organization. They are organized; and yet were not at the pains of creating their organizations. The State governments, where the system of slavery exists, are complete slavery organizations. The church organizations in those States are equally at the service of slavery; while the Federal Government, with its army and navy, from the chief magistracy in Washington, to the Supreme Court, and thence to the chief marshalship at New York, is pledged to support, defend, and propagate the crying curse of human bondage. The pen, the purse, and the sword, are united against the simple truth, preached by humble men in obscure places.\"\nFrederick Douglass, 1857\nIn what way did the actions of Abraham Lincoln in 1860 contradict Douglass's sentiments in the excerpt above?\n\nA. Lincoln promoted the freedom of settlers within territories to determine the slave status of their new state.\nB. Lincoln passed the Homestead Act to give free land to all western settlers.\nC.

In 1860, Lincoln ran for president on a platform that opposed the expansion of slavery into the new territories. This stance was in direct contradiction to the sentiment expressed by Douglass that the government, including its army and navy, was pledged to support, defend, and propagate slavery. By favoring the exclusion of slavery from any of the new territories, Lincoln was taking a step towards limiting the reach and power of slavery, which was contrary to the complete organization in support of slavery that Douglass described.\n\nThe other options do not accurately represent Lincoln's actions in 1860:\n- Option A refers to the concept of popular sovereignty, which Lincoln opposed as it could lead to the expansion of slavery.\n- Option B, the Homestead Act, was indeed passed under Lincoln's presidency but not until 1862, two years after he took office.\n- Option D, the policy of giving newly freed slaves \"forty acres and a mule,\" was a proposal made during the Reconstruction era after the Civil War, not an action taken by Lincoln in 1860."
