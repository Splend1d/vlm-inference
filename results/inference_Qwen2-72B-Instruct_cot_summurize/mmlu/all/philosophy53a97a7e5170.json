Aquinas argues that pleasure is a byproduct or an accompaniment of a good operation or activity. In his view, pleasure does not exist as an end in itself but rather as something that comes from doing what we are meant to do. Therefore, he would disagree with A (pleasure existing for its own sake) and C (operation existing for the sake of pleasure). Thus, option D (both B and C) is also incorrect."
