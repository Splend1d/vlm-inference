This was the time of the pre-Socratic philosophers, such as Thales, Anaximander, and Heraclitus, who began to question traditional religious beliefs and develop more naturalistic explanations for the workings of the universe. So the answer is C. Late Sixth Century BCE. However, it's worth noting that this shift didn't happen overnight and continued to evolve over the following centuries with philosophers like Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle."
