He then pushed the woman out of the way and ran out of the subway car while carrying the purse. The man was apprehended on the subway platform while in possession of the purse. In a jurisdiction that follows the common law with respect to criminal offenses, of what crime can the man properly be convicted?\n\nA. Larceny, because force was not used until after he took the purse.\nB. Larceny, because he made no threat to use force.\nC. Robbery, because he physically took the purse from the woman's presence.\nD. Robbery, because he used force in leaving with the purse.\n"

If force or intimidation is used to take property directly from a person or their immediate presence, it is considered robbery. In this scenario, the man did indeed take the purse directly from the woman's presence and subsequently used force (pushing) to escape with the purse.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer would be:\n\nD. Robbery, because he used force in leaving with the purse."
