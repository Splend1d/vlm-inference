When sled dogs were first domesticated\n\nThe domestication of sled dogs, while interesting in its own right, is not directly relevant to determining when people first entered the Americas from Siberia. Anthropologists primarily rely on evidence such as archaeological findings, genetic data, and geological information about land bridges and ice corridors to establish the timing of human migration. The domestication of dogs, while it may have occurred around the same time or later, does not provide direct evidence for when humans made the initial journey across the Bering Land Bridge."
