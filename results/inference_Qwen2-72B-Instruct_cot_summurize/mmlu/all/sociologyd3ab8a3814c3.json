They have a deep-rooted sense of ineffectiveness and are striving for control: This suggests that some women might feel they lack control over certain aspects of their lives and believe that by changing their appearance through cosmetic surgery, they can regain a sense of control.\n\nB. They are in pursuit of the 'perfect' body, fuelled by images of beauty: The media often portrays an unrealistic standard of beauty that many women aspire to achieve. This can lead to feelings of inadequacy and the belief that cosmetic surgery is necessary to meet these standards.\n\nC. They perceive a part of their body as stigmatizing, in relation to a cultural ideal: In some cultures, certain physical features are highly valued or considered more attractive than others. If a woman feels that a part of her body does not meet these cultural ideals, she might consider cosmetic surgery to correct it.\n\nD. Their male partners pressure them to look like supermodels: While this reason is not explicitly mentioned by Davis, societal pressures, including those from partners, can contribute to a woman's decision to undergo cosmetic surgery. However, it is important to note that the decision to undergo such procedures is complex and multifaceted, often involving a combination of personal, social, and psychological factors.\n\nDavis (1995) likely discussed these motivations within a broader context of how societal norms and expectations influence women's decisions regarding their bodies and appearance."
