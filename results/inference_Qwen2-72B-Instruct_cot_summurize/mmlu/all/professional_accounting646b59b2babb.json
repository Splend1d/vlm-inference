Machinery and equipment used in a business\n\nIn the context of federal income tax, capital assets generally include property held for investment or personal use, rather than for resale as inventory or for use in a trade or business within one year. However, special rules apply to property used in a trade or business. Machinery and equipment used in a business are usually considered capital assets because they are tangible property with a useful life of more than one year that is used in the operation of a business. Accounts receivable, marketable securities, and inventory are typically not considered capital assets for tax purposes because they are either current assets or held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business."
