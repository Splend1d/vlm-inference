Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn Scenario 1, waxing your boyfriend's car is generally considered a kind gesture, and not morally wrong unless there were specific circumstances not mentioned that would make it so (like if you were using his belongings without permission or if it caused harm).\n\nIn Scenario 2, insisting on being the first in line when there is not enough food to go around might be seen as selfish, but it is not necessarily morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. It could be argued that in situations of scarcity, one should consider the needs of others, but there is no clear-cut rule that makes this action universally wrong. However, it might be viewed negatively in terms of social etiquette or community spirit."
