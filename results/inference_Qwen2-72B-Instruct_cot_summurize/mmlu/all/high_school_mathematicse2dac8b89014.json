We want to solve for $n$.\n\nSubstitute the known values into the formula:\n\\[48 = -36 + (n-1)7\\]\n\nSolve for $n$:\n\\[48 = -36 + 7n - 7\\]\n\\[48 = -43 + 7n\\]\n\\[48 + 43 = 7n\\]\n\\[91 = 7n\\]\n\\[n = 13\\]\n\nTherefore, there are $\\boxed{13}$ numbers in the list.\n\nSo, the correct answer is C. 13."
