This action decreases the reserves held by banks and reduces their capacity to create new money through lending.\n\nGiven that the reserve requirement is 5%, for every dollar of reserves that banks hold, they can lend out $20 ($1 / 0.05 = $20). This is known as the money multiplier effect.\n\nIf the FED sells $10 million worth of government securities, this directly removes $10 million from the banking system's reserves. Banks will have less money to lend out. The potential reduction in the money supply can be calculated using the money multiplier:\n\nReduction in money supply = Change in reserves * Money multiplier\n= $10 million * (1 / 0.05)\n= $10 million * 20\n= $200 million\n\nSo, the correct answer is B. decrease by $200 million.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the actual change in the money supply depends on various factors, including the behavior of banks and the public. In reality, the decrease might not fully reach $200 million if banks choose to increase their excess reserves or if the public decides to hold more cash instead of depositing it into banks. But in theory, under the given conditions, the maximum potential decrease in the money supply could be $200 million."
