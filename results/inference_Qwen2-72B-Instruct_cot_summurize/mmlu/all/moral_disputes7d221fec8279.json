Minimize distorted thinking. CBT aims to help individuals identify and challenge negative or irrational thoughts and beliefs that contribute to emotional distress and behavioral problems. By replacing these distorted thoughts with more realistic and adaptive ones, individuals can improve their mood, reduce anxiety, and develop healthier coping strategies."
