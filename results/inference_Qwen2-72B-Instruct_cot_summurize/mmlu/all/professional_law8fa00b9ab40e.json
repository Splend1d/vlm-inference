She was studying in the law library and decided to take a short refreshment break. When she returned to her study desk ten minutes later, her Primer Series was gone. She ran into the student lounge and announced, \"I will pay $20 to anyone who identifies the dirty bum who took my Primer Series MBE Review books.\"\u009d Donna Doubtful saw Terry Thief pick up Sarah's Primer Series books, but did not believe Sarah would actually pay her the $20, if she made the identification. Thus, Donna went up to Sarah and said, \"I know the identity of the thief and promise to tell you, but I want the $20 in advance.\"\u009d The effect of Donna's statement is to\n\nA. Create a unilateral contract.\nB. Create a bilateral contract.\nC. Create no contract.\nD. Create a contract which is defeasible unless Donna makes the required disclosure within a reasonable period of time.\n"

In this case, Donna promised to disclose the identity of the thief (Terry Thief) in exchange for Sarah's promise to pay her $20. This differs from a unilateral contract where one party makes a promise in exchange for an act by another party.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Create a bilateral contract."
