Construct\n\nIn this context, the psychologist is designing a screening test to identify underachieving first- and second-grade children who have a learning disability. This means that the test needs to accurately measure the underlying construct (learning disability) it is intended to assess. Therefore, the psychologist will be most concerned with ensuring that the test has adequate construct validity.\n\nConstruct validity refers to the extent to which a test measures the theoretical construct or trait it is designed to measure. It is crucial in educational and psychological testing because it helps ensure that the test is measuring what it claims to measure and not something else.\n\nContent validity would be important if the test were assessing specific knowledge or skills within a curriculum, but in this case, the focus is on identifying a learning disability rather than assessing content knowledge.\n\nConcurrent validity would be relevant if the test were being compared to another established test of learning disability, but the question does not indicate that such a comparison is being made.\n\nPredictive validity would be relevant if the test were being used to predict future academic performance or outcomes, but the primary concern here is identifying current learning disabilities."
