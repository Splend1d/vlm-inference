The mode is the most common value and can be on the right side of the distribution where there's a higher frequency of values.\n\nThe standard deviation measures the spread or dispersion of the data, but it does not necessarily have the highest value among these statistics in this context.\n\nTherefore, the statistic with the highest numerical value in this scenario would be the mean, assuming that the values are all positive and that the skewness isn't so extreme that the mean becomes negative.\n\nSo the answer is D. mean. However, it's important to note that \"highest value\" could be interpreted differently depending on the context, and if we're talking about magnitude, the standard deviation could potentially have a larger value than the mean, depending on the specific distribution. But under the assumption that we're looking for the largest statistic in terms of its place in the distribution, the mean would be correct."
