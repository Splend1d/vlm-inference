However, it's important to note that infants begin to develop social bonds and preferences for their caregivers earlier than this, with behaviors like smiling, vocalizing, and showing distress when separated from them starting as early as a few weeks old. But according to most developmental psychologists, secure attachment, characterized by specific behaviors such as seeking comfort and proximity to the caregiver, typically becomes evident around 6-7 months."
