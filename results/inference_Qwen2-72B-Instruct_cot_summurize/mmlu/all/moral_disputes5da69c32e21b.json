Cloned individuals may be seen as curiosities because they would be the first of their kind, and people may be fascinated by the idea of an exact genetic replica of another person. Additionally, cloned individuals may be scrutinized in relation to the person they are clones of, as people may compare them to the original individual and judge them based on how closely they resemble or differ from the original. This could lead to unfair expectations and pressures on the cloned individual, as well as potential discrimination or prejudice."
