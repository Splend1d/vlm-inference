Neoliberal based adjustment policies have caused great and unnecessary hardship in developing countries and there is still no evidence they achieved their objectives for macroeconomic stability and growth.\n\nStructural Adjustment Policies (SAPs), often imposed by international financial institutions such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, have been criticized for causing significant hardship in many developing countries. These policies typically require governments to implement austerity measures, privatize state-owned enterprises, devalue currencies, remove trade barriers, and reduce public spending on social services. Critics argue that these policies have led to increased poverty, inequality, and social unrest, while failing to deliver promised economic benefits.\n\nWhile some proponents of SAPs may point to instances where these policies have contributed to economic growth or stabilization, the overall legacy of SAPs is often seen as one of mixed results at best, and failure at worst, particularly in terms of achieving sustainable development and improving living standards for the majority of the population in affected countries."
