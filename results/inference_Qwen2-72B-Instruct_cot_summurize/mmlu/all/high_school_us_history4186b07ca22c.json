The 55% popular vote for the president was the third largest in the nineteenth century, surpassed only by Jackson's first victory in 1828 and Grant's reelection in 1872. McClellan won only New Jersey, Delaware, and Kentucky. Republicans drew support from native-born farmers, skilled and professional workers, those of New England descent, younger voters, and military personnel. Democrats were strongest in the cities and among Irish- and German-Americans (the most populous immigrant groups). It has been estimated that Lincoln received 78% of the vote of Union soldiers and sailors. The figure was not necessary for his reelection, but was perhaps the margin of victory in a few close states and, more importantly, of great symbolic value. Republicans also gained seats in Congress to retain unassailable control, 149 to 42 in the House and 42 to 10 in the Senate; took back several state legislatures; and lost only the governorship of New Jersey (McClellan's home state).\"\nElection of 1864, Harpweek.com\nWhich of the following provides the best explanation for why Radical Republicans opposed Lincoln in 1861?\n\nA.

However, based on historical context, the best explanation is:\n\nC. Lincoln's Ten Percent Plan provided no assurance of black suffrage.\n\nThe Radical Republicans were in favor of more stringent measures for Reconstruction and ensuring the rights of freed slaves, including voting rights. Lincoln's Ten Percent Plan, which allowed Southern states to be readmitted to the Union after 10% of their voters had taken an oath of allegiance to the Union, did not address the issue of black suffrage, which was a major concern for the Radical Republicans. This lack of provision for black voting rights was one of the reasons they opposed Lincoln's policies early in the war."
