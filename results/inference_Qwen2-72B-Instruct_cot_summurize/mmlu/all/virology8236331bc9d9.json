Self-assemble of virus L1 protein into VLP\n\nHPV vaccines, such as Gardasil and Cervarix, are made up of virus-like particles (VLPs) that contain the L1 protein from the human papillomavirus. These VLPs mimic the structure of the virus but do not contain any viral DNA, so they cannot cause infection or cancer. They stimulate an immune response that provides protection against certain types of HPV that can lead to cervical, anal, and other cancers."
