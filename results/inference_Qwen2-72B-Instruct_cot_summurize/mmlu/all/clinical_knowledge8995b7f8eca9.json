These patients are more likely to get urinary tract infections if their blood sugar is unstable.\n\nDiabetes can affect the immune system, making individuals more susceptible to infections, including urinary tract infections (UTIs). High blood sugar levels provide a favorable environment for bacteria to grow, increasing the risk of UTIs. Additionally, diabetes can cause nerve damage that affects bladder function, leading to problems with emptying the bladder completely, which also increases the risk of UTIs."
