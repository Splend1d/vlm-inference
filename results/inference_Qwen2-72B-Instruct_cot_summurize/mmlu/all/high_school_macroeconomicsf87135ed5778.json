The given information does not directly support option A (MPC = 0.80), but it does support option C (MPS = 0.10). If the initial consumption of $8000 from a disposable income of $10000 is considered, then the initial MPC can be calculated as:\n\nInitial MPC = Initial Consumption / Initial Disposable Income\n= $8000 / $10000\n= 0.80\n\nThis would make option A correct based on the initial conditions. But for the change in income, option C is correct based on the provided information.\n\nSo, the correct answers are:\n\nA. the marginal propensity to consume is .80. (Based on the initial conditions)\nC. the marginal propensity to save is .10. (Based on the change in income)"
