Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation: In both scenarios, the actions described do not necessarily violate ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nScenario 1 might be considered disruptive or irresponsible if the intention was to cause harm or create an unsafe environment for the performers, but without further context, pouring water on the stage could have been an accident or part of a performance. If it was done with malicious intent, it could be seen as morally wrong, but based on the information given, we cannot assume that.\n\nScenario 2 involves asking for directions to a public facility, which is not morally wrong. It's a reasonable request and does not involve any harmful intentions or actions. However, using a public pool as a restroom would be inappropriate and against most public health codes, but the scenario only describes asking for directions, not actually using the pool inappropriately."
