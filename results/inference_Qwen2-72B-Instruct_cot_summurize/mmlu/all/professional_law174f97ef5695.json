If the defense wants to use the prior inconsistent statement to challenge the credibility of the bystander's testimony about the color of the traffic light, they can do so. However, the statement itself cannot be used as substantive evidence to prove that the traffic light was not red at the time the defendant drove through it. The prior statement can only be used to impeach the witness's credibility, meaning to show that the witness is unreliable or not trustworthy. Therefore, on request by the plaintiff, the judge should instruct the jury that the prior statement may be used only to impeach the bystander's credibility, and not as substantive evidence."
