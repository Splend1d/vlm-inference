Scale and Organization: Terrorism is often carried out on a larger scale than common crimes studied by the Chicago School, such as gang violence or petty theft. Terrorist acts are usually well-planned and coordinated, sometimes involving multiple countries and sophisticated networks.\n\n2. Political Motivation: Unlike many crimes that may be motivated by personal gain or local disputes, terrorism is often associated with broader political conflicts and ideological goals. It can involve state actors or non-state actors who aim to influence political outcomes or create fear among populations.\n\n3. Impact on International Relations: The effects of terrorism can extend beyond the immediate victims and impact international relations. Acts of terrorism can strain diplomatic ties between countries, lead to military interventions, or prompt changes in foreign policy.\n\nTherefore, all three points (A, B, and C) accurately describe how terrorism is distinct from the types of crime typically analyzed by the Chicago School."
