In this case, the number 11 and 9 both occur three times, and 10 occurs three times as well. This dataset has multiple modes (10, 11, and 9), which indicates that it is multimodal. However, when asked for a single value that represents the central tendency, reporting multiple modes isn't ideal unless specifically allowed.\n\n- **Median**: The median is the middle score when the data is arranged in order. Since there are 15 scores, the median will be the 8th score when they are ordered from smallest to largest. The scores are already listed in order, so the 8th score is 11. This makes the median 11, which is a good representation of the center of the distribution because half of the scores are below it, and half are above it.\n\nGiven these explanations, the best choice for representing the central tendency of this data set is the **median**.\n\nSo the correct answer is:\n\nD. median"
