This is a significant trait that distinguishes them from many other primates that primarily use all four limbs for movement. While there are differences in the degree and efficiency of bipedalism between the two species, the ability to walk upright is a common feature. \n\nB. a reliance on brachiation is incorrect because brachiation, which is swinging through trees using only the arms, is not a characteristic of either species.\n\nC. a lack of sexual dimorphism is also incorrect. Sexual dimorphism refers to the difference in appearance between males and females of the same species, particularly in size, coloration, or morphology. Both Homo sapiens and Australopithecus afarensis exhibit some degree of sexual dimorphism, although it is more pronounced in A. afarensis than in modern humans."
