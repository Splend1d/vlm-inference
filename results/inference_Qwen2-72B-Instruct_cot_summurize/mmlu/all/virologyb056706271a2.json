This process occurs before the onset of symptoms, and it is during this time that the host's immune system is typically mounting a response to fight off the infection. Option A is incorrect because the immune system does not clear the virus during the incubation period; rather, it is actively responding to the presence of the virus. Option D is incorrect as the incubation period generally lasts longer than a few hours."
