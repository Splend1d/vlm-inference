This could happen if output (the total amount of goods and services produced) has increased faster than the population has grown. If output has increased but the population has stayed the same or grown at a slower rate, then there would be more goods and services available per person, leading to an increase in the standard of living.\n\nOption A is not necessarily true because an increase in output alone does not guarantee an increase in the standard of living if the population has also increased significantly.\n\nOption B is incorrect because an increase in population does not automatically lead to an increase in the standard of living.\n\nOption C is incorrect because it is not necessary for both output and population to have increased; an increase in output relative to population is sufficient for an increase in the standard of living."
