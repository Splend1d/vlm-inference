The King of China is a Tartar, and one of the descendants of [Ghenghis] Khan\u2026In all the Chinese provinces, there is a town for the [Muslims], and in this they reside. They also have cells, colleges, and mosques, and are made much of by the Kings of China\u2026\nWhen we approached this city [of Hangzhou] we were met by its judge, the [elders] of Islamism, and the great merchants. The [Muslims] are exceedingly numerous here. This whole city is surrounded by a wall: each of the six [districts of Hangzhou] is also surrounded by a wall. In the first reside the guards, with their commander. I was told that, in the muster-rolls, these amount to twelve thousand\u2026In the second division are the Jews, Christians, and the Turks who worship the sun: these are numerous, their number is not known: and theirs is the most beautiful city. Their streets are well disposed, and their great men are exceedingly wealthy. There are in the city a great number of [Muslims], with some of whom I resided for fifteen days; and was treated most [honorably]\u2026\"\nIbn Battuta, Voyages, 1332\u20131346 C.E.\nThe observations expressed in the excerpt are best seen as evidence for which of the following in Yuan China?\n\nA.

Ibn Battuta's account describes the presence of Muslims, Jews, Christians, and others in the city of Hangzhou, along with their places of worship and communities, indicating a level of religious diversity and coexistence. He also mentions that the Muslims are made much of by the Kings of China, suggesting a degree of official tolerance or even preference.\n\nWhile the excerpt does touch on B. Instatement of foreigners as provincial administrators (as evidenced by the reference to the judge and elders of Islamism meeting Ibn Battuta), the primary focus of the passage is on the religious landscape of the city, making option A the more accurate reflection of the main theme. There is no direct evidence in the excerpt to support options C. Mongol assimilation into Chinese culture or D. Military pressures from internal unrest."
