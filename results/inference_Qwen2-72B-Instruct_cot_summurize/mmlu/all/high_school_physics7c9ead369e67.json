                    "text": "To determine the nature and size of the image formed by a bi-convex lens, we can use the lens formula and magnification formula.\n\nThe lens formula is given as:\n\\[ \\frac{1}{v} - \\frac{1}{u} = \\frac{1}{f} \\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\(v\\) is the image distance,\n- \\(u\\) is the object distance,\n- \\(f\\) is the focal length.\n\nFor a bi-convex lens with equal radii of curvature, the focal length (\\(f\\)) is given by:\n\\[ f = \\frac{R}{2} \\]\n\nGiven that the radius of curvature (\\(R\\)) is 20 cm, then:\n\\[ f = \\frac{20}{2} = 10 \\, \\text{cm} \\]\n\nWe are also given that the object distance (\\(u\\)) is 30 cm. Substituting these values into the lens formula:\n\\[ \\frac{1}{v} - \\frac{1}{30} = \\frac{1}{10} \\]\n\nSolving for \\(v\\):\n\\[ \\frac{1}{v} = \\frac{1}{10} + \\frac{1}{30} = \\frac{4}{30} = \\frac{2}{15} \\]\n\nTherefore:\n\\[ v = \\frac{15}{2} = 7.5 \\, \\text{cm} \\]\n\nThis indicates that the image is real (since \\(v\\) is positive) and formed on the same side of the lens where the screen would be placed.\n\nNext, we calculate the magnification (\\(m\\)) using the formula:\n\\[ m = \\frac{v}{u} = \\frac{7.5}{30} = 0.25 \\]\n\nSince the magnification is positive but less than 1, the image will be upright and smaller than the object. The height of the image (\\(h'\\)) can be calculated as:\n\\[ h' = m \\times h = 0.25 \\times 2 = 0.5 \\, \\text{cm} \\]\n\nHowever, none of the options provided matches this result exactly. Given the options, it seems there might have been a slight error in interpreting the question or the provided options. Based on our calculations, the closest answer in terms of the image being real, upright, and its relative size compared to the object would be:\n\nA. Real, inverted, height = 1 cm\n\nHowever, note that our calculation shows the image should actually be upright and have a height of 0.5 cm, which is not listed among the options. The closest match based on the options provided, considering the image is real and upright (though technically it's not inverted as described in option A), is:\n\nC. Real, upright, height = 1 cm\n\nBut strictly speaking, according to our calculations, the correct height would be 0.5 cm, which isn't represented in any of the options."
