This is known as the endosymbiotic theory, which suggests that these organelles were once free-living prokaryotes that entered into a symbiotic relationship with early eukaryotic cells. Over time, they evolved to become integral parts of the cell, carrying out specialized functions such as energy production (ATP synthesis) and photosynthesis."
