RPC is not about calling procedures based on their distance in memory space but rather about calling procedures on a different computer over a network.\n\nB. An RPC can indeed return a value. The whole point of making an RPC is often to get some result back from the remote procedure.\n\nC. RPCs can pass parameters by reference. In fact, they can use various parameter passing mechanisms, including passing values by reference.\n\nD. RPCs can call procedures implemented in a different language as long as both ends agree on a network protocol and data representation format (e.g., using a common wire format like XML or JSON).\n\nTherefore, none of the given options (A, B, C, D) are correct when describing a Remote Procedure Call. A more accurate statement about RPC would be something along the lines of: \"It allows a computer program to cause a subroutine or procedure to execute in another address space (commonly on another computer on a shared network) without the programmer explicitly coding the details for this remote interaction.\""
