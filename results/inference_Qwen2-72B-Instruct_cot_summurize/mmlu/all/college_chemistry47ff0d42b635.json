                    "text": "The correct answer is A. T1, unlike T2, is sensitive to very low-frequency molecular motions.\n\nExplanation: The T1 relaxation time (spin-lattice relaxation) and T2 relaxation time (spin-spin relaxation) are two fundamental parameters in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy that describe the rate at which the excited nuclei return to their equilibrium state after being perturbed by an RF pulse. T1 is associated with the exchange of energy between the nuclear spins and the lattice (the surrounding environment), while T2 is related to the loss of phase coherence among the nuclear spins due to interactions among themselves and with the environment.\n\nT1 is primarily sensitive to molecular motions occurring at frequencies much lower than the Larmor frequency, which is the frequency at which the nuclei resonate in the presence of a static magnetic field. These low-frequency motions can be things like overall tumbling of molecules or slow conformational changes. In contrast, T2 is more sensitive to molecular motions occurring at or near the Larmor frequency, which can cause dephasing of the spin ensemble.\n\nThus, if there are significant low-frequency motions in the system, they will predominantly affect T1, potentially making it longer compared to T2. This occurs because the low-frequency motions can help redistribute the energy from the excited nuclear spins back into the lattice more efficiently, leading to a longer T1. Meanwhile, T2 may be more affected by higher-frequency motions that lead to faster dephasing, resulting in a shorter T2."
