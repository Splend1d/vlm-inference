An ulna nerve palsy is an example of a lower motor neurone lesion\n\nLower motor neuron lesions, such as ulnar nerve palsy, typically result in muscle weakness or paralysis, loss of reflexes, and muscle atrophy over time due to denervation. They do not lead to increased tone (hypertonia) or brisk reflexes, which are features of upper motor neuron lesions. Fasciculations can be seen in lower motor neuron lesions."
