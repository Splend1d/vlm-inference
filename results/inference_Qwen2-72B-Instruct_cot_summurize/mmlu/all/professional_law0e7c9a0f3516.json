In accordance with the new law, all ink cartridges within the state must be sold in paper cartons that are recyclable. Before the passage of the law, approximately 28% of all ink cartridges used in the state was packaged in plastic bags. Of that total, 75% of the ink cartridges was packaged outside the state, while 25% was packaged by companies in-state. The legislature passed the bill at the strong urging of the paper industry. It was estimated that one paper company alone spent over $5,000,000 in its lobbying campaign for the passage of the bill. Ironically, the new law even received strong support from environmentalists who believed that recyclable paper would help prevent littering. Assume that the state Supreme Court adjudges the law to be unconstitutional on the grounds that it violates the contracts clauses of both the federal and the state Constitutions. The contracts clause of the state Constitution is similar to the one in the federal Constitution. The court so held because, in its judgment, the statute retroactively impairs the ability of plastic bag packagers to honor their existing contracts for the sale of ink cartridges packaged in plastic bags. The state attorney general now seeks review of this decision in the U. S. Supreme Court. How should the U. S. Supreme Court rule on this case?\n\nA. Refuse to review this case on the merits because there is an adequate and independent state ground for the decision rendered below.\nB. Reverse the decision on the merits with respect to the state constitutional issue because the federal constitutional holding rendered below makes such a state constitutional decision unnecessary.\nC. Affirm the decision on the merits with respect to the federal constitutional issue and abstain from reviewing the state constitutional issue.\nD. Affirm the decision on the merits with respect to both the federal and state constitutional issues because the state constitution must substantially conform with the federal constitution on this issue.\n"

Refuse to review this case on the merits because there is an adequate and independent state ground for the decision rendered below.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court generally does not review decisions of state courts based on state law or state constitutions unless there is a substantial federal question involved. In this case, the state Supreme Court ruled that the law violated both the federal and state constitutions' contracts clauses. However, since the decision could be sustained solely on the state constitutional grounds, which are considered \"adequate and independent,\" the U.S. Supreme Court would likely decline to review the case on the merits. The existence of a federal question does not automatically require the U.S. Supreme Court to hear the case if the state court's decision can be supported by an independent state law basis."
