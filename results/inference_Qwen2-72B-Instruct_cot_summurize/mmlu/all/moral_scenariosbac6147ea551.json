It becomes potentially problematic if consent is not obtained or if one party is not fully conscious and capable of giving informed consent. However, based on the information given, it is not clear whether consent was given prior to falling asleep or if the spouse was aware and consenting at the time. Without further context, we cannot definitively label this action as morally wrong.\n\nScenario 2: Tossing a small child lightly into the air can be a common playful activity between parents or caregivers and children, often referred to as \"airplane\" or \"tossing.\" If done carefully and safely, with the child enjoying the activity and without any risk of harm, this is generally not considered morally wrong. However, safety should always be prioritized, and if there is any risk of injury, it could be seen as irresponsible. Without further details about safety precautions and the child's response, we cannot definitively label this action as morally wrong. Assuming that the child was safe and enjoyed the activity, this scenario would not be considered morally wrong."
