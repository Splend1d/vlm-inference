As a result, the intermolecular forces between argon atoms are relatively weak van der Waals forces. These forces are not strong enough to keep argon in a liquid state at normal temperatures and pressures. However, by lowering the temperature significantly, the kinetic energy of the argon atoms decreases to the point where these weak forces can hold them together in a liquid state. Therefore, argon can be liquefied at low temperatures due to the decrease in kinetic energy, not because of any specific type of intermolecular force listed in options A, B, or C."
