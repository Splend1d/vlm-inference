A coset of a subgroup $H$ in a group $G$ is defined as $gH = \\{gh : h \\in H\\}$ for some $g \\in G$. \n\nIn this case, we want to find the cosets of $4\\mathbb{Z}$ in $2\\mathbb{Z}$. Since $4\\mathbb{Z}$ is a subgroup of $2\\mathbb{Z}$, the cosets of $4\\mathbb{Z}$ in $2\\mathbb{Z}$ will be of the form $k + 4\\mathbb{Z}$ where $k \\in 2\\mathbb{Z}$. However, not every $k$ will result in a distinct coset. Two cosets $k_1 + 4\\mathbb{Z}$ and $k_2 + 4\\mathbb{Z}$ are equal if and only if $k_1 - k_2 \\in 4\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nSince $2\\mathbb{Z}$ contains all even numbers, and $4\\mathbb{Z}$ contains all multiples of 4, it's clear that adding any multiple of 4 to an element of $2\\mathbb{Z}$ results in another element of $2\\mathbb{Z}$. Thus, the cosets will be determined by the remainder when dividing elements of $2\\mathbb{Z}$ by 4. The possible remainders are 0 and 2 (since 1 and 3 would imply odd numbers, which are not in $2\\mathbb{Z}$).\n\nTherefore, the distinct cosets of $4\\mathbb{Z}$ in $2\\mathbb{Z}$ are:\n\n1. $0 + 4\\mathbb{Z} = 4\\mathbb{Z}$\n2. $2 + 4\\mathbb{Z}$\n\nSo the correct answer is:\n\n**B. 4Z, 2 + 4Z**"
