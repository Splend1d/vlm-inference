While type 14 is also an HPV type, it is not as commonly associated with cervical cancer as the others listed. Therefore, the most accurate answer from the options given would be B, which lists types 16, 18, 31, and 45. However, the actual list of high-risk HPV types includes more than just these four, such as types 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, and 68."
