Operant conditioning involves learning through the consequences of behavior. Paradoxically, sometimes punishment can increase the frequency of a behavior (paradoxical punishment) or reinforcement can decrease it (paradoxical reinforcement). These phenomena have been studied extensively in the context of conditioning and have helped psychologists understand more complex behaviors and motivations."
