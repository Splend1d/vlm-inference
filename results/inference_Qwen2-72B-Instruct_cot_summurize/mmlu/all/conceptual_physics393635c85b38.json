Different colors of light bend by different amounts because they travel at slightly different speeds in the prism material. This dispersion effect results in a rainbow-like spectrum.\n\nThe amount of bending (or refraction) is inversely related to the speed of light for that color in the prism material. The colors that travel slower (and thus bend more) are on the shorter wavelength end of the visible spectrum. Blue light has a shorter wavelength and travels slower in the prism material compared to green light, causing it to bend more.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. blue"
