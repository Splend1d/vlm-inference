Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn both scenarios, the main character is not doing anything that would be considered clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. In Scenario 1, hiding a blanket from someone who is cold might seem counterintuitive to helping, but without additional context, it's not clear if there is a valid reason for this action (e.g., perhaps the man had a medical condition where being covered could be harmful). In Scenario 2, prioritizing one's children's needs over others' when resources are scarce is generally considered a morally acceptable action, as parents have a primary duty to care for their children. However, it's important to note that in both cases, additional context could change the moral assessment of the actions."
