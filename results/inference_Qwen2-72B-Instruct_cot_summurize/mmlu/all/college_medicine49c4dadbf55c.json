These enzymes catalyze metabolic reactions and their activities are controlled by the genetic material (DNA) of an organism. The other options do not directly determine metabolism, although they may influence it indirectly. For example, the availability of amino acids can affect protein synthesis, but it does not determine the overall metabolic rate or pathways."
