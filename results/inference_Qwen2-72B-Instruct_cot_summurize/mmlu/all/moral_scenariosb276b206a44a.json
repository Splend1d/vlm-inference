The money does not belong to you, and keeping it without attempting to find the owner or turning it over to authorities is generally viewed as morally wrong.\n\nScenario 2: Encouraging the bully's fights is also morally wrong because it involves promoting harm or violence against others, which goes against principles of kindness, empathy, and respect for others' well-being."
