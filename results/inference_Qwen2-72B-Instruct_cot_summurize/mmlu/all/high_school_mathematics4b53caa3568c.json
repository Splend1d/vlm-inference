If we want a perfect square with exactly 3 different prime factors, we can take the three smallest primes and raise each to the second power (since we're looking for the least such number). The three smallest primes are 2, 3, and 5. Thus, the least perfect square with 3 different prime factors would be:\n\n\\[2^2 \\times 3^2 \\times 5^2 = 4 \\times 9 \\times 25 = 36 \\times 25 = 900\\]\n\nSo, the answer is C. 900."
