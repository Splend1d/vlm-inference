The gravitational force (weight) of the person is directed downward, but due to the rotation, the wall exerts a normal force perpendicular to the wall, which has a component that counters gravity.\n\nThe frictional force \\(F_f\\) must equal or exceed the weight \\(W\\) of the person for them not to slide down:\n\n\\[F_f = \\mu N \\geq W\\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\(F_f\\) is the frictional force,\n- \\(\\mu\\) is the coefficient of friction,\n- \\(N\\) is the normal force, and\n- \\(W\\) is the weight of the person.\n\nThe normal force \\(N\\) is also responsible for providing the centripetal force required for circular motion:\n\n\\[N = m\\frac{v^2}{R}\\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\(m\\) is the mass of the person,\n- \\(v\\) is the tangential speed, and\n- \\(R\\) is the radius of the ride.\n\nSubstituting the expression for \\(N\\) into the friction equation gives:\n\n\\[\\mu m\\frac{v^2}{R} \\geq mg\\]\n\nwhere \\(g\\) is the acceleration due to gravity.\n\nSolving for \\(m\\) gives:\n\n\\[m \\leq \\frac{\\mu R g}{v^2}\\]\n\nTherefore, the greatest mass that a person can have to safely go on this ride is:\n\n\\[m_{max} = \\frac{\\mu R g}{v^2}\\]\n\nSo, the correct answer is **C. rg/(\u03bcv^2)**."
