It is actually a helpful act. Without permission, it could be seen as an invasion of privacy, but since there is no indication that permission was not granted, this scenario is not wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, laughing at the antics of happy monkeys behind bars might be considered insensitive by some, especially if the situation raises concerns about animal welfare. However, it is not generally viewed as morally wrong to enjoy watching animals play or behave in amusing ways, assuming the animals are being treated well and are not being harmed for entertainment. Therefore, this scenario is also not wrong according to ordinary moral standards."
