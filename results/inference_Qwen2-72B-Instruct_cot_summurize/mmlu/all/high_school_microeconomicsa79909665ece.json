In the long run, firms earn zero economic profit as new entrants erode any positive profit margins. However, they still produce at an output level where the price is above the minimum average total cost (ATC). This means that resources are not allocated as efficiently as they could be, leading to productive inefficiency. Firms do not minimize their costs or operate at their most efficient scale, as would occur under perfect competition at the minimum ATC point."
