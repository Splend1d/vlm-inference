He decided to break into the employee's house one night, when he knew that the employee and her family would be away, to try to find and retrieve the equipment. The man had brought a picklock to open the employee's back door, but when he tried the door, he found that it was unlocked, so he entered. As the man was looking around the house, he heard sounds outside and became afraid. He left the house but was arrested by police on neighborhood patrol. What is the man's strongest defense to a burglary charge?\n\nA. The back door to the house was unlocked.\nB. The burglary was abandoned.\nC. The house was not occupied at the time of his entry.\nD. The man did not intend to commit a crime inside the house.\n"

This is because he voluntarily left the house before committing any theft or other crime, due to fear of being caught. However, it's important to note that simply abandoning the attempt does not necessarily absolve him of criminal liability for the initial act of breaking and entering, even if the door was unlocked. The fact that he intended to commit a crime (stealing computer equipment) when he entered the house could still lead to charges related to attempted burglary or unlawful entry."
