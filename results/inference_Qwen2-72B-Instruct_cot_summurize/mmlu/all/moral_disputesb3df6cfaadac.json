Therefore, the correct answer would be:\n\nB. does not need to be intentionally inflicted.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that different philosophers might have different views on this matter, and the specific interpretation can depend on the context in which the question is being asked. In the case of Fiona McGregor, I couldn't find a direct reference to her stance on whether the expressive harm of rape needs to be intentionally inflicted or not. The answer provided is based on Langton's interpretation of Haslanger's work. If you're referring to a specific text or philosopher, please provide more details so I can give a more accurate response."
