Uninvited in-person solicitations can be considered unethical if they take advantage of an individual's vulnerability or create a situation where the person feels pressured or unduly influenced to seek therapy. This is particularly concerning when the individuals being solicited are in a state of distress or are otherwise susceptible to manipulation."
