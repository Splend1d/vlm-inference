                    "text": "To determine which pair of reactants will not produce a net ionic equation (meaning all ions remain in solution and no solid precipitate forms, no gas evolves, and no molecular compound is formed), we need to consider the solubility rules for ionic compounds and whether any of the products can form a weak electrolyte or a nonelectrolyte.\n\nLet's examine each option:\n\nA. \\(Na_2SO_3 + FeCl_2\\)\n\n- \\(Na_2SO_3\\) is soluble.\n- \\(FeCl_2\\) is soluble.\n- Possible products: \\(FeSO_3\\) and \\(NaCl\\).\n- \\(NaCl\\) is soluble.\n- \\(FeSO_3\\) is generally considered soluble, but let's check the solubility rules more carefully. Sulfates are usually soluble except for those of lead(II), barium, and calcium. Iron(II) sulfate is soluble.\n  \nSo, no precipitate forms, but this doesn't necessarily mean that there is no net ionic reaction because we have to consider if an acid-base reaction or a complex formation could occur. However, based on the information given, this pair does not obviously form a precipitate or a gas.\n\nB. \\(CaCl_2 + MnSO_4\\)\n\n- \\(CaCl_2\\) is soluble.\n- \\(MnSO_4\\) is soluble.\n- Possible products: \\(CaSO_4\\) and \\(MnCl_2\\).\n- \\(MnCl_2\\) is soluble.\n- \\(CaSO_4\\) is slightly soluble but can be considered as forming a precipitate according to solubility rules (sulfates of calcium are not very soluble).\n\nThus, this pair would form a net ionic equation due to the formation of a precipitate (\\(CaSO_4\\)).\n\nC. \\(NH_4I + Pb(NO_3)_2\\)\n\n- \\(NH_4I\\) is soluble.\n- \\(Pb(NO_3)_2\\) is soluble.\n- Possible products: \\(PbI_2\\) and \\(NH_4NO_3\\).\n- \\(NH_4NO_3\\) is soluble.\n- \\(PbI_2\\) is insoluble (iodides of lead are not soluble).\n\nThis pair would also form a net ionic equation due to the formation of a precipitate (\\(PbI_2\\)).\n\nD. \\(KOH + HClO_4\\)\n\n- \\(KOH\\) is soluble.\n- \\(HClO_4\\) is soluble.\n- Possible products: \\(KClO_4\\) and \\(H_2O\\).\n- \\(KClO_4\\) is soluble.\n- \\(H_2O\\) is not an ion and is a product of an acid-base reaction.\n\nThis pair would not form a net ionic equation in the traditional sense because it results in water formation and potassium perchlorate remaining in solution. However, since the question is asking for the pair with no net ionic equation (implying no observable change in the ionic composition of the solution), this is a bit tricky. The reaction here is essentially complete because water is formed, and all the ions are accounted for in the products.\n\nGiven the context of the question and focusing on the formation of a precipitate or gas, options A and D do not form precipitates or gases. However, option D clearly undergoes a complete reaction resulting in the formation of water, which is not an ion. Therefore, **the most fitting answer to the question as phrased, considering the formation of a precipitate or gas, is A. \\(Na_2SO_3 + FeCl_2\\)**, because it does not form a precipitate, gas, or a significant amount of a non-ionized molecule under normal conditions."
