                    "text": "C. The availability of water and warm temperatures in the tropics fosters photosynthesis.\n\nThis is the best explanation because photosynthesis, the process by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy, is highly dependent on temperature and water availability. In tropical regions, there is generally more consistent sunlight, warmer temperatures, and adequate rainfall, all of which contribute to higher rates of photosynthesis and thus higher net primary productivity (NPP). While species diversity (option A) can influence ecosystem productivity, it is not the primary factor driving the increase in NPP toward the tropics. Lower metabolic costs (option B) might play a minor role but are not as significant as the direct effects of climate on photosynthesis. The presence of predators (option D) does not directly affect plant productivity but rather influences the structure of ecological communities."
