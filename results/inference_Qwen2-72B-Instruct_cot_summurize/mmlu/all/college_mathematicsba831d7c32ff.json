                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to first identify which pairs of numbers (out of the integers from 1 to 10) have one number being the square of the other. These pairs are:\n\n- \\(1^2 = 1\\), but since both numbers in the pair would be the same, we don't consider this for the \"neither\" condition.\n- \\(2^2 = 4\\)\n- \\(3^2 = 9\\)\n\nThere are no other squares between 1 and 10 where the root and its square are both within this range.\n\nSo, there are three pairs where one number is the square of the other: (2, 4), (4, 2), (3, 9), and (9, 3). This gives us a total of 4 such pairs.\n\nSince Sofia and Tess are choosing independently, there are a total of \\(10 \\times 10 = 100\\) possible combinations of numbers they can choose.\n\nThe number of combinations where neither number is the square of the other is the total number of combinations minus the number of combinations where one number is the square of the other. Since there are 4 such pairs, there are \\(100 - 4 = 96\\) combinations where neither number is the square of the other.\n\nTherefore, the probability that neither number chosen will be the square of the other is \\(96/100 = 0.96\\).\n\nHowever, none of the options match this answer exactly, which suggests a slight oversight in interpreting the question or the given options. Given the options provided, it seems the closest match to our calculation would be D. 0.95, but based on our calculations, the exact probability should be 0.96. There might have been a typo or rounding issue in the question or the options provided. Nonetheless, based on the closest match to our calculation, the correct choice would be:\n\nD. 0.95\n\nBut remember, the precise calculation leads to 0.96, not listed as an option."
