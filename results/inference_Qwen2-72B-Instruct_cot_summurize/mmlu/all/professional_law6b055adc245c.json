Any violation or noncompliance with said statute shall be punished by imprisonment for not less than three years nor more than seven years. \"The defendant was involved in an accident that involved injuries to the other driver. The defendant, however, knowing his license to be revoked and afraid of being arrested, fled the scene. However, the victim was able to write down the license number of the defendant's vehicle, and the defendant was rapidly apprehended and put in jail. The defendant is charged with violating the aforementioned statute. He files a motion to dismiss on the grounds that the disclosure requirement of the statute violates his privilege against self-incrimination. His motion should be\n\nA. granted, because the statute makes no provision for Miranda warnings concerning his right to remain silent.\nB. granted, because the statute requires him to provide incriminating information that can be used againsthim in a criminal prosecution.\nC. denied, because the legislative intent in enacting the statute was designed to require disclosure of information to be used primarily in civil litigation.\nD. denied, because in accordance with public policy considerations, the required disclosures are insufficiently testimonial.\n"

The privilege against self-incrimination applies only to \"testimonial\" evidence \u2014 evidence that results from the compelled communication of the accused's thoughts or statements. The act of furnishing one's name, address, and driver's license does not involve any communication of the contents of the mind, and therefore does not implicate the privilege against self-incrimination. Additionally, the public policy behind the statute is to ensure that drivers involved in accidents take responsibility for their actions and provide necessary aid to the injured, which outweighs any potential self-incrimination concerns."
