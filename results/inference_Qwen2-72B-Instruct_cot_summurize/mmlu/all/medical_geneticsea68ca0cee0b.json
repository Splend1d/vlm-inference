It is a genetic condition that affects males, typically caused by an extra copy of the X chromosome (XXY instead of XY). Chromosome instability syndromes are a group of disorders characterized by increased chromosomal breakage and rearrangement, leading to various symptoms including cancer predisposition, developmental delays, and physical abnormalities. Ataxia telangiectasia, Fanconi anaemia, and Bloom syndrome are all examples of chromosome instability syndromes."
