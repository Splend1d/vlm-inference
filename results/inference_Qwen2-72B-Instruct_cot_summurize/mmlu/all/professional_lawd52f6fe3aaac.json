It may be proved to impeach him as a witness\n\nThe witness's mental condition could potentially affect his reliability as a witness and thus can be used to challenge his credibility. However, this does not automatically disqualify him from testifying. The decision to allow the testimony will depend on the judge's assessment of whether the witness's condition impacts his ability to perceive, recall, and communicate accurately. The opposing party may use the mental illness to impeach the witness, meaning they can attempt to show that the witness's testimony is not trustworthy due to his condition."
