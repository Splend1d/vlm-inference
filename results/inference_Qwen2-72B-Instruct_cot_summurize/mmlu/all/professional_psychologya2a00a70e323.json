This ensures that his clients have access to professional help if needed while he is away, maintaining continuity of care and ethical responsibility.\n\nHowever, it's also important that he discusses his vacation plans with his current clients ahead of time (as mentioned in option A) so that they are aware of his unavailability and can plan their sessions or seek alternative arrangements accordingly. Combining elements of both A and C would be ideal: informing clients about the upcoming absence and providing them with emergency contact information for another qualified professional."
