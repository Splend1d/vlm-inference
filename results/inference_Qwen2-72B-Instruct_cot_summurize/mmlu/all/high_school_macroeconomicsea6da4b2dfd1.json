                    "text": "In this situation, the policy direction would be considered expansionary because increasing government spending has a positive effect on aggregate demand, even if taxes are also increased. The expenditure multiplier is calculated as \\( \\frac{1}{1-MPC} \\), which in this case is \\( \\frac{1}{1-0.75} = 4 \\). This means that each dollar of additional government spending will lead to an increase in total economic output of $4.\n\nHowever, the tax multiplier is negative because higher taxes reduce disposable income and, thus, consumption. It is calculated as \\( -MPC \\times \\frac{1}{1-MPC} \\), which in this case is \\( -0.75 \\times \\frac{1}{1-0.75} = -3 \\). This means that each dollar of increased taxes will reduce total economic output by $3.\n\nSo, given these multipliers and the fact that government spending is increasing, the overall effect could be seen as expansionary, especially if the positive impact of increased government spending outweighs the negative impact of higher taxes. However, it's important to note that the net effect on aggregate demand depends on the specific amounts of spending and taxation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. expansionary   4   -3"
