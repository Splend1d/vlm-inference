The spectrum of a star is like a unique fingerprint that reveals the chemical composition of the star's atmosphere. When light from a star passes through a prism or a diffraction grating, it is separated into its component wavelengths (colors), forming a spectrum. By examining this spectrum, scientists can see dark lines at specific wavelengths where certain elements have absorbed light. These absorption lines correspond to the energy levels of electrons in atoms, allowing scientists to determine which elements are present in the star's atmosphere."
