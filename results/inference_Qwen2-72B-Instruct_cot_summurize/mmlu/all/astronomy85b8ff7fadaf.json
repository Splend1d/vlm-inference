They appear darker than the surrounding highlands because the basaltic rock has a lower albedo, or reflectivity, than the lighter anorthosite that makes up much of the lunar crust. The maria are primarily found on the near side of the Moon and include well-known features such as Mare Tranquillitatis, where Apollo 11 landed, and Oceanus Procellarum, the largest lunar mare."
