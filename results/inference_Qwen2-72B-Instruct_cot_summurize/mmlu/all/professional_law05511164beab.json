The mother objected on religious grounds. She claimed that it would be better for her son to die if that was his fate. The pediatrician sought an order from the state court. The mother was present with her lawyer at the court. In deciding whether it may issue such an order in face of all relevant constitutional defenses by the mother, which of the following must the state court consider?\n\nA. Whether medical treatment is necessary to save the baby's life.\nB. Whether the mother's refusal to authorize medical treatment is justified on the basis of current knowledge.\nC. Whether the hospital is owned and operated by the state.\nD. Whether the mother is a taxpayer of the state in which the court is located.\n"

Whether medical treatment is necessary to save the baby's life.\n\nThis is because the state has a compelling interest in protecting the life and health of a child, even when doing so conflicts with the religious beliefs of the parents. If medical treatment is necessary to save the baby's life, the court may rule that the treatment should be administered despite the mother's objections based on her religious beliefs. This is known as the \"best interests of the child\" standard, which takes precedence over parental rights when a child's health or life is at risk.\n\nThe other options (B, C, and D) are not directly relevant to the court's decision in this case. The court is not concerned with the mother's justification for her refusal based on current knowledge (B), whether the hospital is owned and operated by the state (C), or whether the mother is a taxpayer of the state (D). These factors do not bear on the central question of whether the state can intervene to protect the child's welfare."
