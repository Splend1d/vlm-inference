During the course of their marriage, the beatings became more violent and more frequent. Unable to endure the physical abuse any longer, the wife hired a hit man to kill her husband. One night while the husband was asleep, the hit man entered the home with a key given to him by the wife and shot the husband to death. Afterward, the wife was prosecuted for murder as an accomplice. At trial, the prosecution presented the facts outlined above. Thereafter, the defense sought to have the judge instruct the jury that the wife acted in self- defense under the battered women's syndrome. Based on the given facts, should the judge give such an instruction to the jury?\n\nA. No, because the wife's belief in the necessity of deadly force in self-defense was unreasonable.\nB. No, because even though the wife was the victim of spousal abuse, she could have avoided the danger by safely retreating.\nC. Yes, because, on these facts, a reasonable jury could conclude that the wife acted in self- defense by using necessary force to protect herself from the husband's constant violent attacks.\nD. Yes, because a criminal defendant's Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial prohibits a court from refusing to submit affirmative defenses to the jury.\n"

Yes, because, on these facts, a reasonable jury could conclude that the wife acted in self-defense by using necessary force to protect herself from the husband's constant violent attacks.\n\nThe battered woman syndrome is a set of psychological characteristics found in some victims of domestic violence who have been abused over a prolonged period. It can be argued that due to the severity and frequency of the abuse, the wife may have felt there was no other way to escape the immediate threat to her life and safety. However, it's important to note that the use of lethal force must still be evaluated within the context of the law regarding self-defense, which generally requires that the force used be proportional to the threat faced and that there be no safe avenue of retreat. The specific laws regarding self-defense and the admissibility of the battered woman syndrome as a defense will vary by jurisdiction."
