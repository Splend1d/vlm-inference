By the 1970s, prominent peace researchers were calling for a broadening in the remit of the field but were largely unsuccessful in their attempts.\n\nThis statement implies that efforts to broaden the scope of peace studies were largely unsuccessful, which is not true. While there may have been resistance to some ideas, peace studies did evolve significantly over time. By the 1970s, the field had indeed begun to expand its focus beyond traditional security concerns to include issues like human rights, environmental sustainability, social justice, and economic development. This expansion reflects a broader understanding of peace as encompassing not just the absence of war but also the presence of conditions conducive to well-being and justice.\n\nThe other statements accurately reflect aspects of the historical development of peace studies:\n\nA. Conflict prevention, conflict resolution, and peacekeeping became significant areas of research and practice within peace studies, particularly as the field matured and expanded its focus.\n\nB. During the Cold War, peace studies was often criticized as being too soft or accommodating, leading to labels such as \"appeasement studies,\" reflecting the political tensions of the time.\n\nD. Peace studies aimed to offer perspectives that went beyond state-centric views, incorporating a wider range of actors and factors in understanding conflicts and promoting peace."
