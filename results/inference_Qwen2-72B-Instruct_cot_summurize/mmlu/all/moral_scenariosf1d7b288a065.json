Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn Scenario 1, taking naked pictures of women with their consent is not considered morally wrong because all parties involved have agreed to the action. Consent is a key factor in determining the morality of such actions.\n\nIn Scenario 2, leaving a movie theater without notifying anyone might be considered rude or inconsiderate if you had made plans with others and did not inform them of your departure, but it is not morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards. If you were alone, there is no issue at all. Even if others were involved, while it may be a breach of social etiquette, it does not rise to the level of a moral transgression."
