Since we're looking at abelian groups of order 16, we can analyze this problem using the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups.\n\nA group of order 16 can be expressed as a direct product of cyclic groups of prime power order. Since 16 = \\(2^4\\), we consider the possible decompositions into products of cyclic groups:\n\n1. \\(C_{16}\\) (cyclic group of order 16)\n2. \\(C_8 \\times C_2\\)\n3. \\(C_4 \\times C_4\\)\n4. \\(C_4 \\times C_2 \\times C_2\\)\n5. \\(C_2 \\times C_2 \\times C_2 \\times C_2\\)\n\nHowever, not all of these satisfy the given condition. Let's examine which ones do:\n\n- In \\(C_{16}\\), not every element satisfies the given condition since there are elements of order 16.\n- In \\(C_8 \\times C_2\\), not every element satisfies the given condition since there are elements of order 8.\n- In \\(C_4 \\times C_4\\), every element satisfies the given condition since the maximum order of any element is 4.\n- In \\(C_4 \\times C_2 \\times C_2\\), every element satisfies the given condition since the maximum order of any element is 4.\n- In \\(C_2 \\times C_2 \\times C_2 \\times C_2\\), every element satisfies the given condition since the maximum order of any element is 2.\n\nThus, up to isomorphism, there are 3 additive abelian groups of order 16 where \\(x + x + x + x = 0\\) for all \\(x \\in G\\).\n\nThe correct answer is **D. 3**."
