                    "text": "To determine the reducibility of a polynomial over a given field, we need to check if it can be factored into polynomials of lower degree with coefficients in that field.\n\nLet's analyze each statement:\n\n**Statement 1: 4x - 2 is irreducible over \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\).**\n\nFor a polynomial to be reducible over \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\), it must be possible to factor it into two non-constant polynomials with integer coefficients. However, \\(4x - 2\\) cannot be factored into two non-constant polynomials with integer coefficients because its only factors would be of the form \\(a(4x - 2)\\) where \\(a\\) is an integer, which does not count as a non-trivial factorization. Hence, \\(4x - 2\\) is irreducible over \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\).\n\n**Statement 2: 4x - 2 is irreducible over \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\).**\n\nA polynomial is reducible over \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) if it can be factored into two non-constant polynomials with rational coefficients. The polynomial \\(4x - 2\\) can be factored as \\(2(2x - 1)\\) over \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\), but this doesn't mean it's reducible in the context of being split into polynomials of lower degree since both factors are not considered non-constant (one is a constant factor). However, the standard definition for reducibility in this context requires that the polynomial be expressed as a product of polynomials of positive degree. Since \\(4x - 2 = 2(2x - 1)\\) and \\(2x - 1\\) is of positive degree and has rational coefficients, we could argue that \\(4x - 2\\) is reducible over \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) under this interpretation, but typically, when discussing irreducibility, we exclude the extraction of constant factors. Therefore, considering the typical definition for irreducibility, \\(4x - 2\\) is considered irreducible over \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) because it cannot be factored into polynomials of positive degree with rational coefficients other than itself and constants.\n\nGiven these analyses:\n\n**Answer:** C. True, False\n\nHowever, this answer assumes a strict interpretation of \"irreducible\" that excludes the extraction of constant factors, which is commonly used in discussions about polynomial irreducibility. If one were to include the extraction of constant factors in the definition of reducibility, then the second statement would be considered true, leading to a different answer. In mathematical contexts, definitions can sometimes vary slightly, so it's important to clarify such details. Given the common understanding of irreducibility, though, the answer would be C. True, False."
