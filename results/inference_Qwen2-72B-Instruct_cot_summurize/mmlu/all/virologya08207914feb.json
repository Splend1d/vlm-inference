Astroviruses have been known to infect a wide range of animals, including humans, for many years, but their significance as human pathogens was not fully appreciated until recently due to the limitations of traditional diagnostic methods. However, with the advent of deep sequencing technology, which allows for the identification of viral genomes directly from clinical samples, astroviruses have been recognized as a significant cause of gastroenteritis in humans, particularly in young children and immunocompromised individuals."
