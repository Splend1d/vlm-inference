It is produced by fat cells and signals the brain when energy stores are sufficient, thus decreasing hunger.\n\nGhrelin, on the other hand, is a hormone that acts on the hypothalamus to increase hunger. It is primarily produced in the stomach and signals the brain when the stomach is empty, stimulating appetite and food intake."
