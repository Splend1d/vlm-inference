The children should not be included in the study.\n\nRespecting the autonomy and wishes of the participants, even if they are children, is a fundamental ethical principle in research. Even though parental consent has been obtained, it is essential to also consider the assent or dissent of the children themselves. If they do not wish to participate, their decision must be respected, and they should not be included in the study. This approach aligns with ethical guidelines for research involving human subjects, particularly minors, which emphasize the importance of ensuring that participation is voluntary and that individuals are not coerced into taking part in research activities."
