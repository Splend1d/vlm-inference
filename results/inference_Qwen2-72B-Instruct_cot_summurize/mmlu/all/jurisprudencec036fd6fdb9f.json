When no-one would prefer another's bundle of resources to his or her own.\n\nDworkin suggests that equality of resources should be measured by ensuring that each person has an equal claim to a set of resources that they value equally. This means that if everyone is equally satisfied with their own bundle of resources and would not prefer someone else's bundle over their own, then the ideal of equality of welfare has been achieved. This approach aims to correct for choices that individuals make which affect their welfare, while still respecting their autonomy and the importance of personal responsibility."
