We of the Progressive party here dedicate ourselves to the fulfillment of the duty laid upon us by our fathers to maintain the government of the people, by the people and for the people whose foundations they laid. We hold with Thomas Jefferson and Abraham Lincoln that the people are the masters of their Constitution, to fulfill its purposes and to safeguard it from those who, by perversion of its intent, would convert it into an instrument of injustice. In accordance with the needs of each generation the people must use their sovereign powers to establish and maintain equal opportunity and industrial justice, to secure which this Government was founded and without which no republic can endure.\n\"This country belongs to the people who inhabit it. Its resources, its business, its institutions and its laws should be utilized, maintained or altered in whatever manner will best promote the general interest. It is time to set the public welfare in the first place.\"\nProgressive Party Platform, 1912\nOf the following policies, which was NOT a main objective of American Progressives?\n\nA. Passage of the Pure Food and Water Act\nB. Creation of national forests and protected wildlife reserves\nC. Initiation of antitrust lawsuits against various corporate monopolies\nD. Intervention in the affairs of Central American governments\n"

Intervention in the affairs of Central American governments\n\nProgressivism was primarily focused on domestic issues such as social, economic, and political reforms aimed at addressing problems caused by industrialization, urbanization, immigration, and political corruption. The other three options (A, B, and C) were indeed part of the Progressive agenda, focusing on consumer protection, conservation, and breaking up monopolies to promote fair competition. Intervention in foreign affairs, particularly in Central America, was more closely associated with the foreign policy of President Theodore Roosevelt and his \"Big Stick\" diplomacy rather than the core objectives of the Progressive movement."
