This is known as the \"required records\" exception. While a person cannot be compelled to testify against themselves, they can be required to produce documents that are incriminating. This is particularly true for business and tax records, which are often subject to regulatory requirements for maintenance and production. However, it should be noted that if the act of producing the records itself would be testimonial (e.g., acknowledging ownership or control of the records), then the Fifth Amendment could potentially apply to that act. In practice, courts have developed mechanisms like immunity grants to compel production while still respecting constitutional rights."
