The robberies were carried out by a single individual who entered the banks wearing a ski mask and carrying a machine gun. The police received information from a reliable informant that the defendant was the person responsible for the robberies. Acting on this tip, the police secured a valid arrest warrant and went to the defendant's home to apprehend him. When the officers rang the doorbell, the defendant opened the door and was placed under arrest. The defendant, who was wearing only underwear, asked the officers if he could put on a shirt and pants. One of the police officers asked the defendant if anyone else was present in the house. The defendant indicated that he was alone. The officer then accompanied the defendant to his bedroom to change his clothes. When the defendant asked permission to enter the closet for his pants, the officer told him that he needed to inspect the closet first. While the officer was inside the closet, he saw a ski mask that he recognized as part of the apparel worn by the bank robber. The officer confiscated the ski mask and then allowed the defendant inside the closet to change his clothes. While the officer and the defendant were in the bedroom, the officer's partner decided to conduct a protective sweep of the other rooms of the dwelling to see if any accomplices were present. Upon entering a back storage room, the other officer saw a box containing a large amount of $100 bills. The officer confiscated the money, which was later determined to be part of the money stolen during one of the bank robberies. The defendant is subsequently prosecuted for bank robbery. The prosecution seeks to introduce the ski mask and the money found in his home into evidence. A motion by the defendant's attorney to exclude the items will be\n\nA. granted with respect to the ski mask, but denied with respect to the money.\nB. granted with respect to the money, but denied with respect to the ski mask.\nC. granted with respect to both the ski mask and the money.\nD. denied with respect to both the ski mask and the money.\n"

                    "text": "The legality of the evidence seized hinges on whether the police actions were constitutional under the Fourth Amendment, which protects against unreasonable searches and seizures. Here's how it breaks down:\n\n1. **Ski Mask:** The police officer entered the closet to ensure there were no dangers present (a reasonable safety check given the context). During this safety check, the officer saw the ski mask. This falls under the plain view doctrine, which allows evidence to be seized without a warrant if the officer is lawfully present and the incriminating nature of the item is immediately apparent. Therefore, the seizure of the ski mask would likely be considered lawful.\n\n2. **Money:** The second officer conducted a protective sweep of the premises, which is permitted when officers have a reasonable suspicion that the area to be swept harbors an individual posing a danger to those already on the scene. However, the scope of such a sweep is limited to areas where a person might be hiding. A back storage room does not typically fit this description unless there was specific reason to believe someone could be hiding there. Without such a reason, the search may be deemed unlawful. Additionally, even if the protective sweep was justified, the officer's decision to seize the money goes beyond what is necessary for ensuring safety. The seizure of the money may thus be considered unconstitutional.\n\nGiven these considerations, the court is most likely to:\n\n**B. Grant the motion with respect to the money, but deny it with respect to the ski mask.**\n\nThis answer acknowledges that the ski mask was likely seized lawfully due to the officer being in the closet for a legitimate safety reason and spotting the mask in plain view. Conversely, the money was seized during an arguably overreaching protective sweep and subsequent search that exceeded the bounds of ensuring officer safety, potentially violating the defendant's Fourth Amendment rights."
