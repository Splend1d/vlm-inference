The parties met and signed a \"Letter Agreement\", which set forth the price, down payment amount, financing terms, the assets to be included, and a host of other pertinent details. The final closing date was not stated, but the purchasers left a down payment of $20,000 with the seller. The letter stated that the terms comprised their essential agreement, but that a formal document would be drafted by the parties' attorneys. Before that happened, the seller returned the check and refused to perform. The investor brought an equity action for specific performance to compel the sale. The equity court ruled that there was a complete and binding contract that must be specifically performed. Will the appellate court likely affirm the lower court's decision?\n\nA. No, because closing date was left out and the attorneys were supposed to compose the final contract with all of the remaining details put in.\nB. No, because this type of letter is basically a \"gentlemen's agreement\" that is not intended to be legally binding.\nC. Yes, because a letter of intent is legally binding if it sets forth the price, describes the business and is signed by both parties.\nD. Yes, because where the letter contains all of the essential terms required for a contract, it will be enforced as a contract.\n"

Yes, because where the letter contains all of the essential terms required for a contract, it will be enforced as a contract.\n\nExplanation: In this scenario, the Letter Agreement contained essential terms such as price, down payment, financing terms, and assets to be included. Although a formal document was to be drafted by the parties' attorneys, the Letter Agreement itself can be considered a binding contract if it includes all the necessary elements for a contract to exist. The fact that a closing date was not specified may not necessarily render the agreement incomplete or unenforceable, as long as the other terms are clear and the intention to enter into a binding agreement is evident. Therefore, the appellate court is likely to affirm the lower court's decision if it finds that the Letter Agreement meets the requirements for a binding contract."
