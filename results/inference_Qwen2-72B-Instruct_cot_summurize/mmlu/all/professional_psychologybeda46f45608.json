It helps to assess whether a test measures what it is supposed to measure by comparing it across different traits and methods. The matrix can be used to check for convergent validity (the extent to which a measure correlates with other measures of the same construct) and discriminant validity (the extent to which a measure does not correlate with measures of different constructs)."
