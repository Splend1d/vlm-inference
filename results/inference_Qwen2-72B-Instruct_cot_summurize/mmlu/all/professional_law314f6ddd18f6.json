This is true even though there is considerable mining of silver, turquoise, sulfur, and stone within the state. As a result, the largest platinum mining company in the state has filed suit challenging the constitutionality of the state's platinum tax statute. Which of the following best states the burden of persuasion if the mining company attacks the statute as violating the equal protection of the laws?\n\nA. The state must convince the court that the classification in the statute is rationally related to the advancement of a legitimate state interest.\nB. The state must convince the court that the classification in this statute is the least restrictive means by which to advance a compelling state interest.\nC. The mining company must convince the court that the classification in this statute is not necessary to advance a compelling state interest.\nD. The mining company must convince the court that the classification in this statute is not rationally related to the advancement of a legitimate state interest.\n"

The mining company must convince the court that the classification in this statute is not rationally related to the advancement of a legitimate state interest.\n\nIn an equal protection challenge to a state statute, the burden is typically on the party challenging the statute (in this case, the mining company) to demonstrate that the classification used in the statute is not rationally related to a legitimate state interest. This is because state statutes are presumed constitutional, and the party challenging the statute bears the burden of proving it unconstitutional. Unless the statute involves a suspect classification or infringes upon a fundamental right, which is not the case here, the rational basis test applies, placing the burden on the challenger to show that the statute lacks a rational basis."
