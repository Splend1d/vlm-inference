Fallacy of Composition\n\nJohn Stuart Mill's statement might be criticized as a fallacy of composition, which occurs when someone assumes that what is true for the parts must also be true for the whole. In this case, it could be argued that just because each person's happiness is a good to that person does not necessarily mean that the general happiness is automatically a good for the aggregate of all persons. This would depend on how the 'general happiness' is defined and achieved. If it comes at the expense of some individuals' unhappiness, then it might not be a good for the aggregate. However, it's important to note that Mill's utilitarian philosophy aims to maximize overall happiness, so he would argue that any action leading to the greatest happiness for the greatest number is morally right."
