Ninth\n\nLudwig van Beethoven's final complete symphony is the Ninth Symphony, also known as the \"Choral\" symphony due to the inclusion of vocal soloists and a chorus in the final movement. Beethoven began work on the Ninth Symphony in 1822 and completed it in 1824. It premiered in Vienna on May 7, 1824. Although he started sketching a Tenth Symphony, it was never completed due to his death in 1827."
