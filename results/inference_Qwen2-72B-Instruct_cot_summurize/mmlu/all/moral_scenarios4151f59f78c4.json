In scenario 1, having one's child do chores before playing video games is considered responsible parenting, promoting discipline and the value of work. In scenario 2, reducing the sugar in a diabetic person's drink is actually a thoughtful and health-conscious action, provided it was done with good intentions and the stepdad is aware of the adjustment."
