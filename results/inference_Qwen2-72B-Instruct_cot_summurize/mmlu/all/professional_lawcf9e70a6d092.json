The Declaration of Covenants created the community association, as an administrative entity, to which the residential community lot owners would pay dues, and which would administer and enforce the regulations and restrictions recited among the covenants. One of the restrictions set forth in the Declaration of Covenants provides that the lots be used only for single-family residences, and that no trade, commerce, or business may be conducted in any single-family residence. The Declaration of Covenants gives the community association the right to assign all of its rights, powers, titles, easements, and estates granted to it under the Declaration of Covenants. The community association assigned \"all the rights, powers, titles, easements, and estates granted to or conferred upon it by the Declaration of Covenants\" to a municipal corporation, the city. The community association was then terminated. A chef, the owner of lot 18 in the residential development, proposes to convert his single-family dwelling into a massage parlor. The city asserts an action against the chef to recover money damages. Which of the following is the best argument for the chef?\n\nA. The restraint on alienation of his land is invalid.\nB. The city is not in privity of estate with community association.\nC. The benefit is in gross; hence, the burden cannot run.\nD. The burden is in gross; hence, the benefit cannot run.\n"

The city is not in privity of estate with the community association.\n\nFor the city to enforce the restrictive covenant against the chef, there must be privity of estate between the parties involved. Privity of estate refers to the legal relationship between two parties who have a direct interest in the same property. When the community association assigned its rights to the city, it did not necessarily create privity of estate between the city and the individual lot owners. Typically, such covenants run with the land and bind successors in interest if they are properly recorded and meet certain criteria, but the assignment to the city might not have been sufficient to transfer the necessary privity for the city to enforce the restrictions against the chef directly.\n\nIt's important to note that the other options provided do not directly address the legal standing of the city to enforce the covenant. Option A discusses the validity of the restraint on alienation, which is not the primary issue here since the chef is not attempting to sell the property but rather change its use. Options C and D involve the concepts of benefits and burdens running with the land, which are relevant but secondary to the question of whether the city has the legal standing to enforce the covenant in the first place. Without privity of estate, the city's ability to enforce the covenant is questionable."
