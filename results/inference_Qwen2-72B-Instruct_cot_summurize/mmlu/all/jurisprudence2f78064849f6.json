This means that law is essentially an artefact or social construction (Option A). Legal positivists argue that the validity of a law is not dependent on its moral correctness but rather on its sources and the fact that it has been created through established social processes. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. That law is essentially an artefact or social construction."
