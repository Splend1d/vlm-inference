                    "text": "To determine which company's fuse is more likely to last at least 1 hour (60 minutes), we need to calculate the z-score for each distribution and then find the area under the curve to the right of 60 minutes.\n\nFor Company I:\n- Mean (\\(\\mu\\)) = 50 minutes\n- Standard Deviation (\\(\\sigma\\)) = 10 minutes\n\nThe z-score for 60 minutes is calculated as follows:\n\n\\[z = \\frac{X - \\mu}{\\sigma} = \\frac{60 - 50}{10} = 1\\]\n\nLooking up a z-score of 1 in a standard normal distribution table gives us a cumulative probability of approximately 0.8413. However, since we're interested in the probability of lasting at least 60 minutes, we need the area to the right of 60 minutes, which would be 1 - 0.8413 = 0.1587 (or about 0.159).\n\nFor Company II:\n- Mean (\\(\\mu\\)) = 55 minutes\n- Standard Deviation (\\(\\sigma\\)) = 5 minutes\n\nThe z-score for 60 minutes is calculated as follows:\n\n\\[z = \\frac{X - \\mu}{\\sigma} = \\frac{60 - 55}{5} = 1\\]\n\nLooking up a z-score of 1 in a standard normal distribution table again gives us a cumulative probability of approximately 0.8413. The area to the right of 60 minutes is again 1 - 0.8413 = 0.1587 (or about 0.159).\n\nHowever, the question asks which company's fuse is more likely to last at least 1 hour, not for the probability itself. Since the calculations show that both have the same probability (0.159) of lasting at least 60 minutes when looking at the area to the right of the z-score of 1, this does not directly answer the question regarding likelihood between the two companies based on their respective distributions.\n\nGiven the calculation results, it seems options C and D are incorrect as they state the probabilities for both companies are either 0.159 or 0.841, but neither directly answers the question of which company's fuse is more likely to last at least 1 hour.\n\nThe correct interpretation should consider that Company II's mean is closer to 60 minutes, meaning there is more of its distribution above 60 minutes than Company I's, despite both having the same z-score at 60 minutes due to different means and standard deviations. However, based on the provided options, the most accurate answer considering the given choices and the calculation results is:\n\nC. For both companies, the probability that a fuse will last at least 1 hour is 0.159\n\nThis is because, mathematically, the probability calculation shows the same value for both companies at 0.159, even though logically, Company II's fuses are more likely to last at least 60 minutes based on the mean values and the distribution shapes."
