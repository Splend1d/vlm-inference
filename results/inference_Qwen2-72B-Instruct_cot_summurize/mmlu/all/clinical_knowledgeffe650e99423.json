Grade 3/5 on the Medical Research Council (MRC) scale for muscle strength represents active movement against gravity but not against resistance, not just movement with gravity eliminated.\nB. Flexion at the elbow is produced by the biceps muscle, not the triceps.\nD. Grade 1/5 on the MRC scale represents a flicker or trace of muscle contraction without any movement, not no movement or muscle contraction at all."
