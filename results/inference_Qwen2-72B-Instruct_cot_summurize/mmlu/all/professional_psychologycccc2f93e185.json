Displaying genuine interest in the client by asking about his/her family and work or school. Personalismo is a cultural value that emphasizes warmth, empathy, and interpersonal connectedness. By showing genuine interest in the client's life, the therapist can build a strong therapeutic alliance and create a safe and supportive environment for the client to share their experiences and concerns. This approach also acknowledges the importance of the client's social context and can help the therapist better understand the client's values, beliefs, and cultural background. While integrating members of the extended family into the intervention (option A) can be beneficial in some cases, it is not always necessary or appropriate. Maintaining a neutral attitude (option B) is important in therapy, but it does not necessarily reflect the value of personalismo. Establishing credibility by demonstrating knowledge of indigenous healing practices (option D) can be helpful, but it is not the only way to incorporate personalismo into therapy."
