The mean of these scores is \\(\\frac{S}{10}\\).\n\nWhen the largest score is increased by 40 points, the new sum of the scores becomes \\(S + 40\\). \n\nThe new mean of the scores would then be \\(\\frac{S + 40}{10}\\).\n\nLet's simplify this:\n\n\\[\n\\text{New Mean} = \\frac{S + 40}{10} = \\frac{S}{10} + \\frac{40}{10} = \\text{Original Mean} + 4\n\\]\n\nTherefore, increasing the largest score by 40 points increases the mean by 4 points.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nB. It will increase by 4 points."
