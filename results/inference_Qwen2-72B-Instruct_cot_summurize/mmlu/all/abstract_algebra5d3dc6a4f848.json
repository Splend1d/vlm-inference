For any \\(a \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\), there should be an \\(e\\) such that \\(a*e = e*a = a\\).\n\nUsing the operation definition:\n\\[a*e = a + e + 1 = a\\]\n\nSolving for \\(e\\):\n\\[e + 1 = 0\\]\n\\[e = -1\\]\n\nThus, the identity element \\(e = -1\\).\n\nNow, to find the inverse of \\(a\\), we want to find \\(a^{-1}\\) such that:\n\\[a*a^{-1} = -1\\]\n\nUsing the operation definition:\n\\[a*a^{-1} = a + a^{-1} + 1 = -1\\]\n\nSolving for \\(a^{-1}\\):\n\\[a + a^{-1} = -2\\]\n\\[a^{-1} = -2 - a\\]\n\nSo, the inverse of \\(a\\) is \\(-2-a\\), which can also be written as \\(a-2\\) if you consider the expression in terms of \\(a\\), but since the question asks for the inverse of \\(a\\), the correct answer would be:\n\nB. \\(-2\\)\n\nHowever, given the options, the correct representation of the inverse of \\(a\\) in terms of \\(a\\) is:\n\nC. \\(a-2\\)\n\nThis implies finding an element such that when combined with \\(a\\) using the defined operation, it yields the identity element (\\(-1\\)). The correct option based on the given choices and the derivation is C. \\(a-2\\), recognizing that this represents the inverse of \\(a\\) when applied to the operation defined by \\(a*b = a + b + 1\\)."
