SO3 (Sulfur Trioxide)\n\nSulfur trioxide can exist in several resonance forms due to the double bonds and lone pairs on the sulfur atom. In one resonance structure, sulfur has a double bond with one oxygen atom and single bonds with the other two oxygen atoms. In another resonance structure, the double bond shifts to another oxygen atom, and so on. This results in multiple resonance structures for SO3.\n\nThe other molecules listed do not have multiple resonance structures:\n\nA. CCl2F2 (Carbon Tetrachlorofluoride) does not have resonance structures because all the chlorine and fluorine atoms are bonded to the carbon atom through single bonds, and there are no lone pairs or double bonds that can be shifted to create alternative structures.\n\nC. PF5 (Phosphorus Pentafluoride) does not have resonance structures because phosphorus is bonded to each of the five fluorine atoms through single bonds, and there are no double bonds or lone pairs that can be shifted.\n\nD. H2O (Water) does not have resonance structures because the oxygen atom has two lone pairs and two single bonds to hydrogen atoms, which cannot be shifted to create alternative structures without violating the octet rule. However, it's worth noting that water does have a bent geometry due to the presence of lone pairs, but this does not constitute resonance as understood in chemical bonding theory."
