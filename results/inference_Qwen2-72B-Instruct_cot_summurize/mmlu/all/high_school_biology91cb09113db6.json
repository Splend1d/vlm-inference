There will be a net flow of water into the bag, causing it to swell in size.\nC. The bag will remain the exact same size because no water will move at all.\nD.

                    "text": "The correct answer is B. There will be a net flow of water into the bag, causing it to swell in size.\n\nExplanation: Osmosis is the net movement of solvent molecules (in this case, water) through a selectively permeable membrane from an area of lower solute concentration to an area of higher solute concentration until equilibrium is reached. When the dialysis bag containing a 0.5 M solution is placed in distilled water (which can be considered as a 0 M solution), the water outside the bag has a lower solute concentration than inside the bag. Therefore, water from the distilled water (outside the bag) will move into the bag through osmosis to equalize the solute concentrations on both sides of the dialysis membrane. This will cause the bag to swell in size."
