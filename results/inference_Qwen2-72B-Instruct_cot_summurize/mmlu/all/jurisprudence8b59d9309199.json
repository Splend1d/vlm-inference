Parfit does not necessarily oppose equality but rather questions some traditional conceptions of it. In his work, he discusses various principles of distributive justice and argues against the idea that equality should be the sole or primary aim of a just distribution. Instead, he suggests that the focus should be on maximizing the overall good or welfare. Therefore, none of the provided options correctly capture Parfit's stance on equality.\n\nHowever, if I have to choose the closest option from the given ones, I would say:\n\nE. None of the above, as Parfit's position is more nuanced than any of these options suggest. He critiques certain forms of egalitarianism but does not reject all forms of equality or the importance of addressing poverty."
