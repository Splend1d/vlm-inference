The solutions for this in the interval [0, 2\u03c0] are \\(x = \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\) and \\(x = \\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\).\n\n2. \\(\\sin x + \\cos x = -(\\sin x - \\cos x)\\), which simplifies to \\(2\\sin x = 0\\). The solutions for this in the interval [0, 2\u03c0] are \\(x = 0\\), \\(x = \\pi\\), and \\(x = 2\\pi\\).\n\nHowever, we're looking for the smallest positive value of \\(x\\) after \\(x=0\\), which is \\(x = \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\). Therefore, \\(a = \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\).\n\nNext, we need to find the area between these curves from \\(x = 0\\) to \\(x = \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\). This can be found by integrating the absolute difference between the two functions over the interval:\n\n\\[\n\\int_0^{\\frac{\\pi}{2}} |(\\sin x + \\cos x)^4 - (\\sin x - \\cos x)^4| dx\n\\]\n\nNotice that for \\(x \\in [0, \\frac{\\pi}{2}]\\), \\((\\sin x + \\cos x)^4 > (\\sin x - \\cos x)^4\\), so the absolute value isn't necessary here, and we can simply integrate the difference:\n\n\\[\n\\int_0^{\\frac{\\pi}{2}} ((\\sin x + \\cos x)^4 - (\\sin x - \\cos x)^4) dx\n\\]\n\nUsing the binomial theorem and trigonometric identities, we can expand and simplify this integral. However, a simpler approach is to notice that the integrand can be simplified using the identity \\(\\sin^2 x + \\cos^2 x = 1\\):\n\n\\[\n(\\sin x + \\cos x)^4 - (\\sin x - \\cos x)^4 = 8\\sin x \\cos x (\\sin^2 x + \\cos^2 x) = 8\\sin x \\cos x\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the area is:\n\n\\[\n\\int_0^{\\frac{\\pi}{2}} 8\\sin x \\cos x dx = 4\\int_0^{\\frac{\\pi}{2}} 2\\sin x \\cos x dx = 4\\int_0^{\\frac{\\pi}{2}} \\sin(2x) dx\n\\]\n\nLet \\(u = 2x\\), then \\(du = 2dx\\) or \\(dx = \\frac{du}{2}\\):\n\n\\[\n4\\int_0^{\\pi} \\sin(u) \\frac{du}{2} = 2\\int_0^{\\pi} \\sin(u) du = 2[-\\cos(u)]_0^{\\pi} = 2(-\\cos(\\pi) + \\cos(0)) = 2(1 + 1) = 4\n\\]\n\nThus, the correct answer is C. 4."
