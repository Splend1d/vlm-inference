In this case, the $100,000 note payable from Simmon to King would be eliminated because it's an intercompany transaction.\n\nThus, the total liabilities reported on the consolidated financial statements would be:\n\n- King's liabilities: $450,000\n- Simmon's liabilities: $200,000\n\nTotal before elimination: $450,000 + $200,000 = $650,000\n\nAfter eliminating the intercompany note payable: $650,000 - $100,000 = $550,000\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. $550,000"
