Here's a brief explanation of each:\n\nA. Following childbirth: Many cultures have practices where sexual abstinence is required for a certain period after a woman gives birth. This can be due to physical recovery needs, but also for cultural or religious reasons.\n\nB. During menstruation: In many cultures, there are prohibitions against sexual activity during menstruation. These prohibitions may be based on beliefs about menstrual blood being impure or unclean, or they may be related to health concerns.\n\nC. Between parents and children: Sexual relations between parents and children are universally taboo across virtually all cultures. This incest taboo is considered one of the most universal prohibitions in human societies, often enforced by strong social, legal, and moral sanctions.\n\nTherefore, all three restrictions have existed in at least one culture at some point in history."
