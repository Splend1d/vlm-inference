Therefore, the bond interest expense for the period from June 1 to December 31, year 1, would include the period from the issuance date until the first interest payment date (which is four months) plus the period from the first interest payment date until the end of the year (which is three months). Thus, the total period for which the interest expense would be recognized in the year ended December 31, year 1, would be seven months.\n\nSo the correct answer is:\n\nD. Seven months."
