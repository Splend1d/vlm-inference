Stigma surrounding HIV/AIDS can discourage individuals from getting tested due to fear of judgment or discrimination. Machismo, or strong traditional views on masculinity, may prevent men from seeking help or acknowledging potential vulnerability to infection. Drug abuse can also lead to risky behaviors and avoidance of healthcare services, including HIV testing."
