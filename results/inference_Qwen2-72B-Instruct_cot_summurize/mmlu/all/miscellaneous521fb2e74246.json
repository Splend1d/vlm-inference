The nursery rhyme goes, \"In 1492, Columbus sailed the ocean blue,\" but the term \"blue\" is often misinterpreted as describing the color of the ocean. In this context, \"blue\" is simply a rhyming device and does not describe the condition or appearance of the ocean. Therefore, the most accurate description from the given options would be that Columbus sailed in a \"really big\" ocean, referring to the vastness of the Atlantic."
