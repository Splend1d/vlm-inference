                    "text": "The correct answer is B. If the force of gravity between the Moon and the Earth were to suddenly stop, the Moon would continue rotating on its axis because that motion is independent of the gravitational force between the two bodies. However, without the centripetal force provided by gravity, the Moon would no longer follow a curved path around the Earth. Instead, it would move in a straight line at whatever velocity it had at the moment gravity ceased, according to Newton's first law of motion (an object in motion stays in motion with the same speed and in the same direction unless acted upon by an unbalanced force). This would effectively cause the Moon to \"fly off\" into space, away from the Earth, while continuing to rotate on its axis."
