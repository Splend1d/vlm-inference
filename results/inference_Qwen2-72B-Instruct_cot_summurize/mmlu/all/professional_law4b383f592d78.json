He finally saw a public defender who filed a motion to dismiss alleging an unconstitutional detention in violation of due process. The prosecution countered that the state's rules allowed for detention without a probable cause hearing for up to 30 days, and that the procedure was constitutional. Will the court most likely decide that this detention is unconstitutional?\n\nA. No, because the Supreme Court has ruled that detentions can properly last up to 30 days without a probable cause determination.\nB. No, because each case must be decided on its own facts and there may be many good reasons why the state has not yet provided a probable cause determination.\nC. Yes, because when the state arrests someone without a warrant it must provide a prompt probable cause determination.\nD. No, because it is constitutional to hold someone for up to 15 days without a probable cause determination.\n"

Yes, because when the state arrests someone without a warrant it must provide a prompt probable cause determination.\n\nIn general, when someone is arrested without a warrant, the Fourth Amendment requires that there must be a prompt determination of probable cause by a judicial officer. This is to ensure that the arrestee's rights are protected and that they are not being detained unconstitutionally. The exact time frame can vary based on jurisdiction and circumstances, but generally, it should occur within 48 hours of the arrest. In this case, since the man was held for 14 days without such a determination, his detention would likely be considered unconstitutional."
