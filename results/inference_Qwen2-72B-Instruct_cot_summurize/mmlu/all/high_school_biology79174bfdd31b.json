                    "text": "A. Inbreeding and loss of genetic variation threaten a population.\n\nThis is the correct answer because small populations are prone to inbreeding, which can lead to a loss of genetic variation. This loss of genetic diversity can increase the frequency of deleterious alleles and reduce the overall fitness of the population, making it more susceptible to diseases, environmental changes, and other threats. The other options either do not directly contribute to the extinction vortex or are not inherently detrimental to the population's survival. For example, migration and breeding with individuals from another population can actually increase genetic diversity and help a population avoid the risks associated with inbreeding. Mutations are a natural part of evolution and can be beneficial, neutral, or harmful; they do not necessarily reduce the health of a population on their own."
