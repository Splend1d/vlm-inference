Inquire about the current status of transactions that were recorded on the basis of preliminary data.\n\nAuditors perform various procedures to identify and gather evidence regarding subsequent events that may affect the financial statements. Subsequent events are events or transactions that occur after the balance sheet date but before the issuance of the financial statements. Among the options given, inquiring about the current status of transactions that were recorded on the basis of preliminary data is the most relevant procedure for obtaining evidence about subsequent events. This helps the auditor determine if there have been any changes or updates to these transactions that could impact the financial statements.\n\nHere's why the other options are less relevant:\n\nA. Verify inventory pledged under loan agreements by confirming the details with financial institutions. This procedure is more related to verifying the existence and valuation of inventory rather than assessing subsequent events.\n\nC. Compare the financial statements being reported on with those of the prior year. While this can be useful for detecting unusual fluctuations or trends, it does not specifically address subsequent events.\n\nD. Trace information from shipping documents to sales invoices and sales journal transactions. This procedure is typically used to test the completeness and accuracy of revenue recognition and does not directly relate to subsequent events."
