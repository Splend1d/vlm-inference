The gift violates the establishment clause.\n\nThe establishment clause of the First Amendment prohibits the government from making any law respecting an establishment of religion. By providing federally owned buses to a religious organization for the purpose of spreading a particular moral message, Congress may be seen as endorsing or favoring a specific religious viewpoint, which could violate the principle of separation of church and state. This action could be interpreted as the government advancing or inhibiting religion, which is forbidden by the establishment clause."
