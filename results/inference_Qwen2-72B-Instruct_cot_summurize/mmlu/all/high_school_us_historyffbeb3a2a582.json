Prior to this act, British policies in the colonies were largely focused on mercantilist principles, which involved regulating colonial trade to ensure that it benefited the mother country. The Navigation Acts, for example, controlled colonial trade to ensure that it flowed through British ports and used British ships.\n\nHowever, the Sugar Act of 1764 introduced taxation as a means of raising revenue from the colonies rather than simply regulating their trade. This was a departure from previous policies that primarily sought to control colonial trade for the benefit of the British economy. The act reduced the tax on molasses (which had previously been set at six pence per gallon but was rarely enforced) to three pence per gallon while making the tax more strictly enforced. It also imposed other duties on wines, silks, coffee, and other items imported into the colonies. The revenue generated by these taxes was intended to pay for the costs of defending and administering the colonies, particularly in light of the increased territory gained by Britain in the Treaty of Paris in 1763 following the Seven Years' War.\n\nThis move towards taxation without representation would contribute to growing tensions between the colonies and the British government, eventually leading to the American Revolution."
