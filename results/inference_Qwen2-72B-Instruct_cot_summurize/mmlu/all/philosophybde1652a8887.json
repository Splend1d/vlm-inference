According to Nagel, there are certain aspects of our lives where we might not be morally assessable due to factors that are outside of our control. Here's how each of your options fits into Nagel's argument:\n\nA. Actions that affect only themselves: Nagel might argue that if an action has no impact on others, then it is less clear whether one can be morally assessed for it. However, he would likely acknowledge that this depends on whether the action reflects on one's character or whether it could indirectly affect others.\n\nB. Their character: Nagel does not claim that people cannot be morally assessed for their character. In fact, he discusses how one's character traits can lead to different outcomes in similar situations, which raises questions about the role of luck in moral assessment.\n\nC. What is due to factors beyond their control: This is the most direct application of Nagel's argument. He claims that when outcomes are significantly influenced by factors beyond a person's control, it is problematic to hold them fully morally responsible for those outcomes. For example, if someone is born with a predisposition to aggression, they may not be entirely blameworthy for acting aggressively.\n\nD. Actions that do not violate anyone\u2019s rights: Nagel does not specifically claim that people cannot be morally assessed for actions that don't violate rights. However, he does discuss the role of luck in outcomes, and if an action doesn't harm others (i.e., doesn't violate their rights), the moral assessment of that action might be mitigated by the role of luck in its consequences.\n\nIn summary, Nagel's primary focus is on option C, arguing that when outcomes are significantly affected by factors beyond a person's control, it complicates our ability to make moral assessments."
