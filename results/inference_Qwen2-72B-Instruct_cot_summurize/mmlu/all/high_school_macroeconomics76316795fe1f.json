It posits that production (supply) inherently generates the income necessary to purchase the output produced (demand). In other words, the act of producing goods and services creates the means to buy them, thus supply creates its own demand. This theory suggests that overproduction or prolonged periods of unemployment are not possible in a free market economy because the supply of goods will always generate enough income for people to demand those goods. This concept is in stark contrast with Keynesian economics, which argues that demand can fall short of supply, leading to recessions and the need for government intervention to stimulate the economy."
