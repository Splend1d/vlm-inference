So if you have two elements \\((a,b)\\) and \\((c,d)\\), their product is \\((a\\cdot c, b\\cdot d)\\) where each multiplication is performed within the corresponding ring.\n\nGiven the elements \\((2,3)\\) and \\((3,5)\\) in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_5 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_9 \\):\n\n- For the first component, we multiply \\(2\\) and \\(3\\) in \\(\\mathbb{Z}_5\\). In \\(\\mathbb{Z}_5\\), \\(2\\cdot 3 = 6\\), which is equivalent to \\(1\\) modulo \\(5\\). So, the result of this multiplication is \\(1\\).\n  \n- For the second component, we multiply \\(3\\) and \\(5\\) in \\(\\mathbb{Z}_9\\). In \\(\\mathbb{Z}_9\\), \\(3\\cdot 5 = 15\\), which is equivalent to \\(6\\) modulo \\(9\\). So, the result of this multiplication is \\(6\\).\n\nThus, the product of \\((2,3)\\) and \\((3,5)\\) in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_5 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_9 \\) is \\((1,6)\\).\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nC.
