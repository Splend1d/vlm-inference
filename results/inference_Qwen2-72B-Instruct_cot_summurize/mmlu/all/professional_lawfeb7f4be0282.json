One day, the man set out driving his truck, heavily loaded with lumber, down a mountain road. Sitting next to the man in the passenger seat was a 19-year-old helper. During the course of the trip, when the truck was going down a long hill, the brakes failed. The man shouted to the helper to jump, but the teenager refused to do so and shouted back to the man that he should try to steer the truck down the hill. The man then opened the door on the passenger's side of the truck and negligently pushed the helper out. The helper, who suffered a broken leg, was rushed to the hospital where he was treated for his injury. As the helper was recuperating, a nurse inadvertently mixed up his chart with that of the female patient in the next room. The nurse gave the helper a fertility pill that made him sterile. If the helper brings suit against the man to recover damages for his sterility, the man will\n\nA. recover, because it is foreseeable that a hospital can be negligent in its care of patients.\nB. recover, because the man was negligent in pushing the helper out of the truck.\nC. not recover, because the nurse's act was a supervening superseding cause.\nD. not recover, because it is not foreseeable that a patient would be injured in such a manner.\n"

The nurse's action is an independent event that occurred after the initial incident and was not a foreseeable result of the man's actions. Therefore, the nurse's act is considered a supervening (or intervening) superseding cause that breaks the chain of causation between the man's actions and the helper's injury (sterility). This means that the man cannot be held liable for the helper's sterility. However, this does not preclude the helper from bringing a separate suit against the hospital or the nurse for medical malpractice."
