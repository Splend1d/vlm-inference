To estimate the total stock investment by students in this school, two plans are proposed. Plan I would sample 30 students at random, find a confidence interval estimate of their average investment, and then multiply both ends of this interval by 1650 to get an interval estimate of the total investment. Plan II would sample 30 students at random from among the 132 who have investments in the market, find a confidence interval estimate of their average investment, and then multiply both ends of this interval by 132 to get an interval estimate of the total investment. Which is the better plan for estimating the total stock market investment by students in this school?\n\nA. Plan I\nB. Plan II\nC. Both plans use random samples and so will produce equivalent results.\nD. Neither plan will give an accurate estimate.\n"

                    "text": "The better plan for estimating the total stock market investment by students in this school is **Plan B** (which seems to be mistakenly labeled as Plan II in your question).\n\nHere's why:\n\n**Plan I** involves sampling 30 students at random from the entire student body of 1650, regardless of whether they have investments or not. This plan assumes that every student has an equal chance of having a significant stock investment, which is clearly not the case since only 132 students out of 1650 have investments. As a result, most of the sampled students under Plan I will likely have no investment at all, leading to a poor estimate of the average investment among those who actually invest.\n\n**Plan II**, on the other hand, targets the specific group of interest: the 132 students who have stock investments. By sampling from this group, the estimate of the average investment will be more accurate because it directly addresses the population of interest. After calculating the average investment, multiplying by 132 gives a more precise estimate of the total investment by these students.\n\nThus, **Plan II** provides a more focused and accurate estimation method for the total stock market investment by the students who actually invest, making it the better choice.\n\nThe correct answer based on the options given would be:\n\nB. Plan II\n\n(However, note that the options provided in the question seem to be mislabeled, with \"Plan I\" and \"Plan II\" instead of the typical A, B, C, D format.)"
