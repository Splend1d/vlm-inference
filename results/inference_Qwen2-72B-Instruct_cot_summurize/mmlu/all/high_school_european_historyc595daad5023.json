Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. They initiated an armed resistance against Western interests in Northern China. \n\nThe Boxer Rebellion, also known as the Boxer Uprising, was a violent anti-foreign, anti-colonial, and anti-Christian uprising between 1899 and 1901, during which the Boxers, who were supported by the Qing government, attacked foreign missionaries, Christians, and foreign imperial interests. This rebellion was a direct response to the perceived encroachment of Western powers into China, symbolized by treaties such as the Treaty of Nanjing."
