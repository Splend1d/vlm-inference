Archaeology specifically focuses on the study of human history and prehistory through the excavation and analysis of material remains such as artifacts, structures, and features. While it can intersect with other subfields like biological anthropology, cultural anthropology, and paleoanthropology, its primary categorization is within the broader discipline of anthropology."
