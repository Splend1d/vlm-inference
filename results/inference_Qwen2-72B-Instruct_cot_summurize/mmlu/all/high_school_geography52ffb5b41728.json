None of the above.\n\nAfrican cities are diverse and complex, but many face significant challenges such as inadequate infrastructure, urban poverty, and high levels of unemployment. While there are certainly some areas within African cities that are thriving and well-maintained, these are often limited to certain neighborhoods or districts. Similarly, while some African cities may have multiple business districts, this is not necessarily true for all of them. Therefore, none of the options provided accurately describes most African cities."
