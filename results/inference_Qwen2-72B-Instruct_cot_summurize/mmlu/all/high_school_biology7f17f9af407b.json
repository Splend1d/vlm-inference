Strenuous exercise does not play a role in regulating respiration, but rather is a condition that requires regulation of respiration to meet increased oxygen demand and removal of carbon dioxide. The other options listed (A, B, and C) are all factors that stimulate the respiratory center in the brainstem, leading to an increase in the rate and depth of breathing."
