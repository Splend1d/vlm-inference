High ratios of primary production to standing-crop biomass\n\nEarly-successional plant communities typically have high rates of primary production relative to their standing crop biomass. This is because these communities are characterized by fast-growing, opportunistic species that quickly colonize disturbed or newly available habitats. These species often have high reproductive rates and allocate more resources to growth and reproduction than to maintenance, resulting in high productivity but relatively low biomass. The other options do not generally describe early-successional communities:\n\nA. High niche divergence among co-occurring species is more typical of climax communities where species have evolved to occupy distinct niches to reduce competition.\nC. High frequency of K-selected species is characteristic of late-successional or climax communities, as K-selected species tend to be long-lived and have lower reproductive rates.\nD. High detrital biomass would suggest a mature ecosystem with a well-developed decomposer community, which is not typical of early-successional stages."
