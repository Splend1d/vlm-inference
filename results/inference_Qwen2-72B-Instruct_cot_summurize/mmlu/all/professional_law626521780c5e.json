                    "text": "The United States Congress passed, and the President signed, a law called the \"American Morality Leadership Act\" which limits the amount of makeup that women or men can wear in public and precludes the wearing of short dresses. Men over 65 must wear only brown or grey attire, while those under 65 must wear button down dress shirts with neckties, except for when they are exercising or working physically. The Act has other restrictions and specifications for dress and grooming mandates for men and women. A class action was filed to challenge the Act based on a constitutional attack. Which argument listed below more closely reflects the constitutional argument that is most likely to succeed in court?\n\nA. The law is unconstitutional because it violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act.\nB. The law is unconstitutional because it is primarily discriminatory against women's rights.\nC. The law is unconstitutional because it violates procedural due process.\nD. The law is unconstitutional because it infringes on fundamental rights of the individual.\n"

                    "text": "The argument that most closely reflects the constitutional argument that is most likely to succeed in court is D. The law is unconstitutional because it infringes on fundamental rights of the individual.\n\nThis argument is grounded in the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause, which guarantees the protection of certain fundamental rights from government interference. The law's restrictions on personal appearance and dress could be seen as an infringement on individuals' liberty interests in self-expression and autonomy. Additionally, the law may be challenged under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, as it appears to discriminate based on gender and age without a compelling state interest, which would be subject to strict scrutiny by the courts.\n\nTitle VII of the Civil Rights Act (option A) applies specifically to employment discrimination, not to general laws affecting the public. Procedural due process (option C) concerns the fairness of governmental procedures leading to deprivation of life, liberty, or property, whereas this case seems to focus on substantive due process, which deals with the nature of the right being restricted rather than the process by which the restriction is imposed. While option B might also have some merit, the broader argument about fundamental rights is likely to be more persuasive in challenging the constitutionality of the entire act."
