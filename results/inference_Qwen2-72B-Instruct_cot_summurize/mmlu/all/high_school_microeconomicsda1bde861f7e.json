The cost to produce each additional unit will rise, which leads to an increase in the Marginal Cost (MC). Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. An upward shift in MC.\n\nAn upward shift in MC could also lead to an upward shift in Average Total Cost (ATC) if all other costs remain constant, but that is not one of the options provided. The price change does not directly affect the Average Fixed Cost (AFC) or the Marginal Product of Labor (MPL), which would require a change in the quantity of output or the productivity of labor, respectively."
