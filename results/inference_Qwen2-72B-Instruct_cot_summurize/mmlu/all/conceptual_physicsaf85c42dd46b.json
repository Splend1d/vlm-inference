This means that they are constantly falling towards the Earth due to gravity, but their high horizontal velocity causes them to miss the Earth and continue in a curved path around it. This is often referred to as \"falling around\" the Earth. While options A and C are related to the forces acting on the satellite, they do not fully capture the essence of orbital motion. Option B is incorrect as satellites are still within the Earth's gravitational field."
