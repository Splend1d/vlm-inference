Octahedral complexes of monodentate ligands can display optical isomerism only when they have at least three different ligands.\n\nExplanation:\nA. Square planar complexes can display optical isomerism if there are two different types of ligands, each in two equivalent positions, forming a non-superimposable mirror image (meso isomers don't count).\nB. Tetrahedral complexes do not usually display optical isomerism unless the ligands themselves are chiral because there's always a plane of symmetry that would prevent the formation of enantiomers.\nC. Linear complexes cannot display optical isomerism as they lack the necessary spatial arrangement to form non-superimposable mirror images.\nD. Octahedral complexes with monodentate ligands can indeed display optical isomerism, but it requires at least three different ligands for this to occur, or two pairs of similar ligands and one distinct ligand, forming a structure where non-superimposable mirror images can exist."
