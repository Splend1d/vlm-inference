Right ventricular hypertrophy\n\nA palpable left parasternal impulse is often associated with right ventricular hypertrophy, which can be caused by conditions such as pulmonary hypertension or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The left parasternal area refers to the region just to the left of the sternum (breastbone), where the right ventricle is located. When the right ventricle becomes enlarged, its contraction can create a noticeable impulse that can be felt on physical examination."
