For instance, countries like Ethiopia, Rwanda, and Ghana have seen robust economic expansion. However, this growth has not been uniform across the region. The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), despite being rich in natural resources, has struggled with political instability, conflict, and poor governance, which have hindered its economic development. As a result, the DRC's per capita income in 2020 was lower than it was in 1980, indicating that it has become poorer over the last few decades."
