According to Habermas, 'law as medium' operates within the system, facilitating the coordination of actions and interactions among individuals and institutions in society. It is instrumental and serves as a means for achieving social order and regulating economic activities. On the other hand, 'law as institution' is embedded in the lifeworld, the realm of subjective experiences, meanings, and values that constitute everyday life. In this context, law reflects and reproduces the shared values and norms of society through institutional arrangements and practices."
