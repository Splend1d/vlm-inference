He found that machine-paced production, which is characteristic of assembly line work, was the most alienating form of work. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nC. car manufacturing in assembly plants\n\nHowever, it should be noted that Blauner's research has been criticized for oversimplifying the relationship between technology and worker satisfaction, and for not taking into account other factors such as job security, wages, and working conditions. Nonetheless, his findings have had a significant impact on our understanding of the psychological effects of work and technology."
