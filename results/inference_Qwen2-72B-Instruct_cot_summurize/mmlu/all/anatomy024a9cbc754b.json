These fibers cross over (decussate) from one side of the body to the other in the pyramids.\n\nIt's worth noting that:\n\nA. Nociception (pain sensation) decussates at the level of the spinal cord, not the brainstem.\n\nB. Skilled movements involve the corticospinal tract, which does indeed decussate in the pyramids, as mentioned in C.\n\nD. Discriminative touch, including fine touch and proprioception, decussates in the brainstem at the level of the medulla oblongata, specifically in the area known as the dorsal column-medial lemniscal pathway. However, it is not accurate to say it decussates in the pyramids, as those are associated with motor function."
