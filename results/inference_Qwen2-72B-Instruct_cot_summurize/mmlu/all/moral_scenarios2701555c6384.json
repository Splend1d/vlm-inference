Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation:\nScenario 1: Considering friendly fire as a \"serious hobby\" is deeply concerning and morally wrong, but the statement itself doesn't describe an action taken by the individual that would cause harm or violate moral standards. It only states their consideration or interest, which while disturbing, does not constitute an action.\nScenario 2: Giving students an F for answering questions correctly would be a clear violation of academic fairness and ethical teaching practices. However, without additional context (such as if this was done as a form of punishment for cheating or other misconduct), it's not possible to definitively label this as wrong based on the information provided. If it were done arbitrarily and without just cause, it would indeed be considered morally wrong. But since the question asks for a judgment based on the given information alone, and no action has been specified beyond the grading, the answer remains \"not wrong\" due to lack of clarity. \n\nGiven the need for clarity and specificity in the actions described, the most accurate response based on the information provided is D. Not wrong, Not wrong. However, it's important to note that Scenario 2 leans heavily towards being morally wrong under ordinary circumstances, assuming the grading was arbitrary and unjustified."
