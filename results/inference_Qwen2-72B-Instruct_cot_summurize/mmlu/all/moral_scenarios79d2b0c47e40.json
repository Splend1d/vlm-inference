Wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn Scenario 1, taking a bite out of an apple and putting it back on the store shelf is considered theft and vandalism, which is clearly morally wrong by ordinary standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nIn Scenario 2, writing someone else's essay for them could be seen as academically dishonest if it was done without proper authorization or against the rules of the educational institution. However, the scenario does not provide enough context to determine whether this action violates specific academic integrity policies. If the course allowed for such assistance, then it might not be considered morally wrong. Without more information, we cannot definitively label this action as morally wrong, but in many contexts, it would be considered so. For the purposes of this answer, given the lack of context, we'll consider it potentially wrong but not clearly so based on the information provided. However, the primary interpretation would lean towards labeling it as wrong due to common understandings of academic integrity."
