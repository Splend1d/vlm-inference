This type of furnace allows for more flexibility in operation and can be easily turned on and off as needed, making it ideal for intermittent workloads. The material to be melted is placed directly in the electromagnetic field generated by the induction coil, which heats up the material until it melts. This process can be started and stopped as required, making it a good choice for small batch or intermittent production runs."
