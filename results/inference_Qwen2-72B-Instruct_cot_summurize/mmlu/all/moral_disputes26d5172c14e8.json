Liberal egalitarianism holds that individuals have certain fundamental rights and duties, such as the right to equal treatment and the duty to promote social justice. These rights and duties set limits on what individuals can be morally required to do. Thus, while liberal egalitarianism may require a black doctor to treat all patients equally regardless of race, it does not necessarily require the doctor to practice specifically in a black community. Whether or not the doctor has a moral obligation to do so would depend on other factors, such as the availability of medical care in that community and the doctor's own personal values and circumstances."
