Johnson (1989) and United States v. Eichman (1990), the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that laws banning flag desecration are unconstitutional because they infringe upon an individual's right to express dissenting political views. Therefore, to ban flag burning, the Constitution would need to be amended to override these Supreme Court decisions."
