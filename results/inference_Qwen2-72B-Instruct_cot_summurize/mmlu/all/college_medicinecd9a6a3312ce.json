In eukaryotic cells under aerobic conditions, the process of oxidative phosphorylation in the electron transport chain is typically used to generate ATP from these reduced coenzymes.\n\n- NADH contributes to the production of about 2.5 to 3 ATP molecules per molecule when oxidized through the electron transport chain.\n- FADH2 contributes to the production of about 1.5 to 2 ATP molecules per molecule when oxidized through the same pathway.\n\nSo if we consider an average, NADH could produce approximately 3 ATP and FADH2 could produce approximately 2 ATP. However, since the question asks for the collective amount, and does not specify how many molecules of each are involved, we need to make some assumptions.\n\nLet's assume that we have one molecule each of NADH and FADH2:\n- NADH would produce around 3 ATP.\n- FADH2 would produce around 2 ATP.\n\nAdding these together gives us approximately 5 ATP. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nB. 5 ATP. \n\nHowever, it's important to note that the actual number can vary slightly based on the efficiency of the electron transport chain and other factors."
