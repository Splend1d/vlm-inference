                    "text": "Crowding out occurs when an increase in government spending or borrowing leads to higher interest rates, which in turn discourages private investment. The extent of crowding out depends on several factors, including the responsiveness of investment to changes in interest rates (the elasticity of the investment demand curve) and the behavior of monetary policy.\n\nGiven the options provided:\n\nA. Expansionary monetary policy accompanies the fiscal policy: This would typically involve lower interest rates, which could offset some of the crowding out effect by making borrowing cheaper for private investors. Thus, there would be less crowding out if monetary policy is expansionary at the same time as fiscal policy.\n\nB. The investment demand curve is inelastic: If the investment demand curve is inelastic, it means that investment does not respond much to changes in interest rates. In this case, even if interest rates rise due to increased government borrowing, private investment would not fall significantly, leading to less crowding out. However, the question asks for a scenario where there is \"relatively more\" crowding out, so this option does not fit the criteria.\n\nC. Government spending improves profit expectations among businesses: If government spending boosts overall economic activity and improves business profits, it can lead to a multiplier effect where private investment increases alongside government spending. This scenario could mitigate crowding out because the positive impact on profits encourages more private investment rather than less.\n\nD. The investment demand curve is elastic: An elastic investment demand curve means that investment is highly responsive to changes in interest rates. If interest rates rise due to increased government borrowing, private investment will fall sharply, leading to a significant crowding out effect. This scenario fits the criteria of having \"relatively more\" crowding out as a result of expansionary fiscal policy.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. The investment demand curve is elastic."
