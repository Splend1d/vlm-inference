In Hinduism, cremation is seen as a way to release the soul from the body so that it can continue its journey through the cycle of rebirth (samsara). Similarly, in Buddhism, cremation is often preferred as it is believed to aid in the separation of the spirit from the physical body, allowing the spirit to move on to the next life or achieve Nirvana."
