The restriction of women to the domestic sphere creates a sense of national identity that is founded on a celebration of home life, feminine strength, and maternal characteristics.\nD. When thinking about national identity, violence, physical strength, aggression, and the ability to use force are attributed as feminine characteristics.

Women have been used as symbols of statehood, with nationalism often presented in highly gendered and female terms. For instance, countries like France (Marianne) and Germany (Germania) have female national personifications. Women's bodies have also been used to represent the nation, with their purity and sanctity often serving as metaphors for the nation's honor. In times of conflict, women's bodies become battlegrounds, with rape and sexual violence used as weapons of war to humiliate enemy men and destroy the morale of the enemy population.\n\nMoreover, national identity can be developed through shared experiences, including war. However, the glorification of iconic national figures such as political leaders is often gendered, with men occupying more prominent roles in the public sphere. Women may be celebrated for their contributions to the war effort, but these contributions are often confined to the domestic sphere, such as nursing, cooking, and caring for soldiers.\n\nMeasures of national pride and success are also biased towards the glorification of male attributes such as physical strength, aggression, and the ability to use force. The male identity is often imagined as being one of warriorhood, with men expected to defend the nation against external threats. This reinforces traditional gender roles, with women expected to occupy the domestic sphere and men expected to occupy the public sphere.\n\nIn summary, gender plays a significant role in shaping the conceptualization of nationhood and conflict. Women are often used as symbols of statehood, while measures of national pride and success are biased towards the glorification of male attributes. National identity can be developed through shared experiences, including war, but the glorification of iconic national figures is often gendered, with men occupying more prominent roles in the public sphere."
