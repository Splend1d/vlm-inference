More oxygen atoms generally mean a stronger acid because they stabilize the negative charge on the conjugate base. Following this trend:\n\n- HBrO (hypobromous acid) has 1 oxygen.\n- HBrO3 (bromic acid) has 3 oxygens.\n- HBrO2 (bromous acid) has 2 oxygens.\n- HBrO4 (perbromic acid) has 4 oxygens.\n\nThus, among these options, HBrO4 (perbromic acid) is the strongest acid due to having the most oxygen atoms attached to the bromine atom. Therefore, the answer is D. HBrO4."
