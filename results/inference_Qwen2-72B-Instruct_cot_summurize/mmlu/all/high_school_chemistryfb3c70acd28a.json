S\u2013O: Oxygen (O) is more electronegative than sulfur (S), but the difference isn't as large as in some other pairs.\nB. P\u2013F: Fluorine (F) is the most electronegative element on the periodic table, and phosphorus (P) is less electronegative, making this bond highly polar.\nC. C\u2013B: Carbon (C) and boron (B) have similar electronegativities, so this bond would be relatively nonpolar.\nD. C\u2013N: Nitrogen (N) is more electronegative than carbon (C), but again, the difference isn't as large as in the case of B.\n\nGiven these considerations, the pair with the largest bond polarity is:\n\nB.
