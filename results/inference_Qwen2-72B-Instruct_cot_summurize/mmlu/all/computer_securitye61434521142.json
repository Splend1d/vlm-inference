The optimizations mentioned\u2014Chinese Remainder (CR), Montgomery Representation (MR), Karatsuba Multiplication (KM), and Repeated squaring and Sliding windows (RS)\u2014can all potentially leak information through their variable execution times.\n\nTurning off CR and MR would indeed help in closing the timing channel attack as described because these optimizations introduce variability in the execution time based on the data being processed, which is precisely what the timing attack exploits. By turning off CR and MR, the computation becomes more uniform, thus reducing the potential for timing-based information leakage.\n\nHowever, simply turning off CR would not be enough because MR also contributes to the timing variability. Therefore, both CR and MR need to be disabled to effectively mitigate the timing attack.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nC. True, False\n\nThis means that turning off both CR and MR (option 1) would close the timing channel attack described in the paper, but turning off only CR (option 2) would not be sufficient."
