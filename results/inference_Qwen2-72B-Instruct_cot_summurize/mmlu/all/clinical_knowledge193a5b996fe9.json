Low carbohydrate intake can lead to reduced glycogen stores, which are critical for sustained high-intensity efforts. This can result in early fatigue and impaired performance in high-intensity activities.\n\nA is incorrect because carbohydrate stores, particularly muscle glycogen, play a significant role even in short-duration, high-intensity exercises lasting less than 10 minutes.\nB is not directly related to carbohydrate intake, as resting muscle pH is primarily influenced by factors such as muscle fiber type and metabolic processes within the muscle cells.\nD is also incorrect, as low carbohydrate intake actually leads to greater reliance on fat and protein metabolism during exercise, rather than an increased use of muscle glycogen."
