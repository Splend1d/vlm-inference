This will be a permutation that has cycle lengths whose LCM is maximized.\n\nLet's consider different possibilities:\n\n- A 5-cycle: \\((12345)\\) has an order of 5.\n- A product of disjoint cycles, for example, a 4-cycle and a 1-cycle: \\((1234)(5)\\) has an order of 4.\n- Another possibility is a 3-cycle and a 2-cycle: \\((123)(45)\\). The LCM of 3 and 2 is 6, so this permutation has an order of 6.\n- We could have two 2-cycles and a 1-cycle: \\((12)(34)(5)\\), which has an order of 2 (the LCM of 2 and 1).\n- Lastly, we can have five 1-cycles: \\((1)(2)(3)(4)(5)\\), which has an order of 1.\n\nAmong these, the highest order is 6, achieved by the permutation that is a product of a 3-cycle and a 2-cycle.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\nB. 6"
