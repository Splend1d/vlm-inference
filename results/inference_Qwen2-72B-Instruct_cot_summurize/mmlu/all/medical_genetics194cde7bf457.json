This can include physical traits, behaviors, and even the effects of environmental exposures. Parental exposures to war, natural disasters, and hunger can have lasting impacts on their offspring, potentially affecting their health, development, and behavior. These effects can be mediated through various mechanisms including epigenetic changes, which can alter gene expression without changing the DNA sequence itself."
