Even though the victim was already dead when the defendant fired the additional shots, the defendant's actions demonstrate a clear intent to commit murder. The fact that the victim was already deceased does not negate the defendant's culpability for the act of murder, as he intended to kill the victim by firing the gun at him. Therefore, the defendant can be charged with murder, which is the unlawful killing of another person with malice aforethought."
