Toward the end of the seventh year of the term, a violent storm blew off several of the roof shingles. The tenant noticed a leak through the roof where the shingles had blown off, but didn't make any repairs. A month later, a severe rain storm occurred and water leaked through the roof, causing damage to the valuable parquet floors in the two rooms below. In a subsequent proceeding by the landlord against the tenant to recover for the damage to the parquet floors resulting from the leak, liability would most likely be imposed upon\n\nA. the landlord, because he was under an implied obligation to keep the premises in a habitable condition.\nB. the landlord, because he was under an affirmative obligation to deliver the premises in a reasonable state of repair.\nC. the landlord, because of the contractual obligation under the lease to make all necessary repairs during the term of the lease.\nD. the tenant, because a tenant for years is obligated to make such ordinary repairs on the leased property.\n"

However, given the information provided, the most likely answer is:\n\nC. the landlord, because of the contractual obligation under the lease to make all necessary repairs during the term of the lease.\n\nThis is assuming that the lease includes a clause requiring the landlord to maintain the structural integrity of the property, which typically includes the roof. The fact that the damage was caused by a failure to maintain the roof, which is generally considered part of the landlord's responsibilities, would support this answer.\n\nHowever, if the lease specifically states that the tenant is responsible for maintaining the roof or making repairs, then the answer could be:\n\nD. the tenant, because a tenant for years is obligated to make such ordinary repairs on the leased property.\n\nIn this case, the tenant would be liable for not addressing the issue when they first noticed the leak and allowing further damage to occur. It's important to note that even without such a clause, tenants may still have some responsibility to mitigate damages once they become aware of them. If the tenant failed to take reasonable steps to prevent further damage (e.g., placing buckets to catch water or covering the area with a tarp), they might also be partially liable."
