In their book \"The Coddling of the American Mind,\" Lukianoff and Haidt argue that trigger warnings can contribute to a culture of vindictive protectiveness, which they define as \"an unhealthy campus climate in which students are encouraged to take offense at anything that might cause discomfort or distress.\" They suggest that institutions of higher education should discourage the use of trigger warnings and instead encourage students to engage with challenging ideas and perspectives."
