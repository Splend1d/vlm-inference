I would work without a net and without the noise of the crowd to disturb me. The view from on high is dizzying, instructive. I do not record the world exactly as it comes to me but transform it by making it pass through a prism of fabulous stories I have collected on the way. I gather stories the way a lepidopterist hoards his chloroformed specimens of rare moths, or Costa Rican beetles. Stories are like vessels I use to interpret the world to myself. ----------Pat Conroy Which of the following best describes the organization of the passage?\n\nA. The author provides several explanations for taking a certain course of action.\nB. The author uses analogies to explain his experience of a particular action.\nC. The author makes a comparison between his own experiences and that of others in his profession.\nD. The author chronicles the various phases of his work in a particular discipline.\n"

The author uses analogies to explain his experience of a particular action.\n\nThe passage is organized around the author's explanation of his writing process and how he transforms his experiences into stories. He uses analogies, such as comparing himself to a lepidopterist collecting rare insects, to describe his approach to gathering and interpreting stories. There is no clear chronology or comparison to others in his profession, nor does he provide multiple explanations for taking a specific course of action."
