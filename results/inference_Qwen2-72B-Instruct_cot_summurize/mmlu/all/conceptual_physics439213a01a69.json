According to Einstein's theory of relativity, time appears to move slower for an object in motion compared to one at rest when observed from the perspective of the stationary object. This effect becomes more pronounced as the object approaches the speed of light. Therefore, time does not compress but rather stretches or dilates with increased speed."
