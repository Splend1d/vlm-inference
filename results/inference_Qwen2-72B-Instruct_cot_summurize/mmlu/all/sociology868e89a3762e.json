All of the above.\n\nCultural restructuring is a broad term that refers to the process by which a society's cultural landscape is transformed, often in response to economic, social, or political changes. It can involve various strategies to revitalize urban areas, rebrand regions, and create new economic opportunities based on culture and creativity. This can include regenerating cities in economic decline (option A), converting former industrial sites into tourist attractions (option B), and using media advertising to sell the symbolic value of places and cultural products (option C). Thus, all three options are correct as they represent different facets of cultural restructuring."
