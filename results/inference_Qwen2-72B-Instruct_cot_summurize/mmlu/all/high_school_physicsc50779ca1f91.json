The net charge has not changed.\n\nIn an ideal circuit with a battery and a light bulb, when the circuit is closed, electrons flow from the negative terminal of the battery through the circuit and to the positive terminal. This flow of electrons (current) allows the light bulb to light up. However, this does not change the net charge of the circuit as a whole because what you have is simply a redistribution of charges. The same amount of charge that leaves the negative terminal arrives at the positive terminal, so there is no net gain or loss of charge in the circuit. Conservation of charge is a fundamental principle in physics, stating that the total electric charge in a closed system remains constant, regardless of changes within the system."
