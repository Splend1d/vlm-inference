If IGOs only identify states that already support human rights, they are not actively working to improve or enforce human rights in countries where abuses occur.\n\nB. A lack of information about potential or actual human rights abuses by leaders can limit an IGO's ability to address these issues effectively.\n\nC. If IGOs have little ability to constrain abusive leaders, their effectiveness in promoting human rights is significantly reduced, as they may lack the power to enforce compliance with human rights standards."
