Mercury is the only metal that remains in a liquid state at standard conditions for temperature and pressure (i.e., room temperature and 1 atmosphere of pressure). It has a melting point of -38.83 \u00b0C and a boiling point of 356.73 \u00b0C, allowing it to exist as a liquid under normal conditions."
