The term \"anatomically modern\" refers to physical characteristics that are similar to those of present-day humans, including brain size and complexity. These individuals, who lived up to 50,000 years ago, had cognitive abilities that allowed them to create art, use complex tools, and engage in symbolic behavior, which suggests they thought like us."
