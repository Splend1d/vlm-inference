                    "text": "To find the probability that a randomly chosen resistor from this shipment has a resistance greater than 188 ohms given it's already known to be less than 194 ohms, we can use properties of the normal distribution and conditional probability.\n\nFirst, let's find the z-scores for 194 ohms and 188 ohms:\n\n- The z-score for 194 ohms: \\((194 - 200) / 5 = -6 / 5 = -1.2\\)\n- The z-score for 188 ohms: \\((188 - 200) / 5 = -12 / 5 = -2.4\\)\n\nUsing a standard normal table or calculator, we can find the cumulative probabilities associated with these z-scores:\n\n- For \\(z = -1.2\\), the cumulative probability is approximately 0.1151 (or 11.51%).\n- For \\(z = -2.4\\), the cumulative probability is approximately 0.0082 (or 0.82%).\n\nThe probability that a resistor has a resistance less than 194 ohms is about 0.1151, and the probability that it has a resistance less than 188 ohms is about 0.0082. We want the probability that the resistance is between 188 and 194 ohms, which is the difference between these two probabilities:\n\n\\[P(188 < X < 194) = P(X < 194) - P(X < 188) = 0.1151 - 0.0082 = 0.1069\\]\n\nHowever, the question asks for the probability that the resistance is greater than 188 ohms given it's less than 194 ohms. This is a conditional probability, which we can calculate using the formula:\n\n\\[P(A|B) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)}\\]\n\nIn this case, event A is \"resistance greater than 188 ohms\" and event B is \"resistance less than 194 ohms\". So,\n\n\\[P(\\text{resistance} > 188 | \\text{resistance} < 194) = \\frac{P(188 < X < 194)}{P(X < 194)} = \\frac{0.1069}{0.1151}\\]\n\n\\[= 0.9287\\]\n\nRounding to the nearest tenth gives us 0.93.\n\nThus, the correct answer is **D. 0.93**."
