Punishments are used with nonhuman animals, and negative reinforcements are used with humans.\nB. Negative reinforcements are used in classical conditioning, and punishments are used in operant conditioning.\nC. Punishments are primarily used when training an organism to perform a behavior and negative reinforcements are used to train an organism to stop performing a behavior.\nD. Punishments decrease the frequency of a behavior and negative reinforcements increase the frequency of a behavior.\n"

Punishment, on the other hand, involves either presenting an aversive stimulus or removing a desirable one to decrease the likelihood of a behavior being repeated."
