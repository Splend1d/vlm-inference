Americans consumed more than they produced.\n\nA trade deficit occurs when a country imports more goods and services than it exports, which implies that consumption exceeds production within the country. This does not necessarily mean that the government spent more than it took in (option C), nor does it imply that net exports were positive (option A). Additionally, while a trade deficit can be financed by capital inflows, option D specifically states that capital flowed out, which is incorrect in this context."
