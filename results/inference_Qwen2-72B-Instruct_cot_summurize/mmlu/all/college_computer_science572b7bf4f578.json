For a pipeline, it's essentially the inverse of the clock cycle duration if we assume no stalls or other delays.\n- M-5 has a clock cycle of 10 ns for a 5-stage pipeline, which means it can complete an instruction every 10 ns under ideal conditions. This gives a throughput of 1 instruction per 10 ns.\n- M-7 has a clock cycle of 7.5 ns for a 7-stage pipeline, meaning it can complete an instruction every 7.5 ns under ideal conditions. This gives a throughput of 1 instruction per 7.5 ns.\n- Therefore, **M-7 has a higher maximum throughput than M-5**, making Statement I true.\n\n### Statement II: The latency of a single instruction is shorter on M-7\u2019s pipeline than on M-5\u2019s pipeline.\n\n**Analysis:**\n- Latency refers to the total time taken from the start of the first stage of a single instruction until its completion.\n- M-5's pipeline latency would be 5 stages * 10 ns = 50 ns.\n- M-7's pipeline latency would be 7 stages * 7.5 ns = 52.5 ns.\n- Therefore, **the latency of a single instruction is actually longer on M-7\u2019s pipeline than on M-5\u2019s pipeline**, making Statement II false.\n\n### Statement III: Programs executing on M-7 will always run faster than programs executing on M-5.\n\n**Analysis:**\n- While M-7 has a higher throughput, the actual running time of programs depends not only on throughput but also on the number of instructions in the program, the efficiency of the instruction set, pipeline stalls, and other factors.\n- Without information on these additional factors, we cannot conclude that programs will always run faster on M-7. A more complex program with many dependencies might actually run slower due to increased pipeline stalls.\n- Therefore, **Statement III cannot be assumed to be true without further information**.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nA. I only\n\nThis choice correctly identifies that M-7 has better maximum throughput than M-5, while statements II and III are either false or cannot be conclusively determined based on the given information."
