This process is known as chemosynthesis and allows these bacteria to synthesize organic compounds from carbon dioxide and water using the energy released from the oxidation of inorganic molecules like hydrogen sulfide (H2S), ammonia (NH3), or elemental hydrogen (H2). This is in contrast to photosynthetic organisms that use light energy to synthesize organic compounds through photosynthesis."
