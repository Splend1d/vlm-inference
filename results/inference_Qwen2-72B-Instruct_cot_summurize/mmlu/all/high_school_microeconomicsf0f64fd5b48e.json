                    "text": "The burden of an excise tax placed on a producer (which can be passed on to consumers) depends on the elasticity of both the demand and supply curves. The more inelastic the demand, the less sensitive quantity demanded is to changes in price, meaning that consumers will pay more of the tax. Similarly, the more elastic the supply, the more responsive quantity supplied is to changes in price, which also means that consumers will pay more of the tax because producers will reduce their supply less in response to the tax.\n\nGiven these conditions, the scenario where consumers would bear the largest burden of the tax would be when demand is relatively inelastic and supply is relatively elastic. This is because with inelastic demand, consumers will continue to buy the product even if the price increases due to the tax, and with elastic supply, producers will not significantly reduce production in response to the higher cost (due to the tax), instead choosing to pass on the cost to consumers.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. If the demand curve is price inelastic and the supply curve is price elastic\n\nThis scenario would lead to consumers paying the largest portion of the excise tax."
