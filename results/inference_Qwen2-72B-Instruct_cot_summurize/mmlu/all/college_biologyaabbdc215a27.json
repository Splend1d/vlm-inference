This is known as anchorage dependence.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that cancer cells can differ from normal cells in other aspects listed:\n\nA. Cancer cells often have the ability to divide indefinitely due to telomerase activity or other mechanisms, whereas most normal cells have a limited number of divisions before they enter senescence.\n\nB. Cancer cells often lose contact inhibition, which is the ability of normal cells to stop dividing when they come into contact with each other. This loss allows cancer cells to form tumors.\n\nD. Cancer cells may proliferate to higher densities than normal cells under certain conditions, depending on factors such as nutrient availability and the specific type of cancer cells."
