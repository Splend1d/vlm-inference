Misusing ambiguity\n\nThe fallacy of amphiboly occurs when a statement has more than one meaning due to its grammatical structure, leading to confusion or misinterpretation. This can be seen as misusing ambiguity, as the ambiguity arises from the sentence's structure rather than the meaning of individual words. The other options listed are not directly related to amphiboly:\n\nB. Reification: This fallacy involves treating an abstract concept as if it were a concrete, real thing.\nC. Figure of speech: This refers to the use of words in a way that deviates from their literal meaning, often for rhetorical or poetic effect.\nD. Special pleading: This fallacy occurs when someone applies a principle or rule to others but makes an unjustified exception for themselves or someone they favor."
