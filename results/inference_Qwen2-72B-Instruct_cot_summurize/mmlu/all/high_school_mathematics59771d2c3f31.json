Among these, {3, 6} are multiples of 3.\n- A 6-sided die has 6 outcomes: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. Among these, {3, 6} are multiples of 3.\n\nFor the product to be a multiple of 3, at least one of the rolls must result in a number that is a multiple of 3.\n\nLet's break down the possibilities:\n\n1. **Juan rolls a multiple of 3 (3 or 6):**  \n   - Probability = $\\frac{2}{8} = \\frac{1}{4}$\n\n   For this case, regardless of what Amal rolls, the product will be a multiple of 3 since Juan's roll already guarantees it. Thus, the probability for this scenario is simply $\\frac{1}{4}$.\n\n2. **Juan does NOT roll a multiple of 3:**  \n   - Probability = $1 - \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\n   In this case, for the product to be a multiple of 3, Amal must roll a 3 or a 6.\n   - Probability of Amal rolling a 3 or 6 = $\\frac{2}{6} = \\frac{1}{3}$\n\n   Therefore, the probability of this happening is $\\frac{3}{4} * \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n\nAdding both scenarios together gives us the total probability that the product is a multiple of 3:\n- Total probability = $\\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{2}$\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **A. $\\frac{1}{2}$**."
