In scenario 1, using drain cleaner to brush one's daughter's teeth is extremely dangerous and could cause severe harm or death. This action shows a disregard for the child's safety and well-being. In scenario 2, having an old dog put down simply because one wants a puppy is also morally reprehensible. It disregards the life and welfare of the old dog, which has likely been a loyal companion, in favor of personal desire for a new pet. Euthanizing an animal should only be considered when the animal is suffering and there are no other humane options available."
