Address Sanitizer is a tool that helps detect memory errors such as buffer overflows, use-after-free, and other memory-related bugs by instrumenting the program's code during compilation. When the instrumented program is run under a fuzzer, ASAN can quickly pinpoint the location and nature of any memory errors that occur, making them much easier to find and fix.\n\nA. is incorrect because a grammar-based fuzzer can still be effective at finding memory errors, especially if the grammar includes constructs that can trigger such errors.\nB. is incorrect because ASAN actually makes errors easier to reproduce by providing detailed information about where and when they occur.\nD. is incorrect because fuzzing can indeed find memory errors, among other issues, by generating and injecting unexpected or invalid inputs into the program being tested."
