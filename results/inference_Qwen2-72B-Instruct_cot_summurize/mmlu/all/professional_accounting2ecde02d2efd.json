Since the individual did not file a tax return, the deadline would be 2 years from when the tax was paid. However, since the question asks for the time period after the taxes were paid, the correct answer in this context would be:\n\nB. Two years.\n\nBut it's important to note that if the individual had filed a return, even if it was late, the 3-year window from the due date of the return would likely apply."
