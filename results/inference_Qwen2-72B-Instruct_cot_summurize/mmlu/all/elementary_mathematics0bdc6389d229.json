This list starts with 167,213 and then goes down to 161,455 before going back up to 17,400 and then down again to 11,633. It's not ordered from least to greatest.\n\nB. This list starts at 10,354, increases to 10,600, then jumps significantly to 104,321 and 106,213. Since each number is greater than the previous one, this list is indeed ordered from least to greatest.\n\nC. This list has 160,233 followed by 171,141, then drops to 11,645 and goes back up to 16,703. It's not consistently increasing, so it's not ordered from least to greatest.\n\nD. This list starts at 12,209, increases to 12,902, but then the next number is 125,466, which is greater than the previous number, but the last number, 125,464, is less than the third number. So, it's not ordered from least to greatest.\n\nTherefore, the only list that is ordered from least to greatest is:\n\n**B. 10,354, 10,600, 104,321, 106,213**"
