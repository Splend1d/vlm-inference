However, if we're talking about which power standing alone might not always support federal law, it would be:\n\nC. necessary and proper power\n\nThe \"necessary and proper\" clause, also known as the elastic clause, grants Congress the authority to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution its enumerated powers. This power is not an independent source of authority but rather a means to execute other enumerated powers. Thus, standing alone, this power could not support a federal law without being tied to another enumerated power.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the other powers you listed can independently support federal law under certain circumstances:\n\nA. Taxing power allows the federal government to levy taxes to raise revenue for the government.\nB. Spending power enables Congress to spend money for the general welfare.\nD. Commerce power gives Congress the authority to regulate interstate and foreign commerce.\n\nEach of these powers can provide a constitutional basis for federal legislation on their own."
