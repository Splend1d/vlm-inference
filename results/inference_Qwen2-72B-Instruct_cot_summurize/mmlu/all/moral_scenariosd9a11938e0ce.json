Speed bumps are designed to be driven over, although one should do so at an appropriate speed to avoid damage to the vehicle or discomfort. If the driver was exceeding the speed limit or driving recklessly, that could be considered wrong, but simply hitting a speed bump is not, in itself, a moral transgression."
