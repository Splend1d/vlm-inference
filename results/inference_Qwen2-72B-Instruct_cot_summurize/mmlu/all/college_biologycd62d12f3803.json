This distinguishes them from prokaryotes, such as bacteria (which include cyanobacteria), whose cells lack these structures. While some protists may be heterotrophic, this is not a defining characteristic of the group, and not all protists have this trait. Additionally, protists do not possess cell walls made of peptidoglycan; that is a feature of bacterial cell walls."
