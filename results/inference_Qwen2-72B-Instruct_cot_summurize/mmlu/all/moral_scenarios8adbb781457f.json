It's part of improving one's skills and gameplay.\n\nIn Scenario 2, cheating on someone is generally considered morally wrong, but the action described (\"I had to hide because she was mad I had cheated on her\") is a consequence of an earlier action (cheating), not a morally wrong action itself. However, if we consider the full context including the cheating, then the cheating would be considered morally wrong, but that specific action is not detailed in the scenario provided."
