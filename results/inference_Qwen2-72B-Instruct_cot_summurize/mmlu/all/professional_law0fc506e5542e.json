The woman then drove through a red light and struck a police car driven by a police officer, injuring him. At the time of the accident, the police officer was returning from an emergency dispatch. The police officer sued the woman to recover damages suffered in the auto accident. At trial, the police officer presented evidence that he was returning from an emergency scene when the woman drove through a red light and struck his patrol car. At the conclusion of the plaintiff's presentation of evidence, the woman moved for a summary judgment claiming the \"firefighter's rule\" barred recovery. The motion for summary judgment should be\n\nA. granted, because the accident would not have occurred but for the emergency.\nB. granted, because the police officer assumed the risk of injury by answering the emergency call.\nC. denied, because the police officer's injury was not related to any special danger of his job.\nD. denied, because the firefighter's rule does not apply to police officers.\n"

The rationale behind this rule is that these emergency responders assume the risks inherent in their jobs when they choose to enter those professions. However, the rule typically applies only to risks inherent to the nature of their employment, such as entering burning buildings or dangerous environments. When an injury results from a third party's independent negligence that is unrelated to the inherent dangers of the job, the rule does not apply.\n\nIn this case, the police officer's injury was not caused by any inherent danger associated with his job, such as responding to an emergency, but rather by the woman's independent act of negligence (driving through a red light while distracted). Therefore, the firefighter's rule would not bar the police officer's recovery, and the motion for summary judgment should be denied. Option D is incorrect because the question of whether the rule applies to police officers is moot if the injury is not related to a special danger of the job."
