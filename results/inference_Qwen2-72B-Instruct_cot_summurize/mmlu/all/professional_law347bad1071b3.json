Following the killings, the police issued an \"all-points-bulletin\" for the arrest of a 40-year-old Caucasian male (height, 6 feet; weight, 150-155 pounds), who had been seen near the location of the bank robbery. On Friday, a security guard at a local department store was walking down Main Street when he noticed a tall, African American man who fit the bank robbery suspect's description in age, height, and weight. The security guard approached the person (and believing him to be the bank robbery suspect), pulled a gun and arrested him. The security guard held the man in custody until the police arrived a short time later. The police officer informed the security guard that he had arrested the wrong person. The man had told the security guard that he was not the man who had committed the bank robbery and shot the police officers. The man was humiliated by the false arrest. If the man asserts a claim for assault against the security guard, he will\n\nA. succeed, if the man saw the security guard pointing the gun at him.\nB. succeed, if the security guard's mistaken belief was unreasonable.\nC. not succeed, because the security guard did not intend to injure the man.\nD. not succeed, because the man did not suffer any injury from the security guard's act.\n"

The security guard's actions in pulling a gun and arresting the individual based on an unreasonable mistaken belief that he was the bank robbery suspect could constitute assault if the man reasonably feared imminent harm. The fact that the man did not suffer physical injury does not preclude an assault claim, as the crime of assault does not require actual physical contact. Additionally, the security guard's intent to injure is not relevant to an assault claim, only the intent to create a situation where the victim would fear imminent harm."
