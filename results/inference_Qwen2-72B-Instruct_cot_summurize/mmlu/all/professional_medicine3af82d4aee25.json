Middle ear effusion\n\nThis could represent a collection of fluid, pus, or granulation tissue due to chronic inflammation from repeated infections. It's important to note that this finding should be further evaluated by an otolaryngologist (ear, nose, and throat specialist) to determine if additional treatment, such as tympanostomy tubes, is necessary."
