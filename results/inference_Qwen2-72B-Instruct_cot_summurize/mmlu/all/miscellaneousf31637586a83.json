Correct toothbrushing technique\n\nThis topic is developmentally appropriate for toddlers because it's important to start teaching them good oral hygiene habits early on, which includes learning how to brush their teeth properly. At around age 2 or 3, toddlers can begin to learn how to hold a toothbrush and imitate brushing motions, although they will need assistance from an adult until they are more capable, typically around age 6 or 7.\n\nA. Growth of permanent teeth - This topic is not appropriate for toddlers since their permanent teeth don't start coming in until around age 6.\nB. Correct use of incisors while eating - While toddlers may be learning to use their incisors to bite and chew food, this is more related to their overall motor skills development than specific dental knowledge.\nD. Evolution of the human tooth - This topic is too complex and not relevant to a toddler's developmental stage."
