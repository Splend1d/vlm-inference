The Mayan king Yax Pahsaj symbolized his royalty on a stele that depicts the founder of the dynasty \u201cpassing him the torch.\u201d This is a common theme in Maya iconography, where rulers are often depicted receiving symbols of power and authority from their ancestors or deities. In this case, the stele likely shows Yax Pahsaj being legitimized as the ruler of his kingdom by the founder of his dynasty."
