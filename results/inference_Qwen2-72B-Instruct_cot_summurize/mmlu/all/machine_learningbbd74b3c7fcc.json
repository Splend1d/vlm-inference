The polynomial degree\n\nThe degree of the polynomial determines the complexity of the model. A low-degree polynomial may not capture the underlying trend in the data well enough, leading to underfitting. Conversely, a high-degree polynomial can fit the training data very closely, including its noise, resulting in overfitting. Therefore, choosing the right degree of the polynomial is crucial for achieving a good balance between bias and variance.\n\nOptions B, C, and D also have an impact on the model but do not directly control the trade-off between underfitting and overfitting as significantly as the choice of polynomial degree does. The learning algorithm (matrix inversion vs. gradient descent) affects computational efficiency and convergence properties but not the model's capacity. The assumed variance of the Gaussian noise can influence regularization techniques but does not change the model's inherent flexibility. The inclusion of a constant term adjusts the intercept of the polynomial but does not affect its overall shape or complexity."
