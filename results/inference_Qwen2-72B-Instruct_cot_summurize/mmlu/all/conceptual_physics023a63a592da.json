This principle states that a body immersed in a fluid (in this case, air) is acted upon by an upward force equal to the weight of the fluid it displaces. A blimp is filled with a gas that is less dense than the surrounding air, causing it to displace more air than it weighs and thus experience an upward buoyant force that allows it to fly."
