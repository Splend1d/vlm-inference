According to the NASP's Principles for Professional Ethics, psychologists should ensure the validity and reliability of assessments they use, and they should not use outdated or culturally biased materials.\n\nGiven these principles, option A is not appropriate because using new norms with an outdated test does not address the potential changes in curriculum or the psychometric properties of the test over time.\n\nOption B is more reasonable as it suggests collecting data from the new form for comparison, which could help in understanding any discrepancies between the old and new forms.\n\nOption C is the most aligned with professional ethics, as it emphasizes the importance of using current, valid, and reliable assessments. However, it may not be practical given the financial constraints mentioned.\n\nOption D might be too extreme, as canceling the assessment altogether could deprive students of important information about their academic standing.\n\nConsidering all options, the best course of action would be to:\n\n- Insist on administering only the most recent form of the test (Option C) if possible, as it aligns with ethical standards.\n- If that is not feasible due to budget constraints, then Option B would be the next best choice, as it allows for some data collection from the new form while still utilizing the older form in a way that can potentially inform future decisions.\n\nIn either case, the school psychologist should document the reasons for the decision and any limitations of the assessment process clearly."
