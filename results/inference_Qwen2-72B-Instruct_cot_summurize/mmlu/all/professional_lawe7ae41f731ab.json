One year later, the buyer cleared a path from her home across the seller's retained land to a road that abuts the western boundary of the seller's land. The seller stood by and watched the buyer clear the path, but made no objection. This path is very convenient to the buyer's use of her land, and the buyer used it daily for several months.

                    "text": "The buyer's best chance of success in having the barrier removed would likely be based on the theory of an easement by implication. This type of easement arises when a piece of land is divided and sold, and at the time of the sale, there is an existing use that is apparent, continuous, and reasonably necessary for the enjoyment of the land being sold. In this case, the buyer has been using the path across the seller's retained land for several months, and the path is readily apparent and necessary for the buyer's access and use of her property. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. the buyer has an easement by implication. This would depend on whether the convenience was sufficiently strong to amount to \"reasonably necessary.\"\n\nAn easement by necessity (option A) typically arises when a parcel of land is completely landlocked and has no access to a public road without crossing another's property. An easement by prescription (option C) requires a long-term, open, and notorious use that is adverse to the owner's rights, typically for a statutory period which varies by jurisdiction. An express easement (option D) would require a written agreement or deed provision granting the easement, which does not appear to be present in this scenario."
