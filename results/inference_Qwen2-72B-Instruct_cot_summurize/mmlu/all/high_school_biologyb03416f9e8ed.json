Hemophilia is a recessive, X-linked trait, and since females with Turner's syndrome have only one X chromosome, they do not have the second X chromosome to potentially carry a normal gene for the clotting factor that is missing in hemophilia. This means that if the single X chromosome carries the mutated gene for hemophilia, the female will express the disease because there is no second X chromosome to provide a functional copy of the gene. However, it should be noted that hemophilia is not a common feature of Turner's syndrome; it was likely included in the question to test understanding of genetics and chromosomal abnormalities."
