It's important to note that ethical perspectives can change over time, and some philosophers might adjust their views based on new information or evolving societal values. Nonetheless, given the information provided and understanding of Baxter's original stance, option D would be the most likely response. \n\nBut if we consider a more nuanced interpretation of Baxter's later views, where he acknowledges the instrumental value of nature for human well-being, then options A and B could also be considered depending on whether the policy would have indirect negative effects on humans through environmental degradation or ecosystem disruption. However, since the question specifies that the policy would not negatively affect human beings, option D remains the most appropriate answer under Baxter's ethical framework."
