In general, gases have higher entropy than solids because gas particles can move more freely and occupy more space. When a reaction results in fewer moles of gas being produced or gases turning into solids, the overall entropy of the system decreases.\n\nLet's look at each option:\n\nA. C(s) + CO2(g) \u2192 2 CO(g)\nThis reaction produces more moles of gas (2 moles of CO from 1 mole of CO2), so it would likely result in an increase in entropy.\n\nB. 2 Na(s) + O2(g) \u2192 Na2O2(s)\nIn this reaction, one mole of gas (O2) is consumed and no gases are produced, resulting in a solid product (Na2O2). This reaction will have a significant decrease in entropy due to the reduction in the number of gas molecules.\n\nC. CH4(g) + 2 O2(g) \u2192 CO2(g) + 2 H2O(g)\nThis reaction starts with three moles of gas and ends with three moles of gas, so there is no net change in the number of moles of gas, and thus the change in entropy would be less significant compared to reaction B.\n\nD. 2 NI3(s) \u2192 3 I2(s) + N2(g)\nAlthough this reaction produces a gas, it also results in the formation of additional moles of solid, but since the question focuses on the greatest decrease in entropy, the production of a gas molecule does not contribute to a decrease in entropy as significantly as the conversion of a gas to a solid in reaction B.\n\nTherefore, the reaction with the greatest decrease in entropy is B. 2 Na(s) + O2(g) \u2192 Na2O2(s)."
