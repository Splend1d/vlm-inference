It is surrounded by mountains and can be approached from one side only; it has no crops, trees, or water, but has reservoirs in which rainwater is collected. The Arabs often cut off the inhabitants from their supply of drinking-water until the they buy them off with money and pieces of cloth. It is an exceedingly hot place. It is the port of the Indians, and to it come large vessels from Kinbayat [Cambay], Kawlam [Quilon], Calicut and many other Malabar ports [on the south-west coast of India]. There are Indian merchants living there, as well as Egyptian merchants. Its inhabitants are all either merchants, porters, or fishermen. Some of the merchants are immensely rich, so rich that sometimes a single merchant is sole owner of a large ship with all it contains, and this is a subject of ostentation and rivalry amongst them. In spite of that they are pious, humble, upright, and generous in character, treat strangers well, give liberally to devotees, and pay in full the tithes due to God.\"\nIbn Battuta, ca. 1325\u20131354 C.E.\nIbn Battuta's experiences were LEAST similar to the experiences of which of the following?\n\nA. Zheng He\nB. Marco Polo\nC. Lorenzo de Medici\nD. Xuanzang\n"

This is because Lorenzo de Medici was not a traveler or explorer like the others mentioned. He was a powerful Italian banker and de facto ruler of Florence during the Renaissance, known for his patronage of the arts rather than for extensive travels or exploration.\n\nIn contrast:\n- Zheng He was a Chinese explorer who led several expeditions across the Indian Ocean and beyond during the Ming Dynasty.\n- Marco Polo was a Venetian merchant traveler whose travels are documented in \"The Travels of Marco Polo,\" where he describes his journey through Asia along the Silk Road.\n- Xuanzang was a Chinese Buddhist monk, scholar, traveler, and translator who journeyed to India to study Buddhism and bring back sacred texts.\n\nAll three of these individuals\u2014Zheng He, Marco Polo, and Xuanzang\u2014had experiences more akin to Ibn Battuta's extensive travels and encounters with diverse cultures and peoples."
