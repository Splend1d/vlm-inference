The vegetal pole undergoes cleavage more readily than does the animal pole.\n\nIn fact, it is often the opposite - the animal pole (which contains the fertilization cone and is generally more concentrated with cytoplasmic determinants and free of large amounts of yolk) tends to cleave more rapidly and symmetrically compared to the vegetal pole, which may have more yolk and undergo slower, more asymmetric divisions. However, the specifics can vary depending on the type of egg and the organism. For example, in amphibians like Xenopus, the animal pole does cleave faster initially, but later stages can involve more complex patterns of cleavage that might not follow this general rule strictly."
