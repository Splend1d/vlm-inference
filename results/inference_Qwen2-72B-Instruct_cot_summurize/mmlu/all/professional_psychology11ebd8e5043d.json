High levels of conflict can lead to increased stress and emotional difficulties for children, while lower levels of conflict can help facilitate a smoother transition. While other factors like the quality of parent-child relationships and contact with the noncustodial parent are also important, the degree of post-divorce conflict is often cited as the most critical factor in children's adjustment to divorce."
