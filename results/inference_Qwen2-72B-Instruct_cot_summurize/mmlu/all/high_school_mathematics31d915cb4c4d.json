                    "text": "The Mean Value Theorem (MVT) states that if a function is continuous on the closed interval [a, b] and differentiable on the open interval (a, b), then there exists at least one point c in the interval (a, b) such that the derivative of the function at c is equal to the average rate of change of the function over the interval [a, b]. In other words, there exists at least one c in (a, b) such that:\n\n\\[f'(c) = \\frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b-a}\\]\n\nGiven the function \\(f(x) = 2\\sin(x) + \\sin(4x)\\) on the interval \\([0,\\pi]\\), we need to find the number of points where this condition is satisfied.\n\nFirst, check if the function is continuous and differentiable on the given interval. Since sine functions are continuous and differentiable everywhere, \\(f(x) = 2\\sin(x) + \\sin(4x)\\) is also continuous and differentiable on \\([0,\\pi]\\).\n\nNext, calculate the average rate of change of the function over the interval \\([0,\\pi]\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nf(\\pi) &= 2\\sin(\\pi) + \\sin(4\\pi) = 0 \\\\\nf(0) &= 2\\sin(0) + \\sin(0) = 0 \\\\\n\\text{Average rate of change} &= \\frac{f(\\pi) - f(0)}{\\pi-0} = \\frac{0-0}{\\pi} = 0\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nNow, differentiate the function to find \\(f'(x)\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nf'(x) &= 2\\cos(x) + 4\\cos(4x)\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nWe need to find the values of \\(x\\) in the interval \\((0,\\pi)\\) for which \\(f'(x) = 0\\). So,\n\n\\[\n2\\cos(x) + 4\\cos(4x) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis equation can be quite tricky to solve analytically due to the presence of both \\(\\cos(x)\\) and \\(\\cos(4x)\\). However, we can look for the number of solutions within the interval \\([0,\\pi]\\) using graphical or numerical methods. \n\nTo understand the number of solutions without solving it explicitly, consider the properties of cosine:\n1. \\(\\cos(x)\\) has a period of \\(2\\pi\\), while \\(\\cos(4x)\\) has a period of \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\).\n2. Both \\(\\cos(x)\\) and \\(\\cos(4x)\\) oscillate between \\(-1\\) and \\(1\\).\n3. Within the interval \\([0,\\pi]\\), \\(\\cos(x)\\) goes from 1 to -1 once, while \\(\\cos(4x)\\) completes two full cycles from 1 to -1 and back to 1.\n\nGiven these properties, we can infer that there will be multiple points where the derivative equals zero because the frequency of \\(\\cos(4x)\\) is higher than that of \\(\\cos(x)\\). However, finding the exact number requires solving the equation or analyzing the behavior of the function's derivative graphically or numerically.\n\nWithout detailed calculation, it's clear that the answer must be more than 1 since \\(\\cos(4x)\\) alone has at least 4 points where its derivative is zero within \\([0,\\pi]\\), not considering the influence of \\(\\cos(x)\\). Therefore, the correct answer cannot be A (1).\n\nGiven the options and the complexity of solving the equation directly, the best approach here is to eliminate options based on the understanding of the functions involved. Given that \\(\\cos(4x)\\) has 4 cycles within \\([0,\\pi]\\) and considering the interaction with \\(2\\cos(x)\\), it's reasonable to expect more than 2 but less than 5 points where \\(f'(x) = 0\\) given the interval size and the nature of trigonometric functions.\n\nThus, the most reasonable choice based on the given options and the analysis would be:\n\nC. 3\n\nHowever, without solving the equation explicitly or performing a detailed graphical analysis, this answer is an inference based on the properties of the functions involved."
