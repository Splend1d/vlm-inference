The Acheulean hand axe, associated with Homo erectus, showed a marked improvement over earlier Oldowan tools. These hand axes were more symmetrical, had a distinct shape (often teardrop-shaped), and demonstrated a greater level of craftsmanship and planning in their production. Over time, these tools became more refined and standardized, indicating that the technology was indeed improving."
