This can include aspects such as composition, color scheme, line, shape, texture, and form, all working together to create a cohesive whole. While the other options (social meaning, faithful representation, and the power to evoke strong emotions) are significant aspects of art, they are not strictly formal characteristics. They involve content, intent, and effect, rather than the structure and form of the artwork itself."
