The flu virus, which changes its envelope proteins\n\nThis process, known as antigenic drift or shift in the case of influenza viruses, allows the virus to change its surface antigens, specifically hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), thus evading recognition by antibodies produced during previous infections or vaccinations. This is why new flu vaccines are needed every year, as the circulating strains often have different antigenic properties."
