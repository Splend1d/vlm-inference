In the context of chromatin structure, DNase can cleave the linker DNA that connects two nucleosome cores in a nucleosome dimer, thus separating them into monomers. This process does not directly target the histones (options A, B, or C), but rather the DNA that is wrapped around them and the linker DNA between nucleosomes."
