The farmer then gave a co-workera mortgage on the olive grove to secure a loanfrom the co-worker to the farmer in the amount of$120,000. The farmer then gave an investor a mortgage on the olive grove to secure a loan from the investor to the farmer in the amount of $110,000. The co-worker then records. The investor then records. Thereafter, the friend records. In a foreclosure proceeding where the friend, the co-worker, and the investor were parties, the olive grove sold for $220,000.

However, in this case, all three parties have mortgages on the same property (the olive grove), and the issue is determining the priority of those mortgages.\n\nThe friend's mortgage was given first, followed by the co-worker's, and then the investor's. The recording order was: co-worker, investor, and finally friend. Since the friend's interest was not recorded until after both the co-worker and the investor had recorded their interests, the friend's unrecorded interest would be void against the co-worker and the investor, assuming they were both purchasers in good faith for valuable consideration.\n\nHowever, since the co-worker recorded before the investor, the co-worker's mortgage has priority over the investor's. The friend's interest, being unrecorded until last, would be subordinate to both the co-worker's and the investor's interests.\n\nGiven the sale price of $220,000:\n\n1. The co-worker's mortgage for $120,000 is satisfied first.\n2. That leaves $100,000 ($220,000 - $120,000) for the investor's mortgage.\n3. The investor's mortgage is for $110,000, but only $100,000 remains after the co-worker's mortgage is satisfied.\n4. Therefore, the investor will receive $100,000, which is the remaining balance after the co-worker's mortgage is paid off.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\nC. $100,000.00"
