Asthma is characterized by airway inflammation and hyperresponsiveness, which can cause variability in peak flow readings due to changes in airway caliber. This variability can be assessed using a peak flow meter, which measures the maximum speed of expiration. In patients with asthma, peak flow readings may vary significantly from day to day or even within the same day, reflecting the episodic nature of the disease. Monitoring peak flow can help in the diagnosis, management, and assessment of asthma control."
