Therefore, the correct answer cannot be C (that they should be accepted) or D (that they follow common sense). \n\nOption A (that they are incompatible with the right to retaliation) does not accurately represent Reiman's critique of van den Haag's arguments. Reiman does not argue that van den Haag's arguments are incompatible with the right to retaliation; rather, he argues that they fail to provide a convincing justification for the death penalty.\n\nOption B (that they prove that torture is morally impermissible) is also not an accurate representation of Reiman's critique of van den Haag's arguments. While Reiman does argue that some of van den Haag's arguments could potentially justify other forms of punishment that are widely considered to be cruel and unusual, such as torture, this is not the main focus of his critique.\n\nTherefore, none of the options provided is entirely accurate. However, if forced to choose, the closest answer would be D (that they follow common sense), but this is not a correct statement according to Reiman's critique. Reiman argues that van den Haag's arguments are not based on sound reasoning and do not follow common sense."
