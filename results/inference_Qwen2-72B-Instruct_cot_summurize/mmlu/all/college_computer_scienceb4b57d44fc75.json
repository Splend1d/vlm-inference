G has a vertex with no incoming edge.\nThis statement must be true. In a DAG, there must exist at least one vertex with no incoming edges, also known as a source. This is because if every vertex had an incoming edge, then there would have to be a cycle somewhere in the graph (since each vertex's incoming edge would have to come from another vertex), contradicting the fact that the graph is acyclic.\n\nII. G has a vertex with no outgoing edge.\nThis statement does not necessarily have to be true. It is possible for a DAG to have all vertices with at least one outgoing edge. However, it is also possible for a DAG to have vertices with no outgoing edges, especially if we consider graphs where some vertices are \"sinks\" that terminate paths without sending them further.\n\nIII. G has an isolated vertex, that is, one with neither an incoming edge nor an outgoing edge.\nThis statement does not necessarily have to be true. An isolated vertex would be one that has neither incoming nor outgoing edges, but this is not required for a graph to be a DAG. All vertices could either have only incoming edges, only outgoing edges, or both.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. I only"
