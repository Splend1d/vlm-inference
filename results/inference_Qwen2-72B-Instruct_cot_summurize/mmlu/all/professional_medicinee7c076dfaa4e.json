He has had recurrent cervical lymphadenitis and pneumonia since infancy. Two years ago, a culture from an abscess in the cervical region grew Staphylococcus aureus. His temperature is 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F). Examination shows a tender, erythematous, edematous left ankle; there is point tenderness over the medial malleolus. A bone scan shows increased uptake in the left lower tibial metaphysis. Culture of bone aspirate grows Serratia marcescens. Nitroblue tetrazolium test shows no color change. Which of the following is the most likely mechanism for these findings?\n\nA. Developmental arrest of maturation of B lymphocytes\nB. Dysmorphogenesis of the third and fourth pharyngeal pouches\nC. Impaired chemotaxis\nD. Impaired phagocytic oxidative metabolism\n"

The patient's history of recurrent infections and the positive culture for Serratia marcescens, along with the negative nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) test, suggest a diagnosis of chronic granulomatous disease (CGD). CGD is a primary immunodeficiency characterized by recurrent bacterial and fungal infections due to impaired phagocytic oxidative metabolism in neutrophils, which leads to reduced ability to kill certain bacteria and fungi."
