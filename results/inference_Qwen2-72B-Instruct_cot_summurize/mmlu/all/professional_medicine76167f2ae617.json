The partial collapse of the left lung indicates a pneumothorax component, while the presence of blood suggests a hemothorax. However, since the mediastinum is still in the midline, this rules out a tension pneumothorax, which would typically cause mediastinal shift due to the pressure from the trapped air.\n\nGiven these findings, the most likely diagnosis is:\n\nA. Hemopneumothorax, not under tension\n\nThis condition involves both air and blood in the pleural space without the severe pressure changes associated with a tension pneumothorax. The elevated stomach bubble could be secondary to the trauma or due to the positioning of the patient, but it does not directly contribute to the primary diagnosis. Immediate treatment would involve chest tube insertion to evacuate the air and blood, allowing the lung to re-expand."
