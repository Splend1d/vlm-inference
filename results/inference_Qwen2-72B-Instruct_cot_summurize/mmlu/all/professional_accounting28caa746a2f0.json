                    "text": "When a shareholder contributes property to a corporation in exchange for stock, under IRC Section 351, generally no gain or loss is recognized by the shareholder on the transfer. However, there is an exception for liabilities assumed by the corporation.\n\nIn this case, the shareholder contributes equipment with a fair market value (FMV) of $20,000 and a basis of $6,000, subject to a $12,000 liability. The corporation takes over the liability, which is considered boot received by the shareholder. The shareholder must recognize gain to the extent of the liability relief, but only up to the excess of the FMV of the property over the shareholder's adjusted basis in the property.\n\nFirst, we calculate the potential gain as the difference between the FMV and the basis:\n\\[ \\text{Potential Gain} = \\text{FMV} - \\text{Basis} = \\$20,000 - \\$6,000 = \\$14,000 \\]\n\nNext, we compare the potential gain to the liability relief ($12,000). Since the potential gain (\\$14,000) is greater than the liability relief (\\$12,000), the shareholder will recognize gain equal to the liability relief, which is $12,000.\n\nHowever, since the question seems to be asking for the gain \"if any,\" without specifying that the calculation should consider the assumption of the liability as taxable income, the answer could be interpreted differently based on how strictly one adheres to the question's wording. Given the context provided, the correct answer considering the assumption of liability as a form of gain would be:\n\nD. $12,000"
