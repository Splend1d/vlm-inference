It seems there may have been an error in the options provided or in the question itself. Given the calculations based on the information you've provided, none of the options A through D are correct. The closest option to our calculation is not listed.\n\nBut if we strictly follow the question and consider only the costs directly associated with the building (i.e., excluding the land cost), then the total would be:\n\nCost of razing old building = $60,000\nArchitect's fees = $95,000\nNew building construction cost = $1,850,000\n\nTotal = $60,000 + $95,000 + $1,850,000 = $2,005,000\n\nSo, under this interpretation, the answer would be:\n\nA. $2,005,000"
