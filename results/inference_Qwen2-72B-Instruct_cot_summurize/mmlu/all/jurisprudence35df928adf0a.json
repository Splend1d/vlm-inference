Rousseau\n\nJean-Jacques Rousseau, in his work \"The Social Contract,\" argues that the social contract is not a historical fact but a hypothetical construction of reason. He posits that in order to escape the state of nature and its inherent problems, individuals would have agreed to an implicit social contract, surrendering some of their freedoms and rights to a collective body or sovereign. However, he clarifies that this agreement is a theoretical construct rather than an actual historical event."
