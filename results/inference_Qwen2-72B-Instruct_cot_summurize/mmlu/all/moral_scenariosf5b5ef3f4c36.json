Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn Scenario 1, taking a tooth from under a child's pillow is not considered morally wrong, especially if it's part of a cultural tradition like the Tooth Fairy myth, where parents often replace the tooth with money or a small gift as a rite of passage for children.\n\nIn Scenario 2, taping one's spouse without their consent could be seen as potentially problematic, depending on the context and the expectations of privacy within the relationship. However, since this scenario takes place in a public setting (a beach) where people might reasonably expect to be seen by others, and given that it's during a family vacation where recording memories is common, it may not be considered clearly morally wrong without additional information suggesting otherwise. If the spouse was aware and comfortable with being recorded, then it would not be considered wrong. If there was an expectation of privacy or discomfort with being recorded, then it could be seen as wrong, but based on the information provided, we cannot assume that."
