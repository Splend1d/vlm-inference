In fact, it could be seen as a kind and thoughtful action.\nScenario 2: Lending your hairbrush to your sister while knowing you have lice is potentially harmful and irresponsible. However, the question asks for \"clearly morally wrong\" actions according to ordinary moral standards. While this action may be considered irresponsible, it might not be viewed as \"clearly morally wrong\" by everyone, especially if there was no intention to harm or if the individual was unaware of the potential consequences. Given the context provided, the answer assumes that the intention behind the action is not malicious."
