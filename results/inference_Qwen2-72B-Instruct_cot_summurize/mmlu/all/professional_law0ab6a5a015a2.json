The president of a development company is interested in purchasing three of the four parcels. The president buys the three parcels from the farmer and begins formulating plans for constructing single-family dwelling units on the land. The original deed between the farmer and the development company contains a provision expressly binding \"upon all subsequent grantees, their heirs, and assigns,\" stipulating that any further subdivisions by any such persons shall be restricted to minimum two-acre lots to be used for single- family dwelling units only. The development company immediately subdivided two of the parcels into lots of three, four, and five acres, and began construction of homes thereon. The original deed restrictions were enumerated within the special warranty deeds and were given to the purchasers of the homes in the new development, called phase 1. Two years later, the president sold the remaining parcel, which had not been included in the phase 1 subdivision plan, to a contractor. The contractor, in turn, drafted a subdivision plan for the last 250-acre parcel, dividing it into one-acre lots. The contractor then commenced construction of single-family dwelling units in the new development, to be known as phase 2. There was no mention of the restriction for two-acre minimum lots in the deeds to the purchasers of the new homes in phase 2. Meanwhile, after the farmer's death, his estate isrequired to sell the remaining 250-acre parcel of his farmland. The buyer is an investor, who proposes to construct a two-level shopping center and parking lot on the property. The area surrounding phase 1 and phase 2 was rezoned for commercial and industrial uses in 2010. The investor's shopping center has grown to include 150 stores. Now, one of the lot owners in phase 1 contracts to sell his property to two physicians who plan to start a suburban medical practice. In an action by the homeowners in phase 1 to prevent such commercial use by the physicians, the court will most likely hold that\n\nA. the restrictions are still enforceable, thus preventing such commercial use.\nB. the restrictions would no longer be enforceable, because the offering of personal services (i. e. , medical) would be a conforming use.\nC. the restrictions would no longer be enforceable, because of the change in the character of the neighborhood.\nD. the restrictions would no longer be enforceable, because the opening of a physician's office in a private home would not be construed as a commercial enterprise.\n"

However, since the area has been rezoned for commercial and industrial uses, and a large shopping center has been constructed nearby, the character of the neighborhood has changed significantly. This change may have rendered the original restrictions obsolete or unenforceable due to the principle of changed conditions, which allows courts to modify or terminate restrictive covenants when circumstances have so fundamentally altered that enforcement would no longer serve its original purpose.\n\nAdditionally, the fact that the contractor who purchased the third parcel subdivided it into one-acre lots and built homes without enforcing the two-acre minimum restriction could also weaken the enforceability of the restrictions. This could be seen as a breach of the covenant, potentially leading to the argument that the restrictions have been abandoned or waived.\n\nTherefore, the court may determine that the restrictions are no longer enforceable, allowing the physicians to convert the home into a medical practice, which could be considered a conforming use given the rezoning and the presence of commercial activities in the vicinity."
