                    "text": "To determine the H+ concentration in a 1.0 M phenol solution, we can use the acid dissociation constant (Ka) expression for the dissociation of phenol (C6H5OH). The dissociation reaction is:\n\n\\[ \\text{C}_6\\text{H}_5\\text{OH} (aq) \\rightleftharpoons \\text{C}_6\\text{H}_5\\text{O}^- (aq) + \\text{H}^+ (aq) \\]\n\nThe Ka expression for this reaction is:\n\n\\[ K_a = \\frac{[\\text{C}_6\\text{H}_5\\text{O}^-][\\text{H}^+]}{[\\text{C}_6\\text{H}_5\\text{OH}]} \\]\n\nGiven that the initial concentration of phenol is 1.0 M and assuming x is the change in concentrations due to the dissociation, we have:\n\n- The equilibrium concentration of C6H5OH is (1.0 - x) M.\n- The equilibrium concentration of C6H5O^- is x M.\n- The equilibrium concentration of H+ is x M.\n\nSubstituting these into the Ka expression gives:\n\n\\[ 1 \\times 10^{-10} = \\frac{x \\cdot x}{(1.0 - x)} \\]\n\nSince x is very small compared to 1.0 M (because Ka is very small), we can approximate (1.0 - x) as 1.0. This simplifies our equation to:\n\n\\[ 1 \\times 10^{-10} = \\frac{x^2}{1.0} \\]\n\nSolving for x gives:\n\n\\[ x^2 = 1 \\times 10^{-10} \\]\n\n\\[ x = \\sqrt{1 \\times 10^{-10}} \\]\n\n\\[ x = 1 \\times 10^{-5} \\]\n\nThus, the H+ concentration in the 1.0 M phenol solution is approximately 1 \u00d7 10^-5 M. So, the correct answer is:\n\nD. 1 \u00d7 10^-5 M"
