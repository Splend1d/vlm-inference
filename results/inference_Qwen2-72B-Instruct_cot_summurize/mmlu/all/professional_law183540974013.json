Under the proposal, the postal service would be established as a separate state agency under the direction of a postmaster general. The postal service would be responsible for the overnight or express delivery of official governmental mailings within the state. The bill further provides that all state government employees may utilize the overnight postal service at no charge for sending mailings to persons or corporations within the state. Assume that no other state has established such a postal service to date. Moreover, assume there is uncontradicted evidence that the establishment of such an independent state postal service will diminish the revenues of the U. S. Postal Service. Which of the following, if established, is the strongest argument in support of the proposed legislation?\n\nA. Under the Tenth Amendment, a state has exclusive authority to regulate transactions that are wholly intrastate.\nB. Since the proposed bill is not inconsistent with congressional postal power, it is valid under the supremacy clause.\nC. State employees may be exempt from paying for mailing charges under intergovernmental immunity provided Congress has enacted a similar exemption for federal governmental employees.\nD. There is a legitimate state interest in ensuring that governmental mailings are delivered expeditiously.\n"

There is a legitimate state interest in ensuring that governmental mailings are delivered expeditiously.\n\nThis argument acknowledges the state's interest in efficient and timely communication for its internal governmental operations, which can be seen as a valid reason for establishing a specialized service. However, it is important to note that the Constitution grants Congress the power to establish Post Offices and post Roads (Article I, Section 8, Clause 7), and this federal power could potentially preempt any conflicting state legislation. Therefore, while option D presents a strong argument for the state's interest, the legality of the proposed legislation would ultimately depend on whether it conflicts with federal postal laws and regulations, and whether Congress has occupied the field to the extent that it preempts state action."
