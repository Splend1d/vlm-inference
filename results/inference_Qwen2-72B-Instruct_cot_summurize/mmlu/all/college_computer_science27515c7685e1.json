This is essentially asking for the proportion of defective chips from Company Y among all defective chips:\n\n\\[ P(\\text{Defective chip from Y} | \\text{Chip is defective}) = \\frac{\\text{Number of defective chips from Y}}{\\text{Total number of defective chips}} \\]\n\n\\[ P(\\text{Defective chip from Y} | \\text{Chip is defective}) = \\frac{2}{3} \\]\n\nThus, the correct answer is D. 2 / 3."
