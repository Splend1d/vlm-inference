The store clerk refused to sell it to him, because it was a \"house rule\" that the necklace was intended for women only. If the man brings suit against the store for its refusal to sell him the necklace, the man will\n\nA. lose, because the advertisement was intended only as an invitation to make an offer.\nB. lose, because the man did not notii' the store in writing that he intended to accept the offer.\nC. win, because the advertisement should be construed as a binding offer.\nD. win, because it is immaterial whether the man was the first customer to appear at the store to purchase the necklace.\n"

While the advertisement may have been an offer to sell the necklace at a specific price, the store can impose reasonable conditions on who can accept that offer. In this case, the \"house rule\" that the necklace was intended for women only could be seen as a reasonable condition.\n\nHowever, the legality of such a condition would depend on various factors, including whether it violates any anti-discrimination laws or regulations. Assuming that the condition does not violate any laws, the store has the right to refuse to sell the necklace to the man based on their own policy.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer would be A: \"lose, because the advertisement was intended only as an invitation to make an offer.\" The man cannot force the store to sell him the necklace if they have imposed reasonable conditions on who can accept the offer."
