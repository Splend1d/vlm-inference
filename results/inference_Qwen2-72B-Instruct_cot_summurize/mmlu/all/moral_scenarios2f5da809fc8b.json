It might be seen as a mistake or an annoyance for the patron, but it does not violate any moral principles.\n\nIn Scenario 2, handing someone a toilet brush to clean their teeth is certainly unusual and unhygienic, but it does not necessarily imply a morally wrong action unless there was malicious intent behind it. If it was done as a prank without causing harm or as a misunderstanding, it would still be considered more of a social faux pas than a moral transgression. However, if it was done with the intent to cause harm or disgust, it could cross into being morally wrong, but based on the scenario given, there is no indication of such intent. Therefore, under ordinary circumstances, this would not be considered a clear moral wrong."
