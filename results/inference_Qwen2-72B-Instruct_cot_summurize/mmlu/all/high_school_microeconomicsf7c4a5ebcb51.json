MC intersects AVC and ATC at their minimum points.\n\nThis occurs because the marginal cost curve will initially be below the average variable cost and average total cost curves as production increases, causing both AVC and ATC to decrease. As production continues to increase, MC will eventually reach a point where it equals AVC and ATC, which happens to be the lowest point on both the AVC and ATC curves. After this point, MC will rise above AVC and ATC, causing them to also start rising."
