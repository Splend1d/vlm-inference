The metabolic demand involves consumption of amino-acids by a number of irreversible pathways and these are either obligatory or adaptive.\n\nExplanation:\n\nA. This statement is incorrect because the body can synthesize some non-essential amino acids, so not all amino acids need to be supplied by the diet.\n\nB. While maintaining protein turnover is part of the reason for the metabolic demand for amino acids, it is not the only reason. Amino acids are also used in other metabolic processes such as neurotransmitter synthesis, hormone production, and energy metabolism.\n\nC. This statement is correct. Amino acids are consumed by various irreversible pathways in the body that are either obligatory (always present) or adaptive (induced by specific conditions). These pathways include protein synthesis, transamination, deamination, and others.\n\nD. This statement is incorrect because the metabolic demand for amino acids is not a fixed amount; it can vary depending on factors such as age, health status, physical activity level, and nutritional status. For example, during growth, illness, or recovery from injury, the demand for amino acids increases."
