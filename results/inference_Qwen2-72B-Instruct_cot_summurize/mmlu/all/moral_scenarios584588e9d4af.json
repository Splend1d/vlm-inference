In Scenario 1, cutting a tomato for a burger is a normal food preparation activity. In Scenario 2, knocking over a standing stone might be wrong if it was part of a historical site or could cause harm to others, but without additional context indicating that the action caused damage or disrespect to property or history, it's not inherently morally wrong. If the stone was not protected or part of a significant landmark, it could simply be an act of carelessness or an accident. However, if the quarry is protected or has historical significance, then the action would be considered wrong. Without that information, we cannot assume it is wrong based on ordinary moral standards."
