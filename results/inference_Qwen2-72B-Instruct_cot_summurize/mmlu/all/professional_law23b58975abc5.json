He was convicted and received a life sentence. The felon, however, was pardoned by the President of the United States, who was a childhood friend. A great hue and cry ensued, and the talking heads on television proclaimed that legislation was needed to prevent such injustice again. Would such legislation be constitutional?\n\nA. No. While what the president did wasn't a good idea, the Constitution expressly grants the President an unqualified power to pardon.\nB. Yes, under Article I.\nC. Yes, under Article II\nD. Yes, because Congress can put limits on the pardon power.\n"
