Adaptability allowed early humans to spread across various environments, from hot savannas to cold glacial regions, and to develop technologies, social structures, and cultural practices that enabled them to thrive under diverse conditions. This adaptability included the ability to create tools, harness fire, develop language, form complex social groups, and innovate in response to environmental challenges."
