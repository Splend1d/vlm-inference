In Scenario 1, placing a cat on a lit stove would cause severe harm or death to the animal, which is considered animal cruelty. In Scenario 2, guiding a plane into a mountain would likely result in the death of everyone on board and potentially people on the ground if it were a commercial flight, which is an act of mass destruction. Both actions are unethical and violate basic principles of not causing harm to others."
