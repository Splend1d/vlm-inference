Cultural homogenization refers to the reduction in cultural diversity through the popularization and diffusion of a wide array of cultural symbols\u2014not only physical objects but customs, ideas, values, and behaviors\u2014from a dominant culture, most often Western culture. If you provide me with the list, I can help you select the best answer. Without that context, it's impossible to accurately choose from options A, B, C, or D. Could you please provide more details?"
