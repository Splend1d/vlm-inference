The company's property was separated from the golf course by a fence on which the company had posted signs warning people not to enter the property because of the dangers of balloons landing. A golfer on the golf course hit an errant shot onto the company's property, ignored the warning signs, and jumped over the fence to retrieve her golf ball. At about the same time, one of the company's balloons experienced mechanical problems and had to make an emergency landing to avoid crashing. The balloon, which was out of control when it landed, struck the golfer and injured her. The jurisdiction has decided that hot-air ballooning is an abnormally dangerous activity. In an action by the golfer against the company, does the company have any affirmative defenses?\n\nA. No, because the balloon was out of control when it struck the golfer.\nB. No, because the company was engaged in an abnormally dangerous activity.\nC. Yes, because the balloon landed to avoid crashing.\nD. Yes, because the golfer assumed the risk by coming onto the company's property.\n"

Yes, because the golfer assumed the risk by coming onto the company's property.\n\nAssumption of risk is a defense that can be used in cases where the plaintiff voluntarily and knowingly exposed themselves to a dangerous situation. In this case, the golfer ignored warning signs and trespassed onto the company's property, which was clearly marked as dangerous due to the potential for balloon landings. Therefore, the company may argue that the golfer assumed the risk of injury by entering the property despite the warnings. However, it is important to note that the specific laws and regulations regarding assumption of risk and abnormally dangerous activities may vary by jurisdiction, and the court will consider all relevant factors before making a decision."
