An approach to security that applies critical knowledge to established orthodoxies of security studies.\n\nCritical Security Studies (CSS) is an interdisciplinary field that challenges traditional approaches to security by questioning the assumptions underlying mainstream security theories. It seeks to broaden the concept of security beyond military concerns and state-centric perspectives to include issues such as human security, economic security, environmental security, and cultural security. CSS also emphasizes the role of power relations, identity, and discourse in shaping security policies and practices. By adopting a critical stance, CSS aims to uncover hidden biases and power dynamics within security discourses and to promote more inclusive and democratic forms of security governance."
