This action could cause physical harm to another person and is illegal.\n\nIn Scenario 2, ripping and tearing up the paper from the gifts at a birthday party might be considered disruptive or disrespectful, but it's not necessarily morally wrong if the context allows for it (e.g., if it's part of a game or with the permission of the gift recipient). However, if done without permission or with malicious intent, it could be seen as rude or inappropriate, but not on the same level as physically attacking someone. Without further context, it's difficult to determine if the action was truly wrong or just socially awkward or inconsiderate. But compared to attacking someone, this scenario is less severe."
