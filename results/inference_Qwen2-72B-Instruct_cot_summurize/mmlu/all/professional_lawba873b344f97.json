The President issued an executive order requiring all executive branch employees to use exclusively one brand of ballpoint pens and pencils as their writing utensils. According to a study, the federal government could save in excess of $250,000 a year in office supply costs if all executive agencies were to use standardized pens and pencils.\nB. The President issued an executive order requiring all executive branch employees to wear only white shirts and blouses during regular working hours. According to the President's directive, executive employees are prohibited from wearing colored (e. g. , blue or yellow) or striped shirts and blouses while on duty. The President issued the order in an effort to establish a uniform dress code for all executive employees.\nC. In 1887, Congress passed a law establishing a federal Commission of Birdwatchers. The Commission, which is still in effect, consists of seven members who are appointed by the President. The Commission's main function is to go on periodic retreats to photograph and study North American birds and their migratory habits. Believing that the Commission is archaic, the President decides that any future funding will simply be a waste of money. He thus executes an executive decree abrogating the Commission of Birdwatchers.\nD. A devastating hurricane damages an island which is part of a foreign country. The storm destroys many homes, resulting in death and injury to thousands. In response to a request from the foreign government for emergency aid, the President, without seeking the advice and consent of the Senate, issues an executive decree authorizing U. S. Army troops to the island to provide medical and humanitarian assistance.\n"

                    "text": "Executive Order C is the most likely to be found unconstitutional. This is because the President cannot unilaterally abolish a commission created by Congress through legislation. The Constitution grants Congress the power to create federal agencies and commissions, and the President does not have the authority to dissolve them through executive action alone. If the President wishes to eliminate the Commission of Birdwatchers, he would need to work with Congress to pass new legislation repealing the original statute that established the commission.\n\nThe other executive orders (A, B, and D) do not necessarily violate constitutional principles. Executive Order A deals with administrative efficiency and cost-saving measures within the executive branch, which is generally within the President's purview. Executive Order B establishes a dress code for executive branch employees, which may be seen as an internal management decision. Executive Order D involves the deployment of military forces for humanitarian purposes, which has precedent in previous executive actions, though it might be argued that such a deployment should involve congressional consultation or approval depending on the duration and scope of the mission. However, these arguments are less clear-cut than the constitutional overreach present in Executive Order C."
