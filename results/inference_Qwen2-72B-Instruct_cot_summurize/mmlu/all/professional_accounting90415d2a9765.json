However, if the fair market value at the time of the gift is lower than the adjusted basis, the child's basis is the lesser of the donor's adjusted basis or the fair market value at the time of the gift.\n\nIn this case, the parent's adjusted basis was $10,000 and the fair market value at the time of the gift was $9,000. Therefore, the child's basis for the securities would be the lower of the two, which is $9,000.\n\nSo the correct answer is:\n\nB. $9,000"
