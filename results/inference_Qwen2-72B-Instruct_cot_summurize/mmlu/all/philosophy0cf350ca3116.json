In his political philosophy, as expressed in works such as \"Two Treatises of Government,\" Locke argued that individuals enter into a social contract to form a government that will protect their natural rights, including life, liberty, and property. The establishment of a commonwealth is meant to provide a framework for the protection of these rights, which are often seen as being at risk in the state of nature due to potential conflicts over resources and power."
