The seller answered the complaint and included as a separate defense an allegation that the purchaser had brought and lost a similar contract claim against a different seller three years earlier, and that this history represented a pattern of filing frivolous lawsuits. The purchaser believes that the earlier lawsuit was factually completely different from the current one and is therefore irrelevant. What is the purchaser's best response to the seller's answer?\n\nA. File a reply that includes a denial of the separate defense.\nB. Move for sanctions against the seller for asserting a frivolous defense.\nC. Move to amend the complaint to add allegations about the differences between the lawsuits.\nD. Move to strike the separate defense as irrelevant.\n"

Move to strike the separate defense as irrelevant.\n\nThe seller's assertion regarding the purchaser's previous lawsuit is not relevant to the current case unless it can be shown that there is some legal or factual connection that would make it pertinent. Alleging that a party has a history of filing lawsuits does not, in itself, address the merits of the current lawsuit or provide a defense to the allegations made. Therefore, the purchaser can argue that the defense is immaterial and should be stricken from the record. However, if the seller can demonstrate that the prior lawsuit is relevant to the current case (for example, if it involves substantially similar facts or parties), then the court may allow the defense to stand."
