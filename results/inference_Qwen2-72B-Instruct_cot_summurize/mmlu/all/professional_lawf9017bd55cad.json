It was a late autunm afternoon, and the football team was practicing for its upcoming game against its archrival. While the team was practicing, the skies darkened as a storm approached. Minutes later, it began to rain heavily. Even though the storm intensified, the coach did not stop the practice because he had no reason to believe the storm presented a danger to his players. Suddenly, a bolt of lightning struck and killed the team's star player. This jurisdiction has abolished governmental immunity, and a school board may be sued as a private entity. If the player's parents bring a wrongful death action against the coach and the high school board, will they prevail?\n\nA. Yes, because the player was injured while engaged in a school activity.\nB. Yes, because under the circumstances the coach would be strictly liable.\nC. No, because the coach was not negligent by continuing the practice.\nD. No, because lightning is an act of God.\n"

No, because the coach was not negligent by continuing the practice.\n\nWhile the situation is tragic, negligence requires that the coach had a duty to protect the player from harm, breached that duty, and that breach led to the player's injury or death. In this case, the coach had no reason to believe the storm presented a danger, so he did not breach his duty of care. Lightning strikes during storms are rare events, and without specific knowledge that lightning was imminent, the coach cannot be held responsible for continuing the practice. However, if it were known that the coach ignored clear warnings about the storm or lightning risk, then the answer might be different. But based on the information given, the correct answer is C. \n\nNote: The other options are incorrect because:\nA. Being involved in a school activity does not automatically mean the school is liable.\nB. Strict liability does not apply in this scenario since the coach did not engage in any inherently dangerous activity.\nD. While lightning can be considered an \"act of God,\" it does not absolve humans from exercising reasonable care when foreseeable risks are present. However, in this case, the coach did not have reason to believe there was an immediate danger."
