The mall owner called the police, who warned them to stop or they would be arrested. They returned the next day and continued to leaflet. The police came again and issued another warning. The law student left to avoid arrest, but the police arrested his companions for criminal trespass and loitering. The law student, in an attempt to get an advance ruling on the constitutionality of the criminal statutes, filed a declaratory judgment action in federal court asking for declaratory relief. Based on Supreme Court precedent will the federal district court dismiss the declaratory judgment action?\n\nA. Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.\nB. No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.\nC. No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.\nD. Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.\n"

However, based on Supreme Court precedent regarding declaratory judgments and the abstention doctrine, the most likely answer is:\n\nA. Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.\n\nThis is because the Supreme Court has established that federal courts should generally abstain from hearing cases that involve ongoing state criminal proceedings, especially when the relief sought could interfere with those proceedings. This principle is known as Younger abstention, named after the case Younger v. Harris (1971). Under this doctrine, federal courts will typically refuse to hear a case if there is an ongoing state criminal proceeding involving the same parties and issues, unless there are exceptional circumstances that justify federal intervention.\n\nIn this scenario, the law student's companions have been arrested and are facing state criminal charges. If the federal court were to issue a declaratory judgment on the constitutionality of the criminal statutes under which they were arrested, it could potentially interfere with the ongoing state criminal proceedings. Therefore, the federal court is likely to dismiss the declaratory judgment action to respect the principles of equity and comity that underlie the abstention doctrine."
