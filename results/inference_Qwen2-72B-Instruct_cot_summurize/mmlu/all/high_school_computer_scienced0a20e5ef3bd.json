The song was saved using fewer bits per second than the original song.\n\nWhen audio files are compressed to save space, some data is discarded, which can result in a loss of sound quality. If the student saved the song using a format or settings with fewer bits per second (bps) than the original recording, this could explain the lower sound quality. Fewer bits per second means less information is being used to represent the audio, leading to potential loss of detail and clarity."
