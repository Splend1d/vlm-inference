Static figures and a sense of optical surface movement\n\nPointillism, as developed by Georges Seurat, is characterized by the use of small, distinct dots of color that are applied in patterns to form an image. When viewed from a distance, these dots blend together in the eye of the viewer, creating a sense of optical surface movement. The figures and scenes depicted in Seurat's works tend to be static, with the visual interest coming from the technique rather than dynamic composition or emotional content."
