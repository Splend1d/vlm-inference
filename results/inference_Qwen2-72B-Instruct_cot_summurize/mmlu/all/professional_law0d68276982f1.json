The following day, the man conveys the property to his sister; she does not record her deed. Then on February 4, the man executes an identical conveyance of the farm to a friend. The friend gives the man a check for $100,000 for the property and records the conveyance, even though he has actual knowledge of the prior conveyance to the sister. The sister, however, records her deed on February 6. The friend then conveys his interest in the farm to a farmer, who gives a purchase price of $115,000 to the friend. On February 5, the farmer purchases the farm without notice of the conveyance to the sister and duly records the deed. If the property in question was located in a state having a notice-type statute, which of the following parties would ultimately prevail?\n\nA. The farmer.\nB. The sister.\nC. The friend.\nD. The man.\n"

Let's break down the sequence of events:\n\n1. **Woman to Man (February 1):** This conveyance is duly recorded, giving the man legal title to the farm.\n\n2. **Man to Sister (February 2):** The sister's deed is not recorded until February 6. She does not have priority over later bona fide purchasers (BFPs) who record their interests before she records hers.\n\n3. **Man to Friend (February 4):** The friend pays $100,000 for the property and records the conveyance, despite knowing about the prior conveyance to the sister. The friend's recording takes place before the sister's recording, making him a BFP with superior rights over the sister.\n\n4. **Friend to Farmer (February 5):** The farmer purchases the farm from the friend without notice of the conveyance to the sister and records the deed immediately. Under a notice-type statute, the farmer becomes the BFP with the best claim to the property because he purchased it without notice of any other claims and recorded his deed promptly.\n\nGiven these circumstances, the ultimate prevailing party under a notice-type statute would be:\n\n**A. The farmer.**\n\nThe farmer's lack of notice of the sister's unrecorded conveyance and his prompt recording of the deed make him the BFP with the strongest claim to the property."
