Since there are three numbers and two of them are the same (3), the median will also be 3.\n\nNow let's add the number 6 to the list and see what happens to the mean and median.\n\nNew list: 1, 3, 3, 6\n\nNew Mean = (Sum of all numbers) / (Number of numbers)\nNew Mean = (1 + 3 + 3 + 6) / 4\nNew Mean = 13 / 4\nNew Mean = 3.25\n\nThe new mean is greater than the old mean (3.25 > 2.33), so:\n\nA. the mean would increase.\n\nFor the median, since we now have an even number of data points, the median will be the average of the two middle numbers.\n\nNew Median = (3 + 3) / 2\nNew Median = 6 / 2\nNew Median = 3\n\nThe median remains the same as before (3). So neither C nor D is correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. the mean would increase."
