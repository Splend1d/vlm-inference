Two months after completion of the work, the company sued the city for its failure to pay under the terms of the contract. At trial, the company's construction supervisor who personally oversaw all the repair work was called to testify. He sought to testify about the amount of sewer pipe used, the number of hours required to complete the job, and the number of workers employed by the company during the construction repair work. The defendant's attorney objected on the grounds that the company routinely recorded such factual information in their log books, which were in the company's possession. As a consequence, the supervisor's testimony should be ruled\n\nA. admissible, because it is based on firsthand knowledge.\nB. admissible, because it is a report of regularly conducted business activities.\nC. inadmissible, because such testimony would be violative of the best evidence rule.\nD. inadmissible, because no evidence was introduced to show that the original log records are not available for examination.\n"

                    "text": "The supervisor's testimony would likely be ruled:\n\nA. admissible, because it is based on firsthand knowledge.\n\nHowever, the best answer depends on the context of the trial and the rules of evidence applicable in that jurisdiction. Generally, a witness's testimony about facts within their personal knowledge is admissible. However, if the defendant's attorney wants to introduce the log books as evidence (which would be considered the best evidence of what they contain), they might argue that the supervisor's testimony is unnecessary or that it should be supplemented with the actual log books. If the log books are available and are the best evidence of the information they contain, the court may require them to be produced instead of, or in addition to, the supervisor's testimony.\n\nThe \"best evidence rule\" generally requires that an original document be produced when its contents are at issue, rather than secondary evidence like testimony about what the document says. In this case, if the log books are in the company's possession and can be produced, they would likely be considered the best evidence of the number of hours worked, the amount of materials used, etc.\n\nTherefore, while the supervisor's testimony could be admissible based on firsthand knowledge, the defendant's attorney's objection might lead the court to also require the production of the log books under the best evidence rule. If the log books are not available for some reason, the supervisor's testimony would be more likely to be admitted without question. \n\nThus, a more nuanced response might be that the testimony is admissible but that the log books should also be produced if they are available, reflecting both A and C depending on the circumstances. However, among the given options, A is the most directly correct regarding the admissibility of the supervisor's testimony based on firsthand knowledge."
