DVDs are a normal luxury good.\n\nThe income elasticity of demand measures how the quantity demanded of a good responds to a change in consumers' income. A positive income elasticity (+1.5 in this case) indicates that the good is a normal good, and since it's greater than 1, it suggests that DVDs are a luxury good. As people's incomes rise, they buy more DVDs, and the percentage increase in quantity demanded is greater than the percentage increase in income."
