Mathematically, it is given by:\n\n\\[ \\mathbf{E} = \\frac{\\mathbf{F}}{q} \\]\n\nwhere \\(\\mathbf{E}\\) is the electric field, \\(\\mathbf{F}\\) is the force experienced by the test charge, and \\(q\\) is the magnitude of the test charge.\n\nThe important point here is that the electric field \\(\\mathbf{E}\\) does not depend on the test charge used to measure it. It is a property of the space due to the presence of other charges (in this case, due to the two parallel plates).\n\nThus, if experimenter A uses a very small test charge \\(q_0\\), and experimenter B uses a test charge \\(2q_0\\) to measure the same electric field, they will both find the same electric field strength. The force experienced by each test charge will be different (\\(F_A = q_0 E\\) and \\(F_B = 2q_0 E\\)), but the field strength \\(\\mathbf{E}\\) remains constant.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. the same as the field found by B"
