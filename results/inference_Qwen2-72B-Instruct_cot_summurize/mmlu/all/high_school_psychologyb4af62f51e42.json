Inferential statistics allow researchers to make inferences about a larger population based on data collected from a sample, including testing hypotheses and determining whether observed differences are likely due to chance or represent true effects. Common tests used for this purpose include t-tests, ANOVA (Analysis of Variance), and regression analysis."
