Has been properly voided in the normal course of business.\n\nIf a purchase order has been properly voided as part of the normal course of business, it would not provide the auditor with relevant evidence regarding the internal control activities related to the proper approval of purchase orders. Therefore, it would make sense for the auditor to replace that voided purchase order with another one for testing purposes. \n\nOptions A, C, and D all suggest scenarios where there might be some issue or irregularity that the auditor would want to investigate further rather than simply replacing the purchase order. In those cases, the voided purchase order could potentially provide useful information about the effectiveness of the internal controls."
