The buyer tried to stop the van for a red light, but the brakes failed to operate. As a consequence, the buyer drove through the red light and collided with a car driven by a woman. Subsequently, the woman asserted a claim against the buyer to recover for the injuries she suffered in the accident. At trial, the only evidence offered by the plaintiff concerning the cause of the accident was the testimony of an engineering expert. He testified that a manufacturing defect had caused the brakes to suddenly fail. Based on the facts stated above, a motion by the buyer to dismiss at the end of the woman's case should be\n\nA. granted, because the woman presented no evidence that the buyer was negligent.\nB. granted, because the woman was neither the user nor the consumer of the defective product.\nC. denied, because the buyer had a non-delegable duty to maintain the brakes in a safe condition.\nD. denied, because the buyer is strictly liable for injuries caused by a manufacturing defect in an auto that he had purchased.\n"

However, under the doctrine of strict liability, manufacturers and sellers can be held liable for damages caused by defective products without the need for the injured party to prove negligence. Since the brakes failed due to a manufacturing defect, and this defect led to the accident and the woman's injuries, the motion to dismiss at the end of the woman's case should be denied. The buyer, as the seller of the vehicle (in this context, meaning the last party in the distribution chain before the vehicle reached the consumer), can potentially seek recourse from the manufacturer if found liable."
