The people they encountered were likely direct descendants of the Mississippian culture, which had flourished in this region from about 800 to 1600 AD. The Mississippians were known for their complex chiefdoms, large population centers, and monumental earthworks. By the time de Soto arrived, some of these societies may have been in decline or transition, but their cultural legacy would have still been evident in the practices and settlements of the indigenous peoples he met."
