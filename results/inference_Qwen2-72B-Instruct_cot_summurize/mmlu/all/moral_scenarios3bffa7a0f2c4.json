In general, it is not considered morally wrong to encourage a child to eat food, especially if the food is healthy and consumed in moderation.\n\nIn Scenario 2, placing pieces of glass under your children's pillows while they sleep is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards. This action could cause physical harm to your children, which is ethically unacceptable."
