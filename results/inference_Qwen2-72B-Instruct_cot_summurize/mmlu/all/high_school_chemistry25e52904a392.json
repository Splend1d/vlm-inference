Since the stoichiometry of the reaction is 2:1 for \\(\\ce{SO2}\\) to \\(\\ce{O2}\\), the change in partial pressure of \\(\\ce{SO2}\\) would be \\(2x\\). Therefore, at equilibrium:\n\n\\[\nP_{\\ce{SO3}} = 601.44 - 2x\\, \\text{mmHg} \\\\\nP_{\\ce{SO2}} = 2x\\, \\text{mmHg} \\\\\nP_{\\ce{O2}} = x\\, \\text{mmHg}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting these into the \\(K_p\\) equation gives:\n\n\\[\n3.0 \\times 10^{22} = \\frac{(601.44 - 2x)^2}{(2x)^2 \\cdot x}\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n3.0 \\times 10^{22} = \\frac{(601.44 - 2x)^2}{4x^3}\n\\]\n\nSolving this cubic equation for \\(x\\) directly might be complex without numerical methods or a graphing calculator. However, given the magnitude of \\(K_p\\), it suggests that the reaction goes almost completely to completion, meaning that the change in pressure (\\(x\\)) is very small compared to the initial pressure of \\(\\ce{SO3}\\).\n\nWe can approximate by considering that \\(601.44 - 2x \\approx 601.44\\) since \\(x\\) should be much smaller than 601.44 mmHg. This gives us:\n\n\\[\n3.0 \\times 10^{22} = \\frac{601.44^2}{4x^3}\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\(x\\):\n\n\\[\nx = \\left( \\frac{601.44^2}{4 \\times 3.0 \\times 10^{22}} \\right)^{\\frac{1}{3}}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nx = \\left( \\frac{361732.9936}{12 \\times 10^{22}} \\right)^{\\frac{1}{3}}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nx = \\left( 3.01444161333 \\times 10^{-22} \\right)^{\\frac{1}{3}}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nx \\approx 6.69 \\times 10^{-8}\\, \\text{mmHg}\n\\]\n\nConverting \\(x\\) to torr (since 1 mmHg = 1 torr):\n\n\\[\nx \\approx 6.69 \\times 10^{-8}\\, \\text{torr}\n\\]\n\nAmong the options provided, the closest match is:\n\nA. \\(2.88 \\times 10^{-6}\\) torr\n\nHowever, based on our calculation, the answer is closer to option D:\n\nD. \\(1.32 \\times 10^{-5}\\) torr\n\nBut the correct choice from the given options, considering our approximation and calculation, would be:\n\nA. \\(2.88 \\times 10^{-6}\\) torr\n\nNote: The calculation assumes an approximation due to the magnitude of \\(K_p\\), which indicates that the reaction goes almost completely to completion. The exact solution would require solving the cubic equation, which was approximated here for simplicity."
