This condition primarily affects children under the age of 5 years and can lead to serious complications, particularly coronary artery aneurysms.\n\nThe treatment of choice for Kawasaki disease is intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) along with aspirin. IVIG is used to reduce inflammation and prevent the development of coronary artery abnormalities. Aspirin is given to reduce fever and inflammation and, later, as an anticoagulant to prevent blood clots in the coronary arteries.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy to prevent complications of this illness is:\n\nA. Intravenous immune globulin\n\nIt's important to note that penicillin (option B) is not indicated as there is no evidence of bacterial infection, prednisone (option C) is generally not recommended due to concerns about increased risk of coronary artery aneurysms, and isoniazid (option D) is an anti-tuberculosis drug which is not relevant to the treatment of Kawasaki disease."
