Her temperature is 36.9\u00b0C (98.4\u00b0F), pulse is 82/min, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 136/85 mm Hg. Crackles are heard in both lower lung fields. Pulmonary function tests show total lung capacity is 80% of predicted, and diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide, corrected for alveolar volume, is 65% of predicted. Histologic examination of a lung biopsy specimen is most likely to show which of the following findings?\n\nA. Diffuse interstitial fibrosis\nB. Intra-alveolar exudates\nC. Multiple thromboemboli\nD. Necrotizing vasculitis\n"

The decreased diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide suggests that there is damage to the alveolar-capillary membrane, which is consistent with interstitial lung disease. The histologic examination of a lung biopsy specimen in this case would most likely show diffuse interstitial fibrosis, which is characterized by thickening and scarring of the lung tissue. Therefore, the answer is A. Diffuse interstitial fibrosis."
