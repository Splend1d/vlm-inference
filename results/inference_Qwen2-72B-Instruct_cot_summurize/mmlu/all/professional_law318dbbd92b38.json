In this case, the smoke from the fire caused by the mechanic's actions resulted in damage to the neighbor's property (discoloration), which can be considered an interference with the neighbor's use and enjoyment of their property. Unlike strict liability or negligence, which require certain elements to be proven, nuisance claims focus more on the effect of the defendant's actions on the plaintiff's property and less on the fault or intent of the defendant. Trespass typically involves direct physical invasion of property, whereas here the harm was caused by airborne contaminants."
