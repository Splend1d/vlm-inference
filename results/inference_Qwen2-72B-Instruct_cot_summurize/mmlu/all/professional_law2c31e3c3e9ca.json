The defendant is compelled to stand trial in street clothing would NOT cause a due process violation in the trial. \n\nThe right to a fair trial includes the right to be treated with dignity and respect, but being compelled to wear street clothes instead of prison garb does not necessarily violate this right. However, it's worth noting that in some jurisdictions, forcing a defendant to wear prison garb in front of the jury can be seen as prejudicial and may violate the defendant's right to a fair trial.\n\nIn contrast, options A, C, and D all describe situations that could potentially violate the defendant's right to due process:\n\nA. If the trial is conducted in a way that jurors would not be able to give evidence reasonable consideration, this could prevent the defendant from receiving a fair trial.\n\nC. If the defendant is compelled to stand trial or appear at penalty phase proceedings visibly shackled without any security concerns, this could prejudice the jury against the defendant and violate their right to a fair trial.\n\nD. If jurors are exposed to influence favorable to the prosecution, this could also prejudice the jury against the defendant and violate their right to a fair trial."
