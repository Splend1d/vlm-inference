While there are various potential effects of this condition, the most directly associated outcome listed here is:\n\nB. suffer from sterility as an adult.\n\nKlinefelter Syndrome often leads to issues with fertility due to underdeveloped testes and lower production of testosterone. This can result in sterility or reduced fertility in males. It's important to note that individuals with Klinefelter Syndrome can have a wide range of experiences and not all will necessarily experience depression or miscarriage (as it pertains to the individual themselves), and color blindness is not typically associated with this condition."
