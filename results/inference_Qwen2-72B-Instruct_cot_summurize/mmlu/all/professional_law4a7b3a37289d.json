The grand jury issued a subpoena requiring the corporation to produce all emails and internal documents regarding the corporation's knowledge of the risks of an oil spill. The corporation has objected, citing its Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. Can the subpoena be enforced?\n\nA. No, because the corporation was not granted transactional immunity.\nB. No, because the corporation was not granted use-and-derivative-use immunity.\nC. Yes, because a corporation has no Fifth Amendment privilege.\nD. Yes, because the Fifth Amendment privilege does not apply to the compelled production of documents.\n"

Yes, because a corporation has no Fifth Amendment privilege.\n\nThe Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination applies to individuals, but it does not extend to corporations. Corporations are required to comply with subpoenas for the production of documents, even if those documents may tend to incriminate the corporation. Therefore, the subpoena can be enforced despite the corporation's objection based on the Fifth Amendment privilege."
