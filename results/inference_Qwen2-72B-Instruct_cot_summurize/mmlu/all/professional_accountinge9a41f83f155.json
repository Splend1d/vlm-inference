Describes the limitations on the usefulness of the projection.\n\nWhen an accountant compiles projected financial statements, their report should include a separate paragraph that describes the limitations on the usefulness of the projection. This is important because projections are based on various assumptions about future events and economic conditions, which may or may not occur as expected. The accountant's responsibility is to compile the projections from information provided by management but does not include providing assurance on the historical financial statements (option A) or expressing limited assurance on the results (option B). Evaluating the hypothetical assumptions (option D) is part of the process, but it is not specifically what should be included in the report; rather, the focus is on communicating the inherent uncertainties and limitations of projections to the users of the financial statements."
