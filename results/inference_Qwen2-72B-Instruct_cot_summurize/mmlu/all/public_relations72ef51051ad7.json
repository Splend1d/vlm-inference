Shannon and Weaver model\n\nThe Shannon and Weaver model is often referred to as the \"mathematical theory of communication\" and it was the first model to describe the process of encoding and decoding messages in a linear fashion. It includes components such as the sender, encoder, channel, decoder, receiver, and noise. This model is significant because it introduced the concept of feedback in communication, although it was later added by others as the original model did not include it."
