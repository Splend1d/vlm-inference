What happened to this \"lost\"water?\n\nA. it was stripped away by the magnetic field when it rapidly decreased in strength\nB. it was broken into hydrogen and oxygen by ultraviolet light and the hydrogen was lost through thermal escape\nC. it was consumed by a civilization of thirsty Martians\nD. it was vaporized during a period of intense volcanism and was lost to space through thermal escape\n"

Because molecular hydrogen (H2) is so much lighter than water vapor (H2O), the hydrogen was able to achieve escape velocity and was lost to space, while the oxygen remained behind. This process is known as photodissociation followed by hydrogen escape. Over billions of years, this mechanism could account for the loss of a significant amount of water from Mars."
