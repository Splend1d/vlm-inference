Volunteers who have had problems with such injuries were randomly assigned to use either a traditional keyboard or the new design. A significance test was conducted with the alternative hypothesis that a smaller proportion of those using the new keyboard will suffer injuries than those using the traditional keyboard. The resulting P-value was 0.07. Which is a correct interpretation of this P-value?\n\nA. The null hypothesis should be rejected.\nB. The null hypothesis should be accepted.\nC.

There is a 7% chance of getting a difference between the two groups at least as large as the observed difference if the new keyboard is really no better at preventing injuries.\n\nThe P-value does not determine whether the null hypothesis should be accepted or rejected; it merely provides information about the probability of observing the data (or more extreme data) if the null hypothesis is true. In this case, a P-value of 0.07 indicates that there's a 7% probability of observing the difference in injury rates between the two keyboard types, or a larger difference, if the new keyboard is actually no better than the traditional one at preventing injuries. This value is often compared to a predetermined significance level (e.g., 0.05) to decide whether to reject the null hypothesis, but the decision itself is not part of the definition or interpretation of the P-value."
