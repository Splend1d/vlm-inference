True, False\n\nExplanation:\nStatement 1 is true because RoBERTa (Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach) indeed pretrains on a significantly larger corpus compared to BERT. The original BERT model was trained on the BooksCorpus (800M words) and English Wikipedia (2,500M words), while RoBERTa was trained on a more extensive dataset consisting of the Common Crawl dataset (up to 16GB of text data), which is approximately 10 times larger.\n\nStatement 2 is false because ResNeXt (Residual Networks with Next) models typically use ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) as their activation function rather than tanh. Tanh (Hyperbolic Tangent) was popular in earlier neural network architectures but has been largely replaced by ReLU due to its performance benefits, such as faster convergence and reduced likelihood of vanishing gradients."
