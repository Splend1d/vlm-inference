According to the SEC's rules, an auditor cannot provide certain nonaudit services to an audit client without impairing independence. One of those prohibited services is designing or implementing a financial information system. This includes any financial accounting, reporting, or management information system. Therefore, providing such services would impair the auditor's independence and would require the auditor to decline the engagement or withdraw from the audit."
