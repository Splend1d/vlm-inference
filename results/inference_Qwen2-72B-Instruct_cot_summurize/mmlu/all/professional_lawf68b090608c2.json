We have on hand a limited supply of green ink cartridges for all printers; when they're gone, they're gone! Please submit your orders as soon as possible to make sure your order can be filled. \"One of the regular customers of the supplier sent the following reply by fax:\"Sorry to hear that you will no longer carry green ink cartridges, since that is one of our favorite colors. Please ship 100 green ink cartridges to our office as soon as possible. \"The supplier faxed an acknowledgement of the order to the customer with a promise that the cartridges would be shipped out in one week. The next day, the supplier received the following e-mail from the customer:\"Please cancel our order. We just discovered that we already have plenty of green ink cartridges in inventory. \" The supplier proceeded to sell its entire stock of green ink cartridges at its asking price to other customers. In an action for breach of contract by the supplier against the customer, what is the maximum amount of damages that the supplier should be entitled to recover?\n\nA. Nothing.\nB. Only incidental damages, if any, that the supplier has incurred in preparing the green ink cartridges for shipment to the customer before receiving the customer's e-mail.\nC. $5,000, which was the asking price for the 100 green ink cartridges ordered.\nD. Consequential damages, since the green ink cartridges were unique because they were the last of their kind to be offered for sale by the supplier.\n"

However, the supplier may have incurred some costs in preparing the order for shipment (such as packaging and handling), and these incidental damages would be recoverable. The supplier cannot claim the full price of the cartridges or consequential damages since the cartridges were not unique in the sense that they could not be sold to anyone else, and the supplier did not suffer any lost profits."
