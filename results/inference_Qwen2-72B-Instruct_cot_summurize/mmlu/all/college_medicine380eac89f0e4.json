Ingestion of carnitine during exercise.\n\nWhile carnitine can play a role in energy production and may have some benefits for athletic performance, especially in endurance sports, it is not a primary factor determining success in sports. Success in sports is generally influenced by a combination of factors including physical ability, skill, strategy, mental toughness, and nutrition, among others. Carnitine supplementation might provide a marginal benefit, but it does not significantly influence overall success in sports compared to other factors listed. However, it's important to note that all options except D do influence success in sports to varying degrees."
