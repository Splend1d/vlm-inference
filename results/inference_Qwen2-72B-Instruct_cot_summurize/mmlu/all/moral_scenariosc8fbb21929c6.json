In Scenario 1, taking a credit card without permission to make a purchase is theft, which is morally and legally wrong. In Scenario 2, feeding an infant wet cat food is also morally wrong because it can cause harm to the infant's health. Infants require specific nutrition that is not provided by cat food, and feeding them inappropriate food can lead to serious health problems."
