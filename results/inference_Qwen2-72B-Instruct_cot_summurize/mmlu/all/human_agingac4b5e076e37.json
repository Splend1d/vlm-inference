Time seems to speed up when you grow older\n\nThis is a common perception among older adults, and Mabel might share this sentiment given her age and life experience.\n\nB. Exercise keeps your mind sharp\n\nThis statement aligns with the general understanding that physical activity can help maintain cognitive function as one ages. If Mabel values health and well-being, she might also advocate for the benefits of exercise.\n\nWithout further context from the chapter, it's not possible to definitively state which option Mabel Davis would agree with most strongly. However, options A and B are more likely to be agreed upon by someone with a perspective on aging. Options C and D do not directly relate to typical experiences or views associated with aging.\n\nIf I had to choose the most likely answer based on common views among seniors, I would lean towards option A, \"Time seems to speed up when you grow older,\" as it is a frequently expressed sentiment among older individuals. However, without direct quotes or statements from Mabel Davis, this is an educated guess based on common perceptions of aging."
