Sexual desire is seen as a natural part of human life and is to be enjoyed within the bounds of a committed relationship, specifically within the institution of marriage. The Torah (the first five books of the Hebrew Bible) and subsequent Jewish teachings emphasize the importance of sexual relationships in the context of love, mutual respect, and procreation."
