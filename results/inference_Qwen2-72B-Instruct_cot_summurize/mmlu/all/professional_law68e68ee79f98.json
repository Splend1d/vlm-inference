Shortly thereafter, while the purchaser was riding the bicycle along a city street, he saw a traffic light facing him turn from green to amber. He sped up, hoping to cross the intersection before the light turned red. However, the purchaser quickly realized that he could not do so and applied the brakes, which failed. To avoid the traffic that was then crossing in front of him, the purchaser turned sharply to his right and onto the sidewalk, where he struck a pedestrian. Both the pedestrian and the purchaser suffered injuries. The pedestrian asserted a claim based on negligence against the bicycle company. At trial, it was found that the brake failure resulted from a manufacturing defect in the bicycle, and that the bicycle company failed to conduct a reasonable inspection that would have led to the discovery of the existence of the defect. Will the pedestrian prevail?\n\nA. Yes, because the bicycle company placed a defective bicycle into the stream of commerce.\nB. Yes, because the defect could have been discovered through the exercise of reasonable care by the bicycle company.\nC. No, because the pedestrian was not a purchaser of the bicycle.\nD. No, because the purchaser was negligent in turning onto the sidewalk.\n"

Yes, because the bicycle company placed a defective bicycle into the stream of commerce.\n\nAnd also,\n\nB. Yes, because the defect could have been discovered through the exercise of reasonable care by the bicycle company.\n\nThese two options indicate that the bicycle company had a duty to ensure that the bicycles they manufacture are safe for use. They failed in this duty due to a manufacturing defect that went undetected because of their failure to conduct a reasonable inspection. This negligence on the part of the manufacturer can be grounds for the pedestrian's claim based on negligence.\n\nThe fact that the pedestrian was not a direct purchaser does not preclude them from seeking damages; under the concept of product liability law, manufacturers can be held liable to anyone who is foreseeably injured by their products. Additionally, while the purchaser may have acted negligently, this does not necessarily absolve the bicycle company of its responsibility for the defective product. The actions of the purchaser could potentially reduce the damages awarded to the pedestrian if contributory or comparative negligence principles apply, but they do not prevent the pedestrian from prevailing in the lawsuit against the bicycle company."
