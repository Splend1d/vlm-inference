It's important to stay hydrated and this action doesn't harm anyone.\n\nIn Scenario 2, placing cameras in bathroom stalls is clearly morally wrong. This is an invasion of privacy and could potentially lead to legal consequences as well. Bathrooms are spaces where people have a reasonable expectation of privacy, and secretly recording them there is illegal and unethical."
