It affects approximately 15-20% of older adults, and can often be underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed due to its presentation in this age group. Symptoms may include sadness, loss of interest in activities once enjoyed, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, changes in appetite and sleep patterns, and thoughts of death or suicide. It's important for healthcare providers to screen for depression in older adults, as it can significantly impact their quality of life and overall health."
