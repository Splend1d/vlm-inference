Constant power drive.\n\nExplanation: In this method, the speed is increased by weakening the field flux, which in turn reduces the back EMF for a given armature current. As a result, the motor operates at a higher speed to maintain the same level of back EMF, but due to the reduced field flux, the torque produced by the motor decreases. Since power is the product of torque and speed (P = \u03c4\u03c9), when the field flux is varied, the motor's speed and torque change inversely, keeping the power relatively constant. Therefore, this method of speed control results in a constant power drive."
