This is correct because in the long run, firms will enter or exit the market until economic profits are zero, at which point price equals the minimum of average total cost.\n\nB. Price = marginal revenue. This is also correct because in perfect competition, the firm is a price taker and faces a horizontal demand curve, meaning that marginal revenue equals price.\n\nC. Price = minimum average variable cost. This is NOT correct because in the long run, firms will not operate at a level where price only covers average variable costs. If price were equal to minimum average variable cost, it would imply that the firm is not covering its fixed costs, which is unsustainable in the long run.\n\nD. Price = marginal cost. This is correct because in the long run, firms in perfect competition produce at the point where marginal cost equals price, ensuring that they are maximizing profit and producing at the efficient scale.\n\nTherefore, the statement that is not correct for a perfectly competitive firm in the long run is C: price = minimum average variable cost."
