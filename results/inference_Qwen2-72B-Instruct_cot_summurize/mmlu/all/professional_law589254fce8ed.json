The trial attorney failed to interview an alibi witness.\n\nIneffective assistance of counsel claims under the Sixth Amendment typically require showing that the attorney's performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness and that there is a reasonable probability that, but for the attorney's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. Failing to interview an alibi witness could be considered a serious deficiency in performance, especially if the witness could have provided exculpatory evidence that might have changed the outcome of the trial. This failure can be directly tied to the potential prejudice suffered by the defendant, which is a key component of establishing an ineffective assistance of counsel claim."
