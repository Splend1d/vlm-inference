A large number still remain, and to each of them it is only possible to dole out the least scrap of bread. We only give bread to those who would otherwise die. The staple dish here consists of mice, which the inhabitants hunt, so desperate are they from hunger. They devour roots which the animals cannot eat; one can, in fact, not put into words the things one sees. . . . This narrative, far from exaggerating, rather understates the horror of the case, for it does not record the hundredth part of the misery in this district. Those who have not witnessed it with their own eyes cannot imagine how great it is. Not a day passes but at least 200 people die of famine in the two provinces. We certify to having ourselves seen herds, not of cattle, but of men and women, wandering about the fields between Rheims and Rh\u00e9tel, turning up the earth like pigs to find a few roots; and as they can only find rotten ones, and not half enough of them, they become so weak that they have not strength left to seek food. The parish priest at Boult, whose letter we enclose, tells us he has buried three of his parishioners who died of hunger. The rest subsisted on chopped straw mixed with earth, of which they composed a food which cannot be called bread. Other persons in the same place lived on the bodies of animals which had died of disease, and which the cur\u00e9, otherwise unable to help his people, allowed them to roast at the presbytery fire.\n\u2014Report of the Estates of Normandy, 1651\nWhich of the following contributed the LEAST to the health and hunger problems faced by the French people in the seventeenth century?\n\nA.

Low taxes on the peasants and middle class\n\nThe passage describes a dire situation of widespread hunger, disease, and death among the French peasantry in the seventeenth century. It mentions that people are eating mice, inedible roots, and even rotting animal carcasses due to desperation from hunger. The passage also indicates that many are dying daily from famine in the region.\n\nThe options given as potential contributors to this crisis are:\nA. Low-productivity agricultural practices\nB. Adverse weather\nC. Low taxes on the peasants and middle class\nD. Poor transportation\n\nOf these, low taxes on the peasants and middle class (option C) would contribute the least to the health and hunger problems described. In fact, lower taxes might actually have provided some relief to the struggling population by allowing them to keep more of what little resources they had. The other factors listed could all exacerbate the situation by reducing crop yields (low-productivity agricultural practices), destroying crops or making conditions unsuitable for farming (adverse weather), and preventing the efficient distribution of food and aid (poor transportation)."
