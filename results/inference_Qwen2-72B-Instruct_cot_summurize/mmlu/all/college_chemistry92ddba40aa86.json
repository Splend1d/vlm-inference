The pH of a salt solution depends on whether the cation or anion hydrolyzes water to form H\\(^+\\) or OH\\(^-\\) ions.\n\nA. \\(\\text{Na}_2\\text{CO}_3\\) - Sodium carbonate is a strong base due to the bicarbonate ion (\\(HCO_3^-\\)) being a weak acid and its conjugate base (CO\\(_3^{2-}\\)) being able to accept protons from water, increasing the concentration of hydroxide ions (OH\\(^-\\)). Thus, this solution will be basic.\n\nB. \\(\\text{Na}_3\\text{PO}_4\\) - Sodium phosphate also contains a polyatomic anion that can accept protons from water, increasing the concentration of OH\\(^-\\) ions. This makes the solution basic.\n\nC. \\(\\text{Na}_2\\text{S}\\) - Sodium sulfide is even more basic than the others because the sulfide ion (S\\(^{2-}\\)) is a very strong base. It readily accepts protons from water, leading to a high concentration of OH\\(^-\\) ions and making the solution strongly basic.\n\nD. NaCl - Sodium chloride does not affect the pH of water because both the sodium ion (Na\\(^+\\)) and the chloride ion (Cl\\(^-\\)) are spectator ions in water. They do not participate in any significant reactions with water molecules, so the solution remains neutral.\n\nGiven these explanations, the solution that will have the lowest pH is none of the above, as all of them except for NaCl would result in a basic solution (pH > 7). However, if we must choose from the given options, NaCl (option D) would result in the lowest pH because it maintains a neutral pH of about 7, while the other three options would result in solutions with pH values greater than 7 due to their basic nature. \n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nD. NaCl"
