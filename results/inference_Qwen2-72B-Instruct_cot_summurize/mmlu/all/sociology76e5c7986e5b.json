This phenomenon is often associated with suburbanization and the growth of edge cities. While B and C describe important urban trends, they do not specifically define what a decentralized city is. Gentrification (option C) can occur in both centralized and decentralized urban contexts. Option B, while an interesting point about urban public spaces, does not directly relate to the decentralization of a city's structure. Therefore, the most accurate answer to the question of identifying a decentralized city is A."
