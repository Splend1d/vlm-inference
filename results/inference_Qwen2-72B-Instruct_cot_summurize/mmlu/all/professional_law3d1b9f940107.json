On October 31, the owner entered into a written contract with a worker that provided that the worker would be employed for the months of November and December to work at the retail store for $2,000 per month. At the end of November, the owner noticed that business had not increased as much as he had expected. The owner informed the worker that unless he agreed to take a cut in his salary, he would be fired. Reluctantly, on December 1, the worker orally consented to a salary reduction of $500 for the month of December. Which of the following statements regarding the December 1 agreement between the owner and the worked is most accurate?\n\nA. It effectuated a valid reformation of their original written contract.\nB. It effectuated a valid modification of their original written contract.\nC. It effectuated a novation of their original written contract.\nD. It did not alter the rights and obligations of the parties under the terms of their original contract.\n"

On December 1st, the worker orally agreed to a salary reduction for the month of December. This oral agreement to modify the salary for one of the two months covered by the original contract constitutes a modification of the original contract. A modification can be valid even if it's oral, as long as there is consideration (something of value exchanged), which in this case would be the continued employment of the worker in exchange for a reduced salary.\n\nA reformation requires a mutual mistake or misrepresentation, which isn't indicated here. A novation requires the creation of a new contract that replaces the old one completely, which didn't happen since the original contract's terms were simply modified, not replaced. Since the worker agreed to the change, the original contract wasn't left unaltered; it was indeed altered by the modification."
