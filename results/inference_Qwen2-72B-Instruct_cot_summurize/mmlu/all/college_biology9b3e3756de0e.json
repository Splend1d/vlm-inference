They are composed of connexin proteins that form channels connecting the cytoplasm of two adjacent cells. This allows for the exchange of ions, second messengers, and other small molecules, facilitating intercellular communication and coordination.\n\nDesmosomes (both spot and belt) provide strong adhesion between cells and do not facilitate the passage of molecules. Tight junctions seal the space between epithelial cells, preventing the passage of molecules and maintaining the barrier function of the tissue."
