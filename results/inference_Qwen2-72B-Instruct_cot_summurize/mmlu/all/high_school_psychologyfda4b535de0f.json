A stroke in the left cerebral cortex can cause visual agnosia, which is the inability to recognize objects, people, or places despite having intact sensory pathways. This condition can affect the ability to recognize faces, which is called prosopagnosia. The left cerebral cortex is responsible for processing visual information from the right visual field of both eyes, so a stroke in this area can lead to difficulty recognizing people on that side. However, it's important to note that the specific location of the lesion would need to be determined through medical imaging and evaluation by a healthcare professional."
