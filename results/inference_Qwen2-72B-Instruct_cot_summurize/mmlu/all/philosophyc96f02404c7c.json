He believed that virtues were habits that could be developed through practice and that they were necessary for achieving eudaimonia, or human flourishing. However, he also acknowledged that the specific virtues required for eudaimonia could vary depending on context and circumstances. Therefore, his theory was not meant to be rigid or dogmatic, but rather a framework for understanding and cultivating virtuous behavior."
