Kwashiorkor is a form of severe protein-energy malnutrition that occurs most frequently in areas of food scarcity and poverty. It is characterized by edema (oedema), an enlarged liver, and a fatty liver. The primary cause of kwashiorkor is inadequate intake of dietary protein.\n\nAmong the options provided:\n\nA. Altered composition of intestinal bacteria - This can contribute to malabsorption issues and exacerbate malnutrition, potentially playing a role in the development of kwashiorkor.\nB. Low intake of antioxidant nutrients - While antioxidants are important for overall health, their deficiency is not typically cited as a direct cause of kwashiorkor.\nC. Sudden weaning from the breast - This can lead to inadequate nutrition if the diet does not provide sufficient protein and other nutrients after weaning, which can contribute to kwashiorkor.\nD. Iron deficiency - Iron deficiency can lead to anemia, but it is not typically cited as a direct cause of the oedema associated with kwashiorkor.\n\nGiven these explanations, option D (Iron deficiency) is the answer that has not at one point in the past few decades been considered as a direct cause of the oedema of kwashiorkor. However, it's worth noting that iron deficiency could indirectly contribute to the overall severity of malnutrition in cases of kwashiorkor."
