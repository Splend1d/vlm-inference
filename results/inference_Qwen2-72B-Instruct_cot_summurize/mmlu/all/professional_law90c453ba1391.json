When she picked up the car, there was a bill for $5,000 on the dash board. All of the services and parts were workmanlike, not defective and pertained to the areas in the instructions. She refused to pay, claiming that there was no agreement and that the mechanic should have called for advance approval. Can she be held responsible for contractual services performed?\n\nA. No, because there is always an implication that the provider must get permission before doing work not approved.\nB. Yes, because the circumstances and past practice established an implied-in-law contract based on mutual assent.\nC. No, because a contract cannot be based on implications and guess work.\nD. Yes, because the circumstances, including prior practice, showed intent to contract and a meeting of the minds.\n"

Yes, because the circumstances, including prior practice, showed intent to contract and a meeting of the minds.\n\nThe customer left written instructions for the mechanic, which can be considered as an offer for specific services. The mechanic performed the services as requested, which can be seen as acceptance of the offer. Additionally, given that the customer is a long-time regular, there may be an established pattern of behavior that implies consent for the mechanic to perform necessary services without prior approval. This situation demonstrates an implied-in-fact contract, not an implied-in-law contract, based on mutual assent and past dealings between the parties."
