Therefore, increasing the temperature will not cause the volume to increase. However, the other statements are correct because:\n\nA. Increasing the temperature of an ideal gas results in an increase in the average kinetic energy of the molecules, which in turn leads to an increase in their average speed.\n\nB. According to the ideal gas law (PV=nRT), if the volume (V) and the amount of gas (n) remain constant, then an increase in temperature (T) will result in an increase in pressure (P).\n\nC. Kinetic energy is directly proportional to the temperature of the gas. As the temperature increases, so does the kinetic energy of the system."
