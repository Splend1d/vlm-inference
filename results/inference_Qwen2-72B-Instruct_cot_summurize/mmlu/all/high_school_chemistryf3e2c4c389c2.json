In this case, the slow step is the first step:\n\nNO2 + F2 \u2192 NO2F + F\n\nLooking at this step, we see that it involves one molecule of NO2 and one molecule of F2. Therefore, the reaction order with respect to each reactant is 1. Since there are two reactants involved, the overall reaction order is the sum of the individual orders.\n\nThus, the overall reaction order = 1 (for NO2) + 1 (for F2) = 2.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. Second order."
