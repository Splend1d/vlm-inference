Adjoining the farmland was a 50-acre ranch, which was owned by a rancher. In 2004, the rancher forged the farmer's signature on a deed and purported to convey the farmland to a grocer. The grocer paid the rancher $100,000 as the purchase price for the farmland. The following year, the grocer sold the property to a buyer for $125,000. The deed from the grocer to the buyer was properly executed and recorded by the buyer. This jurisdiction has the following \"pure race\" recording statute in effect:\"No conveyance or other instrument is valid as against purchasers for a valuable consideration who record first. \"After the buyer took possession of the farmland, he renovated the farmhouse that was located on the property and made improvements valued at $50,000. In 2006, the farmer returned to visit his sister. During his visit, the farmer went to the farmland to inspect his farmland. While doing so, he encountered the buyer, who informed the farmer that he was the new owner of the property. The farmer thereupon instituted suit to quiet title to the farmland. After judgment was rendered in the farmer's favor, the buyer was ejected from the property. The buyer has now filed an appropriate action against the grocer seeking restitution for the loss he incurred with respect to the purchase and improvements made on the farmland. The buyer will likely recover\n\nA. nothing, because the grocer was also a fraud victim and suffered a substantial financial loss.\nB. $25,000. 00\nC. $50,000. 00\nD. $125,000. 00\n"

                    "text": "The buyer will likely recover D. $125,000.00 from the grocer.\n\nThe reason is that when the buyer purchased the farmland from the grocer, he did so in good faith, believing the grocer had the right to sell the property. The buyer then recorded the deed and made improvements to the property. When the farmer successfully sued to quiet title, it was determined that the grocer did not have the legal right to sell the property, and the sale was invalid. As a result, the buyer lost not only the $125,000 he paid for the property but also the $50,000 he spent on improvements.\n\nUnder these circumstances, the buyer can seek restitution from the grocer for the full amount paid for the property ($125,000) plus the value of any improvements made ($50,000), minus any compensation received from insurance or other sources. However, since the question asks specifically about what the buyer will likely recover in this action against the grocer and does not mention additional compensation or losses, the answer is limited to the purchase price, which is $125,000. The fact that the grocer was also a victim of fraud does not absolve them from responsibility to the buyer, as they represented themselves as having the authority to sell the property."
