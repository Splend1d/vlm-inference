The two stars will look like a single point of light.\n\nWhen the angular separation between two stars is less than the angular resolution of your eyes, they cannot be distinguished as separate objects. Instead, they will be perceived as a single source of light. This is due to the diffraction limit of the eye's optics, which sets a minimum angle below which two points of light cannot be resolved as distinct entities."
