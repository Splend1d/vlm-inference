Prior to beginning the study, Dr. Jang obtained informed consents from the parents of the students as well as assents from the students themselves. During the course of the study, one of the students says he doesn\u2019t want to complete the interview. Dr. Jang should:\n\nA. tell the student that he cannot withdraw from the study since one of his parents has signed an informed consent.\nB. tell the student that he cannot withdraw from the study since he (the student) agreed to participate at the beginning of the study.\nC. contact the student\u2019s parents to ask them to encourage their son to complete the interview.\nD. allow the student to withdraw from the study.\n"

Even though parental consent and child assent were obtained prior to the study, participants have the right to withdraw from the study at any time without penalty or loss of benefits to which they are otherwise entitled. This is a fundamental principle of ethical research practice. Therefore, if a student decides he does not want to complete the interview, Dr. Jang should honor this decision and allow the student to withdraw."
