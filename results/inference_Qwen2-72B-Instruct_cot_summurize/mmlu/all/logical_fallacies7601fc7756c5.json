The term \"discrimination\" is being used in two different senses: the first sense refers to making distinctions or judgments based on qualities or characteristics (as in the examples given about food, music, home decoration, and friends), which is generally considered a normal and necessary part of human decision-making. The second sense of \"discrimination\" refers to treating people unfairly or unequally based on their race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, etc., which is the type of discrimination that laws aim to prevent. By using the same word in two different ways, the argument conflates these two distinct concepts, leading to a misleading conclusion."
