It is the differential survival and reproduction of the most-fit phenotypes.\n\nThis statement best summarizes evolution as understood in modern biology, particularly through the lens of natural selection. Evolution involves changes in the genetic composition of populations over time, often resulting from differences in survival and reproductive success among individuals due to variations in their traits (phenotypes). This process is not goal-directed, nor does it rely on acquired characteristics being passed on to offspring, which was a misconception associated with Lamarckism. Gene flow, while an important mechanism for introducing new genetic variation into a population, is not synonymous with the entire process of evolution."
