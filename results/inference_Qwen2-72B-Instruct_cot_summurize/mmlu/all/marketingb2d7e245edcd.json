If they choose not to take advantage of this early payment discount, they must pay the full amount within 30 days.\n\nSince the store paid the invoice on August 13, which is within 10 days of the purchase date (August 4), they qualify for the 2% discount.\n\nTo calculate the amount paid with the discount:\n\nDiscount amount = 2% of $7,000 = (2/100) * $7,000 = $140\n\nAmount paid = Total amount - Discount amount = $7,000 - $140 = $6,860\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. $6,860."
