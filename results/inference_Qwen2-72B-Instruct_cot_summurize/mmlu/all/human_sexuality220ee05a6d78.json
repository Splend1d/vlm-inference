Positive reinforcement (A) occurs when someone agrees with us, which can increase the likelihood of us enjoying their company and being drawn to them. Agreement from another person (B) can also bolster our self-esteem and reinforce our beliefs about what is right or true. Finally, we often anticipate positive interactions (C) with those who share our attitudes, as these interactions are likely to be harmonious and affirming. Therefore, all three reasons contribute to why we might be attracted to people who are similar to us in attitudes."
