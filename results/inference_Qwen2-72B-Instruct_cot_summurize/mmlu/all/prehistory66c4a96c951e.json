This information is essential for understanding the relationships between different artifacts and features, which can provide insights into the activities that took place at the site and the people who lived there. Recording the precise location and orientation of artifacts in relation to each other and to other features such as postholes, hearths, and pits helps archaeologists reconstruct past human behavior and environmental conditions. While the other options listed (A, C, and D) may also be important aspects of an excavation, the primary reason for leaving artifacts in place initially is to document their spatial contexts and associations."
