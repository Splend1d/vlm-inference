This is also known as Archimedes' principle.\n\nGiven:\n- Volume of the object = \\(2 \\times 10^{-3}\\) m\\(^3\\)\n- Weight of the object = 6 N\n\nFirst, we need to find the mass of the water displaced by the object when it floats. Since the object floats, the weight of the water displaced must be equal to the weight of the object (6 N).\n\nThe density of water is approximately \\(1000\\) kg/m\\(^3\\), and the weight of water can be calculated using its mass and the acceleration due to gravity (\\(g = 9.81\\) m/s\\(^2\\)). The formula for the weight of an object is given by:\n\n\\[Weight = Mass \\times g\\]\n\nSince the weight of the water displaced is equal to the weight of the object, we have:\n\n\\[Mass_{water} \\times g = 6 N\\]\n\nRearranging for the mass of the water:\n\n\\[Mass_{water} = \\frac{6}{g} = \\frac{6}{9.81} \\approx 0.612 kg\\]\n\nThe volume of water displaced can be found using the density of water:\n\n\\[Volume_{displaced} = \\frac{Mass_{water}}{\\rho_{water}} = \\frac{0.612}{1000} = 0.000612 m^3\\]\n\nTo find what percentage of the object's volume is submerged, we divide the volume of water displaced by the total volume of the object and multiply by 100%:\n\n\\[Percentage_{submerged} = \\left(\\frac{0.000612}{2 \\times 10^{-3}}\\right) \\times 100\\% = 30.6\\%\\]\n\nThis means approximately 30.6% of the object's volume is below the water surface, leaving about 69.4% of the volume above the water surface.\n\nHowever, since the question asks for the percentage of the object's volume above the surface of the water, the closest answer choice to our calculated value of 69.4% is:\n\nD. 70%"
