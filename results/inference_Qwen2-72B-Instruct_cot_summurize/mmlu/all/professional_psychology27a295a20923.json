This creates a dual relationship, which is generally considered unethical in professional psychology due to potential conflicts of interest, power imbalances, and the risk of harm to the client (the intern). According to the American Psychological Association's Ethical Principles of Psychologists and Code of Conduct, psychologists should avoid relationships that could impair their objectivity, competence, or effectiveness in performing their functions, or that could exploit or harm others with whom they have a professional relationship."
