During its manufacturing operations, the manufacturer negligentlyallowed quantities of this substance to leak into the soil. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) orderedthat the premises, now owned by an appliance repair shop, be decontaminated. This order, and the subsequent cleanup efforts, received a high level of attention in the local media. An employee of the appliance repair shop has sued the manufacturer in negligence for damages for emotionaldistress. The employee claims to have suffered the distress as a consequence of learning that she has beenexposed for five years, while employed by the appliance repair shop at the premises affected by the EPA order,to the toxic contamination that has existed there. Her complaint does not allege that her emotional distress issevere, that the manufacturer's conduct was extreme and outrageous, or that she has suffered any physicalconsequences. In that action the manufacturer has filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief maybe granted. What is the manufacturer's best argument in support of that motion?\n\nA. The repair shop employee's emotional distress is not alleged to be severe.\nB. The complaint does not allege that the manufacturer's conduct was extreme and outrageous.\nC. The complaint does not allege that the repair shop employee suffered any physical consequences.\nD. The repair shop employee's proper remedy is in a claim against the repair shop, the occupier of thepremises during the period of her alleged exposure.\n"

The repair shop employee's emotional distress is not alleged to be severe.\n\nIn most jurisdictions, for a plaintiff to succeed in a negligence claim for purely emotional distress without accompanying physical injury, the emotional distress must be severe. Since the complaint does not allege that the distress is severe, it may fail to meet the threshold required to state a claim for negligence based on emotional distress alone. The other arguments presented could also be relevant depending on the jurisdiction and specific legal standards applied, but the lack of allegation regarding the severity of emotional distress is a significant deficiency in the complaint under many legal frameworks."
