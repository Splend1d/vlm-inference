However, it would be morally wrong if you chose to drive while being too sleepy to do so safely, but that action is not stated in the scenario provided.\n\nIn scenario 2, omitting peanuts from someone's meal due to an allergy is a considerate and morally correct action, as it prevents harm to that person."
