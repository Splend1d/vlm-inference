                    "text": "To find the area bounded by the parabola \\(y = x^2\\) and the lines \\(y = 1\\) and \\(y = 9\\), we need to integrate with respect to \\(x\\) over the interval where these boundaries intersect.\n\nFirst, let's find the points of intersection between the parabola \\(y = x^2\\) and the lines \\(y = 1\\) and \\(y = 9\\).\n\nFor \\(y = 1\\):\n\\[1 = x^2\\]\n\\[x = \\pm 1\\]\n\nFor \\(y = 9\\):\n\\[9 = x^2\\]\n\\[x = \\pm 3\\]\n\nThus, the points of intersection are at \\(x = -3, -1, 1, 3\\). However, since the lines \\(y = 1\\) and \\(y = 9\\) are horizontal, we only need to consider the intervals \\([-1, 1]\\) for \\(y = 1\\) and \\([-3, 3]\\) for \\(y = 9\\).\n\nThe area under the curve from \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 9\\) is found by integrating the difference between the upper bound (the line \\(y = 9\\)) and the lower bound (the function \\(y = x^2\\)). However, since \\(y = 9\\) is constant, this simplifies to finding the area under \\(y = 9\\) from \\(-3\\) to \\(3\\) and subtracting the area under \\(y = x^2\\) from \\(-1\\) to \\(1\\), then adding back the area under \\(y = x^2\\) from \\(-3\\) to \\(-1\\) and from \\(1\\) to \\(3\\).\n\nLet's calculate:\n\nArea under \\(y = 9\\) from \\(-3\\) to \\(3\\):\n\\[\\int_{-3}^{3} 9 dx = [9x]_{-3}^{3} = 9(3) - 9(-3) = 54\\]\n\nArea under \\(y = x^2\\) from \\(-1\\) to \\(1\\):\n\\[\\int_{-1}^{1} x^2 dx = [\\frac{x^3}{3}]_{-1}^{1} = \\frac{1}{3} - \\frac{-1}{3} = \\frac{2}{3}\\]\n\nArea under \\(y = x^2\\) from \\(-3\\) to \\(-1\\) and from \\(1\\) to \\(3\\):\n\\[\\int_{-3}^{-1} x^2 dx + \\int_{1}^{3} x^2 dx = 2[\\frac{x^3}{3}]_{1}^{3} = 2(\\frac{27}{3} - \\frac{1}{3}) = 2(\\frac{26}{3}) = \\frac{52}{3}\\]\n\nSo, the total area bounded by the parabola \\(y = x^2\\) and the lines \\(y = 1\\) and \\(y = 9\\) is:\n\\[54 - \\frac{2}{3} + \\frac{52}{3} = 54 + \\frac{50}{3} = 54 + 16\\frac{2}{3} = 70\\frac{2}{3}\\]\n\nThis simplified calculation doesn't match any of the options provided directly. The correct approach involves calculating the area above \\(y = 1\\) and below \\(y = 9\\) using definite integrals for both the parabola and the rectangles formed by \\(y = 1\\) and \\(y = 9\\). Let's correct that:\n\nThe area above \\(y = 1\\) and below \\(y = 9\\) is given by:\n\\[2 \\times (\\int_{1}^{3} 9 dx - \\int_{1}^{3} x^2 dx)\\]\n\n\\[= 2 \\times ([9x]_{1}^{3} - [\\frac{x^3}{3}]_{1}^{3})\\]\n\n\\[= 2 \\times ((9(3) - 9(1)) - (\\frac{27}{3} - \\frac{1}{3}))\\]\n\n\\[= 2 \\times ((27 - 9) - (9 - \\frac{1}{3}))\\]\n\n\\[= 2 \\times (18 - 8\\frac{2}{3})\\]\n\n\\[= 2 \\times 9\\frac{1}{3}\\]\n\n\\[= 18\\frac{2}{3}\\]\n\n\\[= 18 + \\frac{2}{3}\\]\n\n\\[= 18\\frac{2}{3}\\]\n\n\\[= \\frac{56}{3}\\]\n\nThe closest option to our result is:\n\nB. 84/3\n\nHowever, this is not exactly what we calculated. Our correct calculation led us to \\(18\\frac{2}{3}\\) or \\(\\frac{56}{3}\\), which is not listed among the choices. It appears there might have been an error in interpreting the question or the answer choices. Given the calculations, none of the provided options exactly match our result of \\(\\frac{56}{3}\\). However, considering the choices given, B. 84/3 is the closest but still not accurate based on our calculations. The correct approach should yield a value closer to our calculated result, indicating a possible misinterpretation of the problem statement or an error in the provided answer choices."
