He believed that all creatures strive towards their ultimate end or perfection, which for humans is union with God and participation in His goodness and truth. This is achieved through virtuous actions and contemplation of divine things, leading to a state of beatitude or happiness in the afterlife. This view is consistent with his theological perspective that God is the source of all goodness, truth, and beauty, and that our ultimate fulfillment can only be found in Him."
