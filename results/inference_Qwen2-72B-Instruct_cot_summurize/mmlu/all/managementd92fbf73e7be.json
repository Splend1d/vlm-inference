Instinct\n\nIntuitive decision making relies on one's instinct, gut feeling, or subconscious knowledge and experience to make choices without conscious reasoning or analysis. While it may sometimes seem like guesswork (A), it is not simply random guessing but rather informed by past experiences and patterns recognized by the brain. It is also distinct from gambling (B), which often involves taking risks based on chance or probability. Unlike rational decision making (D), which is based on logical analysis and explicit information, intuitive decision making occurs more spontaneously and can be particularly useful in situations where there is insufficient time for detailed analysis or when dealing with complex problems that defy clear-cut solutions."
