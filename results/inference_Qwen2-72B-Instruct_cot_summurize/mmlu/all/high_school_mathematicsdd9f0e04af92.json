So, the probability of drawing a second red marble is \\(\\frac{3}{9} = \\frac{1}{3}\\).\nThus, the probability of drawing two red marbles in a row is: \\(\\frac{4}{10} * \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{4}{30} = \\frac{2}{15}\\).\n\nNext, let's calculate the probability of drawing two blue marbles in a row:\n- The probability of drawing the first blue marble is \\(\\frac{6}{10}\\) because there are 6 blue marbles out of a total of 10.\n- Since the first marble is not replaced, there are now 5 blue marbles left out of a total of 9 marbles. So, the probability of drawing a second blue marble is \\(\\frac{5}{9}\\).\nThus, the probability of drawing two blue marbles in a row is: \\(\\frac{6}{10} * \\frac{5}{9} = \\frac{30}{90} = \\frac{1}{3}\\).\n\nTo find the total probability of drawing two marbles of the same color, we add the probabilities of drawing two red marbles and drawing two blue marbles:\n\\(\\frac{2}{15} + \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{2}{15} + \\frac{5}{15} = \\frac{7}{15}\\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. \\(\\boxed{\\frac{7}{15}}\\)."
