He takes nitroglycerin as needed and one aspirin daily. He has smoked two packs of cigarettes daily for 30 years. Examination shows normal heart sounds and no carotid or femoral bruits. Treatment with a \u03b2-adrenergic blocking agent is most likely to improve his symptoms due to which of the following mechanisms?\n\nA. Decreasing myocardial contractility\nB. Dilating the coronary arteries\nC. Peripheral vasodilation\nD. Preventing fibrin and platelet plugs\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is A. Decreasing myocardial contractility.\n\nBeta-blockers reduce the heart rate and decrease myocardial contractility, which in turn decreases myocardial oxygen demand. This can help to relieve angina (crushing substernal chest pain) by decreasing the workload on the heart and thus reducing the amount of oxygen the heart muscle requires during physical activity. Beta-blockers do not dilate coronary arteries (option B) or cause peripheral vasodilation (option C), although they can have an indirect effect on peripheral resistance. They also do not prevent fibrin and platelet plugs (option D); that would be the role of antiplatelet agents like aspirin.\n\nIn this case, given the patient's history of myocardial infarction and ongoing angina, beta-blocker therapy would be appropriate to manage his symptoms and potentially prevent future cardiac events by decreasing the heart's oxygen demand."
