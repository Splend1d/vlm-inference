Although you could potentially derive \\(P(E,F|H)\\) from \\(P(E|H)\\) and \\(P(F|H)\\) if \\(E\\) and \\(F\\) were conditionally independent given \\(H\\), but since it is explicitly stated that there is no conditional independence information, we cannot assume this.

Therefore, this set is insufficient.\n\nD. \\(P(E, F), P(E|H), P(F|H)\\)\n\nSimilar to option A, this set does not provide \\(P(E,F|H)\\) or any direct means to derive it without assuming conditional independence between \\(E\\) and \\(F\\) given \\(H\\).
