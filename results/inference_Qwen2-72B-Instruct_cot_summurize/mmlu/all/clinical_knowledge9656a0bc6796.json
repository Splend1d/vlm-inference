Itching may be a sign of obstructive jaundice.\n\nJaundice is characterized by yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes due to high levels of bilirubin in the blood. In obstructive jaundice, the flow of bile is blocked, often by a gallstone or tumor in the bile ducts. This can lead to itching as well as other symptoms like pale stools and dark urine. However, pale stools and dark urine are not specific to hemolytic anemia-induced jaundice (option A). Bilirubin is actually a breakdown product of heme, which is part of red blood cells, but it is not used by the liver in the synthesis of red blood cells (option B). Option D is incorrect because proper infection control measures should always be taken when handling blood samples, regardless of the source or condition of the patient."
