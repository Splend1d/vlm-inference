These studies were a series of experiments conducted at the Hawthorne Works of the Western Electric Company in the 1920s and 1930s to investigate the effects of working conditions on productivity. The results suggested that workers' productivity increased when they felt they were being observed and treated well, leading to the development of human relations theory in management."
