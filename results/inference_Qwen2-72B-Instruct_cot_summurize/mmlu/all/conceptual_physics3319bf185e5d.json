Increasing the temperature of water beyond this point will cause it to boil, assuming the atmospheric pressure remains constant.\n\nFor water to freeze (transition from liquid to solid), it needs to be subjected to:\n\nA. decreased temperatures\n\nAt standard atmospheric pressure, water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius. Decreasing the temperature of water below this point will cause it to freeze, again assuming atmospheric pressure remains constant.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that atmospheric pressure also plays a role in these phase changes. For example, water will boil at lower temperatures at higher altitudes where atmospheric pressure is lower. Conversely, increasing atmospheric pressure will raise the boiling point of water. Similarly, while freezing point is less affected by pressure than boiling point, extreme pressures can affect the freezing point of water as well. But in the context of your question, the primary factors for boiling and freezing are temperature increases and decreases, respectively."
