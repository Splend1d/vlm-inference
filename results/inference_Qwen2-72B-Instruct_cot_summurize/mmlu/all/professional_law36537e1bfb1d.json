Before the seller signed the offer form or deposited the check, he received an offer of his full asking price of $120,000 from another party. The seller called the purchaser and called the deal off. The purchaser sued for specific performance on the basis that the oral understanding, along with the written offer and the check, constituted an enforceable agreement. Will the purchaser likely prevail?\n\nA. Yes, because there was an oral agreement and the check for the down payment was evidence of consideration being paid.\nB. No, because the offer was not accepted \u0080\u0094 prior to an acceptance the seller had the right to sell to anyone.\nC. Yes, because the buyer and seller had a meeting of the minds evidenced by their oral understanding, the check and the written offer.\nD. No, because specific performance does not apply in a residential real estate transaction.\n"

No, because the offer was not accepted \u2014 prior to an acceptance the seller had the right to sell to anyone.\n\nIn this situation, the seller did not sign the written offer, which means the offer was not accepted. Without a formal acceptance, there is no binding contract. The seller is free to accept other offers until a contract is formally executed. While the oral agreement and the check may indicate intent to enter into a contract, they do not constitute a legally binding agreement without formal acceptance. Additionally, specific performance can be sought in real estate transactions under certain circumstances, but it would not apply if there was no valid contract to begin with."
