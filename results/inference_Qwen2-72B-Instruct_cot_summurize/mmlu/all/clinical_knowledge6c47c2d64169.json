Normal saline.\n\nWhen dealing with a blocked catheter following a transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP), normal saline is commonly used for bladder washout. This is because it is isotonic and less likely to cause electrolyte imbalances or other complications compared to other solutions that may have different osmolarities or contain substances that could irritate the bladder lining. Solutions R and G are not standard terminology in medical practice and are not recognized as specific types of irrigation solutions. Therefore, option D (any of the above) is incorrect since not all options listed are suitable for this purpose."
