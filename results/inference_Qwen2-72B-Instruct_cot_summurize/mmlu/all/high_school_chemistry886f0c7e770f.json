Grind the nail into very small, dust-sized particles, and spray them into a flame.\n\nWhen you grind the nail into a fine powder, you greatly increase its surface area, which allows it to react more quickly with oxygen. Spraying this powder into a flame will cause it to ignite and burn rapidly due to the high surface area and the presence of sufficient oxygen for combustion. This process is akin to what happens in a thermite reaction, where finely divided metallic iron and aluminum powder are ignited in the presence of iron oxide (rust) to produce a spectacular exothermic reaction that generates extremely high temperatures.\n\nOptions A and B involve heating the nail to a high temperature using either a Bunsen burner or an oxyacetylene torch. While these methods can certainly heat the nail to a point where it may oxidize and \"burn,\" they are not as efficient as increasing the surface area of the nail as in option C. The nail would have to reach a very high temperature to burn in air because iron has a relatively high ignition temperature.\n\nOption D involves dissolving the nail in acid, which does not actually burn the nail but rather reacts chemically with it to form iron salts and hydrogen gas. This is a chemical reaction, not a combustion process."
