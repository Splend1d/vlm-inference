                    "text": "The correct answer is D.\n\nWhen we have a solid, metal object with a non-uniform charge distribution on its surface, the electric field inside the conductor will still be zero because the electric field within a conductor is always zero when it reaches electrostatic equilibrium (this is why charges in conductors move to the surface). However, this does not tell us about the electric field outside the object.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the electric field outside the object is not necessarily zero; it depends on the charge distribution on the surface.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the electric field inside a conductor is zero, whereas the electric field outside can be nonzero depending on the charge distribution.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the electric field outside a charged object is not directly proportional to the distance away from the center of mass of the object. In fact, for spherical symmetry, the electric field outside is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the center of the sphere (if the object is spherically symmetric), according to Gauss's law.\n\nOption D is correct because the electric field just outside the surface of a charged conductor is indeed given by E = \u03c3/\u03b5\u2080, where \u03c3 is the surface charge density at any location on the surface and \u03b5\u2080 is the permittivity of free space. This equation comes from applying Gauss's law to an infinitesimally thin Gaussian surface just outside the conductor's surface."
