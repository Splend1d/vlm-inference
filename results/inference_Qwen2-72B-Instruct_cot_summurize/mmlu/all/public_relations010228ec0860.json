The activists are waging an intense internet campaign against the practice. Your utility has overwhelming evidence of the health benefits to fluoridated water. The manager of the utility asks you to initiate a blog to get the health message out. What is the most appropriate course of action?\n\nA. Use utility employees to write the blog, posing as dentists and physicians.\nB. Recruit a group of volunteer dentists and physicians to write the blog under their own identities with no reference to the utility.\nC. Write the blog yourself, identifying yourself as an employee of the utility, and quote the scientific opinions of a variety of sources.\nD. Compensate a group of dentists and physicians to write the blog, identifying the utility as the sponsor of the blog but without disclosing the compensation.\n"

Write the blog yourself, identifying yourself as an employee of the utility, and quote the scientific opinions of a variety of sources. This approach maintains transparency and honesty with the public while presenting the health benefits of fluoridated water based on reliable scientific evidence. It also allows you to address any concerns or misinformation raised by the activists in a professional and factual manner. Using employees to pose as medical professionals (option A) or compensating professionals without disclosing it (option D) would be unethical and could damage the utility's reputation if discovered. Option B may not have the same level of authority since the professionals are writing as volunteers without the backing of the utility."
