A completely randomized design with 24 treatment groups.\n\nTo see why this is the case, consider that there are four temperature levels, two types of pans, and three types of ovens being tested. In a completely randomized design, each combination of these factors is considered a separate treatment group. Thus, the total number of treatment groups is the product of the number of levels of each factor:\n\n4 (temperature levels) x 2 (types of pans) x 3 (types of ovens) = 24 treatment groups\n\nTherefore, the manufacturer would need to randomly assign cakes to each of the 24 treatment groups to test the effects of the different factors on cake texture. This would allow the manufacturer to determine whether any of the factors have a significant effect on texture, and how they interact with one another."
