However, he did not anticipate the significant impact that technological advancements could have on increasing agricultural productivity and thus raising the Earth's carrying capacity for human populations. This has been demonstrated through various agricultural revolutions, such as the Green Revolution in the 20th century, which significantly increased food production and allowed populations to grow beyond what Malthus predicted."
