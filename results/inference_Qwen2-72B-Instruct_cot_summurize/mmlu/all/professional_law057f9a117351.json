Be contained in a signed writing which gives assurance that the offer will be held open.\nC. State the period of time for which it is irrevocable.\n\nAccording to Section 2-205 of the UCC, an offer by a merchant to buy or sell goods in a signed writing which by its terms gives assurance that it will be held open is not revocable, for lack of consideration, during the time stated or for a reasonable time not exceeding three months. If no time is stated, the offer is held open for a reasonable time but not to exceed three months.\n\nAdditionally, while A is true in that the offer must often be between merchants, it's not a complete requirement for the offer to be irrevocable. And D is incorrect because there is no prohibition against the offer being contained in a form supplied by the offeror."
