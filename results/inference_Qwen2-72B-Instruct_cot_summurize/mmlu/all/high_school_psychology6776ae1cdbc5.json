This disorder is characterized by a long-standing pattern of disregard for the rights of others, deceitfulness, impulsivity, irritability and aggression, reckless disregard for safety, and lack of remorse. The onset of symptoms typically begins in childhood or adolescence with Conduct Disorder, which often progresses to ASPD in adulthood.\n\nHere's a brief explanation of the other disorders mentioned:\n\nB. Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID) - This disorder involves the presence of two or more distinct identities or personality states that recurrently take control of behavior. It is often associated with severe trauma in early life.\n\nC. Paranoid Schizophrenia - This is a subtype of schizophrenia where the individual experiences delusions or hallucinations that are predominantly of a persecutory or grandiose nature. They may also show disorganized speech and behavior, but these are not as prominent as the delusions or hallucinations.\n\nD. Somatoform Disorders - These disorders involve physical symptoms that suggest physical disorders but cannot be fully explained by any known medical condition. They are thought to be due to psychological factors rather than a physical cause.\n\nIn this case, the description best fits with Antisocial Personality Disorder. However, it's important to note that only a qualified mental health professional can make an accurate diagnosis after a thorough evaluation."
