Results show an increased incidence of upper respiratory tract infections among these students during finals week. It is hypothesized that the stress of studying for examinations adversely affects the immune system, making the students more susceptible to infection. Which of the following laboratory findings in these students during examination week is most likely to support this hypothesis?\n\nA. Decreased AM serum cortisol concentration\nB. Decreased macrophage activity\nC. Increased basophil count\nD. Increased lymphocyte count\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is B. Decreased macrophage activity.\n\nMacrophages play a crucial role in the immune system by phagocytosing pathogens and presenting antigens to T cells. Stress has been shown to decrease the activity of macrophages, which could result in a decreased ability to fight off infections such as the common cold. This finding would support the hypothesis that stress adversely affects the immune system, leading to an increased susceptibility to infection during examination week.\n\nDecreased AM serum cortisol concentration (option A) would not be expected since cortisol levels typically increase in response to stress. Increased basophil count (option C) and increased lymphocyte count (option D) are not typically associated with stress-induced immunosuppression."
