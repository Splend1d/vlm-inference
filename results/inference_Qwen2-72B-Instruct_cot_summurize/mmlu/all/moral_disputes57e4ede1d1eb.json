Hate speech typically refers to speech that is intended to degrade or demean a group based on race, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender identity, etc., often involving threats or expressions of violence. Sexist speech might include subtle biases, stereotypes, or microaggressions that do not rise to the level of hate speech but still perpetuate harmful attitudes towards women or people of a certain gender."
