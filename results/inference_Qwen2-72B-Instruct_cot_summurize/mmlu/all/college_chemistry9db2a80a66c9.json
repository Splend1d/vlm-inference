However, since the two methyl groups are equivalent, we only consider three unique hydrogen atoms (as the other three are identical to these).\n\nThus, we have:\n\n- 1 nitrogen atom (\\( ^{14}N \\) with \\( I = \\frac{1}{2} \\))\n- 3 equivalent hydrogen atoms (\\( ^1H \\) with \\( I = \\frac{1}{2} \\))\n\nSo, \\( N = 1 + 3 = 4 \\) (the number of equivalent nuclei with non-zero spin).\n\nUsing the formula for the number of lines:\n\\[ n = 2N + 1 = 2 \\times 4 + 1 = 9 \\]\n\nHowever, none of the options provided match this result, which suggests there might have been an oversight in the question formulation or the answer choices given. Given the options, the closest to our calculated value is not listed, but based on the provided choices and assuming there's no error in the question's setup from your side, the correct choice isn't listed among A-D.\n\nYet, if we were to select the most reasonable answer based on common scenarios, the interaction between the electron spin and the nuclear spins of the nitrogen and hydrogen would typically result in a more complex pattern than what the simple formula suggests due to potential hyperfine coupling constants differences. But without further details about the coupling constants and their relative strengths, it's challenging to predict any splitting beyond the simple calculation.\n\nGiven the options you've provided, none directly matches our calculation, and thus, based purely on the information and the formula applied, the question seems to lack the correct option. If we must choose, though, none of the options (A-D) aligns with our calculation of 9 lines. Therefore, the question as posed with the given answer choices does not allow for a precise selection based on standard EPR principles."
