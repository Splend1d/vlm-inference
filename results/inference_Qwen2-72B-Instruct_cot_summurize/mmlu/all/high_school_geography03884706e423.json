While there was some Asian immigration during this period, the majority of immigrants during this time came from Eastern and Southern Europe. The peak of Asian immigration actually occurred later, after the passage of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965. So the correct answer would be:\n\nB. 1870\u20131914\u2014Asians\n\nHowever, it's important to note that immigration patterns are complex and not all groups can be neatly categorized into these time periods. For example, Chinese immigrants came in large numbers during the mid-19th century to work on the transcontinental railroad, but faced severe restrictions under the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882. Other Asian groups such as Japanese and Filipinos also immigrated to the United States before 1914, but they were not the dominant group during this time period."
