People who have a sense of generativity often feel a strong desire to contribute to society, help others, and leave a positive legacy. This can lead them to reflect on their life experiences and share them with others, either through storytelling or other forms of expression. Therefore, life stories are more likely for people who have a sense of generativity. While well-being, personal control, and humor may also contribute to a person's inclination to share their life story, they are not as directly related to this behavior as generativity is."
