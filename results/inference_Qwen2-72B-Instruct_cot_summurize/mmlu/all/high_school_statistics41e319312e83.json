Matched pairs comparison of population means.\n\nSince the same engines are being tested under two different conditions (with and without the additive), this setup is a matched pairs design. The response variable being measured is continuous (engine lifespan), so comparing population means would be appropriate. This allows the manufacturer to assess whether there is a significant difference in the mean engine lifespan between the two conditions."
