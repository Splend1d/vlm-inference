                    "text": "The disappearance of sound at an angle of 45 degrees due to diffraction can be explained by the single-slit diffraction pattern for light, which has a similar mathematical treatment. The first minimum in the intensity pattern occurs when the sine of the diffraction angle (\u03b8) multiplied by the wavelength (\u03bb) equals the slit width (a). This can be represented as:\n\n\\[ a \\sin(\\theta) = n\\lambda \\]\n\nwhere \\(n\\) is the order of the diffraction minimum. For the first minimum (\\(n=1\\)), this equation becomes:\n\n\\[ a \\sin(\\theta) = \\lambda \\]\n\nGiven that the angle \u03b8 is 45 degrees, we can use the fact that \\(\\sin(45^\\circ) = \\sqrt{2}/2\\), and the speed of sound (\\(v\\)) is given as 350 m/s. We need to find the frequency (\\(f\\)), which is related to the wavelength by the equation:\n\n\\[ v = f\\lambda \\]\n\nSubstituting \\(\\lambda = a \\sin(\\theta)\\) into this equation gives:\n\n\\[ v = f(a \\sin(\\theta)) \\]\n\nSolving for \\(f\\) gives:\n\n\\[ f = \\frac{v}{a \\sin(\\theta)} \\]\n\nSubstituting the values for \\(v\\), \\(a\\), and \\(\\sin(\\theta)\\) gives:\n\n\\[ f = \\frac{350}{0.14 \\times \\sqrt{2}/2} \\]\n\n\\[ f = \\frac{350}{0.14 \\times 0.7071} \\]\n\n\\[ f = \\frac{350}{0.098994} \\]\n\n\\[ f \\approx 3536.43 \\text{ Hz} \\]\n\nThis value is closest to option D, 3,500 Hz.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **D. 3,500 Hz**."
