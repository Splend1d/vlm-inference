According to Socrates' philosophy, as presented in Plato's dialogues, he believes that it is the duty of every individual to pursue virtue and justice. He holds that no one willingly chooses evil or acts immorally out of knowledge; instead, people act wrongly due to ignorance. Therefore, corrupting others would go against his pursuit of wisdom and virtue, which he considers his most important duty.\n\nAdditionally, Socrates believes that true happiness and goodness come from living a virtuous life, and harming others would be contrary to achieving such a life. He asserts that the unexamined life is not worth living and that it is better to suffer wrong than to commit it. Thus, corrupting others would not only be against his duty but would also undermine his own moral integrity and the pursuit of the good life."
