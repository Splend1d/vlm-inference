This means there is less acid available to react with the base.\n\nThe equivalence point is the point at which the moles of acid equal the moles of base added. If there is less acid due to decomposition, it takes less base to reach this point. Therefore, the volume of NaOH required to reach the equivalence point will be lower than it would have been without decomposition.\n\nHowever, the endpoint is determined by the indicator used in the titration. If the indicator is chosen properly, it should change color close to the equivalence point. But if less acid is present due to decomposition, the indicator might change color earlier, i.e., at a lower volume of added base, leading the experimenter to stop adding base before reaching the true equivalence point.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\nC. The endpoint would be before the ideal equivalence point."
