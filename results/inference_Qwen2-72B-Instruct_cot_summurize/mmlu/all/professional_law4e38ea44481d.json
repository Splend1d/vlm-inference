Along with the mirror itself, the manufacturer provided brackets and bolts to be used for hanging the mirror. The grocery store paid a local carpenter to come in and hang the mirror. A few days after the carpenter installed the mirror, the mirror suddenly fell from the wall because of a defect in the brackets. It struck a shopper on the head, causing serious injuries to him. If the shopper asserts a claim against the carpenter based on strict liability in tort, the plaintiff will\n\nA. prevail, because the brackets were defective when installed.\nB. prevail, because it would be abnormally dangerous to maintain such a large mirror on the wall of a retail outlet.\nC. not prevail, because the carpenter was not engaged in the sale of the mirror.\nD. not prevail, because the carpenter had no relationship of privily with the plaintiff.\n"

In this case, the carpenter was not involved in the manufacture or sale of the mirror or its mounting hardware (the brackets). The carpenter's role was to install the mirror using the provided hardware. Since the carpenter did not create the defect nor was involved in the product's distribution chain, strict liability would not apply to them. The shopper may have grounds to sue the manufacturer of the brackets for strict liability, but not the carpenter."
