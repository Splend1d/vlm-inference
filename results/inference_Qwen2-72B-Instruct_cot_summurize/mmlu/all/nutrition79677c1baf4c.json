It plays a critical role in cholesterol homeostasis by mediating the uptake of cholesterol-rich LDL particles from the bloodstream into liver cells and other cell types throughout the body. The other proteins listed\u2014NPC1L1, ACAT2, and ABCG5/G8\u2014are all involved in cholesterol absorption in the small intestine.\n\n- NPC1L1 (Niemann-Pick C1-like 1) is a protein that facilitates the uptake of dietary cholesterol and plant sterols in the small intestine.\n- ACAT2 (acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase 2) is an enzyme that esterifies absorbed cholesterol to form cholesteryl esters for incorporation into lipoproteins.\n- ABCG5/G8 (ATP-binding cassette subfamily G member 5 and 8) are transporters that export excess cholesterol and plant sterols from enterocytes back into the intestinal lumen, preventing their excessive absorption."
