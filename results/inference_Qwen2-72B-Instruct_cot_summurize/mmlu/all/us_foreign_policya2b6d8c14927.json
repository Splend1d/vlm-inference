Signed in 1991 by the United States and the Soviet Union, START I set limits on the number of strategic nuclear warheads and delivery vehicles that each side could possess. It also established a framework for inspections and verification measures to ensure compliance with the treaty's provisions. The treaty entered into force in December 1994 and expired in December 2009, but its successor, New START, was signed in 2010 and remains in effect as of 2023."
