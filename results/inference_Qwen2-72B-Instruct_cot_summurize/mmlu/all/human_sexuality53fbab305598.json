However, according to various studies and research, paraphilic interests, which include fetishism, often become apparent during adolescence or early adulthood. Therefore, among the options you've provided, option C (10 through 20) or D (20 through 30) might be closer to when individuals might start to recognize or act on their fetishistic preferences. It's important to note that these interests may not necessarily develop suddenly but can evolve over time. Also, it's crucial to differentiate between harmless fetishes and those that cause distress to oneself or others, which could be considered problematic and may require professional guidance."
