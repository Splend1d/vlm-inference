The drug, which is tasteless, is administered in a cup of orange juice; the other patients receive pure orange juice. Neither the nurses, doctors, nor the patients know which patients receive the drug. At the end of the study period, the number of CD4+ T cells is determined for all of the subjects.

In this type of study, a group of people (the cohort) is identified and then divided into those who will be exposed to a certain factor (in this case, the new drug) and those who will not. Both groups are followed over time to determine if there are differences in outcomes between the two groups. In this study, the outcome being measured is the number of CD4+ T cells at the end of the study period. The fact that neither the nurses, doctors, nor the patients know which patients receive the drug makes it a double-blind study, which helps to minimize bias."
