According to this theory, first proposed by Stanley Schachter and Jerome Singer in the 1960s, emotional experience is determined by both physiological arousal and cognitive interpretation of that arousal. In Susan's case, the same physiological responses (increased blood pressure, heart rate, and body temperature) were interpreted differently based on the context: as anger in traffic and as amorousness with her husband."
