Authority typically refers to the power or right to give orders, make decisions, and enforce obedience within an organization. In this context, \"Executive,\" \"Functional,\" and \"Line Management\" are recognized types of authority:\n\n1. Executive authority: Refers to the highest level of decision-making power within an organization, usually held by the CEO or other top-level executives.\n2. Functional authority: Refers to the authority granted to individuals or departments over specific functions or areas of expertise (e.g., finance, marketing, human resources).\n3. Line management authority: Refers to the authority held by managers who have direct responsibility for overseeing employees and ensuring that work is completed as required.\n\nOn the other hand, suppliers are external entities that provide goods or services to an organization but do not hold any authority within the organization's hierarchy."
