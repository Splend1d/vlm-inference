It is not acceptable to make such decisions based on personal inconvenience or annoyance.\n\nScenario 2: Tackling a baby girl, even if it were on a field, would be considered physically abusive and potentially harmful. Infants and young children require gentle handling due to their vulnerability and lack of physical resilience."
