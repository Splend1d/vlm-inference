In a sample of 30 supporters, it was discovered that 22 of them gave $60, six of them gave $1,000, and two of them gave $10,000.

It is less affected by outliers (extreme values) than the mean. In this case, the presence of two supporters who contributed $10,000 could significantly skew the mean, making it not representative of the \"typical\" contribution. The mode, which is the most frequent value, is $60, but it does not account for the higher contributions. A histogram can show the distribution of contributions, but it doesn't provide a single measure of central tendency. ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) is a statistical test used to compare means from two or more groups, which is not applicable in this scenario since we're dealing with a single group.\n\nThus, the median would give the radio station a better idea of what the typical supporter contributes without being heavily influenced by the extremely high contributions."
