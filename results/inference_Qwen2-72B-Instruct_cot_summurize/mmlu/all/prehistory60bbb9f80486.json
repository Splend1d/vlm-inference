This is evidence of new uses for plants during the Middle Stone Age, specifically for bedding and possibly for comfort or insulation. The other options may also indicate the use of plants, but they do not necessarily represent new uses during the Middle Stone Age. A refers to the use of seeds as an insecticide, which is not necessarily a new use; B refers to the use of flowers in burials, which may be symbolic rather than utilitarian; and D refers to the use of wood for tools and transport, which is not necessarily a new use for plants."
