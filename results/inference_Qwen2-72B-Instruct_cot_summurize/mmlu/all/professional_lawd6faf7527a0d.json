On June 1, 2005, the woman sells to a husband and wife an undivided one-half interest in this land for $100,000 (the entire consideration being paid by the husband). The deed to the husband and wife reads as follows: \"To (husband) and (wife) and their heirs as tenants by the entirety, and not as joint tenants, and not as tenants in common. \"On June 1, 2006, the woman sells her remaining interest in the tract of land to the husband and his brother for $125,000 (the husband pays $80,000 of the purchase price, and the brother pays the balance). The deed to the husband and the brother provides: \"To (the husband) and (the brother) and their heirs as joint tenants and not as tenants in common. \"The husband conveys to his cousin all his right, title, and interest under the two deeds from the woman.

                    "text": "The correct answer is D. an undivided three-quarters interest in the land.\n\nHere's why:\n\nFirst sale:\n- The woman sells an undivided one-half interest in the land to the husband and wife as tenants by the entirety.\n- Upon the death of either spouse, the entire interest would pass to the surviving spouse, so when the husband dies, the wife becomes the sole owner of this one-half interest.\n\nSecond sale:\n- The woman sells her remaining one-half interest in the land to the husband and his brother as joint tenants.\n- When the husband dies, his interest passes to the brother by the right of survivorship because they hold the property as joint tenants. However, before the husband's death, he conveyed his interest to his cousin.\n- Thus, upon the husband's death, his interest does not pass to the brother but instead to the cousin.\n- When the brother dies, since the brother held the full interest conveyed by the husband plus his own portion, the cousin inherits the brother's entire share due to the joint tenancy with right of survivorship.\n\nGiven that:\n- The cousin inherited the husband's share from both transactions (one half of the first sale and a third of the second sale).\n- The cousin also inherited the brother's share from the second transaction (two thirds of the second sale).\n\nThe cousin's interest is calculated as follows:\n- From the first sale: 1/2 (originally owned by the husband)\n- From the second sale: 1/3 (originally owned by the husband) + 2/3 (originally owned by the brother)\n\nAdding these together gives the cousin a total interest of:\n1/2 + 1/3 + 2/3 = 1/2 + 1 = 3/2 or 1 1/2 interests, but since we can't have more than a whole interest in real estate, this calculation simply reflects that the cousin has the entirety of the second sale's interest plus half from the first sale.\n\nIn terms of the overall property interest, the cousin now owns:\n- 1/2 (from the first sale) + 1/2 (the entire second sale's interest) = 1 (or 100% of the second sale's interest) + 1/2 (from the first sale)\n\nTherefore, the cousin owns an undivided three-quarters interest in the land. This accounts for the entire interest from the second sale (which was 1/2 of the total land) and half of the interest from the first sale (also 1/2 of the total land), resulting in 3/4 of the total land."
