                    "text": "When a company performs a stock split, such as the 5-for-1 split that Alto Co. executed, it does not change the par value per share. The par value is a nominal amount and does not reflect the market value of the stock. It's set by the company's charter and remains constant unless changed by a formal amendment.\n\nBefore the split, Alto Co. had 10,000 shares of $10 par value common stock. After the 5-for-1 split, each share would be split into 5 shares, resulting in 50,000 shares outstanding. However, the total par value of all the shares combined remains the same.\n\nTotal par value before the split = 10,000 shares * $10 = $100,000\n\nAfter the split, there are 50,000 shares, but the total par value should still equal $100,000. Therefore, the par value per share after the split is calculated as:\n\n$100,000 / 50,000 shares = $2 per share\n\nHowever, this calculation reflects what the new par value per share would be if the company chose to adjust the par value to maintain the same total par value. In reality, companies do not typically change the par value per share due to a stock split. Instead, they leave the par value unchanged, which means that after the split, each of the new shares would still have a par value of $10.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer to your question is:\n\nA. Remained at $10."
