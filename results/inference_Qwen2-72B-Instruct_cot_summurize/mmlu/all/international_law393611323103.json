Personal immunity is afforded to State officials for conduct undertaken in a public capacity.\n\nPersonal (ratione personae) immunity typically refers to the legal protection granted to certain state officials, such as heads of state, diplomats, and other high-ranking officials, for actions carried out in their official capacity. This immunity can shield them from legal proceedings in foreign courts during their term of office. It is important to note that personal immunity does not apply to actions taken in a private capacity or after the official has left office."
