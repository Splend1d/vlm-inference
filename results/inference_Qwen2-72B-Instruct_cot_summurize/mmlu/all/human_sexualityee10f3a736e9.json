While it is true that people who have liberal attitudes about premarital sex may also have more permissive views about extramarital sex, this does not mean they will automatically engage in such behavior, either accidentally or intentionally.\n\nIt's important to understand that attitudes and behaviors are not always perfectly correlated. A person may hold certain beliefs but choose not to act on them for various reasons, including personal values, religious beliefs, social norms, fear of consequences, or simply a lack of opportunity.\n\nMoreover, \"open swinging\" refers to a specific subculture where couples engage in consensual non-monogamy, often swapping partners for sexual activities. This is a distinct lifestyle choice that may or may not be related to one's views on premarital sex. People can have liberal attitudes toward premarital sex without participating in swinging.\n\nIn conclusion, while there might be some correlation between liberal attitudes about premarital sex and more permissive views on extramarital sex, it would be an overgeneralization to assume that all individuals with such attitudes will engage in extramarital sex or swinging."
