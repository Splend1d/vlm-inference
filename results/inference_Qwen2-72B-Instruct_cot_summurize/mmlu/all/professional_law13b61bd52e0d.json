The retailer emailed a note back saying \"Please send 10 truckloads as promised.\" No shipment was sent, but four months later when the market demand for widgets skyrocketed, the retailer sued the manufacturer for breach claiming that the retailer suffered damages by not having received the shipment of ten trucks as agreed. Does the retailer have a legal right to collect damages under these facts?\n\nA. Yes, there is a specific and detailed enough offer, followed by an unequivocal acceptance, indicating an intent to form a contract.\nB. No, the parties do not set a date for delivery, which always invalidates a contract between merchants for the delivery of goods.\nC. No, the retailer never called back and asked for the widgets, which means that the contract was not finally confirmed and legalized.\nD. Yes, the retailer is entitled to collect damages because the manufacturer violated the doctrine of avoidable consequences.\n"

Yes, there is a specific and detailed enough offer, followed by an unequivocal acceptance, indicating an intent to form a contract.\n\nThe manufacturer made a clear offer to sell ten truckloads of construction-quality widgets at a specified price per truckload, and the retailer accepted this offer in writing by stating, \"Please send 10 truckloads as promised.\" This exchange meets the requirements for forming a binding contract, including an offer, acceptance, consideration (the price), and mutual assent. Therefore, the retailer has a legal right to collect damages if the manufacturer failed to deliver the widgets as agreed upon.\n\nOption B is incorrect because while it's true that specifying a delivery date can be important in a contract, the absence of a specific delivery date does not necessarily invalidate a contract between merchants. Option C is incorrect because the retailer's email constitutes acceptance of the offer, not just an inquiry or request for confirmation. Option D is incorrect because the doctrine of avoidable consequences refers to the duty of the non-breaching party to mitigate their damages, not to the existence of a breach itself."
