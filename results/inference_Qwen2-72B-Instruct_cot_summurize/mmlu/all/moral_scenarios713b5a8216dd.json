This action could potentially save a life or prevent harm, and thus is not considered morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character's decision to go to bed after covering a small hole in a military submarine with a band-aid is clearly morally wrong. The hole could lead to a dangerous situation, possibly endangering lives, and the main character should have taken appropriate action to fix the issue or alert someone who could handle the repair properly."
