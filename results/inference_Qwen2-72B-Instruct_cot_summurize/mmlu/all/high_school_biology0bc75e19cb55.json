Endosymbiotic model\n\nThe endosymbiotic theory proposes that mitochondria and chloroplasts, which are organelles found in eukaryotic cells, evolved from ancient prokaryotic cells that were engulfed by larger cells. Over time, these prokaryotic cells became symbionts, living within the larger cells and eventually evolving into the organelles we know today. This theory explains why mitochondria and chloroplasts have their own DNA and ribosomes, characteristics typically associated with prokaryotes."
