It's triggered by specific stimuli (in this case, the shape of a predator overhead) and is performed in a consistent way every time the stimulus is present. Fixed action patterns are stereotyped behaviors that occur in many animals, including humans, and are thought to be controlled by neural circuits called \"central pattern generators.\""
