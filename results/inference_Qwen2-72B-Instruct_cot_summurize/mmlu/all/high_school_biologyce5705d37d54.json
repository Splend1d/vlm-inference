South American temperate plants are more similar to the tropical plants of South America than to the temperate plants of Europe.\n\nThis observation supported the idea that species change over time and that related species share common ancestors. The fact that plants in South America, even those adapted to different climates, are more closely related to each other than to plants in distant continents suggested to Darwin that they had evolved from common ancestors through a process of gradual change, rather than being created independently in their current forms. This was one of many pieces of evidence that led him to formulate the theory of evolution by natural selection."
