The firm will continue to produce as long as total revenue exceeds total variable cost, even if it incurs loss.\n\nExplanation: In the short run, a profit-maximizing firm will continue to operate as long as its total revenue covers its total variable costs (it can cover some or all of its fixed costs). This is because shutting down would mean incurring the full cost of fixed inputs with no revenue to offset them. By continuing to operate, the firm can at least cover its variable costs and some portion of its fixed costs. It will only shut down if the price falls below the average variable cost (AVC), not necessarily below the average total cost (ATC) or average fixed cost (AFC)."
