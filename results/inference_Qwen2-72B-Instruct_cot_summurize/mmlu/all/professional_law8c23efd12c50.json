She was running late for the meeting and could not find a legal parking spot, so she decided to park illegally in front of a fire hydrant. This was in violation of a local ordinance that prohibited parking within 50 feet of a fire hydrant. The lawyer figured that it was better to get a ticket than to miss her meeting with an important client. The spot where she parked was next to the site of the construction of the new building. While the lawyer was at her meeting, an accident occurred at the construction site. A large crane was being used to lift a load of bricks. A cable on the crane broke, and the bricks fell. Most of them landed on top of the lawyer's car. The load of bricks that fell on the lawyer's car caused the gas tank of the car to rupture and explode. Shrapnel from the explosion flew in all directions and injured a pedestrian who was talking on the sidewalk near the lawyer's car. If the pedestrian sues the lawyer and relies on the doctrine of negligence per Se, which of the following, if true, is the lawyer's best defense?\n\nA. Payment of a small fine is the only penalty provided in the ordinance for those who park too close to fire hydrants.\nB. The police never issued a ticket to the lawyer for parking in front of the fire hydrant.\nC. The purpose. of the parking ordinance was tofacilitate access to the hydrant by fire trucks,not to protect against accidents like the onethat occurred when bricks fell on the lawyer'scar.\nD. The pedestrian would not have been injured ifthe construction company had properly maintained the crane.\n"

The purpose of the parking ordinance was to facilitate access to the hydrant by fire trucks, not to protect against accidents like the one that occurred when bricks fell on the lawyer's car.\n\nNegligence per se occurs when someone violates a statute or regulation designed to protect a certain class of individuals and causes harm to an individual within that class. The key point here is that the harm must be of the type that the statute was intended to prevent. In this case, the parking ordinance was designed to ensure that fire hydrants were accessible to emergency services in the event of a fire, not to prevent accidents involving falling objects at construction sites. Therefore, the lawyer can argue that the violation of the parking ordinance did not directly cause the type of harm suffered by the pedestrian."
