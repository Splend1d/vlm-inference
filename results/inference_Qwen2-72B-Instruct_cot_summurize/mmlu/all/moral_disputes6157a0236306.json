This means that governments and other actors should not respond to terrorist attacks with excessive force or measures that violate human rights, as this can fuel further resentment and radicalization. Instead, they should focus on addressing the underlying grievances that lead individuals to become terrorists, while also taking steps to prevent future attacks through intelligence gathering, law enforcement, and other non-military means. Therefore, the correct answer would be C. avoid playing the terrorism game."
