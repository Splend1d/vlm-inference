                    "text": "The correct answer is B. The object will fall with increasing speed but decreasing acceleration.\n\nHere's why:\n\nWhen an object is in free fall, it is subject to two forces: gravity (which pulls it down) and air resistance (which pushes it up). At the start of the fall, the only significant force acting on the object is gravity, so it accelerates downward at a constant rate (approximately 9.8 m/s\u00b2 near the Earth's surface).\n\nAs the object falls faster, the air resistance increases, and this upward force starts to counteract the force of gravity. As the upward force of air resistance increases, it causes the net downward acceleration to decrease. However, since the object continues to fall through the air, its speed continues to increase, albeit at a decreasing rate due to the decreasing acceleration.\n\nEventually, if the object fell long enough, the force of air resistance would equal the force of gravity, and the object would reach terminal velocity, where it falls at a constant speed with no net acceleration. But according to the question, the object strikes the ground before reaching terminal velocity, so it never reaches a constant speed; instead, it continues to accelerate downward at a decreasing rate until impact."
