This action can contaminate the water and potentially harm other swimmers' health, making it morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character tests out their laser pointer by aiming it at a wall. This action does not cause harm or inconvenience to others and is generally acceptable, provided that no one is accidentally blinded or disturbed by the light. Therefore, this scenario does not involve any clear moral wrongdoing."
