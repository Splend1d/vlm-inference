The whole number part is 4, and the decimal part is .95.\n\nThe decimal .95 can be written as 95/100 because it's 95 hundredths. This fraction can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD), which is 5.\n\n\\[ \\frac{95}{100} = \\frac{95\\div5}{100\\div5} = \\frac{19}{20} \\]\n\nSo, 4.95 can be expressed as a mixed number as:\n\n\\[ 4 \\text{ and } \\frac{19}{20} \\]\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. 4 and 19 over 20."
