Mediation is usually conducted by a person appointed with the consent of the parties, while conciliation involves a commission, which proceeds to an impartial examination of the dispute and proposes settlement terms.\n\nMediation typically involves a neutral third party who facilitates communication and negotiation between disputing parties in order to help them reach a voluntary agreement. The mediator does not impose a solution but helps the parties find their own mutually acceptable resolution.\n\nConciliation, on the other hand, often involves a commission or a group of people who investigate the dispute, hear both sides, and then propose terms for a settlement. The conciliators may offer suggestions or proposals for a resolution, which can be binding or non-binding depending on the agreement of the parties and the rules under which the conciliation is conducted. Unlike mediation, where the focus is on facilitating direct communication between the parties, conciliation may involve more active intervention by the conciliators in proposing solutions."
