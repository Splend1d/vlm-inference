Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. the spending multiplier.\n\nThis concept is based on the idea that when there's an initial increase in spending (aggregate demand), it leads to higher income for individuals and businesses. This increased income then leads to further spending, which in turn generates more income and more spending, creating a chain reaction that multiplies the impact of the initial spending increase on the overall level of economic activity."
