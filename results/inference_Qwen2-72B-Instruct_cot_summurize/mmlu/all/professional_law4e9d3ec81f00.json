This amendment was designed to protect the rights of citizens against state actions that might infringe upon those rights, including the right to equal protection under the law. It gives Congress the power to enforce its provisions through appropriate legislation. In this case, the statute prohibiting racial discrimination in real estate transactions is an exercise of Congress's power to enforce the principle of equal protection as guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment."
