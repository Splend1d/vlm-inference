Among the options provided, the correct answer is:\n\nA. third cranial nerves. \n\nThe third cranial nerve (oculomotor nerve) carries parasympathetic fibers that control the constriction of the pupil and ciliary muscle for accommodation in the eye. However, it's important to note that parasympathetic preganglionic fibers also exit with the seventh, ninth, and tenth cranial nerves, which were not included as options in your question."
