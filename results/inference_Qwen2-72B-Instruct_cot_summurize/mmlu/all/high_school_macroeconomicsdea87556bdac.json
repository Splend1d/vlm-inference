This can lead to upward pressure on prices, resulting in inflation. When the economy is at or near full capacity, businesses may find it difficult to increase production without raising prices due to constraints on resources like labor and raw materials. This can result in cost-push inflation. Additionally, if demand continues to outstrip supply, demand-pull inflation can occur as consumers bid up prices. High inflation can be problematic as it erodes purchasing power and can lead to economic instability if not managed properly by monetary authorities."
