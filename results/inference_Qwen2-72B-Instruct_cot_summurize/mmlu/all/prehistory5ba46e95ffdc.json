The evidence from the Kathu Pan site supports this conclusion, as it contains stone spear points dating back to that time period. While Homo erectus is known to have used various tools, including those made of wood and bone, there is no direct evidence to suggest they used these specifically for fishing or that they did not use stone projectile points for hunting. Option D is incorrect because the evidence suggests that they did use stone spear points for hunting purposes."
