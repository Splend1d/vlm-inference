This phase involves developing a strategy to address the issue, which includes considering the organization's capacity to take a leadership role in managing the issue effectively.\n\nHere's a brief overview of the four steps in the Chase Jones model:\n\nA. Identification: Recognizing and defining the issue.\nB. Analysis: Gathering information about the issue, its stakeholders, and potential impacts.\nC. Strategy: Developing a plan to manage the issue, including assessing the organization's ability to lead or influence the issue.\nD. Evaluation: Monitoring the effectiveness of the strategy and making adjustments as necessary."
