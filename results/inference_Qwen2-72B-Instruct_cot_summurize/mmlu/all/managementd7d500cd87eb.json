It is the authority granted to individuals based on their job title and the responsibilities associated with it. People who hold positions of legitimate power have the right to make decisions, allocate resources, and enforce rules and policies. This type of power is often derived from the organizational hierarchy and is recognized by others as being appropriate and justified."
