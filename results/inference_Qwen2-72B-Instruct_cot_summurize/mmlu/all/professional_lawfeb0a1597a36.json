The fact that the jury found the defendant not guilty of arson does not necessarily mean that the felony murder conviction must be overturned. It is possible for a jury to find inconsistencies in their verdicts due to confusion or other reasons, but this does not automatically constitute a constitutional violation or reversible error.\n\nIf the defense believes that the verdicts are inconsistent or that there was an error in the proceedings, they may appeal the decision to a higher court. However, the trial court is unlikely to set aside the felony murder conviction based solely on the inconsistency of the verdicts."
