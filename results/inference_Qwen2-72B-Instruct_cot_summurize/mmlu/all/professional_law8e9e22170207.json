They ordered him out of the car and saw a cellophane package protruding from under the seat. The package contained a white powdery substance, which the officers suspected to be cocaine. The officers placed the driver under arrest and put him in the rear of their patrol car. They then proceeded to search the rest of the driver's car. In the trunk they found an assault rifle that was later determined to be the weapon used in a liquor store robbery. Charged with that robbery, the driver moved to suppress the assault rifle as evidence on the grounds that the police did not have a warrant to search the trunk. The best theory that the prosecution can use in support of the admissibility of the assault rifle as evidence is that\n\nA. the police conducted an automobile search.\nB. the police conducted an inventory search.\nC. the search was incident to a lawful arrest.\nD. the search was made under exigent circumstances.\n"

When a person is arrested, the police may conduct a search of the person and the area within the immediate control of the person for the purposes of protecting the safety of the officers and preventing the destruction or concealment of evidence. This includes searching the vehicle if it is within the immediate control of the person being arrested or if there is reason to believe that evidence related to the crime for which the person is being arrested may be found in the vehicle. In this case, the police had probable cause to believe that the driver had committed a crime (possession of cocaine) and that there might be additional evidence of criminal activity in the vehicle, including in the trunk. Therefore, the search of the trunk was justified as being incident to the lawful arrest of the driver."
