Let's denote the mean by \\(\\mu = 55,800\\) and the standard deviation by \\(\\sigma\\). The first quartile given is \\(Q1 = 48,815\\).\n\nFrom the definition of the first quartile in terms of standard deviations, we have:\n\\[ Q1 = \\mu - 0.6745\\sigma \\]\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\\[ 48,815 = 55,800 - 0.6745\\sigma \\]\n\nSolving for \\(\\sigma\\):\n\\[ 0.6745\\sigma = 55,800 - 48,815 \\]\n\\[ 0.6745\\sigma = 6,985 \\]\n\\[ \\sigma = \\frac{6,985}{0.6745} \\approx 10,356 \\]\n\nSo the correct answer is B. $10,356.\n\nIt's worth noting that the difference between the actual calculation (\\(6,985 / 0.6745 \\approx 10,356.42\\)) and the provided answer choices is negligible, and rounding can explain slight discrepancies. However, the closest match from your options is B. $10,356."
