Babbling is a critical stage in language development where infants begin to produce strings of sounds that resemble the phonemes of their native language(s). Deaf children who have no access to spoken language may not develop typical babbling patterns, as they lack auditory feedback to guide their speech production. However, it's important to note that deaf children can still produce sounds and may develop alternative communication strategies, such as visual-gestural communication, which can be just as complex and expressive as spoken language."
