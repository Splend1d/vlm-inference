This statement is false because hexagons have six sides, while triangles have three. A shape cannot be both a hexagon and a triangle simultaneously.\n\nB. This statement is true because an octagon is a polygon with eight sides. All shapes with straight sides are considered polygons as long as they have at least three sides. Thus, an octagon, having eight sides, is indeed a polygon.\n\nC. This statement is false because not all parallelograms are rectangles. While it's true that rectangles are parallelograms (because they have two sets of parallel sides), not all parallelograms are rectangles. For example, a rhombus is also a parallelogram but isn't a rectangle.\n\nD. This statement is false because not all rhombi are squares. A square is a special type of rhombus where all four sides are equal in length, and all angles are right angles. A rhombus only requires that all four sides are equal in length; the angles can be any size as long as opposite angles are equal."
