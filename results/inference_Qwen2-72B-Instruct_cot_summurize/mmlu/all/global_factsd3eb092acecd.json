However, it's important to note that the contribution of agriculture to GDP can vary from year to year and has been declining as a share of GDP over time as the economy has become more service-oriented. Additionally, the economic impact of agriculture is often greater than its direct contribution to GDP when considering related industries such as food processing, distribution, and sales."
