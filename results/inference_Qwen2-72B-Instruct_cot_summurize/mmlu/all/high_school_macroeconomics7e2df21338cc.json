This means that the government spends less than it earns in tax revenues, which can help to reduce the amount of money circulating in the economy and thus help to curb inflationary pressures. Option C (increased taxes and government spending) would actually increase the money supply and could potentially exacerbate inflation. Option D (decreased government spending and taxes) might also decrease demand but reducing taxes would leave more money in consumers' hands, possibly fueling demand and inflation further. Therefore, running a surplus by increasing taxes or decreasing spending is generally seen as the best fiscal approach to fighting inflation."
