Reducing frequency of injection drug use\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Both A and C.\n\nOpioid replacement therapy, such as methadone or buprenorphine maintenance treatment, can help individuals reduce their use of illicit opioids and decrease the frequency of injection drug use. By doing so, it can also lower the risk of HIV transmission associated with sharing injecting paraphernalia, which is a common mode of HIV transmission among people who inject drugs. However, option B suggests an increase in sharing of injecting paraphernalia, which is not a benefit but rather a risk factor that ORT aims to mitigate."
