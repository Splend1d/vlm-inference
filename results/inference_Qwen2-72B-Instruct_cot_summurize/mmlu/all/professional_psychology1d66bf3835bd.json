Assimilation refers to the process of incorporating new information or experiences into existing cognitive schemas or structures. In this case, the child is using a familiar schema (using a rattle) to make sense of and interact with a new object (a spoon). This is different from accommodation, which involves modifying existing schemas or developing new ones to better fit new experiences. Response fixity and fixed action patterns are not part of Piaget's theory but are concepts from ethology and behavioral psychology."
