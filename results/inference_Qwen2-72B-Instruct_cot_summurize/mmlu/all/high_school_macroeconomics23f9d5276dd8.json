The Fed sells Treasury securities to commercial banks.\n\nThis action would reduce the money supply in the banking system, making it an example of contractionary monetary policy. When the Federal Reserve sells Treasury securities, it takes money out of circulation, decreasing bank reserves and thus reducing the amount of money banks can lend out. This can help to slow down economic growth and control inflation."
