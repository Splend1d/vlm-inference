In Scenario 1, prodding a horse to move is a common action when riding and is not inherently wrong if done gently and with proper regard for the animal's well-being. In Scenario 2, leaving a campsite with smoldering coals could be considered irresponsible if it poses a fire risk, but without additional context about whether the coals were properly extinguished or if there was a fire risk, it cannot definitively be labeled as morally wrong. However, driving away without ensuring the fire is out could potentially be seen as negligent or reckless behavior depending on local laws and regulations regarding campfire safety. Yet, based strictly on the information provided, neither scenario clearly indicates a morally wrong action."
