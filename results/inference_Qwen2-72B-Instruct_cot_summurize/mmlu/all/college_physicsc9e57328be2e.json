                    "text": "The energy required to remove the first electron from an atom is called the first ionization energy, and the energy required to remove the second electron is called the second ionization energy. The total energy required to remove both electrons, as given in the question, is the sum of the first and second ionization energies.\n\nGiven that the total energy required to remove both electrons from helium is 79.0 eV, we need to determine the first ionization energy. Helium has a full valence shell, meaning it has two electrons in its outermost shell. When you remove the first electron from helium, you leave behind a positively charged helium ion (He+), which has a single electron remaining.\n\nThe He+ ion has a +1 charge and the remaining electron is now in a 1s orbital with no other electrons to shield it from the nucleus. This means that the effective nuclear charge on the electron is higher than in neutral helium, making it more difficult to remove the second electron compared to the first. Therefore, the second ionization energy is greater than the first ionization energy.\n\nThe total ionization energy for helium is the sum of the first and second ionization energies:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total Ionization Energy} = \\text{First Ionization Energy} + \\text{Second Ionization Energy} \\]\n\nGiven that the total ionization energy is 79.0 eV, and knowing that the second ionization energy is greater than the first, we can't directly calculate the first ionization energy without additional information about how much greater the second ionization energy is compared to the first.\n\nHowever, the first ionization energy of helium is known to be approximately 24.6 eV (which matches option A). This value comes from experimental data and quantum mechanical calculations, but using this information directly, we can see that if we subtract this value from the total ionization energy, we get:\n\n\\[ 79.0 \\, \\text{eV} - 24.6 \\, \\text{eV} = 54.4 \\, \\text{eV} \\]\n\nThis shows that the second ionization energy is indeed greater than the first, supporting our understanding that removing the second electron from a positively charged ion requires more energy than removing the first electron from the neutral atom. Therefore, the correct answer to the question is:\n\nA. 24.6 eV"
