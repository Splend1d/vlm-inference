In scenario 1, eating a part of another person's body is not only illegal but also violates fundamental ethical principles regarding harm to others. In scenario 2, starting a campfire in a forest could lead to uncontrollable wildfires, causing significant damage to property, wildlife, and potentially human life, which is also considered morally and legally wrong if not done with proper precautions and permissions. However, if the forest camp fire was done legally and safely with all necessary permits and precautions, then it would not be considered morally wrong. Given that detail was not provided, and considering the potential for harm, the initial judgment stands."
