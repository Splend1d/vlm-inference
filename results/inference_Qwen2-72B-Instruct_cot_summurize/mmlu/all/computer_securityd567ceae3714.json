Blinding prevents the server from using the CRT optimization, which is essential to the timing attack.\nB. Blinding changes the p and q primes that are used, so an adversary cannot learn the server\u2019s true p and q values.\nC. Blinding randomizes the ciphertext being decrypted, thus obscuring the correlation between an adversary\u2019s input and the timing differences.\nD. Blinding adds a random amount of time to the decryption due to the multiplication and division by the blinding random value r, which obscures the timing differences used in the attack.\n"

Blinding randomizes the ciphertext being decrypted, thus obscuring the correlation between an adversary\u2019s input and the timing differences.\n\nBlinding works by multiplying the ciphertext by a random value (r^e) before decryption and then dividing the result by the same random value after decryption. This process randomizes the ciphertext, making it unpredictable for the attacker. As a result, any timing differences that could be exploited in a side-channel attack become obscured, as they no longer correlate with the attacker's inputs."
