This technique helps them to develop self-control and self-regulation skills, which can reduce impulsivity and improve their ability to focus on tasks. The process usually involves breaking down the desired behavior into small steps and using prompts or cues to help the child learn and practice each step until it becomes automatic. This gradual shaping of behavior through self-instructions can be an effective way to help impulsive children develop more adaptive behaviors."
