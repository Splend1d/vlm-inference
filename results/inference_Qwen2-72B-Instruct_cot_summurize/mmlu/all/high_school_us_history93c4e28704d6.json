The reference to \"monopolies\" and \"railroads\" suggests a critique of corporate power and its collusion with political elites, which were major concerns for Populists who advocated for the interests of farmers and laborers against what they saw as the corrupting influence of big business and the established political parties.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nC. a populist newspaper in the 1890s."
