Colchicine\n\nColchicine is known to induce polyploidy in eukaryotic cells by inhibiting the function of microtubules during cell division, specifically during mitosis and meiosis. This inhibition prevents the separation of chromosomes into daughter cells, leading to an increase in chromosome number (polyploidy). The other antibiotics listed (penicillin, tetracycline, and puromycin) do not have this effect on eukaryotic cells."
