The defendant claimed he acted in self-defense after the man drew a knife on him and made menacing gestures with it. The defendant called a witness to the stand to testify that the defendant had a reputation in the community for being a peaceful person. On cross-examination of the witness, the prosecuting attorney asked the witness if he had heard that the defendant had often engaged in fights and brawls. Upon objection by the defendant's attorney, the trial judge should rule the question\n\nA. proper, because it tends to show the witness's knowledge of the defendant's reputation.\nB. proper, because it is relevant to prove the defendant's violent propensities.\nC. not proper, because it puts into evidence separate and unrelated offenses.\nD. not proper, because character cannot be proved by generalities.\n"

Asking about unrelated instances of fighting or brawling would introduce evidence of specific acts that are not directly related to the charge at hand and could prejudice the jury against the defendant. This type of questioning could also violate rules of evidence that prohibit the use of propensity evidence to suggest that a person acted in conformity with a character trait on a particular occasion. However, it's worth noting that under some jurisdictions and circumstances, such questions might be allowed to test the witness's knowledge or the credibility of the reputation testimony, but generally, they are considered not proper for the reasons stated."
