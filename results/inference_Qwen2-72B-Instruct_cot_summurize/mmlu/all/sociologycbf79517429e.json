It led to the development of power-driven machinery, such as steam engines and water-powered machines, which replaced hand tools and animal power. This shift resulted in the concentration of workers in large factories and mills, where they could operate these new machines more efficiently than in small-scale or home-based settings.\n\nWhile some of the other options mentioned contain elements that were present during the 19th century, they do not define the core characteristics of industrial production at that time. For example, while there were indeed increasing numbers of women working in industry, they often occupied lower-status positions rather than high-status ones (option A). Cottage industries and homeworkers doing piecework did exist before and during the early stages of industrialization (option B), but these were largely replaced by factory systems as industrialization progressed. The separation of ownership and control, known as the managerial revolution (option C), was a feature of later industrial development but is not as directly associated with the core characteristics of 19th-century industrial production as the use of power-driven machinery and large-scale work environments (option D)."
