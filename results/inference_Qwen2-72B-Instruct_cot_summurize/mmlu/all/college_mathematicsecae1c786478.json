                    "text": "The answer is B. 28.\n\nHere's why: \n\nThe fact that $G$ contains a subgroup of order 7 means that there is an element in $G$ of order 7. Let's call this element $a$. The subgroup generated by $a$, $\\langle a \\rangle$, has order 7 and consists of the elements $\\{1, a, a^2, a^3, a^4, a^5, a^6\\}$.\n\nSince no element other than the identity is its own inverse, none of these elements except for $1$ can be equal to their own inverse. This means that for each of the six non-identity elements in $\\langle a \\rangle$, we must have a distinct element in $G$ which is its inverse. These six elements and their inverses are all distinct from each other and from the elements in $\\langle a \\rangle$. \n\nSo far, we have accounted for $1 + 6 + 6 = 13$ elements in $G$. Since $G$ must contain at least one more element (the element $a$ itself), the order of $G$ must be at least 14. \n\nWe can eliminate options A and D immediately because they are not divisible by 7, and by Lagrange's theorem, the order of any subgroup of a finite group must divide the order of the group. \n\nOption C is also not possible because if the order of $G$ were 35, then by Cauchy's theorem, $G$ would have an element of order 5. But since no element other than the identity is its own inverse, this would mean that there would have to be another element in $G$ which is the inverse of this element of order 5, contradicting the fact that we have already accounted for all the necessary elements in $G$ based on the existence of an element of order 7.\n\nThis leaves option B as the only possibility. If the order of $G$ is 28, then by Sylow's theorems, $G$ has a normal Sylow 7-subgroup, which must be $\\langle a \\rangle$. Moreover, since no element other than the identity is its own inverse, the remaining 15 elements of $G$ must be paired up into 7 pairs of mutually inverse elements, along with one additional element which is its own inverse (in order to reach a total of 28 elements). This is consistent with the given conditions, so the order of $G$ could be 28."
