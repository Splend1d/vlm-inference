                    "text": "Sinnott-Armstrong is a philosopher who has written extensively on various topics in ethics, including moral psychology, applied ethics, and metaethics. While his work touches on all of the options you've provided (individuals, societies, governments, and families), he is perhaps most well-known for his work on the moral obligations of individuals and societies.\n\nIn his book \"Moral Dilemmas,\" Sinnott-Armstrong explores how individuals should reason through difficult moral decisions, often using thought experiments to illustrate his points. He also co-edited a volume called \"Moral Psychology,\" which examines how psychological research can inform our understanding of moral judgment and decision-making by individuals.\n\nIn addition, Sinnott-Armstrong has written about the ethical responsibilities of societies, particularly in the context of global justice. In his book \"Consequentialism and Its Critics,\" he defends a version of consequentialism that emphasizes the importance of promoting the greatest good for the greatest number, which can be seen as a framework for thinking about the moral obligations of societies.\n\nSo while Sinnott-Armstrong's work touches on all of the options you've provided, if I had to choose one, I would say that he is most interested in examining issues about the moral obligations of individuals and societies. Therefore, the answer would be both A and B. However, since the question asks for a single answer, it may be more accurate to say that Sinnott-Armstrong is most interested in examining issues about the moral obligations of individuals (A)."
