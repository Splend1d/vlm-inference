However, it wasn't until the 1990s (Option B) that the discourse gained significant traction as the internet became more widespread and issues related to computer security, hacking, and data protection became more prominent. Therefore, both the 1980s and 1990s were crucial decades for the development of cyber-security discourse, but the 1990s saw a more substantial increase in attention and concern over cyber-security issues. If you have to pick one, the 1990s would be the most accurate answer."
