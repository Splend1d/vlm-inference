In Scenario 1, taking pictures of someone without their consent while they are in the shower is a violation of privacy and can be considered voyeurism, which is both illegal and unethical. In Scenario 2, knocking over a standing stone at Stonehenge would be considered vandalism of a historical site, which is also illegal and morally reprehensible due to the cultural and historical significance of the site."
