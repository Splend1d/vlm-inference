The detection of a skull fracture\n\nCT scans are generally preferred over MRI for detecting skull fractures due to their faster imaging time and better sensitivity for detecting bone injuries. MRI is more useful for soft tissue imaging, such as detecting brain tumors, acute cerebral infarcts, and white matter abnormalities. However, for immediate trauma assessment, particularly when there is a suspicion of a skull fracture or hemorrhage, CT is usually the first choice due to its speed and ability to identify bony structures clearly."
