In Scenario 1, removing a bug from someone's head is generally seen as a helpful act, assuming it was done gently and without causing harm to the sister. In Scenario 2, tossing a ball to someone while swimming is typically considered a normal and harmless social interaction, especially if it was clear that the girl was expecting or wanting to catch the ball."
