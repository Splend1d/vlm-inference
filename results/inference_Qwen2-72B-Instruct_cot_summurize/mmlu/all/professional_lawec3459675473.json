The man moved a giant magnolia tree from another section of his property and had it replanted on his property at a spot just 10 feet from the woman's property. At that time, the woman protested that by locating the tree so close to her land, the man was increasing the risk of injury to the woman's greenhouse, in which the woman cultivated prizewinning flowers. Hurricanes are quite common in the area. Severalyears after the replanting of the tree, in the midst ofa hurricane, the tree fell on the woman's greenhouse,destroying rare and valuable plants valued at$25,000. The woman asserted a claim against the man to recover damages for the harm caused by the tree falling on the greenhouse. During trial, the only evidence the woman presented was that the hurricane uprooted the tree, causing it to fall onto her property, and thereby resulting in the damage as claimed. At the end of the woman's case, the man moved for a directed verdict. The man's motion will most likely be\n\nA. granted, because the woman did not produce any evidence to show that the man was negligent.\nB. granted, because the woman's damages resulted from an act of God.\nC. denied, because hurricanes were common in the area.\nD. denied, because the trier of fact may still infer liability for trespass.\n"

Simply showing that the tree fell during a hurricane is not enough to establish negligence on the part of the man. She would need to demonstrate that the man's actions (such as planting the tree too close to her property or failing to properly secure it) were unreasonable under the circumstances and contributed to the damage. Without such evidence, the man's motion for a directed verdict would likely be granted due to lack of evidence of negligence."
