Carbon dioxide\n\nWhen we exhale, the concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) is higher than in the air we inhale because our body produces CO2 as a waste product of metabolism. While nitrogen and oxygen are also present in exhaled air, their proportions do not increase; in fact, the percentage of oxygen decreases. Carbon monoxide is not typically present in exhaled air in significant quantities under normal circumstances."
