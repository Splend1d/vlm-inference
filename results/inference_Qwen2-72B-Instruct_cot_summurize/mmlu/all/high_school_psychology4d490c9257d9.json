Therefore, the answer is C.\n\nFreud's phallic stage also takes place during early childhood, around ages 3-6 years. During this stage, according to Freud, children begin to develop feelings of sexual attraction and competition with their same-sex parent for the affection of the opposite-sex parent. This can lead to feelings of guilt or shame when they realize that their desires are not socially acceptable.\n\nIn contrast, Erikson's initiative versus guilt stage focuses on children's growing sense of independence and ability to take initiative in exploring the world around them. Children who successfully navigate this stage develop a sense of purpose and confidence in their abilities, while those who experience too much guilt or shame may become overly critical of themselves and hesitant to try new things."
