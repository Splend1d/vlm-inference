However, since the question emphasizes the ability to explain in a way that most other media cannot, the answer would likely be:\n\nC. Broadcast.\n\nBroadcast media such as television and radio can deliver detailed explanations through spoken word and visual aids, which may not be possible with print or outdoor media. While digital media can also provide detailed explanations, broadcast media has the advantage of being able to convey emotions and nuances through tone of voice and body language, making it particularly effective for certain types of messages."
