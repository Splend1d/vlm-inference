Among the options you've provided, the correct pair that must be proven is:\n\nC. Scienter and justifiable reliance.\n\n- **Scienter** refers to the accountant's knowledge that the representation was false or their reckless disregard for the truth when making the statement. It implies intent to deceive on the part of the accountant.\n- **Justifiable reliance** means that the client reasonably relied on the false representation made by the accountant, which led to the client's detriment or loss.\n\nIt's important to note that proving common law fraud generally requires demonstrating all of the following elements:\n1. A material misrepresentation (a false statement of fact).\n2. Knowledge of its falsity or reckless disregard for the truth by the party making the statement (scienter).\n3. Justifiable reliance by the party to whom the statement was made.\n4. Intent to induce action or inaction based on the misrepresentation.\n5. Resulting damages or loss suffered by the relying party.\n\nHowever, among the given options, C is the most accurate pair specifically addressing aspects of common law fraud liability for an accountant."
