Acetylcholine will not be degraded in the synaptic cleft.\n\nEnzymes that are present in the synaptic cleft, such as acetylcholinesterase, play a critical role in breaking down neurotransmitters like acetylcholine after they have transmitted their signal. If these enzymes are denatured by a chemical agent, they will no longer function properly, and acetylcholine will not be broken down efficiently. This can lead to an accumulation of acetylcholine in the synaptic cleft, potentially overstimulating the postsynaptic receptors and disrupting normal neural communication."
