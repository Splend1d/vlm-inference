Since the function is increasing, this method will underestimate the actual area.\n   \n2. **Right Sum (R):** Uses rectangles whose height is determined by the value of the function at the right endpoint of each subinterval. Since the function is increasing, this method will overestimate the actual area.\n   \n3. **Midpoint Sum (M):** Uses rectangles whose height is determined by the value of the function at the midpoint of each subinterval. This provides a better estimate than either the left or right sums because it takes into account the increase in the function's value across the subinterval.\n   \n4. **Trapezoidal Sum (T):** Averages the left and right sums and uses trapezoids to estimate the area. It also gives a better estimate than either the left or right sums alone because it accounts for the average rate of change over the subintervals.\n\nGiven that the function is also concave up, the trapezoidal sum will be closer to the true area than the left sum but farther from the true area than the midpoint sum. This is because the trapezoidal rule averages the left and right endpoints, which means it will underestimate the area (since the function is increasing) but not as much as the left sum does. Similarly, since the function is concave up, the midpoint sum will give an even more accurate estimate than the trapezoidal sum because it better captures the curvature of the function.\n\nTherefore, when the function is both increasing and concave up, the order of accuracy from least to most accurate is: Left, Trapezoidal, Midpoint, Right. So the correct answer is:\n\n**D. L <= M <= T <= R**\n\nHowever, this is not one of the options provided exactly as stated. The correct relationship based on the provided options and the explanation given would actually be:\n\n**D. L <= T <= M <= R**\n\nThis is because the trapezoidal sum is between the left and midpoint sums in terms of accuracy when the function is increasing and concave up, making option D the correct choice among the given options. However, based on the strict accuracy from least to most, the midpoint sum would come before the trapezoidal sum, making the sequence L < M < T < R, but this exact option isn't provided."
