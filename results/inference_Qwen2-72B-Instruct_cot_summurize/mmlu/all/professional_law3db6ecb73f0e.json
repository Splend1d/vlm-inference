The buyer told the owner that she was very interested in buying the business, but that she needed to get a loan from the bank to finance the purchase. The parties drafted a contract, signed by both parties, which stated that the buyer agreed to purchase the retail business from the owner for $250,000. The written agreement contained a provision wherein the sale would not take effect \"unless the buyer is successful in her bid to obtain a loan from a bank to finance the purchase of the business. \" Subsequently, the buyer made no effort to attempt to obtain a loan from a bank so that the sale could be finalized. After several months, the owner filed suit against the buyer for breach of contract. Which of the following will be the owner's strongest argument in support of his action against the buyer for breach of contract?\n\nA. The obtaining of a loan from a bank was not worded as a \"condition\" to the buyer's duty to buy the business.\nB. Although obtaining a loan from a bank was a condition to the buyer's duty to buy the business, the condition should be excused because its non-occurrence would cause a forfeiture to the owner.\nC. Although obtaining a loan from a bank was a condition to the buyer's duty to buy the business, it should be stricken from the contract because it is an unconscionable term.\nD. The buyer breached an implied promise to make a reasonable effort to obtain a loan from a bank.\n"

The buyer breached an implied promise to make a reasonable effort to obtain a loan from a bank.\n\nWhile the contract did contain a provision stating that the sale would not take effect unless the buyer successfully obtained a loan from a bank, this does not absolve the buyer of any responsibility to try to fulfill that condition. There is an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing in contracts, which includes the obligation to act reasonably and not to prevent the occurrence of conditions precedent (such as obtaining financing) without justification. By making no effort to obtain the loan, the buyer failed to meet this implied promise, potentially constituting a breach of contract.\n\nOptions A, B, and C are not as strong because:\n\nA. The specific wording of the clause does not change the fact that the buyer has an implied duty to act in good faith and make a reasonable effort to fulfill the condition.\n\nB. Excusing the condition due to potential forfeiture to the owner would require demonstrating that the condition was included in bad faith or is otherwise unjust. Simply failing to obtain the loan does not necessarily justify excusing the condition.\n\nC. Striking the condition from the contract after the fact because it is unconscionable would be difficult to argue unless there is evidence that the term was grossly unfair at the time of contract formation. The mere fact that the buyer cannot obtain financing does not automatically make the term unconscionable."
