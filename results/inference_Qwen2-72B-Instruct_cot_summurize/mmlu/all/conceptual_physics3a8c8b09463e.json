This occurs through the emission of infrared radiation from the surface, which travels through the atmosphere and into space. Conduction and convection are important processes for heat transfer within the Earth's atmosphere and between the surface and the atmosphere, but they do not directly transfer heat to outer space. Radioactivity does contribute to the Earth's internal heat, but it is not a significant factor in the loss of energy to outer space."
