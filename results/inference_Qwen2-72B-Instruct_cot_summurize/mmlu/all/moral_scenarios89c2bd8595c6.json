Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn Scenario 1, placing cameras in public areas like halls to prevent vandalism or graffiti is not considered morally wrong, assuming it's done with proper authorization and complies with privacy laws. However, if the cameras were placed in private areas where there is an expectation of privacy (like bathrooms), that would be a different story and would likely be considered morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, listening to music while supervising children at a playground is generally not considered morally wrong, especially if you can still adequately monitor the children's safety. It's important to note that the context matters; if the music is so loud that you cannot hear the children calling for help or if you are distracted to the point of neglecting your supervisory duties, then it could be seen as irresponsible or morally questionable. However, based on the information provided, there is no indication that the supervision is being neglected."
