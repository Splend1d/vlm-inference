So, there are 3 ways to select the male lead.\n\n3. **Selecting the Remaining 3 Roles**: After selecting the female and male leads, we have 6 members left. These 3 roles can be played by any of these remaining members. Since the order in which these 3 roles are filled matters (as they represent distinct objects), we use permutations to calculate the number of ways to fill these roles. The formula for permutations is \\(P(n, r) = \\frac{n!}{(n-r)!}\\), where \\(n\\) is the total number of items and \\(r\\) is the number of items to choose.\n\n   - For 3 roles from 6 members: \\(P(6, 3) = \\frac{6!}{(6-3)!} = \\frac{6!}{3!} = \\frac{720}{6} = 120\\).\n\nMultiplying the number of ways to select each role gives us the total number of ways to assign all roles:\n\n\\[4 \\times 3 \\times 120 = 1440\\]\n\nHowever, this answer is not listed among the options provided, indicating a potential misunderstanding or misinterpretation of the question's details or the options given. Given the calculations based on the interpretation of the question as stated, none of the provided options (A. 640, B. 720, C. 8, D. 1920) directly matches the calculated outcome of 1440.\n\nIf we were to closely examine the provided options with the goal of choosing the closest match to our calculation under some potential assumption or clarification about the question's context, option **B. 720** would not be the correct selection based on our calculation. Instead, considering the options strictly, none aligns perfectly with the calculated result.\n\nHowever, if we assume that there might have been an oversight in the question's framing or the options provided, the logical mathematical approach to solving the presented scenario results in **1440 ways**, which does not match any of the provided choices (A. 640, B. 720, C. 8, D. 1920)."
