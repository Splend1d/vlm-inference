The first sound recording was of a man singing \"Au clair de la lune\", a French folk song, which was recorded by \u00c9douard-L\u00e9on Scott de Martinville in 1860. However, if we consider the options you've given, none of them would be correct based on historical records. If I had to choose the closest option to a song/poem that was one of the earliest recordings, it would be 'Home Sweet Home' (Option D), which was indeed recorded early on by Thomas Edison in 1878 using his phonograph. But this still does not match the very first recording by Scott de Martinville."
