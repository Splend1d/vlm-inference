In this case, Mary's will provided that her estate be divided equally between her daughter, Joan, and the Salvation Army of Largo.\n\nTherefore, assuming there are no other factors or legal challenges that would affect the distribution, Mary's estate should be distributed as follows:\n\nC. 50% to Joan and 50% to the Salvation Army.\n\nOptions A, B, and D suggest alternative distributions that are not in line with the terms of the will. Without additional information indicating that there was a legal basis for altering the distribution (such as a successful contest of the will or a demonstration that the charitable donation was fraudulent), we must assume that the will's instructions will be followed.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that if Joan were to file a timely petition challenging the validity of the will or the specific devise to the Salvation Army based on grounds recognized by law (such as undue influence, lack of testamentary capacity, or fraud), then the outcome could potentially be different. But based solely on the information given, option C is the most likely answer under normal circumstances."
