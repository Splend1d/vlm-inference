When a function is called, a new stack frame is created to hold its parameters, local variables, and return address. This allows functions to be executed and then undone in a last-in-first-out (LIFO) manner.\n\nB, C, and D are not correct because:\n- B. Program code is stored in the text segment, not on the stack.\n- C. Dynamically linked libraries are loaded into the process's virtual address space but are not stored on the stack.\n- D. Global variables are stored in the data segment or bss segment, not on the stack."
