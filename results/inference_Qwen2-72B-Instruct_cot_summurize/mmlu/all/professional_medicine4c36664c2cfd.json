Over the past 9 days, she has had nasal congestion, purulent nasal discharge, sore throat, and a nonproductive cough. She does not smoke. Her husband and children have had no recent illness. Her temperature is 38.5\u00b0C (101.3\u00b0F). Examination shows congested nasal mucosa and purulent discharge on the left. There is tenderness to palpation over the left cheek and no transillumination over the left maxillary sinus. The tympanic membranes are normal, and there is no erythema of the throat. Examination shows no cervical adenopathy. The lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely causal organism?\n\nA. Haemophilus influenzae type b\nB. Moraxella catarrhalis\nC. Staphylococcus aureus\nD. Streptococcus pneumoniae\n"

The fact that she has tenderness to palpation over the left cheek and no transillumination over the left maxillary sinus further supports this diagnosis.\n\nAmong the options given, the most likely causal organism for acute bacterial sinusitis in an adult is Streptococcus pneumoniae (Option D). This bacterium is a common cause of community-acquired respiratory tract infections, including sinusitis, otitis media, and pneumonia.\n\nHaemophilus influenzae type b (Option A) is less common in adults and is typically associated with invasive disease in children who have not been vaccinated against it.\n\nMoraxella catarrhalis (Option B) can cause upper respiratory tract infections but is less commonly implicated in acute sinusitis compared to S. pneumoniae.\n\nStaphylococcus aureus (Option C) can cause sinusitis but is less likely to be the primary causative agent in uncomplicated cases of acute sinusitis in non-smoking adults without other risk factors.\n\nTherefore, the most likely causal organism in this case is Streptococcus pneumoniae (Option D)."
