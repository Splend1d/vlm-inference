The suffering of the puppies is necessary for gustatory pleasure, whereas the suffering of animals on factory farms is simply a by-product of the conditions dictated by economic considerations.\nC.

In fact, Norcross argues that meat-eaters do have the ability to prevent animal suffering by choosing not to consume factory-farmed meat or seeking out more humane alternatives. Therefore, this is a potentially morally relevant difference that Norcross does not discuss. However, it should be noted that some may argue that avoiding factory-farmed meat altogether is not always feasible due to economic or cultural reasons."
