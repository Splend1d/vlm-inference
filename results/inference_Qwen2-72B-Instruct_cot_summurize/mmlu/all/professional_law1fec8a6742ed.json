On August 1, the widower handed his friend a deed conveying the quarry to his niece and said to the friend, \"Give this to my niece. \" Unknown to the widower, the niece was in Africa. The next week, the friend properly recorded the deed with the Recorder's Office. One month later, the widower died, and in his will he devised the quarry to his daughter. Thereafter, the niece returned from Africa, and a dispute arose between the niece and the daughter regarding ownership of the quarry. In a suit to quiet title to the quarry, the court ruled in favor of the niece. The ruling was most likely based upon which of the following?\n\nA. There was an effective \"causa mortis\" gift.\nB. The delivery was effective when the widower handed the deed to the friend.\nC. The delivery was effective when the friend recorded the deed.\nD. The deed was recorded before the devise was effectuated.\n"

The delivery was effective when the widower handed the deed to the friend.\n\nIn property law, a deed must be delivered to the grantee or someone on their behalf for it to be considered valid. In this case, the widower handed the deed to his friend with the intention that it be given to the niece, thus completing the delivery requirement. The fact that the niece was in Africa does not negate the validity of the transfer as long as the widower had the intent to convey the property and the friend acted as the agent for the niece in receiving the deed. Recording the deed is an additional step that provides public notice of the transfer but does not affect the validity of the delivery itself. Therefore, the effective delivery occurred when the widower handed the deed to the friend."
