Half of the tract is swampland totally unfit for cultivation, though it is heavily covered with valuable hardwood timber. The other half is also covered with valuable timber, but it is land that would be fit for the raising of crops if it were cleared of the timber. The latter section of land is more valuable for cultivation than it is for the growing of timber. The grantor conveyed his tract to his brother for life. At the time of the conveyance, the swampland had never been used for the production of timber. The brother took possession and cleared 40 acres of the timber on the section that was suitable for cultivation. In addition, the brother cut 60 acres of timber in the swampland, thus becoming the first person to exploit this area. The brother's cutting of the timber on the section of tract suitable for cultivation would be an example of\n\nA. permissive waste.\nB. ameliorative waste.\nC. equitable waste.\nD. unreasonable exploitation.\n"

A life tenant has the right to use the property during their lifetime but must not commit acts that would permanently damage or devalue the property, especially if such actions would affect the remainderman's (the person who will receive the property after the life tenant's death) interest in the property.\n\nIn this case, since the land suitable for cultivation is more valuable for that purpose than for timber, cutting down the timber could be considered an unreasonable exploitation of the property. This act may reduce the value of the property for future agricultural use, which could harm the remainderman's interest. While the brother might have the right to cut some timber as part of his enjoyment of the property during his life, doing so in a way that significantly diminishes the potential for future use could be seen as wasteful and unreasonable under the circumstances described."
