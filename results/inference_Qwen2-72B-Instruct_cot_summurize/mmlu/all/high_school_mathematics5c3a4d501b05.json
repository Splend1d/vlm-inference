The function \\(f\\) takes an argument that is twice some number and returns that number plus 5. So if we have \\(f(z) = y\\), it means that \\(z = 2x\\) for some \\(x\\), and \\(y = x + 5\\). Therefore, we can write the equation as \\(f(2x) = x + 5\\).\n\nGiven that \\(f(g(6)) = 13\\), we know that whatever \\(g(6)\\) is, when it's doubled and fed into \\(f\\), the output is 13.\n\nLet's denote \\(g(6)\\) by \\(k\\), so \\(f(k) = 13\\). Since \\(f(2x) = x + 5\\), we can set \\(2x = k\\) and thus \\(f(k) = \\frac{k}{2} + 5\\).\n\nSo, we have:\n\\[f(k) = \\frac{k}{2} + 5 = 13\\]\n\nSolving for \\(k\\):\n\\[\\frac{k}{2} = 8\\]\n\\[k = 16\\]\n\nThus, \\(g(6) = 16\\).\n\nThe question asks for \\(2 \\times g(6)\\), which is \\(2 \\times 16 = 32\\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\\[C. 32\\]"
