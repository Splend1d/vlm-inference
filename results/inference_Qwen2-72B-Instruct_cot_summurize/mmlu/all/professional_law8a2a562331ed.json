State law, however, prohibits use of this state funding for surgery for any person who has resided in the state for less than one year, except in emergency situations. A woman moved to the state two months ago seeking permanent employment. Her physician recommends non-emergency surgery to treat a medical condition. The surgery would qualify for state funding if the woman had resided in the state for a year. The woman has sued to invalidate the state law that prohibits state funding of her surgery. Should the woman prevail in her action?\n\nA. No, because the law reasonably conserves the state's limited resources.\nB. No, because the law reasonably prevents the expenditure of state funds on transient nonresidents.\nC. Yes, because the law burdens the woman's fundamental right to health care.\nD. Yes, because the law burdens the woman's fundamental right to travel.\n"

Yes, because the law burdens the woman's fundamental right to travel.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized that there is a fundamental right to interstate travel, which includes not being penalized or discriminated against for having recently moved from another state. The state's residency requirement for non-emergency medical procedures could be seen as an unconstitutional burden on this right by creating a penalty (denial of benefits) for recent arrivals. The court would likely require the state to show a compelling interest and that the residency requirement is narrowly tailored to achieve that interest. In this case, the state may have difficulty justifying the one-year residency requirement as necessary to conserve resources or prevent \"transient nonresidents\" from using state funds, especially if the woman intends to become a permanent resident."
