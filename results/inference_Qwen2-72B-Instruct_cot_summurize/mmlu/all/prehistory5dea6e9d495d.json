Affluent foragers.\n\nThe native peoples of the Northwest Coast of North America, including present-day Alaska, British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, and Northern California, were known for their rich foraging lifestyle. They had access to abundant natural resources such as salmon, shellfish, seaweeds, and various land animals and plants. The term \"affluent foragers\" refers to their ability to obtain a high standard of living without relying on agriculture. These societies often developed complex social structures, including hierarchical systems and elaborate cultural practices, which were supported by their stable food sources and the wealth derived from trade networks."
