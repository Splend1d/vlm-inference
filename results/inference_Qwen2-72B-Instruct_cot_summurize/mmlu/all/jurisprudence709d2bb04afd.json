It makes women into men.\n\nRadical feminists argue that liberal feminism's emphasis on equality often means that women are encouraged to adopt male norms and values, rather than challenging the underlying structures of patriarchy. Radical feminists believe in transforming society fundamentally to create a new system that does not prioritize male values over female ones. They critique liberal feminism for its tendency to push for women's inclusion in existing power structures without questioning those structures themselves. However, it's important to note that this is a simplified explanation of complex feminist theories, and individual perspectives may vary."
