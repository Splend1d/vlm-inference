He argued that this same principle applies to global resources, including food supplies.\n\nIf world food banks were established, Hardin would likely argue that they could become subject to the tragedy of the commons. Countries might be incentivized to take more than their fair share of food aid, leaving less for others in need. Additionally, countries might be less inclined to produce food themselves if they know they can rely on the world food bank, potentially leading to a decrease in overall food production and exacerbating the problem.\n\nOverall, Hardin would likely view the establishment of world food banks with skepticism, given his concerns about the potential for overuse and depletion of shared resources."
