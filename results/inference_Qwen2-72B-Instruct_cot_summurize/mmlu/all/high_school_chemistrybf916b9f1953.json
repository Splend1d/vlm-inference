Transition metals will lose their outermost s-block electrons when forming bonds.\n\nThis is because the s-orbital is higher in energy than the d-orbital in transition metals, making it easier for them to lose the s-electrons first, resulting in a +2 oxidation state. This is not always the case for all transition metals as they can exhibit multiple oxidation states, but +2 is a common one due to this reason."
