While reason is also important in making moral judgments, feelings are an essential and inevitable part of the process. They can motivate us to act ethically and provide valuable insights into what we value and believe is right or wrong. However, it's important to note that feelings alone may not always lead to the most ethical decisions, and should be balanced with rational thought and consideration of the broader context."
