While therapists are legally bound by confidentiality and state/provincial laws to protect the privacy of their clients, the members of a group therapy session are typically held to a standard of confidentiality that relies on trust and mutual respect, often referred to as the \"honor system.\" This means that group members agree not to share what is discussed in the group outside of the session, but there is no legal enforcement for this agreement among the participants themselves.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that some group therapy settings may have additional rules or agreements in place regarding confidentiality, which could include legal or ethical consequences for breaches of confidentiality. But in most cases, especially in the context of the question asked, the primary reliance is on the honor system."
