The federal government at the time was implementing a thaw in relations with the Cuban government. The U.S. Congress passed a statute regarding various policies and dealings toward Cuba. A National Trade Council sued the state in federal court seeking an injunction and declaratory judgment that the state law toward Cuba was unconstitutional. 30 of the business entities that were discriminated against by the state were members of the council. Is the federal court likely to grant the declaratory judgment and declare the state law unconstitutional?\n\nA. No, the state law was consistent with the federal law and with federal policy on Cuba.\nB. No, a state has the sovereign right to pass its own laws concerning its policies toward foreign countries.\nC. Yes, the state law is unconstitutional because it denies equal protection to citizens of other states.\nD. Yes, the state law is unconstitutional because it illegally interfered with the foreign affairs power of the federal government.\n"

Yes, the state law is unconstitutional because it illegally interfered with the foreign affairs power of the federal government.\n\nThe federal government holds the authority to conduct foreign policy, including trade relations with other nations. When a state enacts a law that directly conflicts with federal foreign policy, such as attempting to impose its own sanctions or restrictions on trade with a country like Cuba, this is considered an encroachment on federal powers. The Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution establishes that federal law takes precedence over state law when there is a conflict. Therefore, if the state law contradicts or undermines federal policy toward Cuba, the federal court is likely to grant the declaratory judgment and declare the state law unconstitutional."
