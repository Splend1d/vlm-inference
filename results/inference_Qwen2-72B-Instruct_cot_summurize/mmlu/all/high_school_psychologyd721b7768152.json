They can either facilitate (increase) or inhibit (decrease) the transmission of signals across the synapses, which can lead to changes in mood, perception, and behavior. This mechanism is responsible for the effects of many different types of psychoactive drugs, including stimulants, depressants, hallucinogens, and others."
