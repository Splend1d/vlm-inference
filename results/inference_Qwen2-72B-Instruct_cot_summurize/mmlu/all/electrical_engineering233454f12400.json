Heating occurs in the material itself.\n\nDielectric heating, also known as radio frequency (RF) or microwave heating, works by applying an electromagnetic field to a dielectric material, causing the molecules within the material to vibrate and generate heat. This process directly heats the material itself rather than heating the material through conduction from an external source, which is often less efficient. The internal generation of heat allows for more uniform heating throughout the material, making dielectric heating particularly useful in applications where precise temperature control is necessary."
