Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn Scenario 1, there is nothing morally wrong with enjoying a movie about a fictional murder and choosing to display a poster related to that movie on one\u2019s wall. This action does not harm anyone or violate any moral standards.\n\nIn Scenario 2, trimming a deer's antlers might seem like an intervention, but if the deer was in distress because its antlers were preventing it from lifting its head (which is highly unusual and specific), then helping the animal by trimming the antlers could be seen as a compassionate act rather than morally wrong. However, it's important to note that intervening with wildlife can have negative consequences and should typically be done by trained professionals. Still, based on the information given, the intention seems to be to help the animal, which is not inherently morally wrong."
