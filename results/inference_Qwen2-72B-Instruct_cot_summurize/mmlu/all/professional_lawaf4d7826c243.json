The driver smiled and said \"of course, no problem.\" The officer found stolen bank checks under the rear seat. In a later suppression motion, the driver claimed that his consent was not voluntary. What will the court most likely decide on that issue?\n\nA. The consent was voluntarily given and was not the result of coercion or duress.\nB. The consent was involuntary because it was the product of implied duress.\nC. The consent was involuntary because the officer did not advise the driver of his right to refuse.\nD.

The consent was voluntarily given and was not the result of coercion or duress.\n\nIn this scenario, the driver's response of smiling and saying \"of course, no problem\" indicates a willingness to comply with the officer's request to search the vehicle. There is no indication of any form of coercion or duress used by the officer that would have compelled the driver to give consent against his will. The fact that the officer did not explicitly inform the driver of his right to refuse consent does not automatically make the consent involuntary. However, it is worth noting that best police practices and legal standards often recommend informing individuals of their right to refuse consent to searches. Nevertheless, the absence of such notification does not necessarily render the consent invalid if it can be shown that the consent was otherwise freely and voluntarily given."
