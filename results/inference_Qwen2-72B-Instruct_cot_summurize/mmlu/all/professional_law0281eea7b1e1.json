Vested remainders subject to open, D. Reversions), as these terms pertain to property law and the distribution of estates. \n\nHowever, if we interpret your question in a legal context, the phrase \"with the intent to commit a felony therein\" is often used in legal definitions for crimes such as burglary. For instance, in many jurisdictions, burglary is defined as entering a building or dwelling without permission and with the intent to commit a felony or theft inside.\n\nIf you're looking for a connection between this phrase and the given options, there isn't a direct one unless you're referring to a scenario where someone intends to commit a crime involving real estate or property rights. However, that would be an extremely specific and unusual context, and none of the options A through D directly relate to criminal intent or actions.\n\nFor clarity, here's what each option means:\n\nA. Contingent remainders: This is an interest in property that will become possessory upon the happening of some uncertain event.\n\nB. Executory interests: These are interests that automatically cut off a prior interest when a certain event occurs, and they shift the interest to another party.\n\nC. Vested remainders subject to open: This is an interest in property that has already vested in a person but is subject to potential increase by the addition of other interests.\n\nD. Reversions: This refers to the right of the grantor (or their heirs) to regain possession of the property after a particular estate in the property ends."
