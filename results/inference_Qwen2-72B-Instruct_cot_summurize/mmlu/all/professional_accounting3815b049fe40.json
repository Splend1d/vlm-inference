The JIT approach requires centralized purchasing while traditional approaches encourage purchasing decisions by production employees.\nC.

                    "text": "The correct answer is D. The JIT approach operates with low inventory levels while traditional approaches may operate with high inventory levels.\n\nJust-in-time (JIT) manufacturing aims to reduce waste, including the waste associated with excess inventory. This approach emphasizes producing or acquiring materials and components only as they are needed in the production process, thereby minimizing inventory holding costs and reducing the risk of overproduction. In contrast, traditional manufacturing approaches often involve maintaining higher levels of inventory to ensure that materials are available when needed, which can lead to increased storage costs and potential obsolescence of stock."
