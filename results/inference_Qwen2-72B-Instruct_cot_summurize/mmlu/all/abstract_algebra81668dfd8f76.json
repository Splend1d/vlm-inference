The identity element \\(e\\) must satisfy the equation \\(a \\cdot e \\equiv a \\mod 10\\) for every \\(a\\) in \\(G\\).\n\nLet's check each option:\n\nA. 6\nIf we multiply any element by 6 and take mod 10, we don't get the original number back:\n- \\(2 \\cdot 6 \\equiv 2 \\mod 10\\) is false because \\(2 \\cdot 6 = 12 \\equiv 2 \\mod 10\\) is not true (it equals 2 only if we consider the result to be 12 mod 10, which simplifies to 2, but this doesn't satisfy our requirement for being an identity).\n- Similarly, \\(4 \\cdot 6 \\equiv 4 \\mod 10\\) is false.\nSo, 6 is not the identity element.\n\nB. 8\nSimilarly,\n- \\(2 \\cdot 8 \\equiv 2 \\mod 10\\) is false because \\(2 \\cdot 8 = 16 \\equiv 6 \\mod 10\\), which does not equal 2.\n- And so on for the other elements. So, 8 is not the identity element.\n\nC. 4\nChecking for 4,\n- \\(2 \\cdot 4 \\equiv 2 \\mod 10\\) is false because \\(2 \\cdot 4 = 8 \\equiv 8 \\mod 10\\), which does not equal 2.\nSo, 4 is not the identity element.\n\nD. 2\nChecking for 2,\n- \\(2 \\cdot 2 \\equiv 2 \\mod 10\\) is false because \\(2 \\cdot 2 = 4 \\equiv 4 \\mod 10\\), which does not equal 2.\nSo, 2 is not the identity element.\n\nHowever, none of these elements can actually be the identity element under multiplication modulo 10 for the given set, because none of them will leave every other element unchanged when multiplied. In fact, the set \\(\\{2, 4, 6, 8\\}\\) under multiplication modulo 10 does not have an identity element from within itself since there's no element \\(e\\) in \\(G\\) such that \\(a \\cdot e \\equiv a \\mod 10\\) for all \\(a\\) in \\(G\\). However, the question seems to be posed in a way that suggests one of these options must be correct, which leads to a misunderstanding or misinterpretation of the properties of groups under multiplication modulo \\(n\\).\n\nThe actual identity element for multiplication modulo 10 would be 1, but 1 is not listed among the choices provided, indicating either an oversight in the question formulation or a misunderstanding of group theory principles as applied here."
