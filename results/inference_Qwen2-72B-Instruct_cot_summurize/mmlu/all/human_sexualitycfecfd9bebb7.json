These three components are:\n\nA. Intimacy - this involves feelings of closeness, connectedness, and bondedness.\n\nB. Commitment - this involves the decision to maintain the relationship through good times and bad.\n\nD. Passion - this involves the physical attraction and sexual desire in a relationship.\n\nSternberg argues that for a relationship to be truly fulfilling and long-lasting, it must have all three components. Without any one of these components, a relationship may still exist but will not be as strong or satisfying. Therefore, the answer would be A, B, and D. However, since you can only select one option, the best answer would be B. Commitment, because without commitment, the other two components may not be sustained over time."
