An increase in the amount of capital.\n\nWhile increased government spending (D) can also stimulate economic growth in the short term, it is not always sustainable and can lead to inflation or higher taxes. Lower wages (B) do not necessarily promote economic growth as they can reduce consumer spending and lower living standards. Price controls that keep prices low (C) can distort market mechanisms and discourage investment and production. In contrast, an increase in the amount of capital can lead to more productive capacity and technological advancements, which are key drivers of long-term economic growth."
