Pete is incensed because it will probably take years to use up the inventory of so many toilets and seeks your advice. The best advice is\n\nA. Bill can bind the partnership by his act.\nB. silent partners are investors only and cannot bind the partnership.\nC. unless his name is in the partnership name, third persons are \"on notice\" that he is unauthorized to contract for the partnership.\nD. Bill, as a silent partner, is not authorized to purchase and, therefore, the sale may be set aside.\n"

However, generally speaking, a silent partner in a general partnership does have authority to act on behalf of the partnership if they have been granted such authority by the other partners or if their actions fall within the scope of the partnership's ordinary course of business.\n\nIn this case, since Bill has not been involved in the management of the partnership for six years, it is unlikely that he was granted authority to make significant purchases on behalf of the partnership. Therefore, option D seems like the most appropriate answer: Bill, as a silent partner, is not authorized to purchase and, therefore, the sale may be set aside.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that if the seller of the toilets acted in good faith and did not know that Bill was a silent partner without authority to make such a purchase, the partnership may still be bound by the transaction under the principle of \"apparent authority.\" This means that if the seller reasonably believed that Bill had the authority to make the purchase based on the circumstances, the partnership may still be liable for the purchase even if Bill did not actually have the authority to do so. In this case, Pete may need to seek legal advice to determine whether the sale can be set aside or if the partnership is liable for the purchase."
