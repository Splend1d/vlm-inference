Questionable Analogy\n\nThis argument commits the fallacy of questionable analogy because it compares two things that aren't necessarily similar in all relevant aspects. The argument assumes that because a watch requires a maker, the universe must also require a maker. However, this analogy may not hold up because the universe and a watch have different properties and origins. The complexity of the universe does not necessarily imply that it must have been created by an intelligent being."
