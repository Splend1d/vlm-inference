For a satellite orbiting a planet in a circular orbit, the law states that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of the orbit, which in this case is simply the radius \\(R\\) of the circular orbit.\n\nMathematically, this relationship can be expressed as:\n\n\\[ T^2 \\propto R^3 \\]\n\nor equivalently,\n\n\\[ T = 2\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{R^3}{GM}} \\]\n\nwhere \\(G\\) is the gravitational constant and \\(M\\) is the mass of the central body (the planet). Since \\(m\\), the mass of the satellite, does not appear in the equation for the orbital period of a circular orbit around a much larger body, it follows that the time required for one revolution is independent of \\(m\\).\n\nGiven the choices provided:\n\nA. independent of \\(M\\) - This is incorrect because the period \\(T\\) is inversely proportional to the square root of \\(M\\).\nB. proportional to \\(m^{1/2}\\) - This is incorrect because \\(T\\) is independent of \\(m\\).\nC. linear in \\(R\\) - This is incorrect because \\(T\\) is proportional to \\(R^{3/2}\\), not just \\(R\\).\nD. proportional to \\(R^{3/2}\\) - This is correct based on the formula derived from Kepler's Third Law.\n\nThus, the correct answer is **D. proportional to \\(R^{3/2}\\)**."
