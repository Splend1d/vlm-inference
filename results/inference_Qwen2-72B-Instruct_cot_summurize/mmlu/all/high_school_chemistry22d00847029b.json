                    "text": "The correct answer is C. The \u2013O\u2013H bonds in nitric acid are much weaker than in nitrous acid due to the electron-withdrawing effect of the additional oxygen atoms in nitric acid. This makes it easier for the hydrogen ion to dissociate from the molecule, making nitric acid a stronger acid than nitrous acid.\n\nIn nitric acid (HNO3), the presence of three oxygen atoms creates a strong electron-withdrawing effect that stabilizes the negative charge left on the oxygen atom after the proton (H+) is released. In contrast, nitrous acid (HNO2) only has two oxygen atoms, which means less stabilization of the negative charge and thus a weaker acid. \n\nThe other options provided are not accurate reasons for the difference in strength between these two acids:\n\nA. Nitrogen's electronegativity does not significantly change between the two compounds, so this is not a factor.\nB. While it is true that nitric acid has more oxygen atoms, it is the effect of those additional oxygen atoms on bond strength that matters, not just their number.\nD. Both nitric and nitrous acid have hydrogen atoms bound directly to the nitrogen atom, so this option does not explain the difference in acidity."
