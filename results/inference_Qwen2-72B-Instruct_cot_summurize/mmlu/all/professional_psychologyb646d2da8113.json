These two factors are often referred to as psychomotor speed and manual dexterity, respectively. They are considered to be the primary dimensions underlying performance on motor function tests such as the Purdue Pegboard.\n\nThe other options are not supported by factor-analytic studies:\n\nB. Motor functions are not typically considered a component of intelligence but rather a separate domain of human ability.\nC. While motor functions do share some common variance, they don't usually load onto a single factor; instead, they tend to differentiate into distinct factors like speed and dexterity.\nD. The specificity of motor functions can vary, but factor analysis tends to reveal that there are overarching factors that account for much of the shared variance across different motor tasks."
