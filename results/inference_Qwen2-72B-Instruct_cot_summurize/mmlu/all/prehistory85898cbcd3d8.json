The atlatl was a spear-throwing device used by various cultures around the world, including the Aztecs, to increase the distance and force of a thrown spear. It consists of a shaft with a small handgrip at one end and a notch or hook at the other end, which is used to hold the spear. When the spear is thrown, the atlatl leverages the thrower's arm, allowing them to throw the spear further and with greater force than would be possible without it."
