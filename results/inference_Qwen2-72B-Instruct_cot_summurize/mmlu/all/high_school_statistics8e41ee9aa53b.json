Using a t-table or calculator, we find that for 13 degrees of freedom:\n\n- The t-value for a one-tailed test at 0.10 (P = 0.10) is approximately 1.350.\n- The t-value for a one-tailed test at 0.05 (P = 0.05) is approximately 1.771.\n\nGiven these values, the P-value of 0.075 falls between the critical t-values for P = 0.10 and P = 0.05. Therefore, the corresponding t-value will fall between the t-values for those P-values.\n\nThis means that the correct answer is:\n\n**C. 1.771 < t< 2.160**\n\nHowever, option C lists an upper bound of 2.160, which is not directly provided in the standard tables for comparison. The next typical critical t-value after 1.771 for 13 degrees of freedom is around 2.160 for a two-tailed test at the 0.05 level, but since we're dealing with a one-tailed test, we focus on the lower bounds, which suggest that the correct choice based on the information given and our understanding of where the P-value falls is indeed **C**, even though the upper limit isn't directly tied to a common P-value threshold."
