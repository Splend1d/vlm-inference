Multinodular goiter\n\nA multinodular goiter is a non-toxic enlargement of the thyroid gland characterized by multiple nodules. However, in this case, the patient's symptoms indicate hyperthyroidism, which can occur when one or more of these nodules become autonomous and overproduce thyroid hormones. The varied uptake on the 131I scan indicates some areas of the gland are producing more thyroid hormone than others, consistent with a multinodular goiter where not all nodules may be functioning equally.\n\nA. A defect in thyroxine (T4) biosynthesis would typically present with hypothyroidism, not hyperthyroidism.\nB. Graves' disease typically shows a diffuse increase in uptake on a radioactive iodine scan, rather than the mixed pattern described here.\nD. Riedel's thyroiditis is a rare form of chronic inflammation of the thyroid gland that often leads to fibrosis and is not associated with the clinical presentation described."
