In exchange for $1 received this day, I agree that you can have one month from today's date to decide whether to accept this offer. \"The first student then signed the paper and handed it to the second student. The second student handed a one dollar bill to the first student and left. One week later, the second student succeeded in obtaining a $1,000 loan from his parents. He then telephoned the first student to accept the offer. Upon hearing the second student say hello, and before the second student could accept the offer, the first student said, \"I've changed my mind. I do not want to sell my car. \"Can the second student still accept the first student's offer?\n\nA. No, because $1 is inadequate consideration.\nB. No, because the first student's statement was unequivocal notice that he no longer wished to contract with the second student.\nC. Yes, because the first student's letter formed a valid option.\nD. Yes, based on the principal of promissory estoppel.\n"

Yes, because the first student's letter formed a valid option.\n\nThe first student created a binding option contract by accepting consideration ($1) in exchange for the promise to keep the offer open for one month. This means that the offer cannot be revoked during that time period, and the second student has the right to accept the offer at any point within the agreed-upon timeframe. Since the second student accepted the offer within the one-month window, the offer is still valid and enforceable."
