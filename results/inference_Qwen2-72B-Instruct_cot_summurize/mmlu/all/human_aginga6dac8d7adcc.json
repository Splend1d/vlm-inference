The other options listed can all contribute to an increased risk of falls. Taking many prescription medications can lead to side effects that affect balance and coordination. Visual impairment can make it difficult to see obstacles or changes in terrain. A change in walking style or gait can also indicate underlying health issues that could increase fall risk."
