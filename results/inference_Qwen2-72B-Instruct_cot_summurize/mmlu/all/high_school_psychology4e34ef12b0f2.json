This includes vocabulary, general knowledge, and other learned abilities. It tends to increase throughout adulthood and even into older age.\n\nIn contrast:\n- Visual acuity often decreases with age due to changes in the eye's lens and retina.\n- The ability to reason speedily and fluid intelligence (the capacity to solve new problems, use logic in novel situations, and identify patterns) typically peak around age 20 to 30 and then gradually decline."
