The customer contended that at the time of the mishap, the doors were programmed to swing outward, taking would-be customers entering the store, by surprise. At trial, the customer testified to both the nature of his injuries and the events leading up to their occurrence. The grocery store denied that the doors to its store were in any way unsafe or that the customer's injuries were caused by his encounter with the doors. The customer's sister testified at trial that she accompanied her brother to the store the day of the accident and witnessed the outward swinging doors, which struck him. She further alleged that when she returned to the store the following week, the doors had been re-programmed to swing inward. The trial judge should rule the sister's testimony\n\nA. admissible as a commonsense impression for which a lay opinion is entirely proper.\nB. admissible as a tacit admission of a party opponent.\nC. inadmissible, on the grounds of irrelevancy.\nD. inadmissible, on the grounds of public policy considerations.\n"

Admissible as a commonsense impression for which a lay opinion is entirely proper.\n\nThe sister's testimony about what she observed on the day of the incident and the subsequent change in the operation of the doors is relevant to the case. Her account of the doors' behavior at the time of the accident and the fact that they were later reprogrammed could be seen as evidence that the doors were not functioning properly or safely at the time of the incident. This testimony does not require expert knowledge and can be considered a lay opinion based on her direct observations, which is generally admissible. Additionally, the change in the doors' programming could be interpreted as an admission by the store that there was something wrong with the original programming, although this would depend on additional context and the rules of evidence applicable to the jurisdiction."
