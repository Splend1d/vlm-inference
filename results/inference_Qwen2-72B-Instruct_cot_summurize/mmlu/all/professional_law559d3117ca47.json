The preferred has a liquidation preference equal to its par value of $100 per share plus a 3 percent noncumulative dividend. Rainbow submits to its stockholders a proposal to authorize a new class of preferred stock with redemption rights that would come ahead of the old preferred stock. At a shareholders' meeting, 700 common and 400 preferred vote in favor of the proposal. Which of the following statements is correct?\n\nA. The proposal is validly approved because overall a majority of the outstanding shares did approve.\nB. The proposal is invalidly approved because a majority of the preferred shareholders did not approve.\nC. The vote of the preferred stockholders does not matter because it was nonvoting stock.\nD. The proposal is invalidly approved because a two-thirds vote of each class is required.\n"

The proposal is invalidly approved because a majority of the preferred shareholders did not approve.\n\nIn this scenario, the voting rights of the preferred stock must be considered separately from those of the common stock. Although the preferred stock is generally nonvoting, when it comes to changes that could affect their rights (such as authorizing a new class of preferred stock that would come ahead of the existing preferred), they typically have the right to vote on such matters. Since only 400 out of 1,000 preferred shares voted in favor of the proposal, less than a majority of the preferred shareholders approved it, making the approval invalid."
