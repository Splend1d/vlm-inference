Clonal expansion of pre-existing antibodies and/or T cells\n\nThis process allows for a rapid and robust response upon subsequent encounters with the same pathogen, due to the proliferation of specific antibody-secreting B cells and T cells that have previously encountered the antigen. This feature is what enables the adaptive immune system to \"remember\" past infections and respond more effectively to them, a key aspect of vaccination and immunity. While antibodies (A) and T cells (B) are crucial components of the adaptive immune system, and memory T cells (C) are important for long-term immunity, it is the clonal expansion that provides the amplification of the immune response necessary for effective immunity."
