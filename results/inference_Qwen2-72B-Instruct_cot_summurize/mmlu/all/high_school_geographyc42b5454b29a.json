However, among the options given, A is the closest to the main issue: The Green Revolution targeted crops that were not widely grown or consumed in Africa.\n\nThe Green Revolution, which occurred during the mid-20th century, focused on increasing agricultural productivity through the use of high-yielding varieties (HYVs) of cereal grains, expansion of irrigation, improved agronomic practices, and the use of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides. This revolution primarily benefited regions like South Asia and Latin America where these practices could be effectively implemented, and where the targeted crops, such as wheat and rice, were major staples.\n\nIn contrast, Africa's agriculture is more diverse, with a greater emphasis on crops like cassava, millet, sorghum, and various legumes, which were not the focus of the Green Revolution's efforts. Moreover, many African farmers lacked access to the necessary inputs, such as seeds, fertilizers, and irrigation systems, and the infrastructure needed to support these technologies was often lacking. Additionally, political instability, economic constraints, and inadequate agricultural extension services hindered the adoption of new agricultural practices.\n\nSo, while option A is a significant factor, it is important to consider the broader context of infrastructure, access to resources, and the specific needs of African agriculture when discussing why the Green Revolution did not have the same impact in Africa as it did in other parts of the world."
