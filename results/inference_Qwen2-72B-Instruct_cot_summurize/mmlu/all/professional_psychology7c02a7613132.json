Maintaining a normal body weight\n\nIndividuals with bulimia nervosa often maintain a body weight that is considered normal or even slightly overweight, while those with anorexia nervosa typically have a body weight that is significantly below what is considered healthy for their age, sex, developmental trajectory, and physical health.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that purging (A) and bingeing (C) can occur in both disorders, but the body weight criterion is crucial in distinguishing between them. Therefore, the correct answer in the context of differential diagnosis is B, maintaining a normal body weight. But for a comprehensive understanding, D (All of the above) might seem like it includes the correct answer, yet it's not the primary distinguishing factor; it's the body weight that typically sets them apart in clinical diagnosis."
