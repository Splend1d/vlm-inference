The contiguous zone is a zone in which the coastal State is permitted to prevent and punish infringements of customs, fiscal, immigration or sanitary laws. This means that within this zone, which extends up to 24 nautical miles from the baseline from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured, the coastal State has the right to enforce certain laws and regulations for the purpose of preventing and punishing violations that may have occurred within its territory or territorial sea. This includes customs, fiscal, immigration, and sanitary laws."
