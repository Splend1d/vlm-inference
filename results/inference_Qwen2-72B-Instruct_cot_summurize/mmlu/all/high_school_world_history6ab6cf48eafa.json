He knew that the Russian troops could reach the southern tip of Korea before American troops could arrive. He also knew that the Russians were on the verge of moving into Korea, or were already there. The nearest American troops to Korea were on Okinawa, 600 miles away. His problem, therefore, was to compose a surrender arrangement which, while acceptable to the Russians, would at the same time prevent them from seizing all of Korea. If they refused to confine their advance to north Korea, the United States would be unable to stop them. . . . He decided to use the 38th parallel as a hypothetical line dividing the zones within which Japanese forces in Korea would surrender to appointed American and Russian authorities.\n\u2014Adapted from U.S. Army Lt. Paul C. McGrath's account of Colonel Bonesteel's decision in the 1940s\nWhich best describes the relationship between the United States and the Soviets as depicted in the passage?\n\nA.

While they are not openly hostile, there is a clear strategic competition and mistrust between the two nations, particularly concerning the control of territories such as Korea. Colonel Bonesteel's decision to propose the 38th parallel as a division for the surrender of Japanese forces reflects an attempt to balance Soviet influence and prevent them from gaining complete control over the Korean peninsula. This action is taken despite the fact that American forces are not geographically positioned to enforce this decision militarily, indicating a complex dynamic where cooperation and competition coexist."
