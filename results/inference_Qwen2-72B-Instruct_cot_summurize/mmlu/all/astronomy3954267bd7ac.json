However, it's important to note that the question asks about the largest parabolic antenna, and while the Arecibo dish was indeed massive, its design did not allow it to move, as it was fixed in place and relied on the movement of the sky overhead for observation.\n\nThe Green Bank Telescope (GBT) in West Virginia, USA, is fully steerable and has a diameter of 100 meters (330 feet), making it currently the largest fully steerable single-dish radio telescope in the world.\n\nThe Yevpatoria RT-70 Telescope in Ukraine has a diameter of 70 meters (230 feet).\n\nThe Effelsberg Telescope in Germany also has a diameter of 100 meters (328 feet).\n\nGiven the question's phrasing, the correct answer would be:\n\nA. Green Bank Telescope\n\nThis is because the GBT is both the largest fully steerable parabolic antenna and, following the collapse of the Arecibo Telescope, the largest single-dish radio telescope by diameter."
