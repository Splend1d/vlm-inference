Assuming an average cost of electricity of $0.12 per kilowatt-hour and an efficiency of 3 BTUs per kilowatt-hour, this would translate to a cost of around $10 billion per year to air condition all American automobiles. However, it's worth noting that not all cars are electric or use electricity for their air conditioning, so this estimate may not be entirely accurate. Additionally, this figure doesn't take into account the cost of fuel used to power the air conditioning in gasoline-powered cars."
