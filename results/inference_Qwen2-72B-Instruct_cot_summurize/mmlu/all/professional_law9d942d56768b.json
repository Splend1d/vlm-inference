Her face frozen in a grotesque grimace, she demanded to speak to the doctor. The doctor said, \"Listen, why don't you go over to the emergency room and send the bills to me? I'll take care of your medical expenses. \" The patient subsequently sued the doctor for negligent hiring of the medical assistant and for damages. At trial, she proposes to call the doctor's administrative assistant, who was present during her conversation with the doctor. The patient wants the administrative assistant to testify to the doctor's offer to pay her medical bills. The doctor's attorney objects. The trial judge should\n\nA. sustain the objection, because the patient's medical records are the best evidence of the doctor's negligence.\nB. sustain the objection as an offer to pay the medical bills.\nC. overrule the objection, because the evidence is relevant as to the question of the doctor's negligent hiring.\nD. overrule the objection, because an offer to pay medical bills is an inferential admission.\n"

Generally, offers to pay medical expenses or other damages are not admissible as evidence of liability under the Federal Rules of Evidence Rule 409, which states that offers made to pay medical expenses are not admissible to prove liability for the injury. However, such offers can be admissible for other purposes, such as showing the relationship between the parties, the witness's bias or prejudice, or as evidence of the doctor's negligent hiring practices, which is the focus of the patient's claim in this scenario.\n\nIt's important to note that the relevance of this testimony would depend on the specific context and rules of evidence in the jurisdiction where the trial is taking place. The judge would have to weigh the probative value of the testimony against any potential prejudicial effect it might have on the jury."
