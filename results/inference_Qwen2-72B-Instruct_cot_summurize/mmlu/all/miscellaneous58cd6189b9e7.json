Energy flow between trophic levels is inefficient.\n\nThis statement is true because as energy flows through an ecosystem from one trophic level to the next (e.g., from plants to herbivores to carnivores), only a small percentage of the energy is transferred. Typically, only about 10% of the energy stored in one trophic level is passed on to the next level. This inefficiency is due to energy being lost as heat during metabolic processes and not being available for consumption by the next trophic level."
