This is because people with more wealth are more likely to save and invest, increasing the amount of money available for lending. This increase in supply tends to push interest rates down as lenders compete for borrowers.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Increase in supply   Falling interest rate\n\nHowever, it's important to note that other factors can also influence interest rates, such as central bank policies or inflation expectations. In isolation, though, an increase in the supply of loanable funds due to higher consumer wealth and optimism would lead to falling interest rates."
