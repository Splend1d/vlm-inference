This ensures that the decision-making process is transparent and can be scrutinized by the public and other officials. It also helps to ensure that the decision is made with the best interests of the country and its citizens in mind. However, it's worth noting that in the heat of the moment, as option A suggests, decisions may need to be made quickly and without immediate authorization, but ideally, they should still be made by those with the authority and responsibility to do so. Option C is not necessarily true, as there can be objective answers to such dilemmas based on ethical principles and legal frameworks. Option D is incorrect because options A and B both contain valid points, although B is the most relevant to Dershowitz's argument."
