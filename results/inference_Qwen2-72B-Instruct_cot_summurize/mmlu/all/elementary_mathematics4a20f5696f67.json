Since one quarter gives 60 seconds of car wash time and he spent $3.25, we need to figure out how many quarters are in $3.25.\n\n$3.25 is equivalent to 325 cents. Since each quarter is worth 25 cents, we divide 325 by 25 to get the number of quarters:\n\n\\[ \\frac{325}{25} = 13 \\]\n\nSo Marcus used 13 quarters.\n\nEach quarter gives 60 seconds of car wash time. So 13 quarters give:\n\n\\[ 13 \\times 60 = 780 \\text{ seconds} \\]\n\nTo convert seconds into minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute):\n\n\\[ \\frac{780}{60} = 13 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nTherefore, it took Marcus 13 minutes to wash his car, which corresponds to option B."
