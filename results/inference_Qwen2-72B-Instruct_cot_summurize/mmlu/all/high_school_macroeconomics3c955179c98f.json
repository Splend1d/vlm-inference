This increase in relative price attractiveness will lead consumers who were previously buying good X to switch to good Z, thereby increasing demand for good Z.\n\nAn increase in demand for good Z (assuming supply remains constant) will result in:\n\n1. An upward pressure on the price of good Z as more people are willing to pay higher prices for it.\n2. A movement along the supply curve to a higher equilibrium quantity as suppliers respond to the higher price by offering more of good Z for sale.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. The equilibrium price and the equilibrium quantity will both rise."
