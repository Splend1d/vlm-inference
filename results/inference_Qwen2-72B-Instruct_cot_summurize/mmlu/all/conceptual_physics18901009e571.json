Ice is less dense than liquid water, but when there are small ice particles dispersed throughout the water, they can increase the overall density of the mixture because they take up space without significantly reducing the mass per unit volume as much as pure ice would. This effect is similar to what happens when sea ice forms at the surface of the ocean, causing the surrounding seawater to become denser and sink."
