                    "text": "To answer this question, we need to understand what Marginal Revenue Product (MRP) is and how it relates to hiring decisions. The MRP of a worker is the additional revenue generated by hiring one more worker. It is calculated as the marginal product (MP) of the worker multiplied by the price of the output.\n\nIn this case, the MP of the 3rd worker is 10 units, and the price of the product is $3 per unit. Therefore, the MRPL (Marginal Revenue Product of Labor) for the 3rd worker is:\n\n\\[ \\text{MRPL} = \\text{MP} \\times \\text{Price} = 10 \\times 3 = 30 \\]\n\nThe cost of hiring a worker is $15. For a profit-maximizing firm, it should hire workers up to the point where the MRPL equals the wage rate. In this scenario, the MRPL ($30) is greater than the wage rate ($15), which means hiring this worker increases profits.\n\nNow let's evaluate the options:\n\nA. Hiring more labor could be correct if doing so continues to increase MRPL beyond the wage rate. However, the statement about increasing MRPL is not accurate; MRPL may or may not increase with more workers\u2014it depends on the law of diminishing returns.\n\nB. Hiring more labor to decrease MRPL does not make sense from a profit maximization perspective. Decreasing MRPL would mean that the additional revenue generated by new workers is decreasing relative to the cost of hiring them.\n\nC. Hiring less labor to increase MRPL also does not align with profit maximization. Reducing labor when MRPL > Wage Rate means leaving potential profits on the table.\n\nD. Hiring less labor to decrease MRPL makes no sense in terms of maximizing profits.\n\nGiven the information provided, the firm should continue hiring labor until the MRPL equals the wage rate. Since the MRPL of the 3rd worker is higher than the wage rate, the firm should consider hiring more labor (Option A). However, Option A does not accurately state the reason for hiring more labor (i.e., to increase MRPL, which is not necessarily the goal). Thus, the most accurate statement based on the given options and economic principles would be that the firm should hire more labor while MRPL > Wage Rate, but this exact statement isn't listed among the choices. \n\nSo, none of the options perfectly fit the criteria for the most true statement based on the information provided, but the closest to being true within the context of the question is:\n\nA. The firm should hire more labor. However, the reason stated (\"so that the MRPL will increase\") is incorrect, as the decision should be based on whether MRPL is greater than the wage rate, not on increasing MRPL."
