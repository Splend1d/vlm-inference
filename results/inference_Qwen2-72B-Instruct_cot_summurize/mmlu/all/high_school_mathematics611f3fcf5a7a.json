                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of rolling exactly two even numbers out of four 20-sided dice.\n\nFirst, let's understand the probability of rolling an even number on a single die. Since half of the numbers from 1 to 20 are even (i.e., 10 out of 20), the probability of rolling an even number is \\(\\frac{10}{20} = \\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\nNext, we want exactly two of the four dice to show an even number. This can happen in several ways, but we're interested in the total probability of any of these outcomes happening.\n\nThe probability of getting exactly \\(k\\) successes (in this case, even numbers) in \\(n\\) trials (in this case, dice rolls) follows a binomial distribution. The formula for calculating this probability is:\n\\[P(k; n, p) = \\binom{n}{k}p^k(1-p)^{n-k}\\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\) is the binomial coefficient, which calculates the number of ways to choose \\(k\\) successes out of \\(n\\) trials.\n- \\(p\\) is the probability of success on a single trial.\n\nIn our scenario, \\(n=4\\), \\(k=2\\), and \\(p=\\frac{1}{2}\\). Therefore, we have:\n\\[P(2; 4, \\frac{1}{2}) = \\binom{4}{2}(\\frac{1}{2})^2(1-\\frac{1}{2})^{4-2}\\]\n\nThe binomial coefficient \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\) calculates the number of ways to choose 2 successes out of 4 trials, which is:\n\\[\\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \\frac{4\\times3}{2\\times1} = 6\\]\n\nPlugging this into the formula gives us:\n\\[P(2; 4, \\frac{1}{2}) = 6(\\frac{1}{2})^2(\\frac{1}{2})^{4-2} = 6(\\frac{1}{2})^4 = 6(\\frac{1}{16}) = \\frac{6}{16} = \\frac{3}{8}\\]\n\nTherefore, the probability of exactly two of the dice showing an even number is \\(\\boxed{\\text{C. } \\frac{3}{8}}\\)."
