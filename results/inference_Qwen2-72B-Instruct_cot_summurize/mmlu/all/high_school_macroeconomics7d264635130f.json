                    "text": "When Mommy Morebucks withdraws $1 million from her checking account and keeps it as cash, the immediate effect is that $1 million leaves the banking system as currency in circulation. However, the more significant impact comes from the potential reduction in the money supply due to the decrease in bank reserves.\n\nIn a fractional-reserve banking system, banks are required to keep a certain percentage of their deposits on reserve (the reserve ratio). In this case, the reserve ratio is 10%, meaning for every $100 deposited, the bank must keep $10 in reserve and can lend out the remaining $90. When a bank lends out money, that money gets spent and redeposited into another bank, which can then lend out 90% of those new deposits, and so on. This process multiplies the initial deposit many times over, creating a larger money supply than the original deposit.\n\nWhen $1 million is withdrawn, the bank loses that much in reserves. The bank will have to reduce its lending by an amount that reflects the reserve requirement. If the reserve ratio is 10%, the bank must reduce its lending by $1 million / 0.1 = $10 million. This reduction in lending means that there will be $10 million less in potential new deposits created through the money multiplier effect.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Decreases it by $9 million\n\nHowever, this explanation assumes that the $1 million withdrawn was part of the bank's excess reserves, not required reserves. If the $1 million was part of the required reserves, the bank would need to find additional reserves elsewhere or reduce its lending by at least $1 million, not accounting for any multiplier effect. But since we're considering the potential impact on the money supply through the money multiplier effect, option A is the most accurate choice given the information provided."
