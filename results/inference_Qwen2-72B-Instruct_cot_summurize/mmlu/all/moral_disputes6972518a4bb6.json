This means that while animals themselves are not capable of entering into social contracts or understanding the terms of such contracts, they can still be afforded moral consideration because it serves the interests of those who are parties to the social contract (i.e., humans). The moral standing of animals is thus derived indirectly from their impact on human interests and well-being."
