Specifically, we will use the equation that relates distance (\\(s\\)), initial velocity (\\(u\\)), acceleration (\\(a\\)), and time (\\(t\\)):\n\n\\[s = ut + \\frac{1}{2}at^2\\]\n\nGiven that the car starts from rest, \\(u = 0\\). The acceleration (\\(a\\)) is given as \\(5 \\, \\text{m/s}^2\\), and the distance (\\(s\\)) is \\(200 \\, \\text{m}\\). We want to find the time (\\(t\\)). Substituting the given values into the equation gives:\n\n\\[200 = (0)t + \\frac{1}{2}(5)t^2\\]\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n\\[200 = \\frac{5}{2}t^2\\]\n\nMultiplying both sides by \\(\\frac{2}{5}\\) gives:\n\n\\[80 = t^2\\]\n\nTaking the square root of both sides yields:\n\n\\[t = \\sqrt{80}\\]\n\n\\[t = \\sqrt{16 \\times 5}\\]\n\n\\[t = 4\\sqrt{5}\\]\n\n\\[t \\approx 4 \\times 2.236\\]\n\n\\[t \\approx 8.944 \\, \\text{s}\\]\n\nThis value is closest to option A, which is \\(9.0 \\, \\text{s}\\).\n\nSo, the answer is **A. 9.0 s**."
