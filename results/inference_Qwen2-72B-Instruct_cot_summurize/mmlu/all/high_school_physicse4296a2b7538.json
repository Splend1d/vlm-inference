This effect causes a change in the observed frequency of the sound waves, making them appear higher or lower than the actual frequency emitted by the source.\n\nThe Doppler shift can be absent if the source and the detector move together at the same velocity, i.e., they have no relative motion with respect to each other. In this case, the observed frequency will be the same as the emitted frequency, and there will be no Doppler shift.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nC. Both the source and detector travel in the same direction.\n\nHowever, this is only true if they maintain exactly the same velocity. Any difference in their velocities would result in a relative motion and thus a Doppler shift."
