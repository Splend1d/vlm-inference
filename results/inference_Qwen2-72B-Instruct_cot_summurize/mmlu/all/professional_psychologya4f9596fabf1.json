PREPARATION: Intending to take action within the next month and may have taken some small steps towards change.\nD. ACTION: Actively modifying one's behavior, environment, or increasing new behaviors that support change.\nE. MAINTENANCE: Behavior change has been sustained for more than 6 months, and efforts are made to prevent relapse.\n\nTherefore, the closest match to one of the options provided would be:\n\nC. ACTION: time and effort into modifying behavior\n\nHowever, it should be noted that option D's description of maintenance as lasting at least 8 months is not entirely accurate according to the model, as maintenance is typically considered to start after 6 months of sustained change."
