                    "text": "To evaluate the given sum, we need to understand how the ceiling function of square roots behaves. We have:\n\n\\[\n\\lceil\\sqrt{5}\\rceil + \\lceil\\sqrt{6}\\rceil + \\lceil\\sqrt{7}\\rceil + \\cdots + \\lceil\\sqrt{29}\\rceil\n\\]\n\nFirst, note that $\\sqrt{4} = 2$ and $\\sqrt{9} = 3$, so for any $n$ such that $4 < n < 9$, $\\lceil\\sqrt{n}\\rceil = 3$. There are $4$ numbers in this range ($5, 6, 7, 8$).\n\nNext, for $9 \\leq n < 16$, $\\lceil\\sqrt{n}\\rceil = 4$. This includes $7$ numbers ($9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15$).\n\nFor $16 \\leq n < 25$, $\\lceil\\sqrt{n}\\rceil = 5$. This includes $8$ numbers ($16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24$).\n\nFinally, for $25 \\leq n \\leq 29$, $\\lceil\\sqrt{n}\\rceil = 6$. This includes $5$ numbers ($25, 26, 27, 28, 29$).\n\nSo, the total sum can be calculated as follows:\n\n\\[\n(4)(3) + (7)(4) + (9)(5) + (5)(6) = 12 + 28 + 45 + 30 = 115\n\\]\n\nHowever, this option is not listed among the choices provided, which suggests there might have been an error in calculation or understanding of the options. Given the calculations, none of the provided answer choices match the result of $115$. \n\nUpon re-examining the calculation steps and the question, it seems the calculation is correct based on the interpretation of the problem statement, but the answer does not match any of the given options. Therefore, it's possible that either the question was misinterpreted or the options provided do not include the correct answer.\n\nGiven the provided options (A. 112, B. 111, C. 2006, D. 110), none directly matches the computed result of $115$. However, considering common test-taking strategies, when none of the provided options match your computation and assuming no miscalculation, it's best to choose the option closest to your answer. In this case, the options closest to $115$ are A. 112 and D. 110. Without further context or information, one cannot definitively choose between these two without additional guidance or clarification on rounding or approximation methods.\n\nIn a test scenario, if no further guidance is provided and assuming the question's intent was accurately interpreted, you would typically select the option closest to your calculated answer, which in this case, is neither of the provided options. The closest options to $115$ are A. 112 and D. 110, with A. 112 being slightly closer. However, without additional context, selecting either could be considered reasonable based on rounding practices. Since exact matching is not possible, it's recommended to revisit the question's details or seek clarification if available during a formal assessment."
