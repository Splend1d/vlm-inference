He notes that REM (Rapid Eye Movement) sleep is particularly important for infant brain development because it's during this phase that the brain consolidates memories, processes information from the day, and develops neural connections. Longer and more frequent periods of REM sleep can thus contribute to optimal brain development in infants."
