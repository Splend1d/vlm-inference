Serving an omelet made of scrambled brains and bacon could be considered unusual or unappetizing to some, but it does not inherently involve harm or immoral behavior unless the \"brains\" were obtained unethically or the dish was served deceptively. However, since no context is given about the source of the brains, we cannot assume it's wrong based on the information provided.\n\nScenario 2, on the other hand, clearly involves a morally wrong action. Tossing a hot coal to someone can cause serious injury and pain, which is against ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. This action demonstrates a disregard for another person's safety and well-being."
