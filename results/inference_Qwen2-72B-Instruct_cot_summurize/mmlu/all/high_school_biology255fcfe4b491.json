Each bird's survival was strongly influenced by the depth and strength of its beak as the drought persisted.\n\nDuring a prolonged drought on the Gal\u00e1pagos island of Daphne Major, the available food sources changed, favoring seeds that were harder and larger than usual. Finches with deeper, stronger beaks were better able to crack open these seeds and thus had a higher chance of survival. This natural selection process led to an increase in the average beak size of the surviving finch population over time. However, it is important to note that individual birds do not evolve or develop traits during their lifetimes; rather, genetic variations within the population can lead to changes in the characteristics of future generations if certain traits confer a survival advantage."
