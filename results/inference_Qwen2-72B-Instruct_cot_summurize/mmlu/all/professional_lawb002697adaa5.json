Delivery by April 1. \"On March 8, the company shipped 300 sheets of 1/2-inch refabricated aluminum siding, which were received by the builder on March 10. The following day, the builder sent the following fax to the company: \"Be advised that your shipment is rejected. Order stipulated 1/4-inch sheets. \" This fax was received by the company, but the builder did not ship the nonconforming aluminum sheets back to the company. Did the builder properly reject the shipment delivered on March 10?\n\nA. Yes, because the aluminum sheets were nonconforming goods.\nB. Yes, because the company did not notify the builder that the 1/2-inch sheets were for accommodation only.\nC. No, because the builder waived its right to reject the nonconforming goods by not returning them promptly to the company.\nD. No, because the company could accept the builder's offer by prompt shipment of either conforming or nonconforming goods.\n"

Yes, because the aluminum sheets were nonconforming goods.\n\nThe builder has the right to reject the shipment because the goods delivered did not match the specifications in the original order. According to the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), when goods do not conform to the contract, the buyer has the right to reject them. The builder notified the company of the rejection promptly upon discovering the nonconformity, as evidenced by the fax sent the day after receiving the shipment. The fact that the builder did not return the goods immediately does not necessarily waive their right to reject them, especially if they have notified the seller of their intent to reject the goods. The UCC allows for a reasonable time for the return of goods under such circumstances."
