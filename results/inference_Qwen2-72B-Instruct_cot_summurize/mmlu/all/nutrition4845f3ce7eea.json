However, during periods of metabolic stress, such as critical illness or injury, the demand for glutamate can exceed the body's ability to produce it. This makes glutamate conditionally essential under such circumstances. Glutamate plays a crucial role in various metabolic processes and is involved in the synthesis of other amino acids and nitrogen transport."
