However, it's important to note that these equations also apply to everyday low speeds, but their effects are negligible at those speeds because they approach the classical physics results. So, in a broader sense, the correct answer could be argued as C. Both of these, considering that relativity equations encompass classical physics at low speeds as a special case. But strictly speaking, their noticeable effects and necessity for application arise at relativistic speeds."
