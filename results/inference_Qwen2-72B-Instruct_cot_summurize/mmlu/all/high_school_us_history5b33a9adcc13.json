They only wanted to work in rice paddies without helicopters strafing them and bombs with napalm burning their villages and tearing their country apart. They wanted everything to do with the war, particularly with this foreign presence of the United States of America, to leave them alone in peace, and they practiced the art of survival by siding with whichever military force was present at a particular time, be it Viet Cong, North Vietnamese or American.\"\nJohn Kerry, 1971\nThe two political issues that most concerned the Counterculture Movement of the 1960s were\n\nA.

U.S. involvement in Vietnam and the civil rights movement.\n\nThe Counterculture Movement of the 1960s was characterized by a strong opposition to the Vietnam War and a push for civil rights, especially for African Americans. The movement was made up of young people who were disillusioned with traditional American values and institutions, and sought to create a new culture based on peace, love, and equality. The war in Vietnam was seen as a symbol of the government's hypocrisy and aggression, while the civil rights movement represented a struggle for justice and equality that resonated with the counterculture's ideals."
