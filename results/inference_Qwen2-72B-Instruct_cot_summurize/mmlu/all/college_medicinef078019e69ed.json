H2O\n\nThis segment of the nephron allows for the passive diffusion of water from the filtrate back into the bloodstream, contributing to the concentration of urine and the conservation of water by the body. The other ions listed (Na+, K+, Cl-) are reabsorbed or secreted in different parts of the nephron, but not primarily through the descending loop of Henle."
