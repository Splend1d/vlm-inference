This is because white Ford minivans are a very specific subset of goods, and consumers can easily substitute them with other colors of Ford minivans, minivans from other manufacturers, or even different types of vehicles altogether. The more specific the good, generally, the more elastic its demand tends to be because there are more substitutes available."
