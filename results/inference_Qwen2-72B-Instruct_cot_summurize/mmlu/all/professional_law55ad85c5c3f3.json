After the work was completed, the homeowner honestly believed that there were defects in the contractor's work as well as departures from the plans. In fact, the contractor had fully performed. The homeowner offered to pay the contractor $35,000 in full settlement in exchange for the contractor's promise to surrender his entire claim. The contractor accepted the homeowner's offer, and the homeowner paid the contractor $35,000. The reasonable value of the work was $35,000. Is the contractor likely to succeed in an action challenging the validity of the settlement agreement?\n\nA. No, because the homeowner honestly disputed the amount he owed the contractor.\nB. No, because the reasonable value of the work was only $35,000.\nC. Yes, because the contractor reasonably relied on the homeowner's contractual promise to pay the full $50,000, and that promise should be enforced to avoid injustice.\nD. Yes, because the homeowner's payment of $35,000 cannot furnish consideration for the contractor's relinquishment of a claim for $50,000.\n"

No, because the reasonable value of the work was only $35,000.\n\nThe key factor here is that the reasonable value of the work was actually $35,000, which matches the amount the contractor agreed to accept in full settlement. Even if the contractor initially expected $50,000 based on the contract, the fact that the fair market value of the work was less than this amount means that accepting $35,000 is not necessarily unjust or invalid. The contractor's acceptance of the lesser amount in full settlement, especially when it aligns with the actual value of the work, suggests that the settlement was fair and reasonable. Thus, the contractor is unlikely to succeed in challenging the validity of the settlement agreement."
