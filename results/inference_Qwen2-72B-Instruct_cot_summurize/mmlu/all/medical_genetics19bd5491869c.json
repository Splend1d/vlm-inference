It is part of a group of genetic disorders known as Zellweger spectrum disorders, which also includes neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy and infantile Refsum disease. These disorders result from mutations in genes that are involved in the function of peroxisomes, small structures inside cells that break down fatty acids and other substances. As a result, substances that are normally broken down by peroxisomes can build up to toxic levels in the body, leading to various symptoms."
