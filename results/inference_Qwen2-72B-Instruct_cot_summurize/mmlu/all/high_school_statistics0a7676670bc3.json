The alternative hypothesis (Ha) challenges the null hypothesis by suggesting an effect, difference, or change.\n\nIn this case, the claim is that more than 60% of the mall's visitors shop at the store. To test this claim, you would want your alternative hypothesis (Ha) to reflect the claim that the proportion of visitors who shop at the store is greater than 60%. This means your null hypothesis (H0) would state the opposite - that the proportion is less than or equal to 60%.\n\nThus, the correct pair of hypotheses to support the claim that more than 60% of the mall's visitors shop at the store would be:\n\nH0: p \u2264 0.60 (The proportion of the mall's visitors who shop at the store is 60% or less)\nHa: p > 0.60 (The proportion of the mall's visitors who shop at the store is more than 60%)\n\nTherefore, the answer is A.
