Static friction\n\nStatic friction acts at the point of contact between the sphere and the hill, and it is this force that provides the necessary torque for the sphere to start rotating. This static friction force is directed up the slope, opposite to the direction the hill would try to slide the sphere if there were no rotation. As the sphere rolls without slipping, the point of contact remains momentarily at rest relative to the hill, which is why static (not kinetic) friction is involved."
