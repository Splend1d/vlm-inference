When someone assumes a mortgage, they take over the payments on the existing mortgage loan, but this does not necessarily mean that they are assuming personal liability for the debt. In order for the friend to be personally liable for the debt, there would need to be a separate agreement or contract between the friend and the farmer that specifically states that the friend is taking on the responsibility for paying off the debt. Since there is no indication that such an agreement exists, the farmer will most likely not prevail in an in personam action against the friend to recover the amount of the mortgage due."
