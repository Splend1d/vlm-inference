A police officer noticed her and, on a hunch, conducted a random search. He found a variety of jewelry with price tags and no receipts. A jewelry store owner in the vicinity stated that the jewelry was stolen a few minutes earlier, and the girl may have been a customer at that time. She was arrested for theft. The girl's counsel filed a motion to suppress the evidence. Will the judge likely order suppression of the evidence?\n\nA. Yes, there was no reasonable suspicion or probable cause for the officer to stop and search her.\nB. No, authorities are always allowed to \u0080\u0098stop and frisk' anyone to see what they are carrying.\nC. No, the search was legal because a teenager carrying bags on a downtown street is a suspicious person.\nD. Yes, the officer did not get a search warrant even though he had probable cause.\n"

Yes, there was no reasonable suspicion or probable cause for the officer to stop and search her.\n\nThe Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution protects individuals against unreasonable searches and seizures. For a police officer to conduct a search, they must have either probable cause or reasonable suspicion based on specific and articulable facts. In this case, the officer acted on a \"hunch,\" which is not sufficient grounds for a search under the law. Without any specific evidence or behavior from the girl that would lead the officer to reasonably suspect she was involved in criminal activity, the search would be considered unconstitutional. Therefore, the judge is likely to suppress the evidence obtained from the illegal search. However, if the prosecution can show that the officer had reasonable suspicion or probable cause based on observable facts, the judge might rule differently. But based on the information provided, option A is the most likely outcome."
