Householders who supported renouncers\n\nThis description aligns more closely with the concept of lay followers (shravakas and shravikas) in Jainism, who support the monastic community. They provide the four requisites\u2014food, shelter, clothing, and medicine\u2014to the monks and nuns, ensuring their basic needs are met so they can focus on spiritual practices.\n\nB. Orthodox interpreters of the scriptures\n\nThis might refer to scholars or monks who specialize in studying and interpreting Jain scriptures. However, this term does not specifically denote a group known as \"Caityavasis.\"\n\nC. Women ascetics who lived in communities\n\nJainism has a tradition of female ascetics (aryikas), but again, this term does not specifically identify them as \"Caityavasis.\"\n\nD. Temple-dwelling renouncers\n\nThis could potentially describe a type of monastic life where renouncers reside in temples, but without specific historical or textual references, it's difficult to confirm if this term is directly associated with such a group.\n\nGiven these options and without a precise definition for \"Caityavasis,\" the most fitting answer would be A. Householders who supported renouncers, as it best fits the general understanding of lay support in Jain communities. However, it's important to note that this choice is an interpretation based on the given options and may not accurately reflect a specific term used within Jain literature or tradition."
