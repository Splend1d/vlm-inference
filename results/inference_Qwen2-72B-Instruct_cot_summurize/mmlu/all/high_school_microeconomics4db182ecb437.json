                    "text": "The combination of these two events would have opposing effects on the demand and supply of pineapples, making the effect on equilibrium quantity indeterminate without further information.\n\nFirstly, the drought affecting the supply of pineapples would decrease the supply, shifting the supply curve to the left. This would typically result in a higher price and lower quantity at the new equilibrium point.\n\nSecondly, the discovery that pineapples may assist in the avoidance of cancer would increase the demand for pineapples as consumers perceive them as healthier. This would shift the demand curve to the right, resulting in a higher price and higher quantity at the new equilibrium point.\n\nGiven these two opposing forces, it's impossible to determine with certainty how the equilibrium quantity will be affected without knowing the relative strengths of these forces. If the decrease in supply due to the drought is more significant than the increase in demand due to the health discovery, the equilibrium quantity could decrease. Conversely, if the increase in demand outweighs the decrease in supply, the equilibrium quantity could increase.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer regarding the equilibrium quantity is:\n\nD. Decreases         Indeterminate\n\nHowever, note that the first part of the answer (Decreases) only pertains to the effect of the drought on supply, while the second part (Indeterminate) reflects the overall effect considering both the drought and the health discovery. The equilibrium price would most likely increase due to the combined effect of decreased supply and increased demand."
