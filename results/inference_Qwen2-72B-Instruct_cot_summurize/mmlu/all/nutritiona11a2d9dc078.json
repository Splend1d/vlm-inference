While it is true that exercise can sometimes lead to hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) in people with diabetes, particularly if they have taken insulin or other glucose-lowering medications, this is not generally considered a beneficial effect. Hypoglycaemia can be dangerous and should be managed carefully. The other options listed (reduction of triglycerides, increase of insulin sensitivity, and help controlling hypertension) are all recognized benefits of regular physical activity for individuals with diabetes."
