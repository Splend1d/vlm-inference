This statement is incorrect because exons are defined as the segments of a gene that are transcribed into RNA and then translated into proteins. They do not contain noncoding DNA by definition; however, they are interspersed with noncoding regions called introns within the pre-mRNA, which are removed during splicing to produce mature mRNA.\n\nB. This statement is not always true. While the first exon often contains the translational start site (the AUG codon), this is not an absolute rule. In some cases, the start codon can be located in an intron or in another part of the gene.\n\nC. This statement is also not always true. The last exon does not necessarily contain the normal termination codon. Termination codons (UAA, UAG, or UGA) can be found in any exon, depending on the gene's structure and the reading frame.\n\nD. This statement is correct. A coding exon is always translated in just one of the three possible forward reading frames. The reading frame is established by the start codon, which determines how the sequence of nucleotides in the mRNA is grouped into codons for translation into amino acids. Once the reading frame is set, it continues unchanged through the rest of the mRNA until a stop codon is encountered."
