Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation:\nScenario 1: Bringing a knife while going camping is not considered morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. A knife can be a useful tool for camping activities such as preparing food or setting up camp.\nScenario 2: Having sex at work may be inappropriate and unprofessional, but it is not necessarily morally wrong if it is consensual and does not violate any company policies or laws. However, it could still have negative consequences for the individuals involved and the workplace environment. The context and details of the situation would determine whether it crosses into being morally wrong. Without further context, it cannot be definitively labeled as morally wrong based on ordinary moral standards alone."
