Congress passes legislation establishing a national speed limit.\n\nThe Elastic Clause, also known as the Necessary and Proper Clause, is found in Article I, Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution and gives Congress the authority to pass laws that are deemed necessary and proper for carrying out its enumerated powers. Establishing a national speed limit would be an example of Congress using this clause to regulate interstate commerce, which is one of its enumerated powers."
