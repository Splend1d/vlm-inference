Under the Federal Rules of Evidence, Rule 803(16), a statement in a document in existence 20 years or more at the time it is offered is admissible as an exception to the hearsay rule. This is because documents that have been in existence for such a long period are presumed to be reliable due to their age and the lack of any motive to fabricate them at the time they were created. In this case, since the microfilm copy is 20 years old and is the only record of that particular issue of the newspaper, it could be admitted as an ancient document to prove the price of gold on that day. However, it's important to note that the authenticity of the document must also be established, which is why the librarian's testimony would be relevant."
