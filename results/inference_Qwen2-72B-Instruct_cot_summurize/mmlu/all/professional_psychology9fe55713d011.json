Performance-based assessment.\n\nAssessment centers are unique in their reliance on simulations and exercises that require candidates to demonstrate their skills and abilities in realistic job-related scenarios. These performance-based assessments often include activities such as role-playing, group discussions, in-basket exercises, and problem-solving tasks. This approach allows for a more comprehensive evaluation of a candidate's potential for success in the position than traditional methods such as interviews or paper-and-pencil tests."
