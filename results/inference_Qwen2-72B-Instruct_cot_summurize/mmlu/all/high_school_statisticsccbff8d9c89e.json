The standard deviation of a t-distribution depends on its degrees of freedom (df). As the degrees of freedom increase, the t-distribution approaches the standard normal distribution which has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. However, for smaller degrees of freedom, the t-distribution will have a larger standard deviation."
