This is because logarithmic functions grow more slowly than polynomial functions, and when you take the logarithm of the logarithm, you further slow down the rate of growth.\n\nHere's how these functions compare in terms of their growth rates:\n\n- O(log log N) grows slower than O(log N), which grows slower than O(log e^N) (which is equivalent to O(N)), which grows slower than O(N).\n\nSo the order from slowest growing to fastest growing is:\nC. O(log log N)\nB. O(log N)\nA. O(log e^N) or O(N)\nD. O(N)\n\nNote: O(log e^N) simplifies to O(N) because the natural logarithm of e^N is just N."
