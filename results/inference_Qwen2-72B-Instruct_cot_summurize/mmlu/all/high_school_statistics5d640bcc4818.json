To see if there is a difference between boys and girls in their opposition to the new dress code, they conduct a poll of 60 randomly selected male and 70 randomly selected female high school students in the district. They find that 66 females oppose the dress code and 50 males oppose the dress code. Which of the following explains why a two-proportion z-test is not appropriate?\n\nA. The sample sizes are different.\nB. The sample sizes are too large.\nC. The number of successes and the number of failures for the two groups are not all large enough.\nD. The shapes of the population distributions are not known.\n"

The number of successes and the number of failures for the two groups are not all large enough.\n\nFor a two-proportion z-test to be appropriate, certain conditions need to be met, including:\n1. Independence: The samples should be independent of each other, which seems to be the case here.\n2. Sample size: The sample sizes should be large enough so that the sampling distribution of the difference between the proportions is approximately normal. A common rule of thumb is that both np (number of successes) and n(1-p) (number of failures) should be greater than or equal to 10 for both groups.\n3. Randomness: The samples should be randomly selected, which is also stated in the question.\n\nIn this scenario, we have:\n- For females: 66 out of 70 oppose the dress code, so np = 66 and n(1-p) = 4.\n- For males: 50 out of 60 oppose the dress code, so np = 50 and n(1-p) = 10.\n\nThe number of successes (opposing the dress code) is sufficiently large for both groups, but the number of failures (not opposing the dress code) is less than 10 for the females. Therefore, condition C is violated, making the two-proportion z-test inappropriate for this data set."
