This income tax exempts taxable income earned outside of the state by photographers who live in the state. Moreover, resident-photographers of the state are not taxed on their in-state earned income. A photographer who operates a studio in the state but is a resident of another state, challenges the constitutionality of this tax. Which of the following provisions would furnish the most applicable basis for this constitutional challenge?\n\nA. The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nB. The due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nC. The commerce clause.\nD. The privileges and immunities clause of ArticleIv.\n"

The commerce clause gives Congress the power to regulate commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes. By taxing nonresident photographers who operate in the state while exempting resident photographers from taxation on similar income, the state may be unduly burdening interstate commerce, which could violate the commerce clause."
