This increased size leads to greater polarizability because the outer electrons are further from the nucleus and can be more easily distorted by an electric field.\n\nA. The melting point of Argon is -189.36\u00b0C, and that of Neon is -248.59\u00b0C. So Argon's melting point is higher.\nB. The boiling point of Argon is -185.85\u00b0C, and that of Neon is -246.08\u00b0C. So Argon's boiling point is also higher.\nD. The first ionization energy of Argon is 1520.6 kJ/mol, and that of Neon is 2080.7 kJ/mol. So Argon's first ionization energy is lower, but the question asks for what is lower in Argon than in Neon, not vice versa. Therefore, this option is not correct for the question as stated. \n\nThe best answer according to the options provided and the question asked is C: polarizability."
