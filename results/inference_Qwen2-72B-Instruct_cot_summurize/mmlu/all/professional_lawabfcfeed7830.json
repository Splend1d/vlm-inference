                    "text": "The answer is B. Only the mortgage company has a cause of action against the woman.\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. The woman mortgaged a tract of land to a mortgage company to secure a note for $25,000, due on December 31, 1993, with 9.5 percent interest per annum. This creates a legal obligation between the woman and the mortgage company.\n2. The mortgage was recorded in 1996. Recording the mortgage provides public notice of the mortgage company's interest in the property and gives them priority over subsequent claims or interests.\n3. In 2007, the woman promised in a signed writing to convey the tract of land to her daughter and pay off the mortgage debt when it came due. This promise is a personal agreement between the woman and her daughter but does not extinguish the mortgage lien on the property.\n4. In 2008, the woman delivered a quitclaim deed to her daughter, which did not mention the mortgage. A quitclaim deed transfers whatever interest the grantor has in the property without any warranty of title. However, it does not affect pre-existing liens such as the mortgage.\n\nIf the woman defaults on the mortgage debt, the mortgage company still has a valid security interest in the property because the mortgage was not paid off or discharged. Therefore, the mortgage company can enforce its rights under the mortgage and has a cause of action against the woman.\n\nThe daughter, on the other hand, received the quitclaim deed subject to the existing mortgage. She does not have a cause of action against the woman for the mortgage debt since she took the property with knowledge of the encumbrance. The daughter's remedy would be to seek enforcement of the woman's promise to pay off the mortgage, but this would not give her a cause of action against the woman for the mortgage debt itself."
