While all of the options you've provided could potentially be part of an absolutist position depending on the context, the one that most directly reflects an absolutist stance in moral philosophy is:\n\nA. human persons have a right to life.\n\nThis is because absolutists often hold that certain rights or duties are inviolable and cannot be overridden by other considerations. The right to life is a common example of such an absolute principle, which would mean that taking a human life is always morally wrong, regardless of the circumstances or potential benefits that might result from doing so."
