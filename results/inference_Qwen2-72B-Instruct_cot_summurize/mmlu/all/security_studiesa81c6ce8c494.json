The subaltern refers to populations that are marginalised or outside of the hegemonic power structure.\n\nIn postcolonial studies, the term \"subaltern\" is used to describe groups in society who are excluded from power structures and decision-making processes. These groups can include indigenous peoples, lower castes, women, peasants, and others who have been historically marginalized or oppressed. The concept was popularized by Italian Marxist Antonio Gramsci and later adopted by postcolonial theorists such as Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak."
