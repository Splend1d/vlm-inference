Refers to the process of family formation and dissolution.\n\nThe family life cycle is a concept used in sociology and family studies that describes the stages a family goes through from its formation to its eventual dissolution. These stages typically include marriage, childbearing, childrearing, empty nest, and retirement, among others. It helps marketers understand the different needs and behaviors of families at various points in their lives, which can be useful for targeting products and services. However, it's important to note that families may not follow this cycle linearly or may skip certain stages altogether."
