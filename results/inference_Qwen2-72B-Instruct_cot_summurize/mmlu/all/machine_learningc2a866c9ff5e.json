True, False\n\nExplanation:\nStatement 1 is true because Principal Component Analysis (PCA) performs eigendecomposition on the covariance matrix of the data, while spectral clustering algorithms such as the one by Andrew Ng perform eigendecomposition on the Laplacian matrix derived from the similarity or affinity matrix of the data. Although the matrices are different, they can have the same dimensions depending on the data.\n\nStatement 2 is false because classification and regression are distinct types of problems. Logistic regression is not a special case of linear regression; it is a different model that is used for binary classification problems, whereas linear regression is used for predicting continuous outcomes. While both techniques use similar mathematical forms, their objectives and assumptions are fundamentally different."
