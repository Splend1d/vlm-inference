The ratio of income inequality to income equality in different countries.\n\nThe Lorenz Curve is a graphical representation of income or wealth distribution among the population of a country. It plots the cumulative percentage of the population (on the x-axis) against the cumulative percentage of income or wealth they possess (on the y-axis). The curve helps to visualize income inequality, with a perfectly equal distribution represented by a straight line at 45 degrees (the line of equality), and more unequal distributions represented by curves that bow further away from this line."
