As part of the employee's duties and responsibilities, he would regularly deliver prescriptions and other items (such as toiletries, cosmetics, vitamins, and gift products) to customers. One afternoon while the employee was on duty, he remembered that it was his girlfriend's birthday. He went ahead and bought her a bottle of perfume from the pharmacy's cosmetics department. The employee paid the full price of $79. 95 for the perfume and had the perfume gift wrapped. He then drove to the girlfriend's house in the company van to personally deliver the birthday present. This trip took place during the employee's regular working hours while he was en route to make another delivery from his van. As he was traveling to the girlfriend's house, he was in such a hurry that he drove through a red light and collided with a vehicle owned and operated by a driver. The driver, who had entered the intersection on the green light, tried unsuccessfully to swerve and stop but was unable to avoid the employee's vehicle. The driver was injured in the accident, which caused extensive damage to both vehicles. If the driver brings suit against the drugstore to recover damages arising from the accident, the driver will probably\n\nA. prevail, because the employee paid for the perfume.\nB. prevail, because the employee was under the control and direction of the drugstore at the time of the accident.\nC. not prevail, because the employee was acting outside the scope of the employment relationship at the time of the accident.\nD. not prevail, because the drugstore was not negligent in hiring the employee.\n"

Even though the employee was making a personal detour to deliver a gift to his girlfriend, he was still using the company van during his work hours and on a delivery route. This could be seen as an act within the scope of his employment, making the drugstore potentially liable for the actions of their employee under the doctrine of vicarious liability.\n\nUnder this doctrine, employers can be held responsible for the actions of their employees if those actions occur within the course of employment. Since the employee was using the company van and was on the clock when the accident occurred, the drugstore may be held liable for any damages resulting from the accident.\n\nIt's important to note that the fact that the employee paid for the perfume is irrelevant to the liability issue in this case. Additionally, whether or not the drugstore was negligent in hiring the employee does not directly impact the liability for the accident in this scenario. The key factor is that the employee was performing work-related tasks when the accident occurred."
