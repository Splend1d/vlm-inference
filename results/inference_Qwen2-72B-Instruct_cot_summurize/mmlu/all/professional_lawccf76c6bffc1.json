Adjoining the quarry to the west is a 10-acre ranch, owned by a librarian. In order to gain access to the highway, the teacher has been granted an easement to cross over the ranch using the road along the ranch's southernmost boundary. The teacher has recently purchased a 12-acre farm, which abuts the ranch, but is not appurtenant to the quarry. Directly north of the farm is the ranch and directly west is the highway. The teacher has begun constructing a farmhouse on the farm and is using the existing easement (across the ranch) to gain access to the 1 2acre farm. The teacher has never received permission from the librarian to use the road across the ranch to gain access to the farm. In an appropriate action by the librarian to enjoin the teacher from using the existing easement to gain access to the farm, the plaintiff will most likely\n\nA. succeed, because the teacher is making use of the servient tenement beyond the scope and extent of the easement as it was originally created.\nB. succeed, because the teacher has no right to use the servient tenement in connection with a tract of land that is not part of the dominant tenement.\nC. not succeed, because the teacher has an easement by necessity.\nD. not succeed, because the teacher has a right to use the easement in a manner not inconsistent with the rights of the owner of the servient tenement.\n"

The 12-acre farm is a separate parcel of land and not part of the original dominant tenement. Therefore, the teacher does not have the right to use the easement to access the farm without obtaining additional permission from the librarian, who owns the servient tenement (the ranch). Using the easement for access to the farm would be considered an expansion of the easement's scope, which requires consent from the owner of the servient tenement. Since the teacher did not obtain this consent, the librarian is likely to succeed in enjoining the teacher from using the easement for access to the farm."
