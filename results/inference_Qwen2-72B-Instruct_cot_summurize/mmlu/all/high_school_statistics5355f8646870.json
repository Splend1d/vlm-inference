This study was an experiment in which the subjects were used as their own controls.\n\nExplanation: In this study, the researchers actively manipulated one factor (alcohol consumption) to observe its effect on another variable (reaction time). This manipulation makes it an experiment rather than an observational study. The fact that each subject's reaction time was measured both before and after drinking the alcohol means that each subject served as their own control, allowing for a comparison of reaction times under two different conditions (before and after alcohol consumption). Blocking refers to grouping similar experimental units together to reduce the impact of confounding variables, but it is not mentioned in the context of this study. The placebo effect could potentially be relevant if there was a group receiving a placebo instead of alcohol, but since all subjects consumed alcohol, this effect is not directly relevant here."
