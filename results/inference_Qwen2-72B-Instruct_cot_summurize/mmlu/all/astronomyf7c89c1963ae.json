You can never prove your theory to be correct, only \"yet to be proven wrong.\" Scientific theories are not considered proven, but rather they are considered to be the best explanation for a set of observations or data based on the available evidence. A theory can be supported by a large body of evidence, but it can never be definitively proven to be true. It is always possible that new evidence could emerge that would contradict the theory and require it to be revised or discarded. Therefore, scientific theories are always subject to further testing and refinement as new evidence becomes available. Options A, B, and D are incorrect because they suggest that a theory can be definitively proven, which is not the case in science."
