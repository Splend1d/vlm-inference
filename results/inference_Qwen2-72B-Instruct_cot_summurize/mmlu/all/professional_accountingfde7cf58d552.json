The income after tax is calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Income After Tax} = \\text{IBT} - (\\text{IBT} \\times \\text{Tax Rate}) \\]\n\nWe know that:\n\n\\[ 5.4 = X - (X \\times 0.4) \\]\n\n\\[ 5.4 = X \\times (1 - 0.4) \\]\n\n\\[ 5.4 = X \\times 0.6 \\]\n\n\\[ X = \\frac{5.4}{0.6} = 9 \\]\n\nSo, the income before tax (IBT) is $9 million.\n\nNow, let's calculate EBIT:\n\n\\[ \\text{EBIT} = \\text{IBT} + \\text{Interest Expense} + \\text{Depreciation} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{EBIT} = 9 + 1 + 1 = 11 \\]\n\nFinally, we can calculate the times-interest-earned ratio:\n\n\\[ \\text{Times-Interest-Earned Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{EBIT}}{\\text{Interest Expense}} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Times-Interest-Earned Ratio} = \\frac{11}{1} = 11 \\]\n\nHowever, this exact value isn't listed among the options provided. Given the calculation steps and the options available, the closest match to our calculation would be:\n\nD. 10\n\nIt seems there might be a slight discrepancy or rounding in the question's options or the calculation, but based on the information and standard accounting practices, the answer should be closer to 11."
