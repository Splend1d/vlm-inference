In Scenario 2, cutting children's hair might be considered an odd action if done without permission or in an inappropriate manner, but it is not inherently morally wrong, especially if the person is a barber, hairdresser, or a parent/guardian with consent. However, without additional context about whether the children's hair was cut with their consent and properly, it's hard to definitively label this action as morally wrong. Based on the information provided, neither scenario suggests any clear moral wrongdoing."
