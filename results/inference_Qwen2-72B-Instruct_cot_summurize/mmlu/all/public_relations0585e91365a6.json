Marketing communications\n\nSegmentation of the population into psychographics, demographics, and geodemographics is particularly crucial in marketing communications, as it helps tailor messages to specific groups based on their characteristics, behaviors, and location. This segmentation allows for more effective targeting and personalized communication strategies that can resonate better with each segment. While the other options (issues management, investor relations, and public affairs) may also use segmentation to some extent, marketing communications is the specialization where this practice is most central and detailed."
