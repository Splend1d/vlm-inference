Virtually all small-scale producers are engaged in some self-provisioning and market sales.\n\nWhile the specific percentages can vary widely from country to country and region to region, it is generally true that many small-scale farmers in developing countries practice a mix of subsistence farming (growing food for their own consumption) and commercial farming (selling surplus produce or cash crops on the market). This dual approach helps them to meet their household needs while also generating income. However, the degree to which they rely on each type of farming can depend on factors such as access to markets, infrastructure, technology, and resources."
