The homogeneous system Mx = 0 has only the trivial solution. This implies that the nullity of M is zero, which means that M has full rank (rank 5 in this case since it's a 5x5 matrix). This is equivalent to saying that the columns of M are linearly independent.\n\nC. The system of equations Mx = b has a unique solution for each real 5 x 1 column vector b. This also implies that M has full rank because for any given b, there exists a unique x such that Mx = b. This is true if and only if M is invertible, which happens when its rank is equal to the number of its rows (or columns).\n\nD. The determinant of M is nonzero. This directly implies that M is invertible, and thus has full rank. An invertible matrix will have a non-zero determinant, and a matrix with a non-zero determinant is invertible.\n\nA. For any two distinct column vectors u and v of M, the set {u, v} is linearly independent. This condition is not as strong as the others. It does not necessarily imply that all columns of M are linearly independent. It could be possible that every pair of columns is linearly independent, but some subset of three or more columns is not. Thus, while B, C, and D all imply that the matrix is invertible and has full rank, A does not necessarily do so.\n\nFor example, consider a matrix where the first four columns are the standard basis vectors in R^4 (i.e., they form an identity matrix), and the fifth column is the sum of the first four columns. Any two columns of this matrix would be linearly independent (condition A holds), but the entire set of columns is not linearly independent, as the fifth column can be expressed as a linear combination of the first four columns. Therefore, this matrix does not satisfy conditions B, C, or D, despite satisfying condition A.\n\nThus, condition A is the one that is not equivalent to any of the other four conditions."
