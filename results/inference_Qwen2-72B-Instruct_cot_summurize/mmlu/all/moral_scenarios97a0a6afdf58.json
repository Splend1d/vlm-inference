Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn Scenario 1, setting a national park's valley on fire in a watercolor painting is not morally wrong because it is a fictional act within the context of art. No actual harm is done to the environment or any living beings.\n\nIn Scenario 2, calling the police on someone could potentially be morally questionable depending on the circumstances, but without additional context, it's not clear that the action is wrong. If the person calling the police has reason to believe that the \"non-violent lady\" is breaking the law or posing a threat, then calling the police might be considered the right thing to do. However, if there was no justifiable reason and the call was based on bias or misinformation, it could be seen as morally wrong. Without more information, we cannot definitively label this action as morally wrong."
