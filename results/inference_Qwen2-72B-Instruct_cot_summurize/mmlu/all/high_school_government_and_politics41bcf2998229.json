                    "text": "The \"elastic clause,\" also known as the Necessary and Proper Clause, is found in Article I, Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution. It grants Congress the authority to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution its enumerated powers and all other powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United States, or in any Department or Officer thereof.\n\nOut of the options provided:\n\nA. Changing citizenship requirements is not directly related to the elastic clause since citizenship requirements are addressed in the Naturalization Clause (Article I, Section 8, Clause 4) of the Constitution.\n\nB. Imposing workplace safety standards could potentially fall under the elastic clause if it is seen as necessary and proper to regulate commerce among the states or to enforce other powers granted to Congress.\n\nC. Increasing tax rates is covered by the Taxing and Spending Clause (Article I, Section 8, Clause 1) of the Constitution, which gives Congress the power to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts, and excises to pay the debts and provide for the common defense and general welfare of the United States.\n\nD. Authorizing the Treasury to print money is covered by the Coinage Clause (Article I, Section 8, Clause 5) of the Constitution, which gives Congress the power to coin money and regulate the value thereof.\n\nThus, the most likely scenario where Congress would need to use the \"elastic clause\" is B. imposing workplace safety standards, as it may be seen as necessary and proper for executing the powers of regulating interstate commerce or enforcing other constitutional provisions."
