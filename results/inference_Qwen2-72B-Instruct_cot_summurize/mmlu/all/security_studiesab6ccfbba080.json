All of these options.\nC. United by common insecurities concerning the production and supply of energy resources, international actors are forced into negotiation and cooperation between states increases.\nD.

All of these options.\n\nThe concept of the 'energy security nexus' refers to the interconnectedness of energy policy with other areas such as economic development, environmental protection, and national security. It highlights how energy security can be a driver for cooperation or conflict among nations, depending on how resources are managed and distributed. Therefore, all the given options reflect important outcomes related to the energy security nexus:\n\nA. The competition for control over energy resources can indeed lead to geopolitical rivalries that affect international security.\n\nC. Common vulnerabilities regarding energy production and supply can foster negotiation and cooperation among states.\n\nD. Energy-rich countries in the 'South' may gain leverage over wealthier but resource-poorer nations in the 'North', potentially altering power dynamics and addressing some global inequalities. However, it's important to note that while energy resources can provide leverage, they do not necessarily redress all North-South divides and inequalities on their own."
