Instead, it focuses on the recognition and protection of interests. The option that best formulates the interest theory without assuming the correlativity of rights and duties is:\n\nD. Asserting that X has a right whenever the protection of his interest is recognized as a reason for imposing duties - only when they are actually imposed.\n\nThis formulation acknowledges that the existence of a right is based on the recognition of an interest that warrants protection, leading to the imposition of duties on others to respect or facilitate that interest. It does not necessarily require the direct correlation between a specific right held by X and a specific duty owed by Y, as in the will theory."
