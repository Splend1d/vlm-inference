                    "text": "To find out how many units Spark Co. needs to sell to achieve a profit of 10% of sales, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the profit margin per unit:**\n   The selling price is $200 and the cost price is $125. However, there's also a sales commission of $25 per phone sold. Therefore, the actual profit per unit is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Profit per unit} = \\text{Selling Price} - (\\text{Cost Price} + \\text{Sales Commission}) = 200 - (125 + 25) = 200 - 150 = 50\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the total desired profit:**\n   Spark wants a profit that is 10% of its sales revenue. To find out what 10% of sales would be, we need to set up an equation where \\(x\\) is the number of units sold:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Desired Profit} = 0.1 \\times (\\text{Selling Price} \\times x) = 0.1 \\times (200x)\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total revenue needed to cover costs and achieve desired profit:**\n   The total revenue from sales will be \\(200x\\). The total expenses include the fixed costs and the variable costs (cost of goods sold plus sales commission), which we've already calculated as \\(150x\\). The total expenses are thus:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Expenses} = 150x + 3000\n   \\]\n   \n   Since the desired profit is 10% of sales, or \\(0.1 \\times 200x\\), the total revenue needed is the sum of total expenses and desired profit:\n   \\[\n   200x = 150x + 3000 + 0.1 \\times 200x\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solve for \\(x\\):**\n   Rearranging the equation gives us:\n   \\[\n   200x = 150x + 3000 + 20x\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   200x = 170x + 3000\n   \\]\n   Subtracting \\(170x\\) from both sides gives us:\n   \\[\n   30x = 3000\n   \\]\n   Dividing both sides by 30 gives us:\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{3000}{30} = 100\n   \\]\n\nThus, Spark Co. needs to sell **100** units to achieve a profit of 10% of its sales.\n\nThe correct answer is **D. 100**."
