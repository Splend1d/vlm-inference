He also has had a 10.4-kg (23-lb) weight loss over the past 4 months despite no change in appetite. He has smoked one and a half packs of cigarettes daily for 50 years. He drinks 4 oz of alcohol daily. He has peptic ulcer disease and emphysema. Medications include cimetidine, theophylline, and low-dose prednisone. Examination shows mild ptosis. He has a barrelshaped chest. Breath sounds are distant. There is moderate weakness of proximal muscles of the lower extremities. Reflexes are absent. He has difficulty rising from a chair. Sensory examination shows no abnormalities. An x-ray shows a hyperinflated chest and a 3 x 4-cm mass in the right hilum. His neurologic findings are most likely due to a lesion involving which of the following?\n\nA. Muscle membrane\nB. Parasympathetic nervous system\nC. Peripheral nerve\nD. Presynaptic neuromuscular junction\n"

This condition is characterized by muscle weakness, particularly in the proximal muscles of the lower extremities, and autonomic dysfunction, including dry eyes and mouth. It is caused by autoantibodies that target voltage-gated calcium channels at the presynaptic neuromuscular junction, leading to reduced neurotransmitter release and impaired muscle contraction. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Presynaptic neuromuscular junction."
