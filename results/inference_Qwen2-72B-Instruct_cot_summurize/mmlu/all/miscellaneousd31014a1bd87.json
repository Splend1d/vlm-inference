The sudden demise of the dinosaurs\n\nThe late Cretaceous period ended with a mass extinction event, often referred to as the K-T (or K-Pg) extinction, which is widely believed to have been caused by an asteroid impact and possibly exacerbated by volcanic activity. This event led to the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs and many other species, allowing mammals to diversify and eventually leading to the emergence of humans much later in history."
