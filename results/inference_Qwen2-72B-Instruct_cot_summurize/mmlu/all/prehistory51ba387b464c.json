This process allowed for a larger brain to develop over a longer period, which may have facilitated the development of more complex cognitive abilities. The other options do not describe changes associated with larger brain size in hominids. Microcephaly is a condition where the head is smaller than normal, prognathism is an exaggerated forward projection of the jaw, and the supraorbital cortex is not a recognized term in human anatomy or evolutionary biology."
