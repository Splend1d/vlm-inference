The man raised his gun at the officers and a flurry of shots followed. The man was injured but survived; the woman co-conspirator died from a police officer's bullet. The authorities charged the man with felony-murder of the woman. He was convicted and appealed. Under the prevailing modern view of felony murder, will the appellate court likely reverse the first-degree murder conviction?\n\nA. Yes, because the felony murder rule has been declared unconstitutional.\nB. Yes, because the majority view is that felony murder does not apply if a co-conspirator is killed by a third person during the commission of the crime.\nC. No, because all states recognize that felony murder applies to any deaths that occur during the commission of the crime regardless of who fired the fatal shot.\nD. No, because the man started the flurry of shots instead of surrendering; he caused the woman's death and is guilty of first degree murder.\n"

No, because the man started the flurry of shots instead of surrendering; he caused the woman's death and is guilty of first degree murder.\n\nUnder the felony murder rule, a defendant can be held liable for any deaths that occur during the commission of a felony, even if the death was unintentional or caused by someone else. In this case, the man and woman conspired to commit a felony (bank robbery), and during the commission of that felony, the woman was killed by a police officer's bullet. However, it was the man's actions in raising his gun at the officers that led to the exchange of gunfire and ultimately the woman's death. Therefore, under the felony murder rule, the man can be held liable for her death as it occurred during the commission of the felony and was a foreseeable consequence of his actions. The majority view is that felony murder applies to any deaths that occur during the commission of the crime, regardless of who fired the fatal shot."
