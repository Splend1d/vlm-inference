People with high achievement motivation often seek out opportunities that allow them to demonstrate their competence and to learn new skills or knowledge, even if these opportunities require significant effort.\n\nOption A might not be as appealing to Donald because it would likely not provide him with new challenges or learning opportunities, given that he has already taken and done well in AP Psychology. Option B could potentially be too daunting and might not align with his interests or current academic level, as it suggests enrolling in a graduate seminar, which is typically beyond the scope of a first-year undergraduate student's curriculum. Option C does not align with Donald's interest in psychology or his achievement motivation, as avoiding psychology classes would not allow him to further explore the field or challenge himself academically.\n\nTherefore, based on Donald's interest in psychology and his high achievement motivation, option D is the most likely choice for him as a first-year student. This choice would allow him to engage with more advanced topics in psychology, challenge himself academically, and continue to grow his knowledge and skills in the field.\n\nReference:\n- McClelland, D.
