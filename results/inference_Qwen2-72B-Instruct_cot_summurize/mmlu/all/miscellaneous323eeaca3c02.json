The U.S. men's ice hockey team famously won the gold medal at the Lake Placid Winter Olympics, defeating the heavily favored Soviet Union team in the process. This event is often referred to as the \"Miracle on Ice.\" As of my last update, the U.S. men's team has not won another Olympic gold medal since then. However, it's worth noting that the U.S. women's ice hockey team has won multiple Olympic gold medals, including in 1998, 2018, and most recently in 2022."
