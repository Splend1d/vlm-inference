However, in general, a culture that emphasizes collaboration, teamwork, and group or collective goals might be more accepting of change because it encourages open communication, flexibility, and shared responsibility. So, in this context, options A, B, C, and D could all potentially foster an environment where change is more readily accepted depending on how these cultures are implemented.\n\nIf I have to choose one from the given options, I would lean towards:\n\nD. Collective culture\n\nA collective culture typically values group harmony and cooperation over individualism. In such a setting, employees may be more willing to accept changes if they perceive them as benefiting the group as a whole. However, this is a broad generalization, and many other factors can influence how workers perceive and accept change within an organization."
