In March, the retiree planted his annual tobacco crop, which he usually harvested in early October. In September, the retiree sold his farm to a tobacco grower for $100,000. At the time the retiree conveyed the property to the grower, the tobacco crop was well developed and quite mature. When the retiree and the grower entered into their land-sale agreement, there was no mention of the status or ownership of the tobacco crop. In early October, after the grower took possession of the property, the retiree contacted him and requested permission to harvest and remove the tobacco crop. The grower refused to allow the retiree to re-enter the property. The retiree brings suit against the grower seeking to re-enter the property and remove the tobacco crop that he had planted. Which of the following is correct regarding the respective rights of the parties?\n\nA. The retiree is entitled to remove the tobacco crop, but he must pay the grower a reasonable value to enter the property, thus gaining access to the crop.\nB. The retiree is entitled to remove the tobacco crop and is not required to pay the grower for entering the property, thus gaining access to the crop.\nC. The retiree is not entitled to remove the tobacco crop and, thus, is not entitled to re-enter the property.\nD. The retiree and the grower each have a colorable title to the tobacco crop, and consequently, there should be an equitable division of the proceeds from the sale of the crop between both parties.\n"

The retiree is entitled to remove the tobacco crop and is not required to pay the grower for entering the property, thus gaining access to the crop.\n\nThe general rule in property law is that when a seller plants crops before conveying the property to a buyer, those crops are considered \"growing crops\" and remain the personal property of the seller unless explicitly included in the sale. Since there was no mention of the status or ownership of the tobacco crop in the land-sale agreement, the retiree retains ownership of the crop. The grower cannot prevent the retiree from accessing the property to harvest his own crops. However, if the retiree causes damage while harvesting, he may be liable for any losses incurred by the grower."
