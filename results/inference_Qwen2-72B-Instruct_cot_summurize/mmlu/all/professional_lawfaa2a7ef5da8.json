The property consisted of a single-family house with a yard, garage, and driveway. The boss died intestate on May 1, 2001, leaving her daughter as her sole heir. During her occupancy, the boss paid $3,500 each year in insurance and property taxes. In addition, the premises on the property had a fair market value during this period of $1,500 each year. Following her mother's death, the boss's daughter moved into the house on May 2, 2001. As the administratrix of the boss's estate, the daughter sought to collect from the co-worker one- half of the cost of insurance and property taxes that the boss paid. Conversely, the co-worker claimed that he was not liable for any of the expenses. Furthermore, the coworker's attorney advised him that the daughter did not own any interest in the property and that since the boss's death, he (the co-worker) owned the entire property. The attorney also informed the co-worker that the daughter owed him rent for the entire period of her occupancy, and if she continued to occupy the premises, then she would be liable for insurance and property taxes as well. In an appropriate action to determine the title of the property, what, if any, interest does the daughter have in the said property?\n\nA. None, because the co-worker acquired title to the whole of the property by right of survivorship.\nB. An undivided one-half interest, because upon the death intestate of a tenant-in-common, the latter's interest descends to his heirs.\nC. An undivided one-half interest, because in a tenancy by the entirety, either sibling can make a testamentary disposition.\nD. An undivided whole interest, because in a joint tenancy, every joint tenant is part and parcel of the unit group that owns the whole.\n"

An undivided one-half interest, because upon the death intestate of a tenant-in-common, the latter's interest descends to his heirs.\n\nThe initial devise to the co-worker and the boss as \"their community property\" is problematic because they were not married and thus could not hold property as community property. Instead, they would likely hold the property as tenants-in-common unless there was an agreement specifying otherwise. When the boss died intestate, her interest in the property passed to her daughter, who became a tenant-in-common with the co-worker. Therefore, the daughter has an undivided one-half interest in the property.\n\nOption A is incorrect because there is no right of survivorship in a tenancy in common; each tenant's interest can be inherited or transferred separately. Option C is incorrect because tenancy by the entirety is a form of joint tenancy available only to married couples, which was not the case here. Option D is incorrect because joint tenancy requires a right of survivorship, which does not apply when one of the joint tenants dies intestate and leaves an heir."
