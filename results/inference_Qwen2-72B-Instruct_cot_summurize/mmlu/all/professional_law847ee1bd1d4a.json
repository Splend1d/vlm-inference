(which was within the posted speed limit), the passenger suddenly pointed to an overturned vehicle along the side of the highway and said, \"Look at that car upside down. \" The driver turned to look at the overturned vehicle. As he was looking toward the side of the road, the driver failed to see an abandoned vehicle with a flat tire in the highway about 200 feet in front of his approaching auto. Seconds later, the driver crashed into the rear of the abandoned auto and was injured. The jurisdiction has a relevant comparative negligence statute in effect. If the driver asserts a claim against the owner of the abandoned auto, the most likely result is that the driver will\n\nA. recover all of his damages, because the defendant created a dangerous condition.\nB. recover only a portion of damages, because the abandoned auto was in plain view.\nC. recover nothing, because he had the last clear chance to avoid the collision.\nD. recover nothing, because the passenger's act was a supervening cause.\n"

However, the abandoned vehicle with a flat tire being in plain view suggests that the driver should have been able to see it in time to avoid the collision if he had been paying proper attention to the road. Therefore, the driver's negligence in failing to keep a proper lookout contributed to the accident.\n\nUnder comparative negligence statutes, damages can be apportioned based on the degree of fault of each party involved in the accident. Since both the driver and the owner of the abandoned auto contributed to the accident (the latter for leaving the vehicle in a dangerous position), the court would likely find that the driver's recovery should be reduced by the percentage of his own fault. This means the driver may recover only a portion of his damages, depending on how much fault is attributed to him versus the owner of the abandoned auto."
