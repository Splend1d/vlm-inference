Collagen synthesis is essential for the strength and integrity of the new tissue being formed. It's important to note that while collagen fibers do contribute to bridging the wound (option B), this is part of their function rather than a complete description of their role. Additionally, collagen fibers are indeed needed even when a wound heals by primary intention, as they help in the remodeling and strengthening of the repaired tissue. Option A is incorrect because collagen fiber re-establishment does not occur within the first five days; it starts after that period. Option D is also incorrect since collagen fibers are necessary for proper healing, regardless of whether the wound is healing by primary or secondary intention."
