P > ATC > MR = MC\n\nExplanation:\n1. **P (Price) > ATC (Average Total Cost):** A monopoly firm can set prices above its average total cost because it is the sole provider in the market and faces no competition. This allows the firm to earn economic profits.\n   \n2. **ATC > MR (Marginal Revenue):** Marginal revenue is less than price in a monopoly because when the firm sells an additional unit, it has to lower the price for all units sold, not just the additional one. This means that MR is less than P, and since P is greater than ATC, MR will also be less than ATC.\n\n3. **MR = MC (Marginal Cost):** In any profit-maximizing scenario, whether competitive or monopolistic, firms produce where marginal revenue equals marginal cost. This ensures that the last unit produced adds as much to revenue as it does to cost, maximizing profits."
