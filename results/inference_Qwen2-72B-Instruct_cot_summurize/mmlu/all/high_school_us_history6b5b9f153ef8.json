The right of judging, in such cases, is an essential attribute of sovereignty, of which the States cannot be divested without losing their sovereignty itself, and being reduced to a subordinate corporate condition. In fact, to divide power, and to give to one of the parties the exclusive right of judging of the portion allotted to each, is, in reality, not to divide it at all; and to reserve such exclusive right to the General Government (it matters not by what department to be exercised), is to convert it, in fact, into a great consolidated government, with unlimited powers, and to divest the States, in reality, of all their rights, It is impossible to understand the force of terms, and to deny so plain a conclusion.\"\n\u2014John C. Calhoun, \"South Carolina Exposition and Protest,\" 1828\nThe language of \"protest\" that Calhoun used in his \"Exposition and Protest\" was similar to the language of which of the following political positions?\n\nA. The response of supporters of Andrew Jackson to the \"corrupt bargain\" of 1824.\nB. The response of New England Federalists to the War of 1812.\nC. The response of the Jefferson administration to the actions of the \"Barbary pirates.\"\nD. The response of Daniel Shays to fiscal policies of the Massachusetts legislature in the 1780s.\n"

The response of New England Federalists to the War of 1812.\n\nCalhoun's language of \"protest\" and defense of states' rights aligns with the position taken by New England Federalists during the War of 1812. They opposed the war and convened the Hartford Convention where they discussed the possibility of New England states refusing to comply with federal policies they found detrimental to their interests. This stance is similar to Calhoun's argument for states' rights to nullify federal laws that infringe upon their sovereignty."
