An increase in government spending with no change in taxes.\n\nThis is because increasing government spending without raising taxes leads to higher aggregate demand in the economy. At full employment, the economy is already producing at its maximum sustainable output. Additional demand (from increased government spending) cannot be met by increasing production further; instead, it will likely lead to price increases, as businesses pass on the higher cost of scarce resources to consumers through higher prices.\n\nOption A would not create as much inflation since the increase in taxes would offset the increase in spending, keeping aggregate demand relatively stable.\n\nOption C would likely reduce inflation since decreasing government spending and increasing taxes would lower aggregate demand.\n\nOption D could also potentially lead to inflation if the decrease in taxes significantly boosts consumer spending, but the effect might be less immediate or pronounced than in option B, depending on how quickly consumers spend their extra disposable income. However, since the question asks for the most inflationary policy in the short run, option B remains the most likely choice."
