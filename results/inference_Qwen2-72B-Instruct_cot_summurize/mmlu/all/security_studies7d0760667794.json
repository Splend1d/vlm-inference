The concept of universal and fundamental human rights is often challenged by cultural relativism, which argues that rights and values are culturally determined and not universally applicable. This makes it difficult to assert that there is a clear and universally accepted basis for humanitarian intervention.\n\nB. While there is some international agreement on the importance of protecting human rights, the level of consensus on using force to achieve this goal varies significantly among states. Some countries may be reluctant to support military action due to concerns over sovereignty or strategic interests.\n\nC. The potential for abuse by powerful states is a significant concern when endorsing the use of force to protect individual rights. There is a risk that such norms could be exploited by dominant countries to pursue their own geopolitical objectives under the guise of humanitarian intervention.\n\nThus, all three points mentioned contribute to the limitations of the case for humanitarian intervention."
