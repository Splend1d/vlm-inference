Feinberg, like many philosophers, argues that most of the arguments for psychological egoism are not based on empirical evidence from neuroscience, controlled studies, or even interviews and surveys. Instead, they tend to be more philosophical in nature, relying on logical reasoning and conceptual analysis rather than empirical data."
