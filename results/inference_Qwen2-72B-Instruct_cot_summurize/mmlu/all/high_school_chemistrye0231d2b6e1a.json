The formula for molarity is:\n\n\\[ M = \\frac{n}{V} \\]\n\nFirst, let's find the number of moles of Ni(NO3)2 dissolved. The molar mass of Ni(NO3)2 can be calculated as follows:\n\n- Nickel (Ni): approximately 58.7 g/mol\n- Nitrate (NO3): approximately 62 g/mol\n\nSo, for Ni(NO3)2:\n\n\\[ \\text{Molar Mass} = 58.7 + 2(62) = 58.7 + 124 = 182.7 \\, \\text{g/mol} \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of moles of Ni(NO3)2 using the mass given (30.0 g):\n\n\\[ n = \\frac{\\text{mass}}{\\text{molar mass}} = \\frac{30.0 \\, \\text{g}}{182.7 \\, \\text{g/mol}} = 0.164 \\, \\text{mol} \\]\n\nThe volume of the solution is given as 250 mL, which needs to be converted to liters:\n\n\\[ V = 250 \\, \\text{mL} \\times \\frac{1 \\, \\text{L}}{1000 \\, \\text{mL}} = 0.250 \\, \\text{L} \\]\n\nFinally, we can calculate the molarity:\n\n\\[ M = \\frac{n}{V} = \\frac{0.164 \\, \\text{mol}}{0.250 \\, \\text{L}} = 0.656 \\, \\text{mol/L} \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. 0.656 mol/L"
