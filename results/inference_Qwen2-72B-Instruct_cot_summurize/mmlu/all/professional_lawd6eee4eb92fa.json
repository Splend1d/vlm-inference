The buyer has grounds to sue for the breach of contract concerning the remaining 10 widgets that were not delivered. However, the extent of recovery may depend on whether the non-delivery of the 10 widgets constitutes a material breach or not. If the missing 10 widgets do not significantly affect the overall purpose of the contract, the court may rule that the breach was not material, potentially affecting the amount the buyer can recover. But in principle, the manufacturer's failure to deliver the full quantity as contracted is a breach of the agreement."
