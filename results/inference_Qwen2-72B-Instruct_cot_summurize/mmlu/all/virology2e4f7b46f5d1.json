The Yellow Fever (YF) vaccine is a live attenuated virus vaccine that was developed through Pasteurian passage, which involves passing the virus through a series of non-natural hosts to reduce its virulence while retaining its ability to elicit an immune response. This vaccine has been in use since the 1930s and is highly effective at preventing yellow fever, a serious viral infection transmitted by mosquitoes. It is typically given as a single dose and provides long-lasting immunity."
