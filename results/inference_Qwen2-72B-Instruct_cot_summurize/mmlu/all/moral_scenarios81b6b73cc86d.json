Not wrong, Wrong\n\nIn Scenario 1, while it might be considered inconsiderate or rude, failing to clear one's laundry from a shared washer or dryer is not typically viewed as morally wrong according to ordinary US standards as of 2020. It may breach communal living etiquette but does not rise to the level of a moral transgression.\n\nIn Scenario 2, digging up a hole at a graveyard for any purpose, especially without permission and for an unconventional reason such as burying body parts, would generally be considered a clear violation of legal and moral standards in the US. This action could involve desecration of a burial ground, which is both illegal and morally reprehensible."
