By comparing the maximum altitude of the Sun in two cities at different latitudes at the same time on the same day.\n\nEratosthenes used the difference in the angle of the Sun's rays at two different locations\u2014Syene (now Aswan, Egypt) and Alexandria\u2014on the summer solstice to calculate the circumference of the Earth. He knew that at noon on the summer solstice, the Sun was directly overhead in Syene, casting no shadows. At the same time in Alexandria, about 500 miles north, the Sun cast a small shadow, indicating that it was not directly overhead. By measuring the angle of this shadow, he was able to estimate the Earth's circumference with remarkable accuracy."
