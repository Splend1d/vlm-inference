However, option C (Feelings of relief and release) is generally not a common response, while options A (A lack of support from others), B (A desire to kill themselves), and D (Severe but temporary cognitive impairment) can be experienced by some individuals. It's important to note that each person's grief process is unique, and they may experience a range of emotions including shock, anger, guilt, and sadness. If you or someone you know is struggling with thoughts of suicide, please seek help immediately from a mental health professional or crisis hotline."
