This boundary or line shall be drawn straight, as aforesaid, at a distance of three hundred and seventy leagues west of the Cape Verde Islands, being calculated by degrees, or by any other manner as may be considered the best and readiest, provided the distance shall be no greater than abovesaid. And all lands, both islands and mainlands, found and discovered already, or to be found and discovered hereafter, by the said King of Portugal and by his vessels on this side of the said line and bound determined as above, toward the east, in either north or south latitude, on the eastern side of the said bound provided the said bound is not crossed, shall belong to, and remain in the possession of, and pertain forever to, the said King of Portugal and his successors. And all other lands, both islands and mainlands, found or to be found hereafter, discovered or to be discovered hereafter, which have been discovered or shall be discovered by the said King and Queen of Castile, Aragon, etc., and by their vessels, on the western side of the said bound, determined as above, after having passed the said bound toward the west, in either its north or south latitude, shall belong to, and remain in the possession of, and pertain forever to, the said King and Queen of Castile, Leon, etc., and to their successors.\"\nTreaty of Tordesillas, 1494\nWhich of the following inferences best explains the reason the King and Queen of Castile and Aragon insisted on Spanish control of territory west of the demarcation line?\n\nA. The Spanish desired to convert the Barbary states to Catholicism.\nB. The Spanish believed Portugal did not know about their discovery of the New World.\nC. The Spanish wanted to preserve the independence of Native states in the New World as a buffer against Portuguese expansion.\nD. The Spanish thought India would be harder to conquer than the New World.\n"

Option D is also not directly supported by the passage, but we can infer a reason based on historical context and the information given. The Treaty of Tordesillas was an agreement between Spain and Portugal to divide newly discovered lands outside Europe. Given that the passage states the line was drawn to divide territories \"discovered in the ocean sea,\" and knowing that Christopher Columbus had recently reached the Americas for Spain, it's reasonable to infer that the Spanish were interested in securing the New World because they believed it to be easier to conquer and exploit than potentially more distant and possibly better defended territories like India.\n\nTherefore, the best inference from the given options, considering historical context, is:\n\nD. The Spanish thought India would be harder to conquer than the New World. \n\nHowever, this option is not explicitly stated in the passage and requires additional historical knowledge to fully understand the motivations behind the Treaty of Tordesillas."
