Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn scenario 1, taking an item from a thrift store without paying for it would be considered stealing, but since you said \"found\" and \"take,\" it could imply that you purchased the purse. If you did buy it, then there is nothing morally wrong with that action. If you meant you took it without paying, then it would be morally wrong, but based on the information given, we cannot assume that.\n\nIn scenario 2, getting a tattoo is a personal choice and does not involve harming others or violating any moral standards. Therefore, it is not considered morally wrong."
