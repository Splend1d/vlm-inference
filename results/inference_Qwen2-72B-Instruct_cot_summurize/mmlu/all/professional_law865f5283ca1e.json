Involuntary manslaughter.\n\nInvoluntary manslaughter typically involves the unintentional killing of another person due to reckless behavior or criminal negligence. In this case, the defendant was speeding, violating state law, and as a result, struck and killed the victim. Although the defendant did not intend to kill the victim, their actions were reckless and led to the death, fitting the criteria for involuntary manslaughter.\n\nSpeeding (A) is an infraction or misdemeanor, but it does not encompass the full scope of the defendant's culpability in causing the victim's death. Voluntary manslaughter (C) typically involves a deliberate act but without premeditation, which does not apply here since there was no intent to kill. Murder (D) generally requires malice aforethought or intent to kill, which is also not present in this scenario."
