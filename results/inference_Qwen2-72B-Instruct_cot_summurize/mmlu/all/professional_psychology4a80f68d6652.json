They often require substantial support throughout their lives, but with appropriate training and support, they can learn basic self-care skills and may be able to perform simple tasks under close supervision. However, it's important to note that the term \"mental retardation\" is outdated and considered offensive by many; the term \"intellectual disability\" is now preferred.\n\nA. This statement is not necessarily true. The prevalence of moderate intellectual disability varies, but it is generally less than the percentage given here.\n\nC. This statement is also not accurate for individuals with moderate intellectual disability. They may acquire some academic skills, but typically not up to an eighth-grade level.\n\nD. This statement is generally true for individuals with intellectual disabilities, including those with moderate intellectual disability. Sensorimotor functioning is often not impaired, although there may be some delays in motor skill development. However, this answer does not specifically address the characteristics of moderate intellectual disability."
