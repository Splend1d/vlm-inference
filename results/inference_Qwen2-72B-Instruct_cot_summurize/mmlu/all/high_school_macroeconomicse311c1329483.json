For a given level of government spending they produce a deficit during a recession and a surplus during an expansion.\n\nAutomatic fiscal policy stabilizers work through the tax and transfer systems in such a way that they tend to dampen economic fluctuations without any deliberate action by policymakers. During a recession, tax revenues fall automatically as incomes decline, and transfer payments like unemployment benefits rise automatically as more people become eligible for them. This results in a budget deficit or a smaller surplus, which helps to support aggregate demand. Conversely, during an economic expansion, tax revenues rise and transfer payments fall, leading to a budget surplus or a smaller deficit, which helps to cool down the economy and prevent overheating."
