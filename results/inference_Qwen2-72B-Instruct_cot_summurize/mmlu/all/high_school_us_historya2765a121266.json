Now, largely because of the troubled state of the world as a whole, civil liberties have disappeared in many other countries.\nIt is impossible, of course, to be at war and keep freedom of the press and freedom of speech and freedom of assembly. They disappear automatically. And so in many countries where ordinarily they were safe, today they have gone. In other countries, even before war came, not only freedom of the press and freedom of assembly, and freedom of speech disappeared, but freedom of religion disappeared.\nAnd so we know here in this country, we have a grave responsibility. We are at peace. We have no reason for the fears which govern so many other peoples throughout the world; therefore, we have to guard the freedoms of democracy.\n\u2014Eleanor Roosevelt, Address to the American Civil Liberties Union, Chicago, Illinois, March 14, 1940\nIn her speech, Eleanor Roosevelt alluded to the earlier threat to civil liberties created by which of the following?\n\nA. World War I\nB. The New Deal\nC. The Cold War\nD. The Great Depression\n"

World War I\n\nIn her speech, Eleanor Roosevelt alludes to the historical context of fighting for civil liberties, and she mentions that during war times, such freedoms tend to disappear \"automatically.\" World War I (1914-1918) was the most recent global conflict prior to her speech in 1940, and it is well-documented that during this period, many countries, including the United States, experienced restrictions on civil liberties due to national security concerns. For example, the U.S. government passed the Espionage Act of 1917 and the Sedition Act of 1918, which curtailed freedom of speech and press under the guise of preventing disloyalty and subversive activities during wartime.\n\nThe New Deal (B), the Great Depression (D), and the Cold War (C) were significant events in American history, but they did not involve the same level of direct threat to civil liberties as World War I. The New Deal was a series of programs and policies introduced by President Franklin D. Roosevelt (Eleanor's husband) to help the country recover from the economic downturn of the Great Depression. Although some critics argued that certain aspects of the New Deal overstepped the bounds of federal power, these programs did not result in widespread curtailment of civil liberties. The Great Depression itself was an economic crisis, not a period marked by government suppression of individual freedoms. Finally, while the Cold War did see instances of civil liberties being challenged, particularly with the Red Scare and McCarthyism, this period began after World War II and thus would not be the context to which Roosevelt was referring in her 1940 speech."
