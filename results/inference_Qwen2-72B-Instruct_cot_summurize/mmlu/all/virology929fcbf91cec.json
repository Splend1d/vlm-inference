How many contacts will be infected from one case\n\nThis number is an estimate of the average number of people who will catch the disease from one infected person in a fully susceptible population. If the R number is above 1, the disease will spread exponentially until it runs out of susceptible hosts or interventions are put in place to reduce transmission. If the R number is below 1, the disease will eventually die out."
