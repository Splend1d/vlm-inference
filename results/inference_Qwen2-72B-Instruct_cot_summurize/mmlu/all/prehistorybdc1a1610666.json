It was an abrupt climate change event characterized by a cooling phase that interrupted the general warming trend at the end of the last Ice Age (Pleistocene). This period saw a re-expansion of glaciers in the Northern Hemisphere, affecting many parts of Europe, North America, and Asia. The cause of this cooling is still debated among scientists, but it's often attributed to changes in ocean currents, particularly the shutdown of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation due to the sudden influx of fresh water from melting ice sheets. This event also had significant impacts on human populations, leading to the abandonment of some areas that had previously been settled during warmer periods."
