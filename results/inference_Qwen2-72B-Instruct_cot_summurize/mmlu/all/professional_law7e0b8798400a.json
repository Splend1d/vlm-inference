One day, the husband had been drinking beer while watching football on television. After his favorite team lost a close game, the husband went into a violent rage. As he was storming around the apartment, he suddenly grabbed his wife and led her outside to their car. He then ordered her to get inside the vehicle. The husband was driving around aimlessly when he negligently collided with another car. The other driver, who was injured in the accident, brought suit against the husband to recover damages. Thereafter, the husband retained an attorney to represent him. At his first consultation with the attorney, the husband was accompanied by his wife. During the conference, the attorney's secretary took notes of the meeting. Two weeks later, the wife separated from the husband. She then hired a lawyer to represent her in a suit against the husband for battery and false imprisonment. At the trial between the husband and the other driver, the other driver's attorney calls the wife to testify. She proposes to testify that her husband was intoxicated at the time of the accident. Upon objection by the husband's attorney, the wife's proposed testimony will most likely be\n\nA. admissible as a proper lay opinion.\nB. inadmissible, under the attorney-clientprivilege.\nC. inadmissible, under the marital privilege.\nD. inadmissible, because the wife is biased.\n"

                    "text": "The wife's proposed testimony about her husband's intoxication at the time of the accident would most likely be:\n\nA. admissible as a proper lay opinion.\n\nUnder the rules of evidence, a lay witness may offer an opinion if it is rationally based on the witness's perception, helpful to clearly understanding the witness's testimony or to determining a fact in issue, and not based on scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge. Since the wife was present at the time of the accident and has personal knowledge of her husband's condition due to living with him and observing his behavior, she can provide a lay opinion on whether he appeared to be intoxicated.\n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nB. The attorney-client privilege does not apply because the wife is not testifying about any confidential communications she had with her own attorney. Her testimony is about her observations of her husband, not legal advice or communications with counsel.\n\nC. The marital privilege typically protects confidential communications between spouses, but it does not prevent one spouse from testifying about what they observed directly. Moreover, the privilege can be waived by the spouse who made the communication, and in cases of domestic violence or crimes committed against one spouse by the other, courts may limit the application of the privilege.\n\nD. Bias alone is not a reason to exclude testimony; it affects the weight and credibility of the testimony, not its admissibility. A witness's bias can be explored during cross-examination."
