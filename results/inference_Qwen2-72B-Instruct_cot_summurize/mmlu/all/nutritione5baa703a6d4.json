Poor muscle strength\n\nHigh bone mineral density (A), high body weight (B), and high lean mass (C) are generally protective against osteoporotic fractures, as they contribute to stronger bones and better overall body support. However, poor muscle strength (D) can increase the risk of falls, which in turn increases the risk of fractures, especially in individuals with osteoporosis. Strong muscles help to maintain balance and stability, reducing the likelihood of falls."
