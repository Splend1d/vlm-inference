Therefore, option A can be eliminated.\n\nOption B, an advance in technology, could lead to increased productivity, allowing for more output (real GDP) at lower costs. This could result in falling prices if the supply of goods increases faster than demand, or if producers pass on cost savings to consumers. Thus, this option is plausible.\n\nOption C, an increase in government spending, typically leads to higher aggregate demand, which can push up prices rather than cause deflation. It is less likely to result in the observed scenario unless accompanied by other factors that significantly increase productivity or reduce costs.\n\nOption D, a decrease in government spending, might initially reduce aggregate demand and potentially lead to deflation. However, it is less likely to cause a rise in real GDP in the short term unless there is a simultaneous increase in private sector investment or productivity gains elsewhere in the economy.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most plausible answer is:\n\nB. an advance in technology."
