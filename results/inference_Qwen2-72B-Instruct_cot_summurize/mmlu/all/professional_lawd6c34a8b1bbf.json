However, the Wharton Rule, which generally bars prosecution for conspiracy when the underlying crime is one that requires two parties (like bigamy), does not apply in this context since murder can be committed by a single individual.\n\nOf the options given, the only one that could potentially serve as a valid defense for the defendant would be if the man's acquittal was based on the grounds of self-defense. If the jury found that the man had a reasonable belief that he was in imminent danger of death or serious bodily harm and that using deadly force was necessary to prevent it, then the defendant could argue that he cannot be held criminally responsible for the actions of another person acting in self-defense.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Self-defense."
