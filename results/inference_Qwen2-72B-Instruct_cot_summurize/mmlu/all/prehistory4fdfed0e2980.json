However, this is not entirely accurate as the earliest known premodern Homo sapiens fossils date back to around 300,000 years ago, but the time range provided in option A does fall within the broader period during which premodern Homo sapiens are believed to have existed. The evolution of Homo sapiens is a complex and ongoing area of research, with new discoveries continually pushing back the timeline of our species' existence."
