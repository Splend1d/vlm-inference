Substitution effects and income effects\n\nWhen the price of a good falls, consumers will tend to buy more of that good because it has become relatively cheaper compared to other goods (substitution effect). Additionally, the lower price effectively increases the purchasing power of consumers' income, allowing them to buy more of all goods, including the one that has become cheaper (income effect). These two effects explain why the demand curve slopes downward."
