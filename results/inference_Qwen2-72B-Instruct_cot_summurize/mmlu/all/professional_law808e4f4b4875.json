The other woman did not know that her partner had a gun in the shopping bag. After the women placed three dresses into the shopping bag, a clerk became suspicious and approached the women. The women tried to leave the store and, as they did, the clerk grabbed the bag, which fell to the floor. When the bag hit the floor, the gun discharged, killing the clerk. Which of the following would be the women's best defense to the charge of felony murder?\n\nA. They committed a larceny by placing the three dresses in the shopping bag.\nB. The jurisdiction requires the killing to be independent of the felony.\nC. The jurisdiction follows the agency theory of felony murder.\nD. The killing, was accidental and unintended.\n"

                    "text": "The women's best defense to the charge of felony murder would likely be B. The jurisdiction requires the killing to be independent of the felony.\n\nFelony murder is a legal doctrine that holds a defendant responsible for any deaths that occur during the commission of certain felonies, even if the death was unintentional. However, some jurisdictions require that the death be independent of the felony itself, meaning that the death must not have been a foreseeable result of committing the felony. In this case, if the jurisdiction follows this requirement, the women could argue that the discharge of the gun and the resulting death were unforeseeable accidents that occurred independently of the theft. \n\nIt is important to note that this defense may not absolve the women of all criminal responsibility, but it could potentially reduce the severity of the charges or sentence. The other options (A, C, D) do not provide a strong defense against the charge of felony murder. Option A acknowledges the commission of a crime, option C refers to a theory of liability that does not help the defendants in this scenario, and option D is unlikely to be a valid defense given the circumstances described."
