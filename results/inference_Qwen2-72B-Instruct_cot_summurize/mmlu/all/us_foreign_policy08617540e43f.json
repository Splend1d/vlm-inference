Benevolent hegemony: The idea that the United States, as a benevolent global superpower, should take the lead in international affairs to promote democracy, human rights, and free trade.\n\nB. Ineffectiveness of multilateralism: The belief that multilateral institutions and agreements can be slow, bureaucratic, and ineffective in addressing immediate threats or challenges, leading to the argument that unilateral action is sometimes necessary for timely response.\n\nC. American power: The notion that the United States has the military, economic, and political power to act independently and achieve its foreign policy goals without the need for cooperation from other nations.\n\nThese points collectively support the argument for American unilateralism, which advocates for the U.S. to act alone on the world stage when it deems it necessary to protect its national interests or promote its values."
