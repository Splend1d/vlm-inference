True, False\n\nExplanation:\nStatement 1 is true because one of the key properties of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) is their ability to construct decision boundaries that maximize the margin between different classes. This maximization of the margin leads to better generalization capabilities, which often results in lower generalization error compared to other linear classifiers.\n\nStatement 2 is false because while it's true that SVMs can approximate complex decision boundaries using different types of kernels, including polynomial kernels, the degree of the polynomial kernel required to reproduce the decision boundary from a generative model with class-conditional Gaussian distributions is not necessarily limited to a degree less than or equal to three. The complexity of the decision boundary depends on the data distribution and the specifics of the generative model, so there's no guarantee that a polynomial kernel of such low degree would suffice. In fact, depending on the data, a higher degree polynomial kernel might be necessary, or even a radial basis function (RBF) kernel for more complex boundaries."
