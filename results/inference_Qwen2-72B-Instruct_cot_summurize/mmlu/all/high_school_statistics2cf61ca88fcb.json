However, it's important to note that reactions can vary widely depending on the specific circumstances of the game, and some fans may indeed blame the team's performance more than the officiating (option A). It's less likely that the majority of callers would immediately call for new players (option B) or support the officials if the team has been struggling with fouls throughout the season (option D), although these perspectives might also be represented among the callers."
