It involves using lines and points to represent how objects appear smaller as they recede into the distance, converging at one or more vanishing points on the horizon line. This technique helps to give the impression of depth and distance in a drawing or painting.\n\nRetinal disparity (A) and convergence (B) are both related to binocular vision and how our eyes work together to perceive depth, but they are not techniques used by artists in creating a drawing. Closure (C) is a Gestalt principle of perception where the brain fills in gaps to perceive a complete image, but it does not directly contribute to adding depth to a drawing."
