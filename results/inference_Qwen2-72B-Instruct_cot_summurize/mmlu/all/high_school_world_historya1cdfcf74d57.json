In both countries it was clearer than crystal . . . that things in general were settled for ever.\n\u2014A Tale of Two Cities, by Charles Dickens\nBliss was it in that dawn to be alive.

In America, colonists resented British taxation policies, famously protesting \"no taxation without representation.\" In France, the Estates-General was convened due to financial crisis, and the Third Estate (commoners) revolted against the disproportionate tax burden they bore compared to the nobility and clergy. However, it's important to note that while taxation was a significant factor, both revolutions were also driven by other issues such as transformation of the social class structure, new proposed political structures, and the influence of Enlightenment ideas challenging traditional authority. Yet, among the options provided, taxation stands out as a common grievance leading to revolution in both contexts."
