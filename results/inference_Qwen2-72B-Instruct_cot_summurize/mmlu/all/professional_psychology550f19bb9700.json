As relationships mature, partners become more familiar with each other, and their behaviors become more predictable, which can lead to a decrease in the intensity of emotional experiences. This does not mean that the relationship becomes devoid of positive emotions but rather that the nature of the emotions may change from intense and passionate to more stable and companionate love."
