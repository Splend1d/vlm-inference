(i), (ii), and (iii) only.\n\nHere's why:\n\ni) Taking logarithms of each of the variables can help stabilize variance if the relationship between the variance of the error terms and the mean of the dependent variable follows a power law. This transformation is often used when dealing with multiplicative effects or when the variance increases with the level of the independent variable.\n\nii) Using suitably modified standard errors, such as robust standard errors (also known as Huber-White standard errors or sandwich estimators), can account for heteroscedasticity without modifying the model specification. These standard errors provide more accurate inference in the presence of heteroscedasticity.\n\niii) A generalized least squares (GLS) procedure takes into account the covariance structure of the errors and can provide more efficient estimates than ordinary least squares (OLS) when there is heteroscedasticity. GLS requires knowledge or estimation of the form of the heteroscedasticity to be effective.\n\niv) Adding lagged values of the variables to the regression equation might address issues related to autocorrelation rather than heteroscedasticity. While it can sometimes help in stabilizing variance, this approach is not specifically targeted at dealing with heteroscedasticity.\n\nTherefore, options (i), (ii), and (iii) are plausible approaches to dealing with heteroscedasticity, but adding lagged values of the variables (iv) is not necessarily an approach to address heteroscedasticity directly."
