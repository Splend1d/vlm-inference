Double shelled icosahedron\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that while the core of the Dane particle has an icosahedral symmetry, the overall shape of the particle is more spherical due to its lipid envelope. The Dane particle consists of an inner nucleocapsid (icosahedral core) surrounded by an outer lipid envelope. The nucleocapsid contains the viral DNA and DNA polymerase, while the envelope is studded with surface antigens."
