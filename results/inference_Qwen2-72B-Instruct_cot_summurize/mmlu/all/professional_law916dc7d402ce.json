During the riot, a defendant was walking along the street when he paused in front of an appliance store. He picked up a portable television set that was lying on the sidewalk and started to walk off quickly. A police officer who was standing in front of the shop rushed after the defendant and arrested him. The defendant, an indigent, was charged with grand larceny, a felony carrying the maximum penalty of seven months imprisonment and a S 1,000 fine. At his arraignment, the judge advised the defendant of his right to have counsel appointed for him. The defendant, however, told the judge that he wanted to represent himself and waive his right to a jury trial. The judge then questioned the defendant at length about his demands. The defendant indicated that he had no previous legal experience. He told the judge that the reason he didn't want a court-appointed attorney to represent him was because he didn't trust lawyers. The judge did not find the defendant's reasons for representing himself to be persuasive and appointed an attorney to represent him. Thereafter, an attorney was appointed by the court to represent the defendant. The attorney told the court that the defendant wanted a non-jury trial. However, at the prosecution's request, the court impaneled a jury. The defendant was subsequently convicted by the jury and sentenced to six months imprisonment. In addition, the defendant was ordered to reimburse the state $450 to cover the cost of his attorney. This reimbursement order was made pursuant to a relevant statute in effect at the time of the defendant's arrest. The defendant appeals both the conviction and the reimbursement order. The appellate court should\n\nA. affirm both the conviction and the reimbursement order.\nB. affirm the conviction, but not the reimbursement order.\nC. reverse the conviction because he was denied the right to a non-jury trial, but not the reimbursement order.\nD. reverse both the conviction and the reimbursement order because the defendant was denied the right to represent himself.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is D. reverse both the conviction and the reimbursement order because the defendant was denied the right to represent himself.\n\nThe Sixth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution guarantees criminal defendants the right to self-representation, also known as the right to proceed pro se. When a defendant knowingly and intelligently waives the right to counsel and chooses to represent himself, the court must respect this choice unless there are compelling reasons not to do so. In this case, the defendant clearly expressed his desire to represent himself and waive his right to a jury trial. Although he lacked legal experience, he provided a reason for wanting to represent himself (distrust of lawyers), and the judge did not find any compelling reasons to deny this request. Therefore, the judge's decision to appoint an attorney against the defendant's wishes violated the defendant's constitutional rights.\n\nAdditionally, the court's decision to impanel a jury despite the defendant's and his appointed attorney's request for a non-jury trial further violated the defendant's rights. While the prosecution may have requested a jury trial, the defendant's preference for a bench trial (non-jury) should have been honored if it was made before the trial began.\n\nGiven these violations of the defendant's rights, the appellate court should reverse both the conviction and the reimbursement order. The reimbursement order is based on the defendant's conviction, which is being reversed due to the violation of his rights. Thus, the reimbursement order cannot stand if the underlying conviction is overturned."
