The car swerved out of control, jumped the curb, and crashed into a home. The defendant was arrested and charged with the separate crimes of larceny and malicious destruction of property. During the trial the judge instructed the jury that the theft of the car was sufficient evidence to satisfS' the malice requirement for the malicious destruction of property charge. The defendant's attorney has filed a motion objecting to the judge's jury instruction. The judge's instruction was\n\nA. correct, because malice can be inferred from the intent to steal.\nB. correct, because malicious destruction of property is a general intent crime.\nC. incorrect, because larceny is not a lesser included offense of malicious destruction of property.\nD. incorrect, because malice requires a showing of recklessness.\n"

In this case, the defendant did not intentionally crash the car into the house; rather, the crash occurred due to the steering malfunctioning. Therefore, the mere fact that the defendant committed larceny by stealing the car does not automatically satisfy the malice requirement for the charge of malicious destruction of property.\n\nIt is important to note that while the defendant may have had the intent to steal the car, which satisfies the mens rea (mental state) requirement for larceny, the subsequent crash into the home, which resulted in property damage, must be shown to have been the result of an intentional act or reckless behavior to meet the malice requirement for malicious destruction of property. Since the defendant was operating the vehicle within the posted speed limit and the crash was caused by a sudden malfunction, it cannot be assumed that the defendant acted with the requisite malice for the property damage charge based solely on the theft of the car."
