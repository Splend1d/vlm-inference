The principle behind this method is that the volume of water displaced by the body is equal to the body's volume. By measuring body weight in air and then underwater, one can calculate body density, which is used to estimate body fat percentage. This method provides a more accurate measurement of body composition than methods like skinfold tests or BMI, which are indirect estimates based on equations and assumptions."
