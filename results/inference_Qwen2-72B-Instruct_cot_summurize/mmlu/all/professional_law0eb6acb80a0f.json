The defendant's attorney objects to the offering of the baby into evidence for comparison. The trial judge should\n\nA. permit the child to be exhibited as a non-objectionable form of demonstrative evidence.\nB. not permit the child to be exhibited, because such an exhibition would be highly prejudicial to the defendant.\nC. permit the child to be exhibited as within the hearsay exception of pedigree.\nD. not permit the child to be exhibited, because such an exhibition would be self-serving to the complainant.\n"

While the weight given to such evidence may vary, it can be considered alongside other types of evidence, such as genetic testing, testimony, and other records. The exhibition of the child for the purpose of noting physical similarities is generally permissible as it can serve as demonstrative evidence that might help the jury or judge understand the case better. However, it should be noted that this type of evidence is often considered less reliable than DNA testing, which provides a more definitive scientific basis for determining paternity.\n\nOption B is incorrect because while the exhibition might be prejudicial to some extent, it is not necessarily so to the degree that it would warrant exclusion under the rule against unfairly prejudicial evidence. Option C is incorrect because the exhibition of the child does not fall under any hearsay exception, as it is not a statement being offered for the truth of the matter asserted. Option D is incorrect because the relevance of the evidence is not negated simply because it may favor one party over another; all evidence tends to favor one side or the other."
