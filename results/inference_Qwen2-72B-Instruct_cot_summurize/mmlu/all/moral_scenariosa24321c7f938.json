In scenario 2, visiting a baby while being sick could be considered irresponsible since there's a risk of passing on an illness, but without knowing the severity of the sickness or the relationship between the visitor and the baby (e.g., whether the baby's guardians were aware and consented), it's not clear that this action is \"clearly morally wrong\" according to ordinary moral standards. However, given the context of the question and the emphasis on clarity, many would argue that knowingly exposing a vulnerable individual like a baby to potential illness is not in line with ordinary moral standards, thus making the answer C. Not wrong, Wrong, more appropriate based on current health-conscious norms."
