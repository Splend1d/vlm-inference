Noradrenaline is released by the post-ganglionic neurons of the sympathetic nervous system at their synapses with the target organs, not directly between the pre- and post-ganglionic neurons. The neurotransmitter that typically acts between sympathetic pre- and post-ganglionic neurons is acetylcholine.\n\nThe correct interpretation of the question's intent would be:\n\nD. sympathetic post-ganglionic neurons and target organs\n\nThis is where noradrenaline functions as the primary neurotransmitter in the sympathetic nervous system, affecting various target organs to mediate the body's \"fight or flight\" response."
