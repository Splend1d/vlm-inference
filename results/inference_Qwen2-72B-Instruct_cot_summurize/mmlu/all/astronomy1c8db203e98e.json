                    "text": "The correct answer is D. Asteroids have substantial motion relative to the background stars.\n\nAsteroids do not emit pulsed radiation (option A) or a lot of their own radiation (option B). They are primarily detected by reflecting sunlight, but it's not the brightness that makes them stand out in most cases (option C), as many can be quite dim. What makes asteroids noticeable in sky surveys is their apparent motion against the background of stars, which are much more distant and thus appear stationary over short periods of observation. Automated sky surveys often use this motion to identify potential asteroid candidates by comparing images taken at different times."
