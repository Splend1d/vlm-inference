The exam is normed with a mean of 80 and a standard deviation of 9. Only those who score in the top 15% on the test are invited back for further evaluation. Estrella received a 90 on the test. What was her percentile rank on the test, and did she qualify for further evaluation?\n\nA. 13.35; she didn't qualify.\nB. 54.38; she didn't qualify.\nC. 86.65; she qualified.\nD. 84.38; she didn't qualify.\n"

                    "text": "To find Estrella's percentile rank on the test, we need to calculate the z-score corresponding to her test score and then convert that z-score into a percentile.\n\nThe formula for the z-score is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{X - \\mu}{\\sigma} \\]\n\nwhere \\(X\\) is the individual's score, \\(\\mu\\) is the mean of the distribution, and \\(\\sigma\\) is the standard deviation of the distribution.\n\nGiven that the mean \\(\\mu = 80\\), the standard deviation \\(\\sigma = 9\\), and Estrella's score \\(X = 90\\), we can calculate the z-score as follows:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{90 - 80}{9} = \\frac{10}{9} \\approx 1.11 \\]\n\nNext, we need to find the area under the standard normal curve (the cumulative distribution function) up to this z-score to determine Estrella's percentile rank. This area corresponds to the probability of obtaining a score less than or equal to Estrella's score. We can look up this value in a standard normal distribution table or use a statistical software/calculator.\n\nLooking up a z-score of 1.11 in a standard normal table, we find that the area to the left (or below) this z-score is approximately 0.8665, or 86.65%.\n\nThis means Estrella's score falls at the 86.65th percentile, indicating that she scored higher than 86.65% of the people who took the test.\n\nSince only those who score in the top 15% on the test are invited back for further evaluation, and Estrella's score falls within the top 15% (since she is above the 85th percentile), she did indeed qualify for further evaluation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. 86.65; she qualified."
