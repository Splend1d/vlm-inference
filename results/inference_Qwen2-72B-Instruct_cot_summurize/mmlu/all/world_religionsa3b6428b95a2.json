Therefore, the answer to your question is B. The Dalai Lama. He often speaks about the importance of compassion and altruism, and how these qualities can lead to self-sacrifice for the benefit of others. However, it's worth noting that self-sacrifice is not necessarily a central concept in Buddhism as a whole, but rather one aspect of the broader teaching of compassion and the cultivation of positive qualities such as generosity and kindness."
