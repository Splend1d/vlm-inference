The parameters that can serve as estimators of central tendency are the mean, median, and mode. The standard deviation is a measure of dispersion or variability in the data, not of central tendency.\n\nGiven the information provided:\n\n- Mean = 67\n- Median = 76\n- Mode = 80\n\nWe notice that there is a significant difference between the mean and the median, indicating that the distribution of scores is skewed. In a perfectly symmetrical distribution, the mean, median, and mode would all be equal. However, when a distribution is skewed (as indicated by the disparity between these measures), the median is often considered a better estimator of central tendency because it is less influenced by outliers or skewed data points than the mean.\n\nSince the mean is influenced more by extreme values, if there are a few very low or very high scores, the mean can be pulled in the direction of those scores, making it a less reliable indicator of where the center of the distribution lies. The mode, while being the most frequently occurring score, may not represent the typical score if the distribution is bimodal or multimodal.\n\nThus, the **median** (option B) is the least biased estimator of central tendency for this distribution of biochemistry test scores.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nB.
