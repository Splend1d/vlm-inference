Obesity, excess energy intake, normal growth, and hypoinsulinaemia\n\nLeptin is a hormone produced by adipose cells that plays a critical role in regulating energy intake and expenditure. It signals to the brain to suppress appetite and increase metabolism. In individuals with impaired leptin secretion (leptin deficiency), there is an absence or reduction of this signal, leading to increased hunger, overeating, and obesity. Since leptin also influences insulin sensitivity, its deficiency can lead to hypoinsulinaemia (low insulin levels) as part of the compensatory mechanism trying to maintain glucose homeostasis. Growth is typically not affected in leptin deficiency, and hypothyroidism is not directly associated with leptin levels."
