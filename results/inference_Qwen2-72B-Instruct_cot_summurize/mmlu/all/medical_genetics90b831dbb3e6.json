This allows RNA polymerase to bind to the promoter and transcribe the genes for the enzymes needed to metabolize lactose.\n\nHowever, if there's a mutation in the repressor that prevents it from binding to lactose, then the repressor would not be able to bind to the operator even in the absence of lactose. This means that the lac operon genes would be expressed regardless of whether lactose is present or not, resulting in constitutive expression of the lac operon genes. The presence or absence of glucose would still affect cAMP levels and thus the activity of the cAMP-CAP complex, but this does not directly relate to the question about the effect of a mutation in the repressor protein."
