                    "text": "A businessman is the owner of a pet products company, which is engaged in the manufacture and sale of a variety of pet supplies. The businessman's company manufactures such products as pet furniture, toys, beds, collars, leashes, cages, and vitamins. These items are distributed to pet stores throughout the United States and Europe. For many years, the company has conducted its operations from a large factory located in a small town in the southern part of the state. One of the businessman's biggest selling products is specially manufactured high-frequency dog-calling whistles. These whistles are sold to dog-training schools and canine divisions of many police departments. Although these whistles are not audible to people, they are audible to dogs over considerable distances. Two years ago, a breeder purchased an undeveloped lot in the small town in which the company's factory was located. On her property, the breeder constructed a pet hotel, which was used as a boarding kennel for dogs and cats. This boarding facility was situated about 100 yards from the company's factory. Unknown to the breeder, high-frequency sound waves often emanated from the company's factory when dog-calling whistles were being tested. These sound waves caused the breeder's dogs to howl uncontrollably for many hours during the day and seriously interfered with the operation of her business. The breeder now brings an action against the businessman and the company to recover damages for the interference with her business caused by the high-frequency sound that reaches her kennel. The court should rule in favor of\n\nA. the businessman, because the breeder came to the nuisance after his factory had already been in operation for a number of years.\nB. the businessman, because the breeder's business is abnormally sensitive to harm caused by the high-frequency sound waves.\nC. the breeder, because the high-frequency sound waves constitute a trespass to her premises.\nD. the breeder, because the high-frequency sound waves have seriously interfered with the operation of her business.\n"

                    "text": "The court should rule in favor of D. the breeder, because the high-frequency sound waves have seriously interfered with the operation of her business.\n\nIn this scenario, the businessman's company has been conducting operations that result in high-frequency sound waves emanating from the factory, causing the breeder's dogs to howl uncontrollably and interfering with her business. While it is true that the businessman's factory was in operation before the breeder established her pet hotel, the fact remains that the high-frequency sound waves constitute a form of noise pollution that can be considered a private nuisance if they unreasonably interfere with the use and enjoyment of someone else's property.\n\nThe key issue here is whether the businessman's activities have crossed the line into becoming a nuisance. Given that the sound waves are causing significant disruption to the breeder's business operations, it is likely that a court would find in favor of the breeder. It is also important to note that the businessman's activities may be considered unreasonable given the proximity of the breeder's business and the impact on her livelihood.\n\nAdditionally, the businessman cannot claim that the breeder's business is abnormally sensitive to the high-frequency sound waves since the dogs' reaction is a natural response to the sound, not an abnormal sensitivity. Therefore, options A and B do not provide a valid defense for the businessman.\n\nOption C, which suggests that the high-frequency sound waves constitute a trespass to her premises, is not the most accurate characterization of the situation. Trespass typically involves physical invasion of property, whereas this case involves noise pollution, which is more accurately described as a nuisance rather than a trespass.\n\nThus, option D is the most appropriate answer, as it correctly identifies the core issue: the high-frequency sound waves have seriously interfered with the operation of the breeder's business, potentially entitling her to damages for the interference caused by the businessman's company."
