The man's possession has at all times complied with the requirements of the applicable adverse possession statute in effect. Twelve years after the man took possession, the woman died intestate, leaving her six-year-old son as her only surviving heir. Nine years after the woman's death, when the son was 15, the son's guardian discovered that the man was in possession of the tract. Assume that the statutory period of adverse possession is 20 years and the age of majority is 18. Which of the following correctly describes the state of title to the tract?\n\nA. The man has acquired title by adverse possession.\nB. The man will not acquire title unless he continues in adverse possession for an additional three years, or until the son reaches the age of 18.\nC. The man will not acquire title unless he continues in adverse possession for an additional eight years, making a total of 12 years after the woman's death.\nD. The man will not acquire title unless he continues in adverse possession for an additional 12years, or nine years after the son attains the ageof 18.\n"

The man will not acquire title unless he continues in adverse possession for an additional three years, or until the son reaches the age of 18.\n\nWhen the woman died intestate, her six-year-old son became the heir to the property. Under the law, the son's right to bring an action to recover his interest in the property is typically postponed until he reaches the age of majority (18 years old). However, the adverse possession clock does not stop running during the son's minority. Instead, it is extended for a period equal to the length of time the individual was a minor when the adverse possession began.\n\nIn this case, since the man has been in possession of the property for 12 years, and the statutory period for adverse possession is 20 years, he still needs to remain in adverse possession for an additional 8 years to meet the full statutory requirement. However, because the son was a minor when the adverse possession began, the man must continue to possess the property adversely for 3 more years from the discovery date by the son's guardian, or until the son turns 18, whichever comes first. This is because the son's rights are protected until he reaches the age of majority, and he has a reasonable time (in this case, 3 years) after reaching the age of majority to challenge the adverse possession if he so chooses. If the son does not challenge the adverse possession within this extended period, the man may then have a valid claim to the property through adverse possession."
