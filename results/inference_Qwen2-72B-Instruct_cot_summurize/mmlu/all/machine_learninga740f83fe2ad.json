The parameters in these models are typically initialized randomly or with pre-trained vectors, but not using a Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM). RBMs were used historically in some early neural network architectures for unsupervised learning and pre-training, but they are not part of the Word2Vec algorithm.\n\nStatement 2 is also true. The tanh function, or hyperbolic tangent function, is indeed a nonlinear activation function commonly used in neural networks. It maps input values between -1 and 1, providing a stronger gradient than the sigmoid function for values closer to zero. This can help mitigate the vanishing gradient problem in deep networks."
