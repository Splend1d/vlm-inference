The correct answer is B.\n\nIn general, a modification to a contract requires new consideration to be binding. In this case, the buyer and the manufacturer agreed to change the quantity term from 1,000 to 800 gidgets, but there is no indication that either party provided any additional consideration for this modification. Without new consideration, the modification may not be enforceable.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the modification does not violate the statute of frauds, which requires certain contracts to be in writing to be enforceable. The original contract was already in writing, and the modification could have been made in writing as well.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the fact that the original contract was in writing does not necessarily make the modification unenforceable. If there was new consideration provided for the modification, it could still be enforceable even if it was not in writing.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the parol evidence rule does not apply here. The parol evidence rule generally prohibits the introduction of oral or extrinsic evidence to contradict or vary the terms of a written contract. However, in this case, the modification was agreed upon by both parties and would not be considered extrinsic evidence."
