At the beginning of the experiment, the axon is at rest and has a threshold measured at \u201370 mV at 37oC. The axon receives one stimulus that triggers one action potential in the axon. Subsequent stimuli are much stronger. Which of the following statements explains what happens when several strong stimuli are experienced by the axon?\n\nA. The axon becomes hyperpolarized to \u201390 mV.\nB. The axon becomes hyperpolarized to \u201350 mV.\nC. The strength of the action potential becomes greater.\nD. The frequency of the action potential increases.\n"

The frequency of the action potential increases.\n\nWhen an axon receives multiple strong stimuli, it does not change the strength of the individual action potentials (which are all-or-none events), but rather the frequency at which these action potentials occur can increase. This means that more action potentials will be fired per unit time, increasing the rate of signal transmission along the axon. Neither A nor B accurately describes the situation, as hyperpolarization would make it harder for the neuron to reach the threshold for an action potential, and the strength of an individual action potential does not vary based on the strength of the stimulus once the threshold is reached (C)."
