Higher spending, Higher taxes, and Lowering the discount rate.\n\nIn order to fight a recessionary gap, policymakers need to stimulate economic activity. Higher government spending can increase aggregate demand, which can help close the output gap. However, increasing spending alone could lead to larger budget deficits. To offset this, policymakers might also increase taxes, which could help reduce the size of the deficit while still allowing for increased spending. \n\nMonetary policy can also be used in conjunction with fiscal policy to fight a recessionary gap. Lowering the discount rate (the interest rate charged by the central bank to commercial banks) can make it cheaper for banks to borrow money, encouraging them to lend more and thereby increasing the money supply. This can also stimulate economic activity and help close the output gap. \n\nIt's worth noting that increasing taxes during a recession can be controversial, as it may reduce consumer spending and further dampen economic activity. However, in the context of avoiding large budget deficits, it can be a necessary trade-off. Additionally, the effectiveness of these policies will depend on the specific circumstances of the economy at the time."
