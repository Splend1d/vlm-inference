During the recovery period following high-intensity exercise, when oxygen availability is limited (a condition known as oxygen debt), the resynthesis of phosphocreatine is slowed or inhibited until oxygen levels return to normal. This is because the process relies on ATP production via oxidative phosphorylation in the mitochondria, a pathway that requires oxygen as the final electron acceptor."
