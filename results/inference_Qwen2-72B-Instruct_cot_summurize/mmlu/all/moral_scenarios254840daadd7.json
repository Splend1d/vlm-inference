Offering extra money to a babysitter to stay late could be seen as attempting to take advantage of someone, but it could also simply be an attempt to accommodate a last-minute need for childcare. Without additional information about the circumstances and the babysitter's response, we cannot conclude that this action is clearly morally wrong.\n\nIn scenario 2, tossing a ball to a friend is a normal social interaction and is not considered morally wrong by ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020."
