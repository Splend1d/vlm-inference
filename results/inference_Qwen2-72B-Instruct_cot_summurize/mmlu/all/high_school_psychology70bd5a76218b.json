If John has been handling money for 17 years but still cannot identify the pictures on the faces of the coins and bills, it suggests that he has not effectively encoded this specific information into his long-term memory. This could be due to a lack of attention to these details or because he has never had a reason to encode this information before now. Confabulation (A) refers to the creation of false memories, usually as a result of brain damage, which does not fit the scenario. Failure to reconstruct (B) would imply that he once knew the information but could no longer retrieve it, while deep processing (D) refers to a method of encoding where information is processed at a deeper level, leading to better retention, which is not the issue here."
