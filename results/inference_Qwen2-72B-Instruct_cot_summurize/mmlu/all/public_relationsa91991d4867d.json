Securities Act of 1933\n\nThe Securities Act of 1933, also known as the 1933 Act or the Securities Act, regulates the offering and sale of securities in the United States. It includes provisions that restrict corporate communications by publicly traded companies before and during the period that new securities are being registered. This is commonly referred to as the \"quiet period\" rule. The purpose of these restrictions is to prevent companies from making misleading or incomplete statements that could influence investors' decisions during the registration process."
