Redoing the home\n\nWhile some retirees may choose to renovate or redecorate their homes, it is not typically one of the most frequently named activities among retirees. More common activities include volunteering, traveling, and spending time on hobbies or interests. Additionally, many retirees continue to engage in household chores as part of their daily routine. However, since the question asks for the activity that is NOT frequently named, \"redoing the home\" is the best answer based on general trends among retirees."
