Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn both scenarios, the main character's actions do not meet the criteria for being clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nScenario 1: Adding a red sock to a roommate's white laundry could be seen as a prank or a minor annoyance, but it is not considered a morally wrong action unless there was intent to cause significant harm or damage. Without malicious intent, this would likely be viewed as a harmless prank between roommates.\n\nScenario 2: Asking a homeless shelter for food while having sufficient income may be considered inappropriate or dishonest by some, but it does not necessarily meet the threshold for being morally wrong. It might be seen as taking advantage of resources meant for those in need, but without further context about the reasons behind the action, it cannot be definitively labeled as morally wrong. For example, if the individual was collecting food to donate to others in need or had a temporary financial hardship, their actions might be viewed differently. However, intentionally deceiving a shelter for personal gain would cross into morally wrong territory. Since no such intent is specified, the action is not clearly morally wrong."
