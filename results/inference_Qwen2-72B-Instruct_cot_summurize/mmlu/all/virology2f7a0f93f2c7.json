Homosexual males\n\nHowever, it's important to note that HIV affects multiple groups within the Latino community, including heterosexuals and injection drug users. The CDC reports that while gay and bisexual men account for the majority of new HIV diagnoses among Hispanics/Latinos, heterosexual contact and injection drug use also contribute significantly to new infections. It's crucial to address the needs of all at-risk populations to effectively combat the spread of HIV."
