Medical history is unremarkable and he takes no routine medications. Vital signs are normal. Physical examination shows a palpable nodule in the right lobe of the thyroid gland. Serum thyroid-stimulating hormone concentration is within the reference range. Ultrasonography of the thyroid gland confirms a solid, 1-cm nodule. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?\n\nA. CT scan of the neck\nB. Fine-needle aspiration of the nodule\nC. Radionuclide thyroid scan\nD. Thyroidectomy\n"

Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) of the nodule\n\nFine-needle aspiration biopsy is the initial diagnostic procedure of choice for evaluating thyroid nodules. It is a simple, safe, and cost-effective method that can provide cytologic information to determine if the nodule is benign or malignant. If the FNA result is suspicious or malignant, further workup including possible surgical intervention may be indicated.\n\nA CT scan of the neck is not typically the first-line investigation for a solitary thyroid nodule unless there are specific clinical concerns such as compressive symptoms or suspicion of local invasion.\nA radionuclide thyroid scan can help characterize the functional status of the nodule (hot, cold, or warm), but it does not provide histopathological information.\nThyroidectomy is a surgical procedure that involves removing all or part of the thyroid gland and is usually reserved for cases where malignancy is suspected based on clinical features, imaging studies, or FNA results."
