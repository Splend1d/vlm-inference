The options given are:\n\nA. H+(aq) - This represents hydrogen ions in solution, not a solid metal that can directly reduce other substances.\nB. Na(s) - Sodium is highly reactive and could potentially reduce many substances, but its reactivity makes it difficult to handle safely in many cases.\nC. Ca2+(aq) - This represents calcium ions in solution, similar to H+, this is not a solid metal that can act as a reducing agent in the same way.\nD. Mg(s) - Magnesium is a metal that is less reactive than sodium but still quite effective as a reducing agent. It is safer to handle than sodium and can be used to reduce substances to a desired oxidation state.\n\nConsidering the safety and effectiveness as a reducing agent, **D. Mg(s)** (Magnesium) would be a reasonable and safe substitute for silver amalgam when reducing substances to a desired oxidation state."
