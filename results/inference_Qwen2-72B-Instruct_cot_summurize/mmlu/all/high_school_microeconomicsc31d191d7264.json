The greater (higher) the wage elasticity of demand, the greater the price elasticity for the product produced by labor.\n\nWage elasticity of demand refers to how responsive the demand for labor is to changes in wages. If the wage elasticity of demand is high, it means that small changes in wages lead to large changes in the quantity of labor demanded. This suggests that employers can easily substitute labor with other factors of production or adjust their output levels in response to wage changes. Consequently, the products produced by this labor would also have higher price elasticity of demand, meaning that consumers are sensitive to price changes and will adjust their consumption accordingly."
