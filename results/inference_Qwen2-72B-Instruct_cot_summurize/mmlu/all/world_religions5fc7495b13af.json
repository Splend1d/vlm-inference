Eternal Spirit\n\nIn Manichaean cosmology, God is often referred to as the \"Eternal Spirit\" or \"Spirit of Life.\" However, it's important to note that Mani's conception of the divine is complex and includes aspects like the Father of Greatness (the supreme God) and the Mother of Light (a key figure in the spiritual realm). But if we must choose from your list, \"Eternal Spirit\" would be the closest to how Mani described the divine."
