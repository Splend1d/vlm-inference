But the payment of duties laid by an act of Parliament as regulations of commerce was never disputed. . . . An external tax is a duty laid on commodities imported; that duty is added to the first cost and other charges on the commodity, and, when it is offered for sale, makes a part of the price. If the people do not like it at that price, they refuse it; they are not obliged to pay it. But an internal tax is forced from the people without their consent if not laid by their own representatives. The Stamp Act says we shall have no commerce, make no exchange of property with each other, neither purchase nor grant, nor recover debts; we shall neither marry nor make our wills, unless we pay such and such sums; and thus it is intended to extort our money from us or ruin us by the consequence of refusing to pay it.\"\n\u2014Benjamin Franklin, Examination before Parliament, 1766\nThe policy described most immediately led to\n\nA. peace between Indian tribes and white settlers.\nB. the forced removal of the Cherokee from their homeland.\nC. the first Treaty of Fort Laramie, which guaranteed Indian possession of lands west of the Mississippi River.\nD. a negotiated settlement between the tribes of the Southeast and the U.S. government, by which the tribes were allowed to remain on their lands for ten years.\n"

This issue was one of the key factors leading up to the American Revolution and did not directly relate to any of the options given regarding Native American tribes. However, the context of the passage suggests that the correct answer should relate to the relationship between the British Parliament and the American colonists. None of the options A, B, C, or D directly relate to the passage's context. However, since the question asks for the policy's most immediate effect, the closest in time and relevance would be related to colonial resistance against British taxation policies, which eventually led to the American Revolution.\n\nGiven the options provided, none of them accurately reflect the immediate consequences of the policy described. A more appropriate answer, if it were an option, would be something along the lines of increased tensions between the American colonies and the British government, leading to acts of protest and the eventual outbreak of the American Revolution. Since that option isn't available, the question as presented doesn't have a correct answer based on the information provided."
