Consuming carbohydrates during exercise can help maintain blood glucose levels and delay fatigue. Research suggests that consuming a combination of glucose and fructose (up to 90g per hour) can maximize carbohydrate oxidation rates and enhance endurance performance compared to consuming glucose alone. This is because glucose and fructose are absorbed through different transporters in the gut, allowing for a higher total carbohydrate uptake."
