Environmental change can be a cause of war between countries, largely centred on resource scarcity interrelated with conflict. There is therefore a strong connection between environmental degradation and violence; resources as strategic goals and strategic tools may cause violence if there is inequity.\nB. Population growth and its relationship to environmental degradation can lead to environmentally caused conflict. There is therefore a linear link between population growth and environmental change, and environmental change is the critical determinant in the production of violence.\nC. Common findings in research organizations investigating environmental violence have failed to find quantifiable relationships between environmental and social variables and the cause of war. Analysis of aggregated data failed to establish a common causal mechanism. The extensity of possible variables being simply too vast, mitigating any definitive relationship.\nD. Analysis of environmental violence research shows that there is a tendency among 'strong states' to be less prone to internal violent conflicts whereas states undergoing significant economic and political transitions are more prone to violent conflict. Environmental change is unlikely to be a cause of war but can be a contributory factor.\n"

Analysis of environmental violence research shows that there is a tendency among 'strong states' to be less prone to internal violent conflicts whereas states undergoing significant economic and political transitions are more prone to violent conflict. Environmental change is unlikely to be a cause of war but can be a contributory factor.\n\nWhile environmental change can contribute to conflict, it is not the sole or primary cause of war between countries. Strong states, which typically have more resources and stable political systems, are less likely to experience internal violent conflicts than states undergoing significant economic and political transitions. Environmental change can exacerbate existing tensions and contribute to conflict, particularly in areas where resources are scarce, but it is unlikely to be the sole cause of war. Research has shown that the relationship between environmental and social variables and the cause of war is complex and multifaceted, making it difficult to establish a common causal mechanism."
