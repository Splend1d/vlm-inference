As part of his scheme, the boyfriend enlisted his girlfriend, who agreed to drive the getaway car. On the day of the robbery, the girlfriend and the boyfriend drove to the bank. After the girlfriend parked outside and the boyfriend went into the bank, she saw a security guard in the bank and changed her mind and fled on foot, leaving the keys in the car with the motor running. A few minutes later, the boyfriend went into the bank, robbed it, and then ran back to the car. He drove off and was speeding away from the bank when he looked behind to see if he was being followed. As he took his eye off the road, the boyfriend's vehicle struck a pedestrian who was crossing the street, killing her. For the pedestrian's death, the girlfriend should be found guilty of which, if any, of the following crimes?\n\nA. Murder.\nB. Involuntary manslaughter.\nC. Voluntary manslaughter.\nD. No crime.\n"

Involuntary manslaughter.\n\nIn this scenario, the girlfriend is involved in the felony of bank robbery as an accessory before the fact because she helped plan the crime and provided the getaway car. Although she had second thoughts and left the scene before the robbery occurred, her initial involvement makes her complicit in the felony.\n\nThe death of the pedestrian during the commission of the felony (bank robbery) can trigger the \"felony murder rule\" or \"agency theory,\" under which anyone involved in the commission of a dangerous felony can be held responsible for any deaths that occur during the commission of that felony, even if they did not directly cause the death.\n\nHowever, since the girlfriend was not present at the time of the accident and did not cause the death directly, the charge would likely be involuntary manslaughter rather than murder. Involuntary manslaughter typically involves a death caused by reckless behavior or negligence, without intent to kill. Here, the girlfriend's involvement in the planning and preparation of the bank robbery, which led to the creation of a dangerous situation, could be seen as contributing to the death through negligence.\n\nIt's important to note that the specific charges and legal outcomes can vary significantly based on jurisdictional laws and the interpretation of those laws by the courts."
