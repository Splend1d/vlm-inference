Escape queries\n\nPreventing SQL injection primarily involves sanitizing user input and using parameterized queries or prepared statements, which effectively \"escape\" any potentially harmful characters in the input. This ensures that the data provided by the user is treated as literal values rather than executable SQL code.\n\nOption B (Interrupt requests) is not a direct method for preventing SQL injection but might be part of a broader security strategy to monitor and stop suspicious activities.\n\nOption C (Merge tables) has nothing to do with preventing SQL injection; it's a database design practice that may be used for various reasons unrelated to security.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer for preventing SQL injection is A. Escape queries, though it should be noted that using parameterized queries or prepared statements is the more modern and secure approach."
