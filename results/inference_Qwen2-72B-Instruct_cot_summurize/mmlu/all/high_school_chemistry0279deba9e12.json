The number of collisions per second (frequency of collisions)\nC. The energy of each collision (activation energy must be surpassed)\nD. The orientation of each collision (proper orientation is necessary for the reaction to proceed)\n\nHowever, the collision theory does not explicitly include:\n\nB. The transition state\n\nThe transition state is a concept from transition state theory, which is a more advanced theory used to explain reaction rates. The transition state refers to the highest energy point along the reaction pathway, where the reactants are converting into products. While the collision theory acknowledges that only a certain fraction of collisions have enough energy and proper orientation to lead to a reaction, it does not delve into the details of the transition state.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. the transition state."
