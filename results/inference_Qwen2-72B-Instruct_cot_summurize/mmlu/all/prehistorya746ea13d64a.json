The chinampas, also known as \"floating gardens,\" were created by constructing small rectangular areas on shallow lake beds and reinforcing them with mud, decaying vegetation, and other organic materials. This technique not only increased the amount of arable land but also enriched the soil, enabling multiple harvests per year. The use of terraces and irrigation systems further enhanced agricultural output in the region."
