Oxygen is instead consumed in the electron transport chain during oxidative phosphorylation, which occurs after the TCA cycle and generates ATP. The TCA cycle itself uses acetyl-CoA derived from pyruvate or fatty acids and produces carbon dioxide and high-energy electron carriers (NADH and FADH2) that are used in the electron transport chain."
