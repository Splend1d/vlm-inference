It has but established new classes, new conditions of oppression, new forms of struggle in place of the old ones. Our epoch, the epoch of the bourgeoisie, possesses, however, this distinctive feature: it has simplified the class antagonisms. Society as a whole is more and more splitting up into two great hostile camps, into two great classes, directly facing each other: Bourgeoisie and Proletariat.\nKarl Marx and Friedrich Engels, The Communist Manifesto, 1848\nThe Communist Manifesto can be understood as an example of the influence of which mode of modern European thinking?\n\nA.

This work is a foundational text of modern communism and is deeply influenced by materialism and economic determinism, both of which are central tenets of Marxist thought.\n\nMarx and Engels argue that the history of human societies can be understood through the lens of class struggle, driven by economic factors. They assert that the mode of production in any given society determines its social and political structures, leading to conflicts between different classes (e.g., the bourgeoisie and the proletariat). This perspective aligns with materialism, which posits that material conditions (such as economic relations) shape human consciousness and societal structures.\n\nEconomic determinism, another key concept in Marxism, suggests that economic factors are the primary drivers of historical change. According to Marx and Engels, the development of capitalism and the resulting class antagonisms were inevitable outcomes of historical processes governed by economic laws.\n\nThus, \"The Communist Manifesto\" exemplifies the influence of materialism and economic determinism on modern European thinking. These ideas contrast sharply with the other options listed, such as the Oxford Movement (a religious movement within the Church of England), Hegelian idealism (which emphasizes the role of the mind or spirit in shaping reality), and the rationalism of the Scottish Enlightenment (which focuses on reason and empirical evidence as sources of knowledge)."
