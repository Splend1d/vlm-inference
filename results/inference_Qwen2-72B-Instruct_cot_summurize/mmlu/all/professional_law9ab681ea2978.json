One night, while drinking at a bar, both brothers decided that they wanted a little more action than the bar was offering up, so they left and went to a strip club. At the strip club, they paid for private dances and attempted to have conversations with the women. As hard as they tried, the women who worked in the club did not seem as interested in the brothers as they were in the women. As the night wore on, the brothers decided that they would wait behind the club until closing for the women to come out. The victim, who had given a dance to one of the brothers, came out and proceeded to walk to her car. One of the brothers grabbed the victim from behind and pulled her to the ground while the other brother sexually assaulted her. Both brothers were arrested and charged with the rape of the victim. Their long-time family attorney represented them both at their trial. The younger brother intended to testify that his older brother had forced him to hold the victim down by threatening him with a gun. If appropriate objections are made by either brother, the court should rule that the attorney's representation of the brothers at trial\n\nA. violated the younger brother's Sixth Amendment right to counsel.\nB. constituted an impermissible conflict of interest.\nC. violated the younger brother's constitutional rights, but did not infringe on the older brother's constitutional rights.\nD. did not violate the older brother's constitutional rights if he separately paid for his representation.\n"

                    "text": "B. constituted an impermissible conflict of interest.\n\nThe situation described presents a clear conflict of interest for the attorney representing both brothers. The younger brother's defense strategy is to claim that he was coerced into participating in the crime by his older brother, which directly implicates the older brother. This creates a scenario where the interests of the two defendants are adverse, and the attorney cannot effectively represent both clients without compromising the legal rights and defenses of one or both of them.\n\nUnder professional conduct rules, lawyers are generally prohibited from representing multiple clients when there is a significant risk that the lawyer's responsibilities to one client will materially limit the lawyer's responsibilities to another client or to a third person, or when the representation of one client will be directly adverse to another client (Model Rule 1.7 of the American Bar Association Model Rules of Professional Conduct). Therefore, the attorney's representation of both brothers simultaneously constitutes an impermissible conflict of interest.\n\nAdditionally, this conflict could potentially impact both brothers' Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel, as the attorney may not be able to provide each brother with the zealous defense required under the Constitution due to the conflicting interests between the two clients. However, option A specifically refers to the younger brother's Sixth Amendment right, while B addresses the broader issue of conflict of interest affecting both defendants. Option C incorrectly suggests that the violation only affects the younger brother's rights, and option D implies that paying separately for representation would resolve the conflict of interest, which is not necessarily true."
