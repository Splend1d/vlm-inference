However, even after one follow-up visit the interviewer is unable to make contact with anyone in 8 of these homes. Concerned about nonresponse bias, the researcher picks another simple random sample and instructs the interviewer to keep trying until contact is made with someone in a total of 50 homes. The average number of children is determined to be 1.73. Is this estimate probably too low or too high?\n\nA. Too low, because of undercoverage bias.\nB. Too low, because convenience samples overestimate average results.\nC. Too high, because of undercoverage bias.\nD. Too high, because convenience samples overestimate average results.\n"

                    "text": "The scenario described involves nonresponse bias, which can lead to undercoverage bias if the characteristics of those who do not respond differ significantly from those who do. In this case, the researcher is concerned that the initial sample of 50 homes may not be representative due to the inability to make contact with 8 of them. To correct for this potential bias, the researcher decides to continue sampling until contact is made with 50 households.\n\nThe second approach does not necessarily result in a convenience sample, as the researcher is still using a simple random sampling method, albeit with the modification of ensuring contact is made with all selected households. Convenience sampling would involve selecting households based on ease of access rather than random selection.\n\nGiven that the researcher was concerned enough about nonresponse bias to modify the sampling method, it suggests that there might have been a reason to believe that the nonrespondents could have had a different average number of children compared to the respondents. If the nonrespondents (the 8 homes) had more children on average, then the initial estimate would have been too low. By continuing to sample until contact is made with 50 homes, the researcher is attempting to mitigate this bias.\n\nTherefore, without knowing the specifics of why the original 8 homes did not respond, we cannot definitively say whether the final estimate of 1.73 is too high or too low due to undercoverage bias. However, given the concern about nonresponse bias and the steps taken to address it, the most likely answer based on the information provided is:\n\nA. Too low, because of undercoverage bias.\n\nThis assumes that the nonrespondents were systematically different in a way that would have led to a higher average number of children if they had been included in the sample."
