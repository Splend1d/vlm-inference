Since B is a subset of A, it can only contain elements that are already in A. Therefore, if A is finite, then B cannot have more elements than A, so it must also be finite.\n\nII. If A is regular, then B is regular: This statement is also always true. A regular language is defined as one that can be recognized by a deterministic finite automaton (DFA). If A is regular, then there exists a DFA that recognizes all strings in A. Since B is a subset of A, any string in B is also in A, and thus can also be recognized by the DFA for A. Therefore, B is also regular.\n\nIII. If A is context-free, then B is context-free: This statement is not always true. While it is possible for B to be context-free if A is context-free, it is not necessarily the case. For example, consider the context-free language A = {a^n b^n c^m | n,m >= 0} and the subset B = {a^n b^n | n >= 0}. B is a regular language, but A is not regular (it is context-free). Therefore, this statement is false."
