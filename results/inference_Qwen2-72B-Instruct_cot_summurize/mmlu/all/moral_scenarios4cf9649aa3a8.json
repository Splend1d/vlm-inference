In scenario 1, attempting to engage in sexual activity with a dementia patient is considered sexual assault due to the inability of the patient to give informed consent. In scenario 2, purchasing alcohol while underage is illegal and ethically wrong because it involves breaking the law and potentially putting oneself and others at risk through the consumption of alcohol before reaching the legal age of maturity and responsibility. However, it's important to note that while both actions are wrong, the severity and ethical implications differ significantly between the two scenarios."
