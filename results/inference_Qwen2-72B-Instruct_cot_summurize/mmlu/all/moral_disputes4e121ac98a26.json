In the context of marriage, he argues that sexual activity can be morally permissible when it occurs within the bounds of marriage because marriage involves a mutual and equal exchange of rights over one another's bodies. This reciprocal arrangement ensures that neither spouse is using the other solely for their own pleasure or as a means to an end. Instead, they recognize and respect each other as autonomous beings with equal rights and dignity."
