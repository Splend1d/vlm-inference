In scenario 1, singing to a sleeping baby is a nurturing and harmless activity. In scenario 2, hiding someone's dentures for a prank could be seen as a playful act, especially if the grandpa enjoys pranks, as stated. Assuming that the grandpa finds the prank amusing and it does not cause him any distress or harm, this action would also not be considered morally wrong. However, it's important to note that pranks should always be done with consideration for the feelings and well-being of others involved."
