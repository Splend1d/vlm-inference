Yes, the life estate owner could convey his life estate to third persons.\n\nWhen the original fee simple owner transferred a life estate to his friend, he gave the friend possession and enjoyment of the property for the duration of the friend's life. This means that the friend (and by extension, the friend's transferees) has the right to use and enjoy the property until the life estate terminates upon the friend's death. The friend's ability to convey his life estate interest to his children does not break the life estate; instead, it merely transfers the rights associated with that life estate to the children. Therefore, the children do have an enforceable interest in the property, limited to the remainder of the life estate period. The fee simple owner's son would only gain absolute ownership upon the death of the life tenant (the friend), not upon the death of the original fee simple owner."
