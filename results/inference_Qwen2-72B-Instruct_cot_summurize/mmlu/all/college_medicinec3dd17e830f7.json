Decreasing impact of uncompetitive inhibitor and no change in impact of noncompetitive inhibitor.\n\nExplanation:\nIn uncompetitive inhibition, the inhibitor binds only to the enzyme-substrate complex, not to the free enzyme. Thus, at higher substrate concentrations, the formation of the enzyme-substrate complex is favored over the binding of the inhibitor to this complex, thereby reducing the impact of the uncompetitive inhibitor.\n\nIn contrast, in noncompetitive inhibition, the inhibitor binds to an allosteric site on the enzyme, which can occur regardless of whether the substrate is bound or not. Increasing the substrate concentration does not affect the binding of the noncompetitive inhibitor, so its impact remains unchanged. However, since the question seems to imply that the concentration of the inhibitor itself might change (as suggested by \"decreasing concentration of noncompetitive inhibitor\"), it's important to note that typically, the concentration of the inhibitor is not affected by changes in substrate concentration. The impact of the inhibitor on the reaction rate is what is being referred to here, not the actual physical concentration of the inhibitor in solution."
