It seems there might have been an oversight in how the problem was framed or the options provided. Given the setup and calculations based on standard finance principles, the correct response isn't listed among the options A to D.\n\nFor educational purposes, if we were to interpret the question as asking for the inverse of the exchange ratio (which could represent how many times cheaper company Y is relative to the proposed exchange rate), then the closest option would be:\n\n\\[ \\text{Inverse Exchange Ratio} = \\frac{1}{\\text{Exchange Ratio}} = \\frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \\]\n\nThis interpretation doesn't align with any of the provided options either. The closest option to the correct calculation (2) would not be listed in the given options. \n\nIf the question intended to ask for the ratio of the market prices before considering the exchange offer (essentially, how much more expensive Company X is than Company Y at current market prices), the calculation would be:\n\n\\[ \\frac{\\text{Price of Company X}}{\\text{Price of Company Y}} = \\frac{45}{30} = 1.5 \\]\n\nIn which case, the answer would be:\n\nD. 1.5"
