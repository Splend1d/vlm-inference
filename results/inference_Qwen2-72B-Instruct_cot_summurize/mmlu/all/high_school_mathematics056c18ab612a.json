Let's see if 54,321 is divisible by 121.\n\\[54,321 \\div 121 = 449\\]\nSince 449 is an integer, 121 is indeed a factor of 54,321.\n\nOption C: 18,107 - Let's check if this is a factor of 54,321.\n\\[54,321 \\div 18,107 = 3\\]\nSince 3 is an integer, 18,107 is also a factor of 54,321.\n\nOption D: 54,320 - This is one less than 54,321. Since 54,321 and 54,320 are consecutive integers, they cannot have any common factors other than 1. However, in the context of finding the largest factor of 54,321 that is less than 54,321, we should check if 54,321 is divisible by 54,320 + 1 (since dividing by 54,320 itself would give us 1).\n\\[54,321 \\div 54,320 = 1.000018...\\]\nThis is not an integer, so 54,320 is not a factor of 54,321 in the sense we are considering here.\n\nThe largest factor of 54,321 from the given options that is less than 54,321 is 18,107.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. 18,107"
