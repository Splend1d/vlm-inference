The results indicate that the test has low test-retest reliability.\n\nA psychometrician would likely conclude that the personality test has poor test-retest reliability because the results vary significantly when the same individual takes the test on different occasions. Test-retest reliability refers to the consistency of test scores over time, and in this case, the scores are not consistent, suggesting that the test may not be reliably measuring the construct it intends to measure (in this case, extroversion vs. introversion)."
