(P \u2022 ~B) \u2283 U - This formula suggests that if both the president approved of the tuition raise and the board didn't prevent it, then the university raised tuition. However, this formula does not capture the fact that the tuition raise happened before the president's approval and the board's non-prevention.\nB. (U \u2283 P) \u2022 B - This formula suggests that if the university raised tuition, then the president approved of it AND the board prevented it. This formula contradicts the original sentence, which states that the board did not prevent the tuition raise.\nC. U \u2283 (P \u2022 ~B) - This formula suggests that if the university raised tuition, then both the president approved of it AND the board didn't prevent it. This formula accurately captures the meaning of the original sentence.\nD. U \u2283 (P \u2228 ~B) - This formula suggests that if the university raised tuition, then either the president approved of it OR the board didn't prevent it. While this formula is not necessarily incorrect, it does not capture the fact that both conditions (president's approval and board's non-prevention) must be true for the tuition raise to have occurred. Therefore, option C is the best symbolization of the original sentence."
