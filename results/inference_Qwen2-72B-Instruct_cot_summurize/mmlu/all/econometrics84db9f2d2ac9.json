A model that is based on financial theory\n\nModels based on sound financial theory are more likely to have higher out-of-sample forecast accuracy because they incorporate underlying economic principles and relationships that are expected to hold over time. These models are less prone to overfitting the data and can better capture the true dynamics of the system being modeled, leading to more robust and reliable forecasts.\n\nWhile it's important to note that no single factor guarantees high forecast accuracy, models grounded in theory tend to be more stable and less subject to changes in market conditions or structural shifts in the economy compared to purely statistical models or those with too many variables (which can suffer from overfitting)."
