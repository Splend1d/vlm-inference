According to this theory, demand is more elastic above the current price because rivals will match a price decrease but not a price increase. This results in a demand curve that appears as two discontinuous segments, with a kink at the current price level. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. A demand curve consisting of two discontinuous segments."
