                    "text": "In the context of photoelectron spectroscopy, the binding energy of electrons in an atom corresponds to the energy required to remove (ionize) an electron from that particular orbital. The energy required increases with decreasing distance between the electron and the nucleus, as well as with increasing nuclear charge felt by the electron.\n\nFor carbon (atomic number 6), its electron configuration is \\(1s^2 2s^2 2p^2\\). Therefore, the electrons in the \\(1s\\) orbital are closest to the nucleus and experience the greatest nuclear attraction, making them the most difficult to remove. Conversely, the electrons in the \\(2p\\) orbitals are further from the nucleus and experience less nuclear attraction due to shielding by the inner electrons, making them easier to remove.\n\nGiven this information:\n\nA. The \\(1s\\) peak would have the highest energy (binding energy) because it requires the most energy to remove those electrons.\nB. The \\(2s\\) peak would have a lower energy than the \\(1s\\) peak but higher than the \\(2p\\) peak.\nC. The \\(2p\\) peak would have the lowest energy because these electrons are easiest to remove.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. The 2p peak has the lowest energy."
