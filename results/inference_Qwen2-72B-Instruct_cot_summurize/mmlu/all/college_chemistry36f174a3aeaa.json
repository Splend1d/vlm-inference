Most organic compounds do not contain silicon atoms.\n\nThis statement is true, but it is not a reason for using TMS as a reference. Rather, it is an advantage because the absence of silicon in most organic compounds ensures that there will be no interference with the signals of the compound being analyzed. The reasons for using TMS as a reference are A, B, and C."
