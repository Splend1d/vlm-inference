This is because at this point, the price reflects the true cost of producing an additional unit of the good or service, and it also reflects the value that consumers place on that additional unit. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. the marginal cost curve intersects the demand curve\n\nThis pricing strategy ensures that the quantity produced maximizes social welfare by balancing the costs of production with consumer willingness to pay. It's important to note that in a natural monopoly situation, average total cost (ATC) is typically decreasing over the relevant range of output due to economies of scale, so setting price equal to ATC would result in a price below the socially optimal level and could lead to underproduction."
