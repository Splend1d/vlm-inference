It allows these tribunals to focus their limited resources on the most serious and complex cases that truly require international intervention.\n\nB. **Preventing Abuse of the System**: By requiring individuals to first seek redress through local legal mechanisms, the rule discourages the filing of unnecessary or frivolous petitions at the international level. This maintains the integrity and effectiveness of international human rights bodies by ensuring they address genuine grievances that have been inadequately dealt with by domestic courts.\n\nC. **Building Capacity of Local Courts and Restricting Volume of Petitions**: The exhaustion requirement encourages the strengthening of local judicial systems. By compelling individuals to use domestic remedies, it promotes the development of local legal institutions and expertise in human rights law. Additionally, this helps manage the caseload of international tribunals, allowing them to handle cases that are beyond the scope or capability of national courts.\n\nOption D does not accurately represent the rationale behind the exhaustion of local remedies. While it may sometimes be true that national courts are well-suited to handle certain cases due to their familiarity with local context and law, the rule is not designed to assert the superiority of national courts over international ones in all circumstances. Instead, it aims to ensure that international mechanisms are used as a last resort when domestic remedies have proven inadequate."
