According to the problem statement, the length is twice the width, so we can write:\n\n\\[l = 2w\\]\n\nWe also know that the diagonal splits the rectangle into two right-angled triangles. By the Pythagorean theorem, the square of the diagonal (\\(d\\)) is equal to the sum of the squares of the length and the width:\n\n\\[d^2 = l^2 + w^2\\]\n\nGiven that the diagonal is \\(5\\sqrt{5}\\), we have:\n\n\\[(5\\sqrt{5})^2 = (2w)^2 + w^2\\]\n\nSolving for \\(w\\):\n\n\\[25 \\times 5 = 4w^2 + w^2\\]\n\n\\[125 = 5w^2\\]\n\n\\[w^2 = 25\\]\n\n\\[w = 5\\]\n\nSince \\(l = 2w\\), then:\n\n\\[l = 2 \\times 5 = 10\\]\n\nThe area of the rectangle is given by the product of its length and width:\n\n\\[Area = l \\times w = 10 \\times 5 = 50\\]\n\nThus, the correct answer is C. 50."
