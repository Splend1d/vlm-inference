This condition is also known as Turner syndrome. Monosomy refers to the condition where an individual is missing one copy of a chromosome in all cells.\n\nHere's a brief explanation of the other options:\n\nA. 46,XX: This represents a typical female karyotype with two X chromosomes.\nB. 47,XXX: This indicates an extra X chromosome in addition to the normal pair, resulting in three X chromosomes, a condition called Triple X syndrome.\nC. 69,XYY: This shows an individual has two extra Y chromosomes in addition to the normal XY pair, resulting in a total of 69 chromosomes instead of the usual 46. This is a case of polysomy, not monosomy."
