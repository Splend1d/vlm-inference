The ex-con went ahead and planned the robbery. As part of his scheme, the ex-con stole a van, which he intended to use as the getaway vehicle. According to the ex-con's plan, he would pick up the two men in the van on Friday morning and drive over to the bank where the robbery would occur. The ex-con instructed his cohort that he would be the getaway driver and wait in the van while they entered the bank, armed with shotguns. However, the day before the robbery was to take place, the excon was arrested on a parole violation for carrying a concealed weapon and was taken into custody. The two men, nevertheless, decided to carry out the robbery using the van that the ex-con had stolen. On Friday moming, the two men drove to the bank. When they entered, an undercover police detective was waiting and arrested the two men, as the police had received an anonymous tip regarding the robbery earlier that morning. The ex-con should be found guilty for which of the following crimes?\n\nA. Automobile theft and solicitation.\nB. Automobile theft and conspiracy.\nC. Automobile theft and attempted robbery.\nD. Automobile theft, conspiracy, and attempted robbery.\n"

                    "text": "The ex-con should be found guilty for D. Automobile theft, conspiracy, and attempted robbery.\n\nHere's why:\n\n1. **Automobile Theft**: The ex-con stole a van, which is a clear case of automobile theft.\n\n2. **Conspiracy**: The ex-con planned the bank robbery with the two men, which constitutes a conspiracy to commit a crime. Even though the ex-con was not present during the actual robbery attempt, the agreement and planning stages are enough to charge him with conspiracy.\n\n3. **Attempted Robbery**: Although the ex-con was not physically present at the bank when the attempted robbery took place, he played a significant role in planning it. In legal terms, an attempt can be charged if substantial steps have been taken toward committing the crime, even if the crime itself is not completed. Since the ex-con planned the robbery, stole the van to use as a getaway vehicle, and gave instructions to his cohorts, these actions could be considered substantial steps towards committing the robbery.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Automobile theft, conspiracy, and attempted robbery."
