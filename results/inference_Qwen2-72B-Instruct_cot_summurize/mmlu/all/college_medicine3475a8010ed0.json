                    "text": "The correct answer is C. H2O(s) has a lower density than H2O(l) which results from the crystalline framework that forms due to hydrogen bonds.\n\nThis unique property of water, where its solid form (ice) is less dense than its liquid form, is due to the structure of ice's crystal lattice. In ice, water molecules are arranged in a hexagonal lattice held together by hydrogen bonds, creating a structure with more open space compared to the closer-packed molecules in liquid water. This results in ice having a lower density than liquid water, which explains why ice floats.\n\nThe negative slope of the liquid-solid equilibrium line in the phase diagram for water indicates that as pressure increases, the melting point of ice decreases. This occurs because applying pressure can disrupt the open, less dense structure of ice and force it into a more compact state, allowing it to transition back into liquid water at lower temperatures than would be possible under lower pressures. This phenomenon is also known as the \"pressure melting\" effect."
