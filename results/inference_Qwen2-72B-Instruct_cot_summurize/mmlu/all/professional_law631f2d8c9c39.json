He has run up debts that he did not tell her about, and so he uses his interest in the property to secretly get a mortgage from the bank. When he dies, the bank attempts to execute on the mortgage. Can it do so? Apply the majority view on this issue.\n\nA. No, the mortgage lien could not destroy the joint tenancy, and when the partner dies, the property passes by operation of law to the surviving joint tenant.\nB. No, although the mortgage destroyed the joint tenancy, the bank has to get a deed of trust in order to execute on jointly owned property.\nC. Yes, the bank got title to the property by virtue of the mortgage, which destroyed the joint tenancy, and it can execute on its lien.\nD. Yes, the mortgage was the equivalent of a deed of trust and the joint tenancy was severed by the mortgage lien, giving the bank unfettered legal authority to execute on its mortgage.\n"

The majority view is that upon the death of the mortgaging tenant, the surviving joint tenant takes the property free and clear of the mortgage lien because the joint tenancy includes the right of survivorship.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. No, the mortgage lien could not destroy the joint tenancy, and when the partner dies, the property passes by operation of law to the surviving joint tenant."
