Acts jure gestionis are those undertaken by States in a private capacity.\n\nJure gestionis refers to acts performed by a state or its agencies in a commercial or private capacity, as opposed to jure imperii, which refers to acts performed in exercise of sovereign authority. When a state engages in activities that could be carried out by a private individual or corporation, such as entering into contracts for the purchase of goods or services, these are considered acts jure gestionis. This distinction is important in international law because it affects the application of state immunity and other legal principles. Options B, C, and D are incorrect generalizations or misunderstandings of the concept."
