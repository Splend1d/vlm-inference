Securing the sustainable development of the state was dependent on societal security as an independent interest that was not secondary or dependent on the other sectors, including the military.\nB. The end of the Cold War allowed security studies to move beyond the confines of the dominant realist and neorealist perspectives, with an emerging interest in other, non-military, conceptions of security. Those who wished to broaden the scope of security studies advocated the inclusion of resource, environment, and other referent points for analysis.\nC. Societal security referred to the sustainable development of traditional patterns of military capabilities. Military threats could be subdivided to include the infrastructural strength, the technology, personnel, the economic base and the political base of the military security sector.\nD. Contemporary processes of globalization and societal conflict required the development of new conceptual tools beyond the state as the referent object. Security was dependent on factors beyond geographically conceived survival: survival of the state was superseded by survival of the nation (ethnic) state.\n"

                    "text": "Buzan's concept of 'societal security' marks a departure from traditional understandings of security in several ways:\n\n1. **Expansion of the Referent Object**: Traditional security studies primarily focused on the state as the main referent object, with military power seen as the primary means of ensuring its survival. Buzan's societal security broadens this focus to include the survival of societies and their cultural identities. This shift recognizes that threats to societal identity can be as significant as military threats to the state.\n\n2. **Inclusion of Non-Military Threats**: Buzan's approach moves beyond the military-centric view of security. It includes environmental, economic, political, and social issues as potential sources of insecurity. This is a significant departure from the traditional emphasis on military capabilities and interstate conflict.\n\n3. **Sustainable Development of Society**: Societal security emphasizes the need for sustainable development within societies. This goes beyond the mere survival of the state to consider the well-being and continuity of societal structures, norms, and values. It suggests that security should not just be about defending against external threats but also about fostering internal resilience and adaptability.\n\n4. **Globalization and Identity Threats**: In the context of globalization, societal security acknowledges the challenges posed by transnational processes that can threaten the cohesion and identity of communities. This includes migration, cultural diffusion, and economic integration, which may lead to feelings of insecurity among populations concerned about preserving their distinctiveness.\n\n5. **Beyond Geographical Survival**: Buzan's concept recognizes that security is not solely about the physical survival of a territory but also about the survival of the nation-state in terms of its ethnic, cultural, and social fabric. This perspective shifts the focus from the state's geographical boundaries to the identity and continuity of the people it represents.\n\nIn summary, Buzan's societal security concept challenges traditional views by advocating for a more comprehensive understanding of what constitutes a threat to a society's well-being and by emphasizing the importance of non-military factors in ensuring long-term stability and security."
