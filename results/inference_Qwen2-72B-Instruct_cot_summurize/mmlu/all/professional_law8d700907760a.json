The shop owner sought $100,000 in damages for allegedly defective goods that the distributor had provided under the contract. The distributor is incorporated in State B, with its principal place of business in State C. The distributor brought in as a third-party defendant the wholesaler that had provided the goods to the distributor, alleging that the wholesaler had a duty to indemnify the distributor for any damages recovered by the shop owner. The wholesaler is incorporated in State B, with its principal place of business in State A. The wholesaler has asserted a $60,000 counterclaim against the distributor for payment for the goods at issue, and the distributor has moved to dismiss the counterclaim for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. Should the motion to dismiss be granted?\n\nA. No, because the wholesaler's and the distributor's principal places of business are diverse.\nB. No, because there is supplemental jurisdiction over the wholesaler's counterclaim.\nC. Yes, because there is no diversity of citizenship between the distributor and the wholesaler.\nD. Yes, because there is no diversity of citizenship between the shop owner and the wholesaler.\n"

No, because there is supplemental jurisdiction over the wholesaler's counterclaim.\n\nThe original case involving the shop owner and the distributor falls under diversity jurisdiction since they are from different states and the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000. The third-party claim brought by the distributor against the wholesaler, and the counterclaim by the wholesaler against the distributor, are related to the main action and arise out of the same case or controversy. Therefore, the court has supplemental jurisdiction over these claims under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367(a), even if there is no independent basis for jurisdiction between the third parties."
