Let's denote these sides as \\(a = b = 1\\). The included angle \\(C\\) is the angle at the center of the circle formed by the two radii.\n\nThus, the area \\(A\\) of the triangle becomes:\n\\[A = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot \\sin(C) = \\frac{1}{2}\\sin(C)\\]\n\nTo maximize the area, we want to maximize \\(\\sin(C)\\). The maximum value of \\(\\sin(C)\\) occurs when \\(C = 90^\\circ\\) or \\(\\pi/2\\) radians, at which point \\(\\sin(C) = 1\\).\n\nTherefore, the greatest possible area of such a triangle is:\n\\[A = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 1 = \\frac{1}{2}\\]\n\nSo, the correct answer is **A. 1/2**."
