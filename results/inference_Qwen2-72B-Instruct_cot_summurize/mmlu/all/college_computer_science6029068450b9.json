This is achieved by swapping pages in and out of physical memory as needed during program execution, which allows for the illusion of having more memory than is physically available.\n\nHowever, statement II is not necessarily true. In a virtual memory system, programs do not need to be fully resident in main memory throughout their entire execution. Only the pages that are currently needed are kept in physical memory, while others can be swapped out to secondary storage like a hard disk.\n\nStatement III is also not true. Pages in a virtual memory system are typically fixed-size blocks used for memory management and do not necessarily correspond to semantic characteristics of the program such as functions or data structures."
