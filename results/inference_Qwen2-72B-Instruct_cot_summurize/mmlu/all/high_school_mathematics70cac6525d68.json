                    "text": "This problem involves exponential decay, which is common in processes like radioactive decay or, as in this case, contaminant removal. The rate of removal is proportional to the amount of contaminant remaining, which suggests an exponential relationship.\n\nLet's denote:\n- \\(P_0\\) as the initial percentage of contaminant,\n- \\(P(t)\\) as the percentage of contaminant remaining after time \\(t\\),\n- \\(k\\) as the constant of proportionality for the removal rate.\n\nThe differential equation that describes such a process is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{dP}{dt} = -kP \\]\n\nSolving this differential equation gives us the exponential decay formula:\n\n\\[ P(t) = P_0 e^{-kt} \\]\n\nWe're given that 20% of the contaminant can be removed during the first minute of the process. This means that after one minute, 80% of the contaminant remains (i.e., \\(P(1) = 0.8P_0\\)).\n\nSubstituting into our decay formula:\n\n\\[ 0.8P_0 = P_0 e^{-k \\cdot 1} \\]\n\n\\[ 0.8 = e^{-k} \\]\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\n\\[ \\ln(0.8) = -k \\]\n\n\\[ k = -\\ln(0.8) \\approx 0.22314 \\text{ per minute} \\]\n\nNow, we need to find the time it takes to reduce the contaminant to 2% of its original amount (since 98% must be removed). We set \\(P(t) = 0.02P_0\\) and solve for \\(t\\):\n\n\\[ 0.02P_0 = P_0 e^{-0.22314t} \\]\n\n\\[ 0.02 = e^{-0.22314t} \\]\n\n\\[ \\ln(0.02) = -0.22314t \\]\n\n\\[ t = \\frac{\\ln(0.02)}{-0.22314} \\]\n\n\\[ t \\approx \\frac{-3.91202}{-0.22314} \\approx 17.53 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nSo, the closest answer choice is:\n\nC. 18 min"
