However, the amount of ATP stored is quite limited. The ATP stored in muscles can only supply energy for approximately 2-3 seconds of intense activity before it needs to be replenished through other metabolic pathways such as glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation.\n\nSo the correct answer would be:\n\nB. 2 seconds. \n\nBut it's important to note that this duration can slightly vary depending on factors like the individual's fitness level and the type of muscle fibers being used. However, for most people, the ATP stores will last around 2-3 seconds during maximal effort activities."
