Plugging in the given values:\n\n\\[ KE = \\frac{1}{2}(0.30\\,kg)(0.040\\,m/s)^2 = \\frac{1}{2}(0.30)(0.0016) = 0.00024\\,J = 0.24\\,mJ \\]\n\nThe potential energy of the spring at maximum displacement (\\(x = 0.030\\,m\\)) can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[ PE = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2 \\]\n\nwhere \\(k\\) is the spring constant and \\(x\\) is the displacement from the equilibrium position. We don't know \\(k\\) directly, but we can use the fact that the total mechanical energy is conserved in the absence of friction. This means that the potential energy at maximum displacement equals the kinetic energy at the equilibrium position.\n\nTherefore,\n\n\\[ PE_{max} = KE_{eq} = 0.24\\,mJ \\]\n\nSo, the total mechanical energy of the system, which is the sum of the potential and kinetic energies, is:\n\n\\[ E_{total} = KE + PE_{max} = 0.24\\,mJ + 0.24\\,mJ = 0.48\\,mJ \\]\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\nC. 0.48 mJ"
