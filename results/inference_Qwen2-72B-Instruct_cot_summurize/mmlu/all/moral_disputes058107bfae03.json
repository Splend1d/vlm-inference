This domination does not necessarily stem from overt coercion (option C) but from the unequal power dynamics in the relationship that may lead to feelings of obligation or fear of consequences if they refuse sexual advances. This situation does not necessarily imply that they have neglected steps towards self-sustenance (option A), although such dependence could be a factor. Option D is incorrect because one of the reasons listed does apply according to West's account."
