This means that in option A, even if x is not a CEO, the statement (\u2200y)(Py \u2022 Wxy) would still be true, which doesn't make sense.\n\nOption B has implication (\u2283) between Cx and the rest of the statement, which means that if x is not a CEO, the entire statement becomes vacuously true, which doesn't capture the intended meaning.\n\nOption D translates to \"For all x, if x is a person then there exists a y such that y is a CEO and x is wealthier than y,\" which doesn't capture the intended meaning of the original sentence."
