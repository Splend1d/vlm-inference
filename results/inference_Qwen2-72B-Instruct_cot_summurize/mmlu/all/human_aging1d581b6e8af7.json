Negative stereotypes about older memory\n\nResearch has shown that older adults often hold negative beliefs about their memory abilities, which can be more influenced by societal stereotypes about aging and memory decline than by their actual performance on memory tests. These stereotypes can lead to a self-fulfilling prophecy where older adults may perform worse due to the belief that they should have poor memory, rather than any inherent decline in their cognitive abilities."
