It will be located above the equilibrium price.\n\nA price floor is a minimum price set by the government that is above the equilibrium price in order to prevent the price from falling below a certain level. This is often done to protect producers or to maintain a certain standard of living for workers, such as with minimum wage laws. When a price floor is set above the equilibrium price, it can lead to surpluses because the quantity supplied exceeds the quantity demanded at that price."
