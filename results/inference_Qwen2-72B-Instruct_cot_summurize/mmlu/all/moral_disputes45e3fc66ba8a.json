In her view, certain forms of objectification can be permissible or even positive under specific circumstances. She challenges the common assumption that all objectification is inherently negative and suggests that context plays a crucial role in determining whether an instance of objectification is problematic.\n\nIt is important to note that while Papadaki acknowledges that sexual objectification can sometimes be morally acceptable, she does not endorse all forms of objectification. Her position is nuanced, recognizing that the morality of objectification depends on factors such as consent, power dynamics, and the intentions behind the objectifying act.\n\nRegarding the other options:\n- Option B is a common understanding of objectification, but it does not represent Papadaki's specific stance.\n- Option C might be true in the sense that Papadaki could argue that sexual objectification cannot be fully explained or justified using only Kantian ethical principles, but this is not her primary argument.\n- Option D is also a typical criticism of objectification, but Papadaki's focus is more on the conditions under which objectification may or may not be problematic, rather than denying its potential to deny a person's humanity."
