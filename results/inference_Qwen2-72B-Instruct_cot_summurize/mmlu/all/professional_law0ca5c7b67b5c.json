The defendant, who only had $8. 00 in his possession, saw that the game he wanted was selling for $10. 00 Realizing that he did not have enough money to pay for the game, he ripped the $10. 00 price tag off the box. While no one was looking, the defendant then took the $7. 00 sticker from another game and placed it on the box. He then purchased the game for $7. 00 and walked out of the store.

In this case, the defendant intentionally misrepresented the price of the game by switching the price tags, thus deceiving the store into accepting less money than the item's actual price. This act is considered fraud and falls under the crime of false pretenses. \n\nWhile some elements of other crimes might be present (such as conversion or deceit), false pretenses most accurately describes the defendant's actions in this scenario. However, it's worth noting that laws can vary by jurisdiction, and the specific charges might depend on local statutes."
