Since he did not fulfill the university residency requirement, the student was required to pay $1,800 tuition each semester, which was $400 more than the tuition of state resident-students. In an action by the student challenging the constitutionality of the provision governing the determination of residency for the purpose of fixing a fee differential for out-of-state students in public college, the court will most likely declare the provision\n\nA. unconstitutional, because it constitutes a violation of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nB. unconstitutional, because it constitutes a violation of the privileges and immunities clause of Article IV, Section 2.\nC. constitutional, because the fee differential promotes a compelling state interest.\nD. constitutional, because the provision does not trigger strict scrutiny.\n"

Instead, the court would apply rational basis review, under which the residency requirement could be upheld if it is rationally related to a legitimate government interest, such as encouraging state residency and reducing costs for state residents. The provision does not violate the Equal Protection Clause or the Privileges and Immunities Clause, as it serves a legitimate state interest and does not unduly burden interstate commerce or discriminate against nonresidents without a reasonable justification."
