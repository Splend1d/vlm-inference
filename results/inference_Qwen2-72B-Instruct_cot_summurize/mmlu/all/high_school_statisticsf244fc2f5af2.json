The z-score for the top 20% can be found using a standard normal distribution table or a calculator function for the inverse cumulative distribution function. The z-score that corresponds to a cumulative probability of 0.8 (which means 20% of the distribution is above this point) is approximately +0.84.\n\nGiven a normal distribution with a mean (\\(\\mu\\)) of 600 and a standard deviation (\\(\\sigma\\)) of 15, the formula for finding the value corresponding to a particular z-score is:\n\n\\[X = \\mu + Z\\sigma\\]\n\nwhere \\(X\\) is the value we're trying to find, \\(Z\\) is the z-score, \\(\\mu\\) is the mean, and \\(\\sigma\\) is the standard deviation.\n\nSubstituting the given values into the formula gives us:\n\n\\[X = 600 + 0.84 \\times 15\\]\n\\[X = 600 + 12.6\\]\n\\[X = 612.6\\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. 612.6."
