Selye's general adaptation syndrome\n\nSelye's general adaptation syndrome (GAS) describes the body's response to stress, which includes three stages: alarm, resistance, and exhaustion. In this scenario, Conrad's body is responding to the stress of preparing for finals. During the alarm stage, his body would have started to respond to the initial stress of making a study schedule and reviewing his notes. As he increased his study hours, his body would have entered the resistance phase, trying to cope with the ongoing stress. After the exams, during the exhaustion phase, his body's resources may have been depleted, leaving him vulnerable to illness, such as the flu. This sequence of events aligns well with Selye's GAS theory."
