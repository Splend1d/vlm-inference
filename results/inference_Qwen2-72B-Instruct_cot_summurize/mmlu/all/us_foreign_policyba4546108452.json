After the American Revolution in 1776, Americans believed that they could create a new kind of empire, one that was not based on the traditional European model of centralized power and control. Instead, they envisioned an \"empire of liberty\" where individual states would have significant autonomy and freedom within a larger union. This idea was enshrined in the Declaration of Independence, which proclaimed that all men were created equal and entitled to certain unalienable rights, including life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. The concept of an \"empire of liberty\" helped to shape the early development of the United States as a nation, and it remains a central part of American political ideology today. While options B, C, and D may have been aspirations or goals for some Americans at various points in history, they were not the primary reason why Americans believed they could found a different kind of empire after 1776."
