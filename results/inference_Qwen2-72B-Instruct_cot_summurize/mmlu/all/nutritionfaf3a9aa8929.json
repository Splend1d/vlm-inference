Bariatric surgery can be considered a treatment option for mild cases\n\nBariatric surgery is typically reserved for individuals with severe obesity who have not been able to achieve substantial and sustained weight loss through nonsurgical methods. It is not considered a first-line or appropriate treatment for mild cases of Binge Eating Disorder (BED) or obesity. Bariatric surgery involves significant risks and lifestyle changes, and is generally recommended for people with a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 40 or greater, or a BMI of 35 or greater with obesity-related health problems.\n\nWhile bariatric surgery may be an option for some individuals with BED who also have severe obesity, it is not a treatment specifically targeted at the psychological aspects of BED. Treatment for BED often includes cognitive-behavioral therapy, medication, and nutritional counseling to address the underlying issues contributing to binge eating behaviors."
