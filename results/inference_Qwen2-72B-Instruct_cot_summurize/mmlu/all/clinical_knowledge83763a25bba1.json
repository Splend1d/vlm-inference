Bell's palsy is actually a lower motor neurone lesion, not an upper motor neurone lesion.\nB. This statement is also incorrect. Ramsay Hunt Syndrome is indeed caused by a Herpes Zoster infection, but it affects the facial nerve (VII cranial nerve) at the level of the geniculate ganglion, which is a lower motor neurone lesion.\nD. This statement is incorrect. In Bell's Palsy, the sense of taste can be affected as the facial nerve carries taste sensations from the anterior two-thirds of the tongue. About 30% of patients with Bell's palsy may experience some degree of altered taste sensation."
