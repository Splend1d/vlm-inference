I come to place before the Legislature of Massachusetts the condition of the miserable, the desolate, the outcast. I come as the advocate of helpless, forgotten, insane and idiotic men and women; of beings, sunk to a condition from which the most unconcerned would start with real horror; of beings wretched in our Prisons, and more wretched in our Alms-Houses. . . .\n\"If my pictures are displeasing, coarse, and severe, my subjects, it must be recollected, offer no tranquil, refined, or composing features. The condition of human beings, reduced to the extremest states of degradation and misery, cannot be exhibited in softened language, or adorn a polished page.\n\"I proceed, Gentlemen, briefly to call your attention to the present state of Insane Persons confined within this Commonwealth, in cages, closets, cellars, stalls, pens! Chained, naked, beaten with rods, and lashed into obedience!\"\n\u2014Dorothea Dix, \"Memorial to the Massachusetts Legislature\" (1843)\nDorothea Dix's testimony to the Massachusetts legislature reflects the influence of which of the following?\n\nA. Social Darwinism.\nB. The Second Great Awakening.\nC. Second-wave feminism.\nD. The Christian Science movement.\n"

The Second Great Awakening.\n\nDorothea Dix's advocacy for the humane treatment of the mentally ill and her appeals to the moral conscience of the Massachusetts legislature reflect the influence of the Second Great Awakening. This religious revival in the early 19th century emphasized personal salvation, the improvement of society through moral reform, and the importance of addressing social issues such as poverty, slavery, and the treatment of the mentally ill. Dix's impassioned plea for the welfare of the \"miserable, the desolate, the outcast\" aligns with the humanitarian and reformist ideals promoted during the Second Great Awakening."
