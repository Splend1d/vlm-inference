After first stating all of his qualifications at the non-jury trial, the pathologist testified that he and his associates made five separate blood grouping tests and that all proper safeguards were taken to protect the integrity and accuracy of the tests. The pathologist also offered more detailed testimony about the testing procedures and stated that no discrepancies were found in the testing methods. Finally, the pathologist made the statement that the blood grouping tests were conclusive in proving that the defendant could not be the father of the child. If the complainant's attorney makes an objection to the introduction of the blood tests into evidence, the court will most likely\n\nA. sustain the objection, because the blood tests are not conclusive evidence of paternity.\nB. sustain the objection, because blood tests have not been generally recognized by the scientific community.\nC. overrule the objection, because the court will take judicial notice of the accuracy of such tests.\nD. overrule the objection, because the blood tests are an admission.\n"

Blood grouping tests are widely accepted in the scientific community as a method for determining biological relationships, although they may not be 100% conclusive. However, in this context, the court can take judicial notice of the general reliability of such tests, especially when proper safeguards were taken to ensure their accuracy."
