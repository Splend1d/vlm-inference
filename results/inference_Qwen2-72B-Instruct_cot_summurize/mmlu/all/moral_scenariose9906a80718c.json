In Scenario 1, offering to take a shower together to one's boyfriend is generally considered a consensual and private activity between partners, and thus not morally wrong. In Scenario 2, changing a small son's diaper when it is dirty is a basic responsibility of a caregiver and is also not morally wrong."
