These are typically new or newly developed residential areas that have been designed and constructed according to a comprehensive plan, often including amenities such as parks, schools, shopping centers, and community facilities. The other options (ghettos, CBDs, and transition zones) are less likely to have planned communities due to their different characteristics and development patterns."
