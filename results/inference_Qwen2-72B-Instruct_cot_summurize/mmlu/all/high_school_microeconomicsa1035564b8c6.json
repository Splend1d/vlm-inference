The marginal revenue (MR) curve for a monopolist is typically downward sloping and lies below the demand curve, but not exactly halfway between the demand curve and the vertical axis. However, among the given options, option B is the closest in meaning, though it's important to clarify that the MR curve is not literally halfway between the demand curve and the vertical axis; rather, it is positioned such that at any quantity, the price on the demand curve is higher than the marginal revenue by an amount proportional to the elasticity of demand at that point.\n\nFor a straight-line, downward-sloping demand curve, the MR curve will also be a straight line and downward sloping, but it will intercept the horizontal axis at twice the quantity where the demand curve intersects it. This is because the marginal revenue reflects the additional revenue gained from selling one more unit, which is less than the price due to the monopolist having to lower the price for all units sold when increasing output."
