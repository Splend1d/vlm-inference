False, True\n\nIndustrial-scale neural networks are often trained on GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) rather than CPUs (Central Processing Units) because GPUs are better suited for the parallel processing required for training large neural networks. The ResNet-50 model does indeed have over 1 billion parameters, but this is actually incorrect; ResNet-50 has about 25 million parameters, not over 1 billion. Therefore, if we consider \"over 1 billion parameters\" as false, the correct answer would be D. False, False. However, since one of the options must be true according to the given choices, the closest correct answer based on common misconceptions would be D. False, True, acknowledging that the parameter count statement is also false but not provided as an option."
