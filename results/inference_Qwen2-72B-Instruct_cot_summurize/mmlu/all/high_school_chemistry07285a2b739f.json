Let's analyze each pair:\n\nA. Water (H2O) and methanol (CH3OH): Both are polar solvents, and \"like dissolves like.\" They are miscible due to hydrogen bonding.\n\nB. Benzene (C6H6) and dodecane (C12H26): Both are non-polar, hydrocarbon-based solvents. Since they have similar properties, they should be miscible with each other.\n\nC. Decane (C10H22) and 1-propanol (CH2CH2CH2OH): Decane is a non-polar hydrocarbon while 1-propanol has a polar hydroxyl group. However, 1-propanol is not as polar as water and can still form hydrogen bonds with the hydrocarbon chains. They are likely to be miscible, although the solubility might decrease with increasing chain length in the alcohol.\n\nD. Ethylamine (CH3CH2NH2) and 1-propanol (CH3CH2CH2OH): Both have polar functional groups (amine and alcohol), which can form hydrogen bonds. They should be miscible.\n\nThe pair that is most likely to be immiscible based on the principle of polarity and solvating ability would be C. Decane (C10H22) and 1-propanol (CH2CH2CH2OH). However, it's worth noting that some mixing can still occur due to the nature of 1-propanol, but it may not be completely miscible, especially at higher concentrations or with longer alkane chains."
