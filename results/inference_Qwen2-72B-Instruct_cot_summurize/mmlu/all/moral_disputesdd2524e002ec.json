Both A and B. \n\nIn his article \"Capital Punishment, Human Dignity, and African Values,\" Thaddeus Metz argues that existing dignity-based arguments against capital punishment based on African values fail for two reasons. First, he contends that it is not clear that such arguments demonstrate that capital punishment is degrading and therefore wrong. Second, he argues that these arguments prove too much because they seem to entail that any instance of killing in self-defense is wrong."
