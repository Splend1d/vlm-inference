Special revenue Permanent\n\nHowever, there seems to be a mislabeling in the options provided since the description fits better with:\n\nTrust Fund A: Permanent Fund\nTrust Fund B: Special Revenue Fund\n\nTherefore, the intended answer might have been something along the lines of:\n\nTrust Fund A: Permanent\nTrust Fund B: Special Revenue\n\nBut based on the given options, C would be the closest choice, assuming it was meant to say \"Permanent\" for Trust Fund A and \"Special Revenue\" for Trust Fund B."
