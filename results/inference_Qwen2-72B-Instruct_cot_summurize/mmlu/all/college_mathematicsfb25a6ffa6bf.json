The maximum dimension that their sum \\(V + W\\) could have is 4 (the dimension of the whole space \\(\\mathbb{R}^4\\)), but it could also be less if \\(V\\) and \\(W\\) share a common direction (i.e., if their intersection has non-zero dimension).\n\nNow let's consider the possibilities for \\(\\dim(V \\cap W)\\):\n\n1. If \\(V\\) and \\(W\\) are identical, then \\(V = W\\) and their intersection is just \\(V\\) (or \\(W\\)), so \\(\\dim(V \\cap W) = 2\\).\n2. If \\(V\\) and \\(W\\) intersect in exactly one line (a 1-dimensional subspace), then \\(\\dim(V \\cap W) = 1\\).\n3. If \\(V\\) and \\(W\\) do not intersect except at the origin (which is always part of any subspace), then they are in \"general position,\" and \\(\\dim(V \\cap W) = 0\\).\n\nTherefore, the possible dimensions of \\(V \\cap W\\) are 0, 1, and 2.\n\nThe correct answer is D. 0, 1, and 2 only."
