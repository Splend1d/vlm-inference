Therefore, the new cross-sectional area \\(A'\\) is:\n\n\\[\nA' = \\pi \\left(\\frac{d}{4}\\right)^2 = \\frac{\\pi d^2}{16} = \\frac{1}{4} A\n\\]\n\nHalving the diameter reduces the cross-sectional area by a factor of 4. If the length of the conductor is also doubled, the new length \\(l'\\) is \\(2l\\).\n\nThus, the new resistance \\(R'\\) can be calculated as:\n\n\\[\nR' = \\rho \\frac{l'}{A'} = \\rho \\frac{2l}{\\frac{1}{4} A} = 2 \\cdot 4 \\rho \\frac{l}{A} = 8R\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nD. 8R \u03a9"
