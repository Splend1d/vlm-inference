In Scenario 1, protecting food from contamination is actually a positive action, ensuring that others can eat safely. In Scenario 2, pole dancing during an erotic show is not inherently morally wrong if it is consensual, legal, and part of a performance where all participants are adults and informed. The morality of the situation could depend on additional context, such as whether the venue and performers are operating legally and ethically, but based solely on the information provided, neither scenario describes an action that is clearly morally wrong."
