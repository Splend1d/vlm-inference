Environmental constraints can indeed limit conventional economic growth, leading to economic insecurity and potentially hindering development. This can exacerbate social tensions and inequalities, which are often precursors to conflict.\n\nB. Environmental changes, particularly those related to climate change, pose significant threats to land and resource availability. Rising sea levels, desertification, and altered precipitation patterns can force large-scale migrations, which can strain existing infrastructure, resources, and social structures, potentially leading to conflicts over territory and resources.\n\nC. Environmental degradation and increased demand for resources can lead to scarcity, which historically has been a factor in many conflicts. Competition over water, fertile land, and energy sources can escalate into violence, particularly in regions already experiencing political instability or social unrest.\n\nThus, all three points (A, B, and C) are valid concerns for peace researchers studying the impact of environmental issues in the context of global security and peace."
