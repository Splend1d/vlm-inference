The particles must have the same mass.\n\nExplanation:\nFor the net force between the two particles to be zero, the electric force (due to their charges) must be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to the gravitational force (due to their masses). This requires careful balancing of the charges and masses of the two particles, but it does not require the masses to be the same.\n\nA. The particles can indeed have the same sign of charge if the gravitational attraction exactly balances the electric repulsion.\n\nB. If the distance between the particles changes, the forces will change because both electric and gravitational forces depend on the distance. Therefore, the net force may no longer be zero.\n\nD. Such a situation is possible under certain conditions where the gravitational and electric forces balance each other out.\n\nTherefore, option C is the only statement that is NOT true."
