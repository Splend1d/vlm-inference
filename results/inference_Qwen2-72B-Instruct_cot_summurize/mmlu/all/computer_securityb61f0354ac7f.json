Authenticated\n\nA man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack can indeed jeopardize the security of the Diffie-Hellman key exchange method if the two parties involved in the communication are not properly authenticated. In such an attack, an eavesdropper intercepts the communications between two parties and can modify or relay messages, potentially allowing them to decrypt any data exchanged between the two parties.\n\nWithout proper authentication, the two parties may unknowingly establish a shared secret key with the attacker instead of with each other. This would enable the attacker to decrypt and read all the messages exchanged between the two parties, as well as potentially inject their own messages into the conversation.\n\nTherefore, it is crucial for both parties to authenticate each other before performing the Diffie-Hellman key exchange to prevent MITM attacks. This can be achieved through various means, such as using digital signatures, certificates, or pre-shared keys."
