Using a strong ferromagnetic material as the core of the electromagnet (like iron) also increases the magnetic field strength because such materials can be magnetized easily and amplify the magnetic field produced by the coil.\n\nWhile increasing the number of coils (not mentioned in option C but correct) and decreasing the diameter of the coil (not mentioned in any options and not necessarily true since it's more about the density of the turns rather than just the diameter) can also increase the magnetic field strength, among the given options, C is the correct answer. Option A is incorrect because fewer coils would decrease the magnetic field strength. Option B is incorrect because the diameter of the coil does not directly affect the magnetic field strength as much as the number of turns per unit length does. Option D is incorrect because using an air core instead of iron would actually decrease the magnetic field strength."
