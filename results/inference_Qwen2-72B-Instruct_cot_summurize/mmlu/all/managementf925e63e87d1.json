This is because the structure groups people based on their areas of expertise or function, such as marketing, finance, operations, and human resources. Each department focuses on its specific area, allowing for deeper skill development and expertise within that function. While teamwork, project work groups, and multi-skilled employees can exist within a functional structure, the primary characteristic it fosters is specialization."
