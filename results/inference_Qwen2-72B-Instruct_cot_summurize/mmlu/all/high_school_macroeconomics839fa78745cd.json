This decrease in supply is likely to lead to higher prices for sugar and products that use sugar. As a result, consumers may seek substitutes for sugar or products that use sugar, as option A suggests.\n\nSo the correct answer is:\n\nA. Consumers seek substitutes for sugar and products that use sugar."
