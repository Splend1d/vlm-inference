                    "text": "The question involves understanding Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium principles. According to Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, for a gene with two alleles, A (dominant) and a (recessive), the frequency of the dominant allele (p) plus the frequency of the recessive allele (q) equals 1 (p + q = 1). The frequency of the homozygous dominant genotype (AA) is p^2, the frequency of the homozygous recessive genotype (aa) is q^2, and the frequency of the heterozygous genotype (Aa) is 2pq.\n\nGiven that 4% of the population is black (recessive, aa), this means q^2 = 0.04. Taking the square root of both sides gives us q = 0.2.\n\nSince p + q = 1, we can find p by subtracting q from 1: p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8.\n\nThe frequency of the heterozygous condition (Aa) is given by 2pq. Substituting the values of p and q, we get:\n\n2pq = 2 * 0.8 * 0.2 = 0.32 or 32%.\n\nSo, the correct answer is B. 32 percent."
