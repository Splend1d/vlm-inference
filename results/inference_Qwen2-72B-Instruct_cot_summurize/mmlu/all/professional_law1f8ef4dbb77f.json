Paranoid because of a rash of recent robberies, the owner said, \"Please don't hurt me 11 do anything you want. \" The owner then fainted and fell to the floor.

In this case, even though the defendant did not explicitly threaten the owner, the owner's perception of the situation and his reaction (fainting) indicate that he was indeed placed in fear. The defendant's act of entering the store with a concealed weapon and his subsequent actions led to the owner feeling threatened, which satisfies one of the elements required for a robbery charge. Additionally, the defendant did take money from the cash register, which is considered part of the store and therefore could be seen as taking property from the victim's control."
