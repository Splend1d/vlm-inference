To explain the fact that planets sometimes appear to move westward rather than eastward relative to the stars in our sky.\n\nPtolemy's model, known as the Ptolemaic system, used epicycles (smaller circles) upon deferents (larger circles) to account for the observed retrograde motion of planets. This complex system was necessary in a geocentric model to explain why planets would occasionally slow down, stop, and then reverse their direction against the background stars before resuming their normal eastward motion. This phenomenon is actually caused by the Earth's own motion around the Sun, but in a geocentric framework, it required intricate explanations like the \"circles upon circles\" to maintain the apparent motion of the planets around Earth."
