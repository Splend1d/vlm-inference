Confidentiality, Integrity, Non repudiation and Authentication. \n\nHere's what each of these principles means:\n\n1. **Confidentiality**: Ensures that the information is accessible only to those authorized to have access.\n\n2. **Integrity**: Ensures that data has not been altered or tampered with during transmission from source to destination.\n\n3. **Non-repudiation**: Provides proof of the origin or delivery of data to prevent either the sender denying they sent a message or the receiver denying they received a message.\n\n4. **Authentication**: Verifies the identity of a user, process, or device, often in the context of login screens."
