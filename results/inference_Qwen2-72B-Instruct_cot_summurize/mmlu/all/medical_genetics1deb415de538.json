These markers help in identifying specific locations on chromosomes, which in turn aids in understanding genetic linkage and mapping genes associated with various traits or diseases. The Human Genome Project, completed in 2003, was a significant milestone in this field, providing a detailed map of the human genome and identifying over 20,000 protein-coding genes. This success would not have been possible without the extensive use of DNA markers."
