Instead, when all colors of light are combined, they create white light. However, in subtractive color mixing (as in pigments, dyes, and paints), black can be created by combining all colors or by mixing primary colors in equal amounts, which absorbs all wavelengths of light and reflects none, resulting in black. Option D could also be considered correct depending on the context of the question, as the precise answer depends on whether one is discussing additive or subtractive color mixing."
