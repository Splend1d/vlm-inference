The volunteer fire department in your community\n\nA public good is a product or service that is provided without profit to all members of a society, typically by the government or non-profit organizations. Public goods are non-excludable (meaning no one can be prevented from using them) and non-rivalrous (one person's use does not reduce availability to others). The volunteer fire department fits this description because it provides services to the entire community without directly charging individuals, and one person's use of the fire department's services does not diminish its ability to serve others."
