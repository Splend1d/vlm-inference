The bond agreement provided that for the first five years the stadium was in operation, at least $2 from each admission charge would be used to repay the bond debt. The bond agreement further stipulated that if the proceeds from the admission charges during the first five years were not sufficient to repay the bondholders, then at least $1 from each admission charge for the next five years would be applied to make the necessary bond payments. Assume that three years after the stadium had been in operation, a subsequent session of the state legislature passed a bill entirely prohibiting baseball because four players were killed in playing mishaps. This statute is probably\n\nA. constitutional, because it is a justifiable exercise of the state's police power.\nB. constitutional, because of the clear and present danger of baseball playing in the state.\nC. unconstitutional, because it impairs the obligation of the bondholders'contract.\nD. unconstitutional, because it violates the due process rights of the baseball team owners.\n"

Unconstitutional, because it impairs the obligation of the bondholders' contract.\n\nWhen the state issued bonds to finance the construction of the stadium, they entered into a contractual agreement with the bondholders. This agreement specified certain terms regarding the repayment of the bond debt, including the use of at least $2 from each admission charge for the first five years of the stadium's operation and at least $1 from each admission charge for the following five years if necessary. By passing legislation that prohibits baseball, thereby preventing any admission charges from being collected, the state would be unable to fulfill its contractual obligations to the bondholders. This would constitute an impairment of the obligation of contract, which is prohibited by the Contract Clause of the U.S. Constitution (Article I, Section 10).\n\nWhile states have broad police powers to regulate activities for the health, safety, and welfare of their citizens, these powers cannot be used to impair existing contractual obligations without running afoul of the Contract Clause. In this case, the prohibition of baseball would directly interfere with the state's ability to meet its financial commitments to the bondholders, potentially making the legislation unconstitutional."
