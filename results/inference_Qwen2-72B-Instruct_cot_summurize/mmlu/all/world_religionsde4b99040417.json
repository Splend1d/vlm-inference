Quakers.\n\nPuritans were a group of English Protestants in the 16th and 17th centuries who sought to \"purify\" the Church of England by eliminating all elements they believed to be Roman Catholic or unscriptural, such as vestments, altar rails, and even organs in churches. They also emphasized the importance of individual Bible study and rejected many traditional religious practices.\n\nQuakers, also known as the Religious Society of Friends, emerged in the mid-17th century in England and are known for their emphasis on simplicity, equality, and pacifism. They reject many traditional religious practices, including creeds, sacraments, and clergy, and instead focus on direct communion with God through silent worship and inner guidance from the Holy Spirit.\n\nBoth Puritans and Quakers can be seen as promoting a stripped-down Christianity, but if one must choose between the two options given, then D. Quakers would be the more accurate answer since they reject even more traditional religious practices than the Puritans did. However, it's important to note that there are many different Christian denominations and movements that emphasize simplicity and reject certain traditional practices, so the term \"stripped-down Christianity\" could apply to several groups beyond just Puritans and Quakers."
