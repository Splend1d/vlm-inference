This is known as the Yerkes-Dodson Law, which suggests that there is an optimal level of arousal for performance, and that too little or too much arousal can impair performance. In the context of schoolchildren, mild anxiety can motivate students to work harder and perform better, but excessive anxiety can interfere with learning and lead to poorer academic outcomes."
