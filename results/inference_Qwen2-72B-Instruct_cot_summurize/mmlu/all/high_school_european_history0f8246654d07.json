What shall I say of it now, when the words are put into my mouth, my hope of its destruction\u2014what shall I say of its supplanting by Socialism?\nWhat shall I say concerning its mastery of and its waste of mechanical power, its commonwealth so poor, its enemies of the commonwealth so rich, its stupendous organization\u2014for the misery of life! Its contempt of simple pleasures which everyone could enjoy but for its folly? Its eyeless vulgarity which has destroyed art, the one certain solace of labor? All this I felt then as now, but I did not know why it was so. The hope of the past times was gone, the struggles of mankind for many ages had produced nothing but this sordid, aimless, ugly confusion; the immediate future seemed to me likely to intensify all the present evils by sweeping away the last survivals of the days before the dull squalor of civilization had settled down on the world.\nThis was a bad lookout indeed, and, if I may mention myself as a personality and not as a mere type, especially so to a man of my disposition, careless of metaphysics and religion, as well as of scientific analysis, but with a deep love of the earth and the life on it, and a passion for the history of the past of mankind.\nWilliam Morris, How I Became a Socialist, 1896\nFrom the passage, one may infer that Morris\n\nA. chose to become a socialist because he was appalled by the great waste of resources and general misery caused by modern society\nB. chose to become a socialist because of the persuasiveness of Marx's arguments\nC. rejected socialism because it produced nothing but ugly confusion\nD. rejected socialism because of a deep love of the Earth and the life on it\n"

He felt that this civilization had supplanted socialism, which he presumably viewed as a more equitable and fulfilling system. His decision to become a socialist was driven by his hatred of the current social order and his hope for a better alternative. There is no mention of Marx's arguments influencing him, nor does he reject socialism; in fact, he expresses a desire for it to replace the existing system."
