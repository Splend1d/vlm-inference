They were unable to make use of interposition depth perception.\nB. They were unable to maintain perceptual constancy.\nC. They were unable to distinguish left from right monocular cues.\nD.

They were unable to use binocular cues for depth perception.\n\nThe experiment you described prevented the kittens from developing normal binocular vision, which is crucial for depth perception in animals that have eyes positioned to provide overlapping fields of view. As adults, these cats would likely have difficulties with depth perception because they wouldn't have had the opportunity to develop the neural mechanisms necessary for processing binocular cues, such as retinal disparity, which help in determining the distance of objects."
