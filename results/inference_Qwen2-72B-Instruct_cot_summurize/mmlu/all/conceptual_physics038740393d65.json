If there are one billion neutrons at the end of 10 minutes, then at the end of 9 minutes, there would have been half that amount because the number of neutrons doubles every minute.\n\nTherefore, the number of neutrons reached half a billion (500 million) at the end of 9 minutes.\n\nThe correct answer is D. 9 minutes."
