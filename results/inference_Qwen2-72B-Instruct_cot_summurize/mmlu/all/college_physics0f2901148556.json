                    "text": "The energy radiated by a blackbody (which a cavity in thermal equilibrium can be modeled as) is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n\n\\[P = \\sigma A T^4\\]\n\nwhere \\(P\\) is the power (energy per unit time), \\(\\sigma\\) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, \\(A\\) is the surface area of the blackbody, and \\(T\\) is its absolute temperature in Kelvin.\n\nIf the temperature is doubled, then the new power is:\n\n\\[P' = \\sigma A (2T)^4 = 16\\sigma A T^4 = 16P\\]\n\nThis means that the power (and thus the energy delivered per unit time) increases by a factor of 16 when the temperature is doubled.\n\nAssuming that all other factors remain constant (such as the efficiency of the melting process and the heat capacity of the ice), the mass of ice that can be melted in a fixed amount of time is directly proportional to the energy available for melting. Since the energy available has increased by a factor of 16, the mass of ice that can be melted also increases by a factor of 16.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\nD. 16"
