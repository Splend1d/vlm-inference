However, given the general trend of growth in the consultancy sector over the past few decades due to factors such as increased globalization, technological advancements, and demand for specialized expertise, it's reasonable to assume that there has been significant growth.\n\nIf we look at broader trends in professional services and consultancy sectors, it's plausible that the number could have more than doubled or even tripled over the last 25 years. For instance, according to a report by Oxford Economics and the Association of Consulting Actuaries, the consulting industry in the UK grew by an average of 6% per year between 2010 and 2017. If we extrapolate this growth rate back another decade and a half, it would indeed suggest substantial growth.\n\nHowever, without precise figures, we cannot confidently choose between options B, C, or D. Therefore, based on typical growth patterns, a reasonable guess might be option C (tripled), but this is speculative without concrete data."
