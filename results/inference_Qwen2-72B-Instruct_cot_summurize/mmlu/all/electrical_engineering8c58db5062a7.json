However, since your question specifies that the conductor is static and the field is varying, the closest match from your options would be:\n\nC. static induced emf.\n\nHowever, option C isn't typically used in standard electromagnetic theory terminology. The correct term for an EMF induced by a changing magnetic field (regardless of whether the conductor is moving) is based on Faraday's law of induction, which doesn't differentiate between \"dynamic\" and \"static\" in this context. So, the most accurate answer to your question might actually be:\n\nD. none of these\n\nBut if you must choose one, and considering the options provided, \"static induced emf\" (Option C) is the closest match to describe the scenario you've presented, even though it's not a standard term."
