The assignment would materially alter the duty of the obligor (option D).\n2. The assignment would increase the risk of the obligor.\n3. The assignment is prohibited by law (option B).\n4. The assignment involves personal services or skills, which cannot be delegated to another party.\n5. The assignment is of future rights from future contracts (option C).\n\nOption A does not describe a situation where the assignment is not allowed. If an assignment continues the obligor's duty or risk without altering it or increasing it, then the assignment is typically permissible."
