The player subsequently asserted a claim against the manufacturer of the helmet to recover damages for his injury. At trial, the player's attorney calls a former employee of the manufacturer to testify that three weeks after the player suffered his injury, the manufacturer devised a new design for its football helmets. The former employee's testimony is\n\nA. admissible as an admission.\nB. admissible as circumstantial evidence that the player's injury was traceable to the defective design of the football helmet.\nC. inadmissible, because of the public policy behind taking safety precautions.\nD. inadmissible, because the former employee is no longer authorized to speak on behalf of the manufacturer.\n"

This could potentially be used as circumstantial evidence that the original design was defective and contributed to the player's injury. However, it's important to note that such evidence would not be conclusive and would need to be considered alongside other evidence in the case. Additionally, under Federal Rules of Evidence Rule 407, evidence of subsequent remedial measures is generally not admissible to prove negligence or culpable conduct in connection with the event. But there are exceptions, including if the evidence is offered for another purpose, such as proving ownership, control, or the feasibility of precautionary measures, if contested, or rebutting a contention of undue delay."
