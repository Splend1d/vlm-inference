They do this not necessarily by being the most abundant species, but rather through their unique roles and impacts on the ecosystem. Keystone species often facilitate the coexistence of other species in the community by controlling the population of certain species, which in turn allows less competitive species to survive and thrive. This can involve predation, habitat modification, or other interactions that maintain biodiversity."
