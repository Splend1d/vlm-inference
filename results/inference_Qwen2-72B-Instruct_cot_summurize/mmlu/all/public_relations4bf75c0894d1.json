However, among the options provided:\n\nA. A politician - Can sue for libel; public figures like politicians have to meet a higher standard of proof (actual malice) in libel cases but are not barred from suing.\n\nB. A house of worship - Generally, religious institutions can sue for libel if the defamatory statement harms their reputation.\n\nC. A government institution - This entity often cannot sue for libel due to sovereign immunity, which protects government entities from being sued without their consent. Additionally, the rationale behind denying government bodies the right to sue for defamation is that they do not have a reputation that can be damaged in the same way an individual or private entity's can be.\n\nD. A publicly-traded company - Can sue for libel; corporations, including publicly-traded companies, can file lawsuits for defamation if they can show that false statements have harmed their reputation or business interests.\n\nTherefore, the entity that generally cannot sue for libel from the given options is:\n\nC. A government institution."
