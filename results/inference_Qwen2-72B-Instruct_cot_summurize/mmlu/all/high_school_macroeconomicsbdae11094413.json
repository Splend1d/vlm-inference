It is used to fight inflation by reducing government spending or increasing taxes, and to combat recessions by increasing government spending or cutting taxes. The goal is to stabilize the economy and achieve full employment and price stability. Fiscal policy can result in federal deficits if government spending exceeds tax revenues, but a deficit is not the definition of fiscal policy itself."
