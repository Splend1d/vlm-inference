Firms A and B are substitutes because the cross-price elasticity is greater than zero.\n\nExplanation: The cross-price elasticity of demand measures the responsiveness of the quantity demanded of one good (firm B's cell phone service) to a change in the price of another good (firm A's cell phone service). In this case, when the price of firm A's service rises, the quantity demanded for firm B's service increases. This indicates that the two services are substitutes, as consumers switch from the more expensive service (A) to the relatively cheaper alternative (B). Since the cross-price elasticity is positive (quantity demanded of B goes up when the price of A goes up), it confirms that the two services are substitutes."
