Global tourism has unfortunately been linked to increased rates of prostitution and sex tourism in some areas, particularly in developing countries where there may be less regulation and oversight. This is a serious issue that can have devastating consequences for individuals and communities. The other options listed are all potential consequences of global tourism. Developing countries can indeed depend on tourism as a crucial source of income, which can help boost their economies. However, this can also lead to the exploitation of cheap, unregulated labor in poor countries. Finally, global tourism has allowed us to become more aware of other societies and ways of living, which can promote cultural exchange and understanding."
