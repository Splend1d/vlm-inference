This does not necessarily mean that full-time work is not available in the occupations they want to enter or that part-time jobs pay higher wages. Instead, it implies that women make deliberate choices based on their values and priorities. However, it should be noted that this perspective has been criticized for potentially overlooking structural constraints and inequalities that can limit women's choices."
