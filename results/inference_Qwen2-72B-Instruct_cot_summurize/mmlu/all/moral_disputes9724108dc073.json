He argues that genetic enhancement technologies could lead to a commodification of human traits and undermine the intrinsic value of human beings as unique individuals. Therefore, the answer is D. none of the above. However, it's worth noting that Sandel does argue that genetic enhancement could exacerbate existing social inequalities and create new forms of discrimination, which could be seen as a form of unfairness."
