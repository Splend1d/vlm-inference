However, typically, LC oscillators are used for generating frequencies in the radio frequency (RF) range, which spans from about 3 kHz to 300 GHz.\n\nGiven the options you've provided, the most accurate answer would be:\n\nB. 100 KHz to 500 MHz\n\nThis is a common frequency range for many LC oscillators, covering everything from lower frequency AM radio up through higher frequency FM radio and into other RF applications. However, it's important to note that with proper design, LC oscillators can operate outside this range as well, potentially up to several GHz or down to lower kHz frequencies. But among the given choices, B is the best fit for typical applications."
