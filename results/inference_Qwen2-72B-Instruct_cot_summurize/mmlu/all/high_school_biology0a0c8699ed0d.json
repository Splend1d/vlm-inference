This means that they have diverged from this common ancestor for a shorter period of time compared to organisms that are less closely related. As a result, closely related organisms tend to have more similarities in their genetic makeup and physical characteristics than those that are distantly related. However, it does not necessarily mean that their habitats are more similar (option A) or that they have fewer differences in their DNA sequences or genes (options B and D), although there can be correlations with these factors depending on the specific evolutionary history of the species in question."
