This is often due to factors such as reduced processing speed, attention, and executive function. In contrast, implicit memory, which involves automatic influences of past experiences on current behavior without conscious awareness, generally remains stable across the adult lifespan. This includes skills and conditioned responses, which tend to be less affected by aging."
