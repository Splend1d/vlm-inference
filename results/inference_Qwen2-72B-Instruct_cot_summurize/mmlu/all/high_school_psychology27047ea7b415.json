They work together with other parts of the inner ear, such as the vestibular system, to detect changes in head position and movement. This information is then relayed to the brain, which uses it to coordinate eye movements and maintain posture and balance. The semicircular canals do not have any role in tone quality (related to sound), melatonin production (related to sleep-wake cycles), or olfaction (sense of smell)."
