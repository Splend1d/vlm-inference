The man was not aware of the ordinance.\nB. The city council enacted the ordinance after someone washing his car was hit by a passing truck.\nC.

The man was not aware of the ordinance.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that ignorance of the law is generally not a defense. Even if the man was unaware of the ordinance, he may still be held liable for negligence per se because the ordinance is in place to prevent exactly the kind of harm that occurred. Nonetheless, if the man can demonstrate that the ordinance was not reasonably known or accessible to him (which could be a stretch), it might potentially mitigate his liability. Still, the other options provided do not offer any legal defense against the claim of negligence per se."
