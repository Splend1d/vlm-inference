                    "text": "During intermittent high-intensity exercise, the body's demand for energy increases, leading to various metabolic responses including changes in blood glucose concentration. Initially, blood glucose may rise due to the release of counter-regulatory hormones such as adrenaline and cortisol, which stimulate glycogen breakdown and gluconeogenesis in the liver to increase blood glucose levels. However, as exercise continues, the muscles' demand for glucose increases, potentially leading to a decrease in blood glucose.\n\nFor most individuals, especially those who are well-hydrated and have adequate carbohydrate stores, blood glucose will remain relatively stable or may experience slight fluctuations within normal ranges during 80-90 minutes of intermittent high-intensity exercise. This is because the body has effective mechanisms to maintain blood glucose levels within a narrow range to ensure a continuous supply of energy to the brain and other vital organs.\n\nTherefore, the most likely answer to your question is:\n\nB. remains relatively unchanged.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that individual responses can vary based on factors such as fitness level, diet, hydration status, and the presence of any underlying medical conditions like diabetes. For individuals with diabetes, blood glucose management during exercise can be more complex and requires careful monitoring and adjustment of medication and nutrition strategies."
