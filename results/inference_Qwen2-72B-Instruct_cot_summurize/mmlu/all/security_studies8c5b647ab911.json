Military warfare enhances the ability of people's access to resources and to aid the development in ecologically sustainable ways; it can secure access routes and rights that would otherwise be denied; rebuild infrastructure and equitable access of resources; benefit the management of environmental problems; and also to bolster social institutions and cohesion.\nB. It is when considering the military and the security institutions that some of the greatest contradictions with the concept of environmental security are raised. War impacts negatively on the sustainable growth of the nation but armed forces may be required to manage the effects.\nC. Stronger militaries and technological advances have reduced the negative impact on the environment having greater impact with fewer materials, whilst the spectre of mass destruction warfare has been reduced with the ending of the Cold War.\nD. All of these options.\n"

In certain situations, military forces can play a role in securing access to resources and aiding development in environmentally sustainable ways. They can protect critical infrastructure, ensure the equitable distribution of resources, contribute to the management of environmental issues, and support social institutions.\n\nB. Warfare often has severe negative consequences for the environment, including pollution, habitat destruction, and depletion of natural resources. However, armed forces may also be necessary to manage the aftermath of conflicts and mitigate their environmental impacts.\n\nC. Modern militaries have sought to reduce their environmental footprint through technological advancements that allow for more efficient use of resources and reduced waste. The end of the Cold War has also lessened the threat of large-scale military conflicts, potentially leading to a decrease in environmental damage caused by warfare.\n\nThese points illustrate the complex relationship between armed forces and environmental security, where military actions can both harm and protect the environment under different circumstances."
