The rehabilitation and upbuilding of our countries will have little meaning. Our revolutions will not be allowed to run their course. What can we do? We can do much! We can inject the voice of reason into world affairs. We can mobilize all the spiritual, all the moral, all the political strength of Asia and Africa on the side of peace. Yes, we!

However, given the context of the time period (1955) and the fact that he was speaking at the Bandung Conference, which was a gathering of Asian and African states, it is most likely that the conflict being referred to is:\n\nC. the Cold War.\n\nSukarno and other leaders from the Global South sought to remain non-aligned during the Cold War, a global ideological and political struggle between the Western powers led by the United States and the Eastern bloc led by the Soviet Union. This non-aligned movement was an attempt to avoid being drawn into the superpower rivalry and to promote the interests of developing nations."
