An auto mechanic fixing his dentist\u2019s car for a filling\n\nThe service provided by the auto mechanic is a market transaction with an exchange of money, and thus it would be included in GDP calculations as it represents economic activity.\n\nB. A stay-at-home dad providing childcare for his children\n\nThis activity would not be included in GDP because it is non-market activity. There is no monetary transaction involved.\n\nC. A worker donating $200 to the Red Cross\n\nDonations to charitable organizations do not directly contribute to GDP since they are transfers of funds rather than transactions for goods or services.\n\nD. High school students spending their Saturdays building homes for the homeless\n\nVolunteer work does not count toward GDP because there is no payment for the labor. The value of the volunteer work is not measured in standard GDP calculations."
