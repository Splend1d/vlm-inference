Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)\n\nThis is because the description provided matches the process of PCR, where specific oligonucleotide primers (specific for CMV DNA in this case), thermostable DNA polymerase, and nucleotides are used to amplify a target DNA sequence through repetitive cycles of heating and cooling. The amplified DNA can then be detected by gel electrophoresis.\n\n- A. Northern blotting is used to detect RNA.\n- C. Reverse transcription is used to convert RNA into complementary DNA (cDNA).\n- D. Southern blotting is used to detect specific DNA sequences but does not involve the amplification step that PCR provides."
