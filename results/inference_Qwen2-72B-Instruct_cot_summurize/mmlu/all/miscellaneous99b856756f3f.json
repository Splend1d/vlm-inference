In this case, since the marginal utility of the last dollar spent on good Y (10) is higher than that for good X (5), Carmen is not maximizing her utility with her current consumption.\n\nTo correct this, she should shift her spending from good X to good Y until the marginal utility per dollar spent on both goods is equal. This means buying fewer units of X and more units of Y.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\nB. buy fewer units of X and more units of Y"
