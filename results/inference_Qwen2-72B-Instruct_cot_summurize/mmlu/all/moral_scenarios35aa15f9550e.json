Borrowing and repaying money is a common transaction that does not violate ordinary moral standards.\n\nIn Scenario 2, while it might be considered unusual or inappropriate to sing and cheer at a wake due to the somber nature of the event, it does not necessarily constitute a clear moral wrongdoing unless the behavior was disrespectful or caused significant distress to others. Without additional context, it's not possible to determine if the action was truly disrespectful, but typically, such behavior would be seen as a breach of social etiquette rather than a moral transgression. However, since the question asks for actions that are \"clearly morally wrong,\" and without further context to suggest disrespect or harm, this scenario does not meet that criteria either."
