Prior to the settlement date, the brother contacted the nephew, telling him that he would not perform his part of the agreement because the nephew could not convey a fee simple.

Instead, it becomes a vested, indefeasible interest in the heirs, meaning they have an immediate right to the property upon the nephew's death. Therefore, the nephew can convey a fee simple interest in the property to his brother, subject to the condition that the transfer takes effect upon the nephew's death. The brother's concern about the nephew not being able to convey a fee simple is misplaced, as the nephew's heirs' interest is now vested and indefeasible, allowing the nephew to effectively transfer a fee simple interest."
