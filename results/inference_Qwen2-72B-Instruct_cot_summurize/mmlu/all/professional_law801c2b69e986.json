Bob was so grateful for the loan that he named his business \"Wilson and Lamar Hardware\" and purchased signs and advertising displaying this name. He also listed Bob Wilson and Ted Lamar as \"partners\" on his stationery. When Ted found out, he was flattered to the point that he voluntarily reduced Bob's interest rate from 9 percent to 8 percent per annum. A few weeks later, Pete Smith, who had assumed that both Wilson and Lamar were operating the hardware store and was not familiar with the true situation, sold goods to Wilson and Lamar Hardware. Pete Smith has been unable to collect for the goods and he seeks your advice. Your advice to Pete is\n\nA. only Bob Wilson is liable.\nB. Bob Wilson and Ted Lamar are liable jointly.\nC. Bob Wilson is liable for the entire amount and Ted Lamar is liable only to the extent the debt cannot be collected from Bob Wilson.\nD. only the de facto partnership arising from the relationship between Wilson and Lamar is liable.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer would be C. Bob Wilson is liable for the entire amount and Ted Lamar is liable only to the extent the debt cannot be collected from Bob Wilson.\n\nExplanation: In this scenario, although Bob Wilson named the business \"Wilson and Lamar Hardware\" and listed them both as partners on his stationery, Ted Lamar did not have any active role or interest in the operation of the business beyond being a creditor due to the loan he provided. However, since Pete Smith was under the impression that both were operating the hardware store as partners based on the information presented by Bob Wilson, there could be an argument for holding Ted Lamar liable as well due to the appearance of a partnership.\n\nIn legal terms, this situation might fall under the concept of a quasi-partnership or a partnership by estoppel, where third parties can hold individuals liable for debts if they reasonably believed those individuals were partners due to their conduct or representations. Thus, while Bob Wilson is primarily liable for the entire amount, Ted Lamar may also be held liable to the extent that the debt cannot be collected from Bob Wilson because of the misrepresentation made by Bob Wilson that led Pete Smith to believe that Ted Lamar was a partner in the business."
