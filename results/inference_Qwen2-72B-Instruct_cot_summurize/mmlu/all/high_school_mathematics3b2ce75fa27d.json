Since $(1,2)$ and $(7,4)$ are opposite vertices of the square, we can use the distance formula to find the length of the diagonal of the square.\n\nThe distance formula is given by:\n\n\\[d = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}\\]\n\nSubstituting the coordinates of the two points, we get:\n\n\\[d = \\sqrt{(7 - 1)^2 + (4 - 2)^2} = \\sqrt{6^2 + 2^2} = \\sqrt{36 + 4} = \\sqrt{40}\\]\n\nThis is the length of the diagonal of the square. However, since we want to find the area of the square, we need the length of a side, not the diagonal. The diagonal $d$ of a square relates to the side length $s$ via the Pythagorean theorem, where $d = s\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nThus,\n\n\\[\\sqrt{40} = s\\sqrt{2}\\]\n\nSolving for $s$, we get:\n\n\\[s = \\frac{\\sqrt{40}}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\sqrt{20}\\]\n\nTherefore, the area of the square is $s^2 = (\\sqrt{20})^2 = 20$.\n\nThe correct answer is A. 20."
