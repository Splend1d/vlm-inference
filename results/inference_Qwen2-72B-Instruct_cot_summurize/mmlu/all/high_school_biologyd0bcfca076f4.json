The wings of an insect and the wings of a bird\n\nConvergent evolution refers to the independent development of similar features in different species that are not closely related, usually as an adaptation to similar environmental pressures or lifestyles. The wings of insects and birds are a classic example of convergent evolution because they evolved independently in these two groups but serve a similar function (flight) and have similar structures despite their evolutionary differences."
