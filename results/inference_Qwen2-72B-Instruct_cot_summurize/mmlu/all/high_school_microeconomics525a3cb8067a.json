Pure public goods are non-excludable (people cannot be prevented from using them) and non-rivalrous (one person's use does not diminish another's). They are also typically provided by the government because private markets may not provide them due to the free-rider problem. Since they are non-rivalrous, one more unit for some consumers does not mean one less for others, which contradicts option C. Option A is incorrect because the marginal cost of providing an additional unit to additional citizens is often zero or very low. Option B is incorrect because one of the defining characteristics of a pure public good is that it is non-excludable, meaning people cannot be prevented from benefiting from it even if they do not pay."
