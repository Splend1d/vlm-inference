                    "text": "C. I and III are correct.\n\nExplanation: An increase in the price level (inflation) reduces total spending in the economy for two main reasons:\n\nI. Consumers' incomes cannot go as far now that prices have risen. This means that with the same amount of money, consumers can buy fewer goods and services, leading to a decrease in consumption. This effect is known as the real balance effect or wealth effect.\n\nIII. Higher prices result in higher interest rates which lower spending. This is due to the Fisher effect, which states that nominal interest rates adjust to changes in inflation expectations. As inflation rises, lenders demand higher nominal interest rates to compensate for the loss of purchasing power. Higher interest rates make borrowing more expensive, which can reduce investment and consumer spending on durable goods.\n\nThe second statement (II) is not necessarily true. While it's possible that foreigners may buy less from a country experiencing high inflation if the currency depreciates, this is not a direct effect of an increase in the price level within the country itself. The relationship between inflation and foreign demand depends on exchange rate movements and other factors in international trade. Therefore, only statements I and III are directly related to how an increase in the price level reduces total spending in the economy."
