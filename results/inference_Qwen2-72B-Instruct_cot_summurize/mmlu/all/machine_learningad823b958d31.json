The Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm is the standard method for parameter estimation in GMMs because it directly optimizes the likelihood function, which is non-convex and may have multiple local maxima. Gradient descent could potentially be adapted for this purpose, but it's not commonly done due to the challenges associated with the non-convexity of the problem.\n\nStatement 2: True. A Gaussian-based Bayes optimal classifier assumes that the data from each class follows a multivariate Gaussian distribution. If the number of attributes is fixed, then the computation required for learning the mean and covariance matrices scales linearly with the number of records in the dataset. This is because the mean vector can be computed as a simple average, which is a linear operation, and the covariance matrix can be computed using sums of squares and cross-products, which also scale linearly with the number of records.\n\nSo, the correct answer is D. False, True."
