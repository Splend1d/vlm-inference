This ability typically develops during the concrete operational stage (ages 7-11), whereas children in the pre-operational stage (ages 2-7) often fail to grasp this concept. For example, Piaget might present two identical glasses of water and ask the child if they have the same amount of water. Then, he would pour one glass into a taller, narrower container and ask again. Children in the pre-operational stage might say the taller glass has more water, while those in the concrete operational stage should understand that the quantity remains the same."
