Because they respond more rapidly to changes in iron levels in the diet.\nB. Because blood haemoglobin levels can also respond to a variety of other factors and insults, such as lead poisoning, chronic disease, etc.\nC. Because the specific iron indices can be measured more accurately and easily.\nD. Because haemoglobin levels vary with subject age, and between the sexes.\n"

                    "text": "The answer is B. Blood hemoglobin levels can indeed respond to a variety of other factors and insults, not just iron status. For example, conditions like anemia of chronic disease, vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, or lead poisoning can all affect hemoglobin levels independently of iron stores. In contrast, serum ferritin and transferrin receptor levels are more directly tied to iron storage and utilization. Serum ferritin reflects the amount of iron stored in the body, while transferrin receptors indicate the demand for iron by the body's tissues. These markers tend to be less influenced by other non-iron related factors compared to hemoglobin. While options A, C, and D may have some truth to them, option B best explains why specific iron status indices are generally considered more reliable than hemoglobin levels."
