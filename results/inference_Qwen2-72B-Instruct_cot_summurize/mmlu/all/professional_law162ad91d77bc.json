She contends that contaminants, consisting mostly of the solvent, were released into the ground at the facility and have migrated and continue to migrate to her property, contaminating the soil, the groundwater, and her well. She alleges various acts of negligence on the part of the facility owner in causing the release of the contaminants into the ground. She also alleges that employees of the solvent supplier were negligent in frequently the solvent supplier were negligent in frequently spilling some of the solvent onto the ground while filling a rooftop tank at the facility. The solvent supplier has moved for summary judgment, arguing that if there was any contamination, the facility owner and the supplier independently contributed indeterminate amounts to the contamination and that therefore the homeowner cannot show how much damage each has inflicted on her. There is no evidence that the facility owner and the solvent supplier acted in concert. Should the court grant the summary judgment motion?\n\nA. No, because concurrent tortfeasors are jointly and severally liable for an indivisible injury.\nB. No, because the solvent supplier is vicariously liable for damage inflicted by the facility owner.\nC. Yes, because there is no basis for allocating damages against the solvent supplier. damages against the solvent supplier.\nD. Yes, because there is no evidence that the facility owner and the solvent supplier acted in concert.\n"

No, because concurrent tortfeasors are jointly and severally liable for an indivisible injury.\n\nThe solvent supplier's argument that it should not be held liable because the amount of damage it caused cannot be determined separately from the damage caused by the facility owner does not absolve it of liability. When multiple parties negligently cause an indivisible injury, they are considered concurrent tortfeasors and are jointly and severally liable for the entire harm. This means that the homeowner can recover the full amount of her damages from either defendant, regardless of the extent to which each contributed to the harm. The solvent supplier's motion for summary judgment should be denied based on the principle of joint and several liability for concurrent tortfeasors."
