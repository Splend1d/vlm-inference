In the first sentence, \"spoiled\" refers to food that has gone bad and is no longer safe or pleasant to eat. In the second sentence, \"spoiled\" refers to a person who is indulged excessively or improperly, often resulting in a lack of discipline or respect for others. Since \"spoiled\" is being used with different meanings in each case, this is an example of equivocation."
