It seems there might have been an error in interpreting the question or in the provided options. Given the information and the options available, the correct adjustment based on the question's wording would be:\n\nSubtract municipal bond interest income: $500,000 - $7,500 = $492,500\n\nBut since the state franchise tax refund should be added back, and that is not an option, the closest answer based on the provided adjustments would be:\n\nB. $492,500\n\nThis answer does not fully reconcile with the tax rules regarding refunds, but given the options and the adjustments mentioned in the question, this is the most accurate choice among them. However, the correct taxable income after considering the state franchise tax refund as taxable would be $542,500, which is not one of the provided options."
