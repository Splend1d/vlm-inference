According to Tom L. Beauchamp and James F. Childress in their book \"Principles of Biomedical Ethics,\" these rights include the right to privacy (A), the right to life (B), and the right to exercise religious freedom (C). Each of these rights can be understood as a protection against interference by others, making option D the correct choice. However, it's important to note that the specific categorization of rights may vary depending on the philosopher or ethical framework being considered. If you are referring to a specific philosopher named Arthur, please provide more context so I can give a more accurate answer based on his views. As of my knowledge cut-off in 2023, there isn't a widely recognized philosopher named \"Arthur\" who has written extensively on rights theory."
