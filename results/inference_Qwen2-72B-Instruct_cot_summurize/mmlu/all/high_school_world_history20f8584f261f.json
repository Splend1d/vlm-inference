A puritanical injunction to adhere to a strict code of conduct\n\nThe verse from the Qur'an, Sura 5:89, is instructing believers to abstain from strong drink, games of chance, and idols, which are described as \"an infamy of Satan's handiwork.\" This is an exhortation to avoid certain behaviors that are considered sinful or impure, reflecting a puritanical mode of religious discourse that emphasizes adherence to a strict moral code. The language used is authoritative and directive, aiming to guide believers toward virtuous behavior.\n\nIn contrast, the excerpt from the Rub\u00e1iy\u00e1t of Omar Khayy\u00e1m suggests a more hedonistic approach to life, encouraging the enjoyment of wine when the roses are in bloom. This tone is not reflected in the verse from the Qur'an, which instead stresses abstinence and piety."
