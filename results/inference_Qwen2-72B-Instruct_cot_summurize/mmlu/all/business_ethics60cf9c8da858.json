According to Milton Friedman, a Nobel Prize-winning economist, the main responsibility of a business is to maximize profits for its shareholders within the bounds of the law. He argued that businesses should focus on increasing profits as long as they stay within the rules of the game set by government and avoid deception or fraud. This view has been influential in shaping the thinking of many economists and business leaders about the role of corporations in society. However, it is worth noting that there are other perspectives on the social responsibilities of business, including those that emphasize the importance of considering the interests of all stakeholders, not just shareholders."
