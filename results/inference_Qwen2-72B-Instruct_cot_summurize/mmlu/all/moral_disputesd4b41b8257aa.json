However, I can make an educated guess based on his previous writings and public statements.\n\nMacedo is a political theorist who has written extensively about democracy, citizenship, and immigration. In his book \"Diverse Democracies: Immigration, Citizenship, and the Limits of Multiculturalism,\" he argues that states have a right to control their borders and that immigration policies should be designed to promote social cohesion and protect the interests of citizens.\n\nGiven this perspective, it seems unlikely that Macedo would disagree with statement A, which suggests that states should give special weight to their own citizens. He might also agree with statement B, which notes that immigration policies can have powerful economic effects, as he has written about the ways in which immigration can affect labor markets and wages.\n\nStatement C, which suggests that self-governance is morally irrelevant to the immigration debate, seems unlikely to be something Macedo would agree with. In his work, he emphasizes the importance of democratic self-governance and argues that states have a right to control their borders in order to protect the interests of their citizens.\n\nFinally, statement D, which suggests that there are reasons to think U.S. immigration policy has had detrimental effects on income distribution among citizens, could potentially be something Macedo agrees with. He has written about the ways in which immigration can affect income inequality and has argued that states have a responsibility to ensure that the benefits of immigration are shared fairly among all members of society.\n\nIn summary, based on Macedo's previous writings and public statements, it seems most likely that he would disagree with statement C, which suggests that self-governance is morally irrelevant to the immigration debate."
