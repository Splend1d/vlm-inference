                    "text": "To calculate Greene's basis in Seagull at the end of the year, we need to adjust his initial basis by the income, losses, and distributions during the year.\n\nStarting with Greene's initial basis of $15,000:\n\n1. **Add any increases to basis:**\n   - Seagull reported $2,000 of municipal bond interest, which is tax-exempt income and does not increase or decrease the shareholder's basis in an S corporation. Therefore, no adjustment is made for this item.\n   \n2. **Subtract any decreases to basis:**\n   - Seagull reported an ordinary loss of $5,000. However, the deductibility of this loss is limited to the shareholder's basis in the S corporation at the time of the loss. Given that Greene's initial basis is $15,000, he can fully deduct the $5,000 loss, reducing his basis to $10,000 ($15,000 - $5,000).\n   - Seagull distributed cash of $6,000 to Greene. Distributions reduce a shareholder's basis in the S corporation. After the loss deduction, Greene's basis was $10,000. The $6,000 distribution reduces his basis to $4,000 ($10,000 - $6,000).\n\nTherefore, Greene's basis in Seagull at the end of the year is **$4,000**.\n\nThe correct answer is **A. $4,000**."
