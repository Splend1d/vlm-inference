This would be the total energy intake minus the energy that is not digested and excreted in the faeces. Therefore, the digestible energy intake would be 9279 kJ - 647 kJ = 8632 kJ.\n\nThe metabolisable energy intake is the amount of energy that the body can use after digestion and absorption, which means it's the total energy intake minus the energy that is excreted in both the faeces and the urine. Therefore, the metabolisable energy intake would be 9279 kJ - (647 kJ + 318 kJ) = 8314 kJ.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. 9279-647 kJ and 9279-(647+318) kJ"
