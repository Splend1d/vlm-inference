If the volumes are equal, the final temperature will be the average of the two.\n\nThe average of 20\u00b0C and 28\u00b0C is:\n\n(20 + 28) / 2 = 48 / 2 = 24\u00b0C\n\nHowever, this option isn't available in your choices, which suggests that either the volumes aren't equal or there's an expectation for a more approximate answer. Given the options provided, the closest to our calculated average (24\u00b0C) is:\n\nB. 22\u00b0C\n\nThough it's not exactly right based on the calculation, it's the closest choice given. In a real-world scenario where volumes and heat capacities are taken into account, the final temperature could indeed be around 22\u00b0C if, for example, much less of the warmer water was added to a larger volume of the cooler water. But strictly speaking, without additional information about the volumes of each water sample, the most accurate choice based on the information provided would be closer to 24\u00b0C, which isn't listed. So, the best choice from the options given is B. 22\u00b0C."
