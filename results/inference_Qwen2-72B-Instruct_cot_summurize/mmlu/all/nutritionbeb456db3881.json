Such tests can detect only very large risks because of the fact that only small numbers of animals can be used. \n\nIn animal toxicity studies, high doses are used to observe and measure toxic effects within a relatively short time frame and with a small number of test animals. This approach allows researchers to identify potential hazards at higher exposure levels, which might not be evident at lower doses that humans would typically encounter. The extrapolation of these results to human populations involves considering various factors, including interspecies differences and the route of exposure. While other options may contain some truth, option B best explains why doses in animal toxicity studies are often significantly higher than what people would experience."
