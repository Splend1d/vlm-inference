Two days after the soybean contract was made, the buyer and the seller entered into another contract under which the buyer agreed to purchase 10,000 bushels of wheat from the seller at market price. Before the time for delivery of the soybeans, the seller notified the buyer that it would not deliver the wheat because the seller's wheat supplier had refused to extend additional credit to the seller and therefore the seller had no wheat available for the buyer. Which of the following statements best describes the effect of the seller's repudiation of the wheat contract on the buyer's rights under the soybean contract?\n\nA. It gives the buyer the right to demand assurances that the seller will perform the soybean contract.\nB. It gives the buyer the right to terminate the soybean contract, because of the doctrine of soybean contract, because of the doctrine of dependent covenants.\nC. It gives the buyer the right to terminate the soybean contract, because the buyer does not have to deal with a party that breaches a contract.\nD. It has no effect on the buyer's rights, because the two contracts are entirely separate.\n"

The breach or repudiation of one does not automatically affect the other unless there is a specific clause in either contract linking the performance of one to the other. Since there is no information given that suggests such a link, the repudiation of the wheat contract does not give the buyer any rights under the soybean contract. However, the buyer may still have remedies available under the law for the breach of the wheat contract."
