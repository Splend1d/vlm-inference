When Al is ionized and becomes Al\\(^+\\), the electron that is most easily removed is the one with the highest energy and the least shielding from the nucleus.\n\nThe \\(3p^1\\) electron has an orbital angular momentum quantum number (\\(l\\)) of 1 (since \\(p\\) orbitals have \\(l=1\\)). This electron experiences less shielding than the inner electrons and thus is more easily removed due to its higher energy level and greater distance from the nucleus.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. 1"
