The warmer and wetter conditions allowed for a variety of plants to grow, which supported a diverse range of animal species. This led to an increase in the diversity of food resources available to human populations. Additionally, during this period, humans began to domesticate plants and animals, further increasing the diversity of their diet and leading to the development of agriculture. While hunting and gathering remained important components of subsistence strategies for many groups, the reliance on megafauna and fur-bearing animals decreased as these species became less abundant or went extinct."
