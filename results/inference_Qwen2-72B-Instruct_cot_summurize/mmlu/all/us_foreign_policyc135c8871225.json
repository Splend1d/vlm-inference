This significant increase in military spending was part of Reagan's strategy to strengthen the United States' military capabilities and to put pressure on the Soviet Union during the Cold War. The Reagan administration's defense budget increased from $267 billion in 1981 to $398 billion in 1985 (in constant 1985 dollars), representing a substantial rise in defense spending."
