It encourages liberalization of global trade\n\nAmerican exceptionalism, the idea that the United States is unique among nations due to its founding principles and historical experiences, has often been used to promote a policy of free trade and open markets. This belief holds that the U.S. should lead by example and encourage other countries to adopt similar economic policies, which it believes will lead to greater prosperity worldwide. Therefore, American exceptionalism typically supports the liberalization of global trade rather than protectionist measures like tariffs or nationalization."
