Each of the five daily prayers consists of at least two units (rak'ahs), and in each unit, the recitation of the Fatihah is mandatory. Therefore, for the five daily prayers, it would be recited at least 10 times (5 prayers x 2 rak'ahs per prayer). However, most prayers consist of more than two rak'ahs, and there are additional Sunnah (recommended) and Nafl (voluntary) prayers that can be performed, which increase the number of times the Fatihah is recited. Thus, the minimum number of times the Fatihah is recited in a day is 17, but it could be more depending on an individual's practice."
