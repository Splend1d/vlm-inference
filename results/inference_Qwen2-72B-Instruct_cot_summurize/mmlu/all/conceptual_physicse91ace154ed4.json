Since the mirror is essentially acting as a flat plane, if you clear half of the mirror's height, you will be able to see your entire face reflected. This is because the reflection of your eyes will appear at the level of your eyes, and similarly for all other parts of your face. Thus, by clearing half the mirror's height, you ensure that your entire face is visible in the reflection."
