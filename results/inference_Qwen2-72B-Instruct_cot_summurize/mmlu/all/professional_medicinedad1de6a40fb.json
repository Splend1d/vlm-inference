The patient has a low-grade fever. Examination reveals an erythematous, fluctuant, elevated mass with 3\u00a0midline pores. Rectal examination reveals no induration or pain.

This condition often occurs in the midline at the top of the crease between the buttocks and can present with painful swelling, redness, and warmth over the sacrum, often following trauma such as a fall. The presence of midline pores also suggests a pilonidal sinus or abscess. Anocutaneous fistulas typically present with drainage from an opening near the anus, coccygodynia refers to tailbone pain without swelling or infection, and hidradenitis suppurativa usually affects the axillary and inguinal regions with recurrent boils and scarring."
