At trial, the prosecutor calls the defendant's wife as a willing witness to testify that the defendant told her in confidence that he had misrepresented his assets on the loan application. The defendant objects to his wife's testimony. Should the testimony be admitted?\n\nA. No, because even though the wife is a willing witness, the defendant has the right to exclude confidential marital communications in federal court.\nB. No, but only if the law of the state where the defendant and his wife reside recognizes a privilege for confidential marital communications.\nC. Yes, because in federal court the right not to testify belongs to the testifying spouse, and she is a willing witness.\nD. Yes, because while the adverse testimonial privilege is recognized in federal court, the marital communications privilege is not.\n"

No, because even though the wife is a willing witness, the defendant has the right to exclude confidential marital communications in federal court.\n\nUnder federal law, there is a marital communications privilege that allows one spouse to prevent the other from testifying about confidential communications made during the marriage. This privilege applies in federal court and is designed to protect the privacy of marital communications and maintain the sanctity of the marital relationship. Therefore, the defendant can object to his wife's testimony regarding confidential communications, and the testimony should not be admitted unless the defendant waives this privilege."
