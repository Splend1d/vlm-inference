In accordance with the orthodox tradition of his religion, the employee wears a covering on his head throughout the day. The director of the state forestry department has notified the employee that he will not be permitted to wear his head covering while on duty. A state forestry regulation provides that all forest rangers are required to wear only standard headgear in the interests of maintaining a uniform dress code conducive to the furtherance of the department's morale, efficiency, and professional standard of conduct. Although the employee wants to pursue a career as a forest ranger, he feels that his religious beliefs should not be compromised by a governmental agency. In trying to resolve his dilemma, the employee seeks your legal advice. You should advise him that in light of relevant U. S. Supreme Court decisions, the state regulation is probably\n\nA. constitutional, because although the employee has a constitutional right to the free exercise of his religion, a state may impose reasonable regulations that are rationally related to the furtherance of a state interest.\nB. constitutional, because the interest of the state in vindicating a carefully considered professional judgment by the forestry director that wearing such religious apparel would interfere with the department's morale and efficiency is sufficient to contravene the wishes of its members to wear headgear required by their religious beliefs.\nC. unconstitutional, because in accordance with the free exercise clause of the First Amendment, a state has no power to regulate religious beliefs.\nD. unconstitutional, because an individual has a fundamental right to seek gainful employment, and a state cannot arbitrarily and unreasonably regulate against such economic activity.\n"

This regulation is likely to be considered constitutional if it can be shown that it is a reasonable and rational means to achieve a legitimate state interest. The U.S. Supreme Court has generally upheld such regulations when they are neutral and generally applicable, and do not target any specific religious practice or belief. However, it's worth noting that the employee could potentially seek a religious accommodation under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which requires employers to reasonably accommodate employees' religious practices unless doing so would cause undue hardship."
