These include:\n\nA. Understanding what constitutes a public space: This involves recognizing where visual data can be collected without explicit consent, as public spaces generally have lower expectations of privacy.\n\nB. Protecting individuals from potential harm: Researchers must consider the impact of their work on participants, ensuring that no harm comes to them as a result of the study. This includes emotional, physical, or reputational harm.\n\nC. Any risk of invasion of privacy: Researchers should be mindful of the privacy rights of individuals and take steps to minimize any potential infringement. This may involve obtaining informed consent, anonymizing data, or avoiding sensitive topics.\n\nConsidering all these factors ensures that the research is conducted ethically and responsibly."
