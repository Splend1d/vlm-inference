When the price level increases, the purchasing power of money decreases. This means that people can buy fewer goods and services with the same amount of money. As a result, they may cut back on spending, which reduces consumption. Additionally, higher prices can lead to higher interest rates as central banks may raise rates to combat inflation. Higher interest rates make borrowing more expensive, which can reduce investment spending by businesses and further decrease aggregate demand. \n\nTherefore, as the price level increases, the aggregate demand curve shifts downward due to reduced consumption and investment spending."
