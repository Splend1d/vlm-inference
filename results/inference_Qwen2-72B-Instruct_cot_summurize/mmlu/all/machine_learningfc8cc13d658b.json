A function is monotonic if it is either entirely non-increasing or non-decreasing. The ReLU activation function, defined as f(x) = max(0, x), is non-decreasing, and thus, it is monotonic.\n\nStatement 2 is also false because neural networks trained with gradient descent do not necessarily converge to the global optimum with high probability, especially in complex, high-dimensional spaces typical of deep learning tasks. Gradient descent can often get stuck in local minima or saddle points, and the optimization landscape for neural networks is typically non-convex, making it unlikely that simple gradient descent will find the global minimum."
