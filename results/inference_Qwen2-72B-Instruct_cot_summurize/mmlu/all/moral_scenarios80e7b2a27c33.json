However, the specifics of the diet would matter; simply feeding the cat less without considering its nutritional needs could be seen as neglectful. Assuming the diet is nutritionally balanced and aimed at improving the cat's health, this action is not considered morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, getting children addicted to pot brownies is clearly morally wrong. This action endangers the health and well-being of minors by exposing them to illegal substances and potentially harmful effects, both physically and psychologically. It also violates legal standards regarding drug use and the protection of children."
