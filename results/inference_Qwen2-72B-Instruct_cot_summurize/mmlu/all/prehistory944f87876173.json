Beringia; Late Glacial Maximum\n\nDuring the Late Glacial Maximum, which occurred approximately 26,500 to 19,000 years ago, global sea levels were significantly lower due to the vast amount of water locked up in continental ice sheets. This drop in sea level exposed the continental shelves that are now submerged under the Bering Sea, creating a land bridge known as Beringia that connected Siberia and Alaska. This allowed for the migration of humans and other species between Asia and North America."
