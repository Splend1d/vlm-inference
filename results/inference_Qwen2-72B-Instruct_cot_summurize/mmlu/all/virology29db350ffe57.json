This is because yellow fever is endemic in certain regions of Africa and South America, and many countries require proof of vaccination before entry to prevent the spread of the disease. The yellow fever vaccine is highly effective and provides long-lasting immunity. However, it's important to note that the specific vaccines recommended or required for travelers can vary depending on the destination and individual health factors, so it's always best to consult with a healthcare provider or travel medicine specialist before traveling internationally."
