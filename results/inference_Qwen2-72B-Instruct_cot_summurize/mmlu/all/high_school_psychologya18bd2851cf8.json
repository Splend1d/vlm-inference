Reliability refers to the consistency of a test, while validity refers to the accuracy of a test in measuring what it is supposed to measure. A test can consistently produce the same results (be reliable) without actually measuring what it is intended to measure (not be valid). For example, a scale that always shows 150 pounds regardless of who steps on it is reliable but not valid for measuring weight."
