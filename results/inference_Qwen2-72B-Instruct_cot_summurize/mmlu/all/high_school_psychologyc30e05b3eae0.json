As we encounter new social situations, we either develop healthy or unhealthy personality characteristics in order to cope with social demands.\nC. Humans develop increasing abilities to think about moral choices, and our ability to think about the rights of others develops over time.\nD. Rewards and punishments for behaviors are the major influence on learning in humans.\n"

When we can't assimilate new information, we change our schemas through accommodation.\n\nAccording to Jean Piaget's theory of cognitive development, learning occurs through the processes of assimilation and accommodation. Assimilation is when new information is incorporated into existing cognitive schemas (mental frameworks for understanding the world). Accommodation occurs when existing schemas are modified or new ones are created to accommodate new information that cannot be assimilated into existing schemas. This process of adapting mental structures in response to new experiences is central to Piaget's theory of how children learn and develop cognitively."
