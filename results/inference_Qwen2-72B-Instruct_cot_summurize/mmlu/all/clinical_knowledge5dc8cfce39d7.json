Bowing of a long bone is a characteristic feature\n\nPaget's disease can cause bones to become abnormally enlarged and deformed, which may lead to bowing of long bones. However, it's important to note that spinal cord compression and heart failure can also occur as complications in some cases, and pathological fractures are indeed a recognized feature of the disease. But among the given options, A is the most accurate statement about Paget's disease."
