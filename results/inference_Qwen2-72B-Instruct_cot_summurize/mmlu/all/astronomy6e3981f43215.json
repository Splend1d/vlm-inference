This means that any object will weigh approximately 1/6th as much on the Moon as it does on Earth.\n\nTo compare the weights of these objects on the Moon, we need to convert their masses into the same units and then apply the lunar gravitational acceleration (about 1.625 m/s\u00b2).\n\nA. A kilogram of feathers would weigh about \\(1 \\text{ kg} \\times 1.625 \\frac{\\text{m}}{\\text{s}^2} = 1.625 \\text{ N}\\) on the Moon.\n\nB. Five pounds of bricks as measured on Earth would weigh about \\(5 \\text{ lb} \\times 0.45359237 \\frac{\\text{kg}}{\\text{lb}} \\times 1.625 \\frac{\\text{m}}{\\text{s}^2} \\approx 3.78 \\text{ N}\\) on the Moon. Note: 1 pound is approximately equal to 0.45359237 kg.\n\nC. Five kilograms of feathers would weigh about \\(5 \\text{ kg} \\times 1.625 \\frac{\\text{m}}{\\text{s}^2} = 8.125 \\text{ N}\\) on the Moon.\n\nD. A kilogram of bricks would weigh the same as a kilogram of feathers, which is about \\(1 \\text{ kg} \\times 1.625 \\frac{\\text{m}}{\\text{s}^2} = 1.625 \\text{ N}\\) on the Moon.\n\nTherefore, the object that would weigh the most on the Moon is:\n\nC. Five kilograms of feathers, with a weight of about 8.125 N."
