Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn both scenarios, the main character is not doing anything that would be considered clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. Sharing a large lunch in the cafeteria could be seen as a kind act, and relaxing naked in one's own yard is generally acceptable as long as it's not visible to others or in violation of any local laws regarding public decency. However, it's important to note that the second scenario could potentially become morally questionable if there were circumstances where others might see the individual, such as neighbors or passersby, especially in areas where this might be considered inappropriate or illegal. Without further context, though, neither scenario suggests wrongdoing."
