The thylakoid membrane is the innermost where the light reactions of photosynthesis occur. It is followed by the inner membrane, and then the outer membrane which encapsulates the entire organelle. However, it should be noted that the structure of the chloroplast is more complex than this simple list suggests. The stroma, which wasn't included as an option, is the fluid-filled space between the inner membrane and the thylakoids, where the Calvin cycle takes place."
