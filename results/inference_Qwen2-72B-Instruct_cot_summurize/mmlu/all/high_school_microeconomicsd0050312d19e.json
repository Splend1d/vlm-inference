This can lead to higher prices and profits for the existing firms compared to a more competitive market structure. Oligopolies may also exhibit collusive behavior, where firms cooperate to maintain high prices and limit competition, although such behavior is illegal in many countries. Price-taking behavior is more typical of perfect competition, where individual firms have no power to influence the market price. Normal profits in the long run are more likely in monopolistic competition, where there are many firms producing differentiated products, but the barriers to entry are lower than in an oligopoly."
