Rest and analgesics usually eradicate the pain within 2 weeks. However, the pain seems to recur every 2 to 3 months. Medical history is remarkable for gestational diabetes mellitus during her pregnancies. She takes no medications except for an oral contraceptive. She walks 3 miles daily for exercise and works as a sales representative for a computer software company. She is 165 cm (5 ft 5 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb); BMI is 37 kg/m2 . Vital signs are normal, and physical examination discloses no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?\n\nA. Administer an epidural injection of methylprednisolone\nB. Order MRI of the lumbosacral spine\nC. Order x-rays of the lumbosacral spine\nD. Recommend beginning a weight loss program\n"

Given the patient's BMI of 37 kg/m2, which falls into the obese category, losing weight could help alleviate some of the strain on her lower back. Obesity is a known risk factor for low back pain. Before considering more invasive or expensive diagnostic procedures like MRI or X-rays, or treatments like epidural injections, it would be prudent to address modifiable lifestyle factors such as weight.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that if the pain is severe or significantly impacting her quality of life, further diagnostic testing may be warranted. But given the information provided, starting with a conservative approach focused on lifestyle modifications seems reasonable."
