While the party was in progress, a few teenagers from the neighborhood vandalized some of the cars parked outside the house. They broke the headlights and stole the battery from the boyfriend's car. When the party ended, the boyfriend and his girlfriend left the house and got into his car. The boyfriend, who was about to drive his girlfriend home, was unaware of what had happened. He tried to start the car, but it wouldn't turn on. Two police officers, who were parked outside the house, watched the boyfriend as he tried to start the car. They then approached the boyfriend and charged him with attempting to violate a local ordinance making it a misdemeanor to drive at night without headlights. The boyfriend's best defense to the charge is\n\nA. factual impossibility.\nB. mistake of fact.\nC. entrapment.\nD. no requisite intent.\n"

In this case, the boyfriend was unaware that his car's headlights had been broken and the battery stolen. He had no intention of driving without headlights; he simply could not start the car due to the vandalism. This lack of knowledge about the condition of his vehicle means he did not have the requisite intent to commit the offense.\n\nWhile factual impossibility (A) might seem relevant because it was factually impossible for him to drive with headlights since they were broken, it is generally not recognized as a defense in criminal law unless it negates a required element of the crime. Entrapment (C) does not apply because there is no indication that law enforcement induced the boyfriend to commit a crime. \"No requisite intent\" (D) is essentially what mistake of fact covers, but mistake of fact is more specific to the circumstances presented."
