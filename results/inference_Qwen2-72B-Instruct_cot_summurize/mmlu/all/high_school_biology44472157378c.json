Animal cells contain centrioles, which are involved in cell division and the formation of the cell's internal skeleton, while plant cells do not. Plant cells have a cell wall made of cellulose (A), large central vacuoles for storing water and other substances (C), and lysosomes (B), which are also present in animal cells. However, these features are not unique to animal cells, whereas centrioles are typically absent in plant cells."
