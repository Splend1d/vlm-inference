Fred's unqualified acceptance on April 15 will not create a contract.\n\nJames' offer is irrevocable for a ten-day period from the moment it was made, which would be when Fred received the offer on April 5th. Therefore, the offer is irrevocable until April 15th. However, since the offer does not specify an expiration date beyond the ten-day period, and assuming no other circumstances apply that could extend the offer, it would expire at the end of the ten-day period. Thus, if Fred accepts after April 15th, the acceptance is too late and does not create a contract.\n\nOption A is incorrect because Fred's unqualified acceptance within the ten-day period (i.e., before April 15th) would create a contract.\nOption B is incorrect because even if James dies during the ten-day period, the offer remains irrevocable and Fred can still accept it to form a contract.\nOption C is incorrect because Fred's conditional acceptance (\"I accept your offer, but will pay only $90,000\") is actually a counteroffer, not an acceptance, and thus does not create a contract."
