This is because energy stores, particularly muscle glycogen, become depleted over time, and the body must rely on less efficient energy sources, leading to a decline in performance. While dietary factors like a high-fat diet can influence energy metabolism, they do not directly improve maximum sustainable power, especially if the race distance exceeds the capacity for which the athlete has trained. Muscle glycogen content is indeed related to power output, but the relationship is not inverse; higher muscle glycogen content generally allows for greater sustained power output before depletion."
