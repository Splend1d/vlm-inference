Variance measures the average degree to which each score differs from the mean. It takes into account every data point in the distribution and thus provides a comprehensive measure of dispersion. The square root of the variance is the standard deviation, which is also a commonly used measure of spread.\n\nWhile range (C) does provide information on the spread by indicating the difference between the highest and lowest scores, it only considers two extreme values and doesn't take into account the variability within the rest of the distribution.\n\nMean (B) and median (D) are measures of central tendency and do not provide information about the spread or dispersion of scores. They indicate where the center of the distribution lies but not how the scores are distributed around this center."
