The consumer did not read the notice and used the machine on a steep hill. As a result, it falls over and crushes him. He sues on a theory of strict liability, alleging a defect in the manufacture of the product. The manufacturer defends that the consumer misused the product. Will the Court likely grant the defendant's motion for summary judgment based on the indisputable fact that the consumer did not read the warning, which the defendant argued renders the lawsuit invalid as a matter of law?\n\nA. No, because contributory negligence is not a defense to strict liability in a products liability case.\nB. No, because the product was defective and unreasonably dangerous.\nC. Yes, because the consumer assumed the risk of the danger when he used the product on a steep hill.\nD. Yes, because the consumer ignored the warning and misused the product.\n"

In a strict liability case, the defense can argue that the consumer misused the product in a way that was unforeseeable and that this misuse was the proximate cause of the injury. Since the consumer did not read the warning and used the product in a manner that was explicitly warned against, the court may find that the consumer's actions were the primary cause of the injury, thus granting the defendant's motion for summary judgment. However, it is important to note that the specific outcome would depend on the jurisdiction and its laws regarding strict liability and product misuse."
