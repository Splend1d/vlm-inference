This means that the reaction absorbs energy from its surroundings in order to proceed. In contrast, an exergonic reaction releases energy to its surroundings. Hydrolysis reactions involve the breaking down of a molecule using water and may be either exergonic or endergonic depending on the specific reaction. Redox reactions involve the transfer of electrons between molecules but can also be either exergonic or endergonic."
