This force also provides the centripetal acceleration for the circular motion, which can be described as mv^2/r, where m is the mass of the particle and r is the radius of the circular path.\n\nSetting these two expressions equal to each other gives us:\n\nqvB = mv^2/r\n\nSolving for r gives:\n\nr = mv/(qB)\n\nFor an electron, we know that its mass m is approximately 9.11 \u00d7 10^-31 kg and its charge q is -1.6 \u00d7 10^-19 C. Substituting these values along with the given velocity (v = 10^7 m/s) and magnetic field (B = 5 \u00d7 10^-5 T), we get:\n\nr = (9.11 \u00d7 10^-31 kg * 10^7 m/s) / (-1.6 \u00d7 10^-19 C * 5 \u00d7 10^-5 T)\n= 1.14 m\n\nSo the answer is D. 1 m."
