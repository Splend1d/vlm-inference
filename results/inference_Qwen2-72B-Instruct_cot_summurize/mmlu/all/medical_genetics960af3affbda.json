This indicates a Robertsonian translocation where part of chromosome 21 has attached to chromosome 14, and there's an extra copy of chromosome 21, which is characteristic of Down syndrome.\n\nHowever, it should be noted that the most common form of Down syndrome is actually trisomy 21, which would be represented by a karyotype of 47,XX,+21 or 47,XY,+21, but this option isn't listed in your choices. The karyotype you provided as option A represents a rarer form of Down syndrome due to a Robertsonian translocation."
