The shopper contended that the doors, which were programmed to swing inward, swung outward and injured him as he attempted to enter the store one afternoon. The shopper's brother-in- law, who was an eyewitness to the accident, was not called to testify at trial. Moreover, the shopper's attorney failed to depose the brother-in-law, who redomiciled out of state shortly after the accident. With respect to the shopper's failure to offer the brother-in-law's testimony at trial, on request by the supermarket's attorney, the court should\n\nA. instruct the jury that it raises the presumption that the brother-in-law's testimony would have been unfavorable to the shopper.\nB. instruct the jury that it constitutes an adoptive admission that the brother-in-law's testimony would have been unfavorable to the shopper.\nC. permit the supermarket's attorney to argue that it raises a presumption that the brother-in-law's testimony would have been unfavorable to the shopper.\nD. neither instruct the jury on the matter nor permit the supermarket's attorney to argue the matter.\n"

Neither instruct the jury on the matter nor permit the supermarket's attorney to argue the matter.\n\nIn this scenario, the court would generally not provide an instruction to the jury regarding the absence of the witness or allow the opposing party to argue that the missing testimony must be presumed to be unfavorable. This is because such presumptions could potentially prejudice the jury against the party that did not call the witness without any evidence that the testimony would indeed have been unfavorable. The decision about which witnesses to call is typically within the discretion of the attorneys, and the court does not usually infer guilt or liability from the mere absence of a witness unless there are specific legal grounds for doing so. \n\nHowever, if the supermarket's attorney believes that the shopper's brother-in-law's testimony is crucial and that its absence should affect the case, they might seek other legal avenues to address the issue, such as attempting to subpoena the witness or moving to have the shopper's case dismissed based on the lack of critical evidence. But these actions would require more than just the absence of the witness; they would need to show that the witness's testimony is essential to the case and that the failure to present it was prejudicial to their defense."
