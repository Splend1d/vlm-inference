Ground-penetrating radar (GPR) uses radar pulses to create images of the subsurface. A proton magnetometer measures variations in the Earth's magnetic field that can be caused by buried structures or materials. Electrical resistivity measures the resistance of soil to an electric current, which can vary depending on what lies beneath the surface."
