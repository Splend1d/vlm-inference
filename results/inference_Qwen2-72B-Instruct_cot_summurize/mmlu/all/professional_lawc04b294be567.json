The high school is a public school, and the school has a policy that all student athletes are required to sign an authorization form by which they consent to undergo random drug testing. All the basketball players on the school team, except the teenager, signed the authorization. In the third game of the season, the team beat their archrival, and the teenager scored a record high 69 points. In the locker room following the game, the basketball coach approached the teenager and requested that he provide a urine sample for a random drug test. The teenager refused. He had smoked some marijuana the previous day and was afraid that a positive test result might jeopardize his being awarded a basketball scholarship to college. Thereafter, the teenager was suspended from the team for failing to comply with the coach's request. The coach later admitted that he did not have any individualized suspicion that the teenager was under the influence of drugs. The teenager has filed a motion challenging the suspension and seeking reinstatement on the basketball team. The court will most likely rule in favor of\n\nA. the school, because a urine sample does not constitute a search under the Fourth Amendment.\nB. the school, because drug testing is not an intrusion on his Fourth Amendment right of privacy.\nC. the student, because he didn't consent to the drug test.\nD. the student, because the coach admitted that he did not have any individualized suspicion that the student was under the influence of drugs.\n"

                    "text": "The court will most likely rule in favor of D. the student, because the coach admitted that he did not have any individualized suspicion that the student was under the influence of drugs.\n\nIn the context of school drug testing policies, courts generally balance the interests of the students' privacy rights under the Fourth Amendment against the school's interest in maintaining a safe and drug-free environment. While schools may implement drug testing policies for student athletes, these policies must be reasonable and not overly intrusive. Random drug testing without individualized suspicion can be justified as a reasonable policy for student athletes due to the nature of their activities and the potential impact of drug use on their health and safety, as well as the safety of others.\n\nHowever, in this case, since the coach specifically targeted the teenager for a drug test without any individualized suspicion, it could be seen as an unreasonable search and seizure under the Fourth Amendment. The fact that the teenager had not consented to the drug test is also relevant, but the primary issue here is the lack of individualized suspicion. If the school's policy requires all student athletes to consent to random drug testing, then the teenager's refusal to comply with a policy that he did not agree to could be grounds for disciplinary action. However, if the coach's request was outside of the scope of the school's policy (i.e., not truly random but rather targeted without cause), the court may find the request to be unconstitutional."
