Connecticut (1965) was a landmark case in which the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that the Constitution protected a right to privacy. The case involved a Connecticut law that banned the use of contraceptives, even by married couples. The Court held that the law violated the \"right to marital privacy,\" which is implicit in several constitutional guarantees.\n\nRoe v. Wade (1973) is another landmark case that further established the right to privacy in the context of abortion. The Supreme Court ruled that a woman's decision to have an abortion is protected under the right to privacy, which is grounded in the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. This decision effectively legalized abortion nationwide during the first trimester of pregnancy.\n\nBoth cases are significant because they expanded the interpretation of the right to privacy under the U.S. Constitution, with Griswold focusing on marital privacy and Roe v. Wade on reproductive rights."
