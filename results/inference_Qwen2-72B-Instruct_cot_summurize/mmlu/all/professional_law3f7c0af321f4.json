                    "text": "A retiree lived in a single-family dwelling in the city. Adjacent to his home was a vacant lot that measured 100 feet by 175 feet. The lot, which the retiree owned, was situated on the corner of Davis Street and University Way. The tract measured 100 feet along Davis Street and 175 feet along University Way. The retiree executed a deed purporting to convey the vacant lot to his lifelong friend for the consideration of $28,000. After escrow, the deed was delivered to the friend, who immediately filed it with the county recorder's office. The recorded instrument described the property conveyed as \"all the tract of land beginning at the northwest corner of Davis Street and University Way; thence west along Davis Street 100 feet; thence north 175 feet; thence west 100 feet; thence south 175 feet along University Way to the place of beginning. \" Three months after his conveyance to the friend, the retiree died intestate. His heirs have now filed an appropriate action contesting the friend's title to the vacant lot. Which of the following statements is most accurate concerning the outcome of this suit?\n\nA. The retiree's heirs will prevail because metes and bounds, rather than streets, are appropriate boundary descriptions.\nB. The friend will prevail because equity will not permit forfeiture for a mere technicality.\nC. The outcome will depend on whether the tract of land was plotted as a lot in a subdivision.\nD. The outcome will depend on whether the last call (175 feet along University Way) prevails over the third call (west 100 feet).\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is D. The outcome will depend on whether the last call (175 feet along University Way) prevails over the third call (west 100 feet). \n\nIn legal descriptions of real property, calls (directions and distances) are used to define the boundaries of a parcel of land. When there is a conflict between two calls, such as when following one call would result in a different location than another call, courts typically apply rules of construction to resolve the discrepancy. One common rule is that the last call prevails over earlier calls if they conflict.\n\nIn this case, the description given in the deed includes four calls: west along Davis Street 100 feet, then north 175 feet, then west 100 feet, and finally south 175 feet along University Way back to the place of beginning. However, the second and fourth calls (north 175 feet and south 175 feet) are consistent with each other and with the dimensions of the lot (100 feet by 175 feet), while the first and third calls (west 100 feet twice) are not, since they would result in a square lot instead of a rectangular one. Therefore, the court will likely interpret the third call (west 100 feet) as being in error and give precedence to the last call (south 175 feet along University Way) to maintain the integrity of the description and match the actual dimensions of the lot.\n\nThus, unless there are other issues affecting the validity of the deed or the conveyance, the friend should prevail based on the recorded deed's legal description of the property."
