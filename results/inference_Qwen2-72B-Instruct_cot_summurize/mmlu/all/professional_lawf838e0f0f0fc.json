The boyfriend asked his girlfriend to drive the getaway car, to which she agreed, on the condition that no loaded weapons were used during the robbery. On the day of the robbery, the boyfriend and his girlfriend drove to the grocery store. Unknown to the girlfriend, the boyfriend entered the store with a loaded gun. The boyfriend approached one of the cashiers and told him to fill a bag with all the money from the register. When the cashier refused, the boyfriend shot and killed him. He then turned to the next cashier and pointed his gun at her. The cashier suffered a heart attack and died. The boyfriend then took the money from the registers himself and exited the store. One of the customers had called the police, and they were waiting outside. A shootout ensued, and the boyfriend was killed by the police. If this jurisdiction follows the agency theory of felony murder, the girlfriend is guilty if how many counts of murder?\n\nA. 1\nB. 2\nC. 3\nD. None.\n"

                    "text": "Under the agency theory of felony murder, an accomplice can be held liable for any foreseeable deaths caused by the principal or the principal's agents during the commission of a felony. In this case, the girlfriend is not directly responsible for the deaths but may be held liable for them because they occurred during the commission of a felony (the robbery) that she helped facilitate.\n\nHowever, the girlfriend's liability could potentially be limited by her condition that no loaded weapons were to be used. This condition might be seen as an attempt to limit the scope of the felony and, therefore, her liability for any resulting deaths. Still, under agency theory, if the death is a foreseeable result of the felony, the accomplice can be held liable regardless of such conditions.\n\nGiven the facts presented:\n\n1. The boyfriend shot and killed the first cashier when he refused to comply.\n2. The second cashier died of a heart attack due to the stress of the situation, which can be considered a foreseeable consequence of the robbery.\n3. The boyfriend's death by police is not relevant to the girlfriend's liability under felony murder rules since it does not involve a victim whose death could be attributed to the felony.\n\nIf the jurisdiction follows strict agency theory, and the girlfriend's condition regarding the use of loaded weapons is disregarded, she would be held liable for both deaths that occurred as a direct result of the felony. Therefore, the answer would be:\n\nB. 2\n\nHowever, the actual legal outcome could depend on various factors, including the specific interpretation of agency theory in that jurisdiction, the admissibility of the girlfriend's condition, and whether the court finds the heart attack death to be a direct result of the felony."
