This condition is characterized by dilatation and inflammation of the milk ducts and can result in nipple discharge that may be serous, bloody, or, as in this case, greenish. Although breast cancer can present with nipple discharge, it is usually bloody and associated with other signs such as a palpable lump, skin changes, or nipple retraction. Fibrocystic disease typically causes lumpy, tender breasts but does not usually result in nipple discharge. A pituitary adenoma would be expected to cause symptoms related to hormonal imbalances or pressure effects on surrounding structures rather than nipple discharge.\n\nHowever, it's important to rule out malignancy through appropriate diagnostic testing, such as mammography, ultrasound, or ductal lavage, given the patient's age and the nature of the discharge."
