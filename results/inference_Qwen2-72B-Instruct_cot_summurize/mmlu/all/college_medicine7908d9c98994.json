An accumulation of inorganic phosphate.\n\nDuring high-intensity exercise, such as multiple sprint activities, the rapid breakdown of phosphocreatine (PCr) in the muscle cells leads to an accumulation of inorganic phosphate (Pi). This accumulation is thought to contribute to peripheral muscle fatigue by inhibiting enzymes involved in energy production and interfering with calcium handling, which is crucial for muscle contraction."
