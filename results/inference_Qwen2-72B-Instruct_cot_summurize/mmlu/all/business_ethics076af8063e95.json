Industrial ecosystems\n\nIndustrial ecosystems can be likened to their natural counterparts, comprising a balanced network of interdependent organisms and their environments. This concept adds value to sustainability thinking due to the consideration of companies and industries as being bound together and interdependent due to all kinds of resources and wastes. In industrial ecosystems, waste from one process becomes a resource for another, mimicking the way nutrients and energy flow in natural ecosystems. This approach promotes resource efficiency, reduces waste, and fosters collaboration among different industries for a more sustainable economy."
