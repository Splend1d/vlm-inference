These include the development of a writing system, bronze metallurgy, early forms of divination, ancestor worship, and the concept of a centralized state with a bureaucratic system. These foundational aspects persisted and developed further through successive dynasties, including the Zhou, Qin, Han, Tang, Song, Ming, and Qing Dynasties, all the way up to the modern era. Therefore, the influence of the Shang Dynasty can indeed be seen as extending to the 20th century in terms of shaping various aspects of Chinese civilization."
