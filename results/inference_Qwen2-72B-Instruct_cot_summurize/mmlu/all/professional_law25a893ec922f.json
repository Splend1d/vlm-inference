With a seating capacity of 1,500, it is customarily leased for rock concerts, rodeos, sporting events, fashion shows, etc. In January, a rock star held a week-long concert there, drawing a full house each night. Generally, the city leases the auditorium's facilities for a charge of $2,000 per day. In February, a religious sect applied to rent the auditorium for its annual celebration. However, the city council voted 7 to 3 against permitting the group from using the auditorium. When their rental application was denied, the religious sect threatened to take legal action against the city council. They contended unfair discrimination inasmuch as other religious organizations had leased the auditorium in previous months for their religious gatherings. Amid this controversy, the city council passed an ordinance prohibiting the rental of the auditorium to any religious group. The ordinance was passed in a \"closed door\" session, which did not permit any debate or hearings on the matter. Is this newly enacted city ordinance likely to be held constitutional?\n\nA. No, because it violates the due process rights of religious groups by not affording them an opportunity for a hearing.\nB. No, because the ordinance discriminates against religious groups in violation of the free exercise clause of the First Amendment, as applied to the states via the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause.\nC. Yes, because the ordinance treats all religious groups equally.\nD. Yes, because a city ordinance is not a state action, per Se, and, therefore, is not subject to the limitations of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n"

No, because the ordinance discriminates against religious groups in violation of the free exercise clause of the First Amendment, as applied to the states via the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause.\n\nThis answer is correct because the ordinance specifically targets religious groups and prohibits them from renting the auditorium, while other non-religious groups are still allowed to do so. This constitutes discrimination based on religion, which is a violation of the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment. Additionally, the fact that the decision was made without a public hearing or debate also raises concerns about due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nOption A is partially correct but not as comprehensive as option B since it only addresses the lack of a hearing and not the broader issue of religious discrimination.\n\nOption C is incorrect because even though the ordinance applies to all religious groups equally, it still discriminates against all of them as a class, which is unconstitutional.\n\nOption D is incorrect because a city ordinance is indeed a form of state action and is subject to the limitations of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Fourteenth Amendment applies the protections of the Bill of Rights, including the First Amendment, to actions taken by state and local governments."
