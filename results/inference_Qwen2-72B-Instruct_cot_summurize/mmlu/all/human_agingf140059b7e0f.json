As people get closer to retirement, they often start thinking about their future plans, such as where they will live, how they will spend their time, and how they will manage their finances. This can involve doing some informal planning, such as researching retirement communities or talking to financial advisors. While some people may experience anxiety or irritability as they approach retirement, this is not necessarily a universal experience. Similarly, while some people may become more interested in hobbies or crafts as they prepare for retirement, this is also not a universal trend. Absenteeism from work may increase as people near retirement due to health issues or the need to attend to personal matters, but again, this is not true for everyone."
