Marginal social cost = marginal private cost + negative externality.\n\nExplanation:\nIn economics, the marginal social cost (MSC) represents the total cost to society of producing one additional unit of a good or service. It includes both the marginal private cost (MPC), which is the cost incurred by the producer, and any external costs that may result from the production or consumption of the good. An externality is a cost or benefit that affects a party who did not choose to incur that cost or benefit. When the externality is negative (i.e., it imposes a cost on third parties), it must be added to the MPC to get the MSC. Therefore, MSC = MPC + Negative Externality.\n\nOptions A, B, and C are incorrect because they do not accurately represent the relationship between the concepts mentioned. Option A incorrectly suggests that the marginal social cost is equal to the sum of the marginal private cost and marginal social benefits, which does not align with the definitions of these terms. Option B incorrectly equates the value of an externality with the marginal social costs, while option C incorrectly equates the value of an externality with the marginal private costs."
