Consequentialism, as a moral theory, holds that the rightness or wrongness of an action is determined solely by its consequences. However, this approach can lead to conflicts between different levels of commitment, such as personal relationships, professional obligations, and broader social responsibilities. In some cases, the optimal outcome from a consequentialist perspective may require sacrificing one level of commitment for another, which can be difficult for individuals who value integrating their commitments into a coherent whole."
