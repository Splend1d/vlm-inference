During finals at the end of the fall semester, the student was caught cheating. His chemistry professor saw him looking at a fellow student's exam paper and copying the answers to three multiple choice questions. The professor notified the honor committee, which immediately found an honor code violation and ordered that the student receive a failing grade in the course. In addition, in accordance with the rules of the university, the student's financial aid was terminated. The student filed a lawsuit seeking reinstatement of his financial aid. The student's only argument was that his due process rights were violated in that he did not receive a notice of, or a hearing on, the alleged honor code violation. Which of the following facts, if true, would be most helpful to the student?\n\nA. The university was in financial difficulties and could not meet its payroll expenses.\nB. The university did not re-allocate the student's financial aid to another deserving student.\nC. The university received support from the state.\nD. The honor committee sent the student a letter to advise him of the hearing date.\n"

The honor committee sent the student a letter to advise him of the hearing date.\n\nThis might seem counterintuitive, but the absence of such a notification would have been a stronger point for the student's case. Since the student claims that his due process rights were violated due to lack of notice or a hearing, evidence showing that no such notification was ever sent would support his claim. However, if the honor committee did indeed send the student a letter advising him of the hearing date, this would weaken the student's argument that he did not receive proper notice.\n\nHowever, since the question asks which fact would be *most helpful* to the student's argument that his due process rights were violated, and all other options (A, B, and C) are irrelevant to the issue of due process, option D is the best choice by default, even though it doesn't actually help the student's case if the notification was properly sent. If the notification was not sent, then the lack of notification would strengthen the student's case."
