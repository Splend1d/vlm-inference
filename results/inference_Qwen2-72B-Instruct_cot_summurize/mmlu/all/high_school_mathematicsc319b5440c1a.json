We can do this by factoring $120$ into its prime factors:\n\n\\[120 = 2^3 \\times 3^1 \\times 5^1\\]\n\nFrom this prime factorization, we see that the odd prime factors are $3$ and $5$. To get the greatest odd factor, we multiply all the odd prime factors together with their highest powers found in the prime factorization of $120$. However, since there's only one power of each odd prime ($3^1$ and $5^1$), we just multiply these together:\n\n\\[Greatest\\ Odd\\ Factor = 3^1 \\times 5^1 = 3 \\times 5 = 15\\]\n\nThus, the greatest odd integer that is a factor of $5!$ is $\\boxed{15}$ (Option C)."
