As long as Timmy has at least one supportive and accepting caregiver, he will have a healthy development.\n\nThe sexual orientation of a child is not determined by the sexual orientation of their parents, so option A cannot be assumed. Similarly, there is no evidence to suggest that children raised by same-sex parents are less popular or have poorer social skills than those raised by opposite-sex parents (option B and D). Research indicates that what matters for a child's healthy development is having a stable, loving home environment, which can be provided by any type of family structure."
