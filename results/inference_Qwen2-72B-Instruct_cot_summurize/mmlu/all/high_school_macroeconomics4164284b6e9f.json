They believe in reducing barriers to production and increasing incentives for work, saving, and investment. Given this perspective, the policy most likely to be preferred by supply-side economists from the options provided would be:\n\nD. a tax credit on capital investment.\n\nThis is because such a tax credit directly incentivizes businesses to invest in capital goods, which can lead to increased productivity and economic growth. Lowering taxes on household income (Option C) might also be favored by supply-side economists as it could potentially increase disposable income and consumer spending, but it is less directly linked to stimulating business investment and production than a tax credit on capital investment."
