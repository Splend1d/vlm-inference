A basic job is typically one that produces goods or services for outside markets and generates income for the local economy, while a non-basic job serves the local population and is supported by the income generated by basic jobs.\n\nA. City firefighter - This could be considered a basic job because it is part of the essential services provided by the city to its residents and businesses, which in turn attract people and companies to the area. However, it's important to note that the definition of \"basic\" and \"non-basic\" jobs can vary depending on the context and the specific economic model being used.\n\nB. Social worker - This is generally a non-basic job as it primarily serves the local population and is funded through local taxes or other local revenue sources.\n\nC. Dry cleaner - This is typically a non-basic job as it provides a service to the local community rather than generating income from outside markets.\n\nD. Garment factory worker - This could be either a basic or non-basic job depending on the market for the garments. If the factory exports its products or sells them outside the local area, it would be considered a basic job because it brings in external income. If it only serves the local market, then it would be a non-basic job.\n\nGiven the information provided, option A (city firefighter) is most likely to be considered a basic job because it is an essential service that helps to maintain the safety and well-being of the city's residents and businesses, indirectly supporting the local economy by enabling other activities to take place. However, this classification can depend on the specific economic theory being applied."
