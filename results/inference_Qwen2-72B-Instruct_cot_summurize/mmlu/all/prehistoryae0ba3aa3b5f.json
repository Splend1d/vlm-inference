This can occur through various means such as conquest, trade, or peaceful cultural exchange. Shared religious symbols and practices can serve as a unifying force that helps to integrate diverse groups under a common identity or belief system. This does not necessarily mean that there was decreased violence, increased peace, increased trade, the use of money, or the end of human sacrifice, although these factors could be associated with religious unification in certain contexts."
