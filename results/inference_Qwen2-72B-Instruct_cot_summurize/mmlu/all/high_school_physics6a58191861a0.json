The equation for the vertical displacement (\\(y\\)) of an object under free fall is given by:\n\n\\[ y = \\frac{1}{2}gt^2 \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\(y\\) is the vertical displacement,\n- \\(g\\) is the acceleration due to gravity (\\(9.81 \\, \\text{m/s}^2\\)),\n- \\(t\\) is the time.\n\nWe're given that the stone falls 80 m (\\(y = 80 \\, \\text{m}\\)). We want to find the time (\\(t\\)) it takes for the stone to reach the water. Substituting the known values into the equation gives us:\n\n\\[ 80 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 9.81 \\times t^2 \\]\n\nSolving for \\(t^2\\):\n\n\\[ t^2 = \\frac{80 \\times 2}{9.81} \\]\n\n\\[ t^2 = \\frac{160}{9.81} \\]\n\n\\[ t^2 \\approx 16.31 \\]\n\nTaking the square root of both sides to solve for \\(t\\):\n\n\\[ t \\approx \\sqrt{16.31} \\]\n\n\\[ t \\approx 4.04 \\, \\text{s} \\]\n\nThe closest answer choice to our calculation is:\n\nC. 4 s"
