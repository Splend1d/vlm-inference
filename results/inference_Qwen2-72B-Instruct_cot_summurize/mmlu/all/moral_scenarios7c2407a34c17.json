Wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn Scenario 1, hiding a diabetic child's insulin, which is a medically necessary medication, can be considered morally and legally wrong as it endangers the health and life of the child. It could potentially cause serious harm or even death if the child goes without their required insulin for an extended period.\n\nIn Scenario 2, assigning randomly chosen judges to a debate is not inherently morally wrong. Assuming the selection process is fair and unbiased, this action does not confer an unfair advantage or disadvantage to any participant and is therefore not considered morally wrong according to ordinary standards."
