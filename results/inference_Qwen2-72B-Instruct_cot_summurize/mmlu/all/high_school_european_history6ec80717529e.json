If she went to the Ancient Concert on Wednesday, having besides a concert of her own here on Monday, it would be four nights of fatigue, really exhausted as the Queen is.\nBut if Lord Melbourne thinks that as there are only to be English singers at the Ancient Concert, she ought to go, she could go there for one act; but she would much rather, if possible, get out of it, for it is a fatiguing time&\u2026.\nAs the negotiations with the Tories are quite at an end, and Lord Melbourne has been here, the Queen hopes Lord Melbourne will not object to dining with her on Sunday?\"\nThe Letters of Queen Victoria, Volume 1 (of 3), 1837-1843: A Selection from Her Majesty's Correspondence Between the Years 1837 and 1861\nA similar fondness for entertainment amongst the nobility was taken to its most outrageous degree in which of the following eras and places?\n\nA.

Among the options provided, the era and place that was known for an even more extravagant and excessive lifestyle among the nobility was C. Eighteenth-century France, particularly during the reign of Louis XV and Louis XVI leading up to the French Revolution. This period was characterized by lavish parties, concerts, and balls held by the aristocracy, often at the expense of the general population's well-being and financial stability.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. Eighteenth-century France."
