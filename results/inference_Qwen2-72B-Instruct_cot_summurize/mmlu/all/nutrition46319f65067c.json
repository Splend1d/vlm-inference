Muscle contains more water than fat\n\nThe reason that an electrical current travels faster through muscle than it does through fat when using bioelectrical impedance for measuring body composition is because muscle tissue contains more water and electrolytes than fat tissue. Water and electrolytes are good conductors of electricity, so the current can flow more easily through muscle tissue than through fat tissue, which has a higher resistance. This difference in conductivity allows bioelectrical impedance to estimate the amount of lean mass (which includes muscle) versus fat mass in the body."
