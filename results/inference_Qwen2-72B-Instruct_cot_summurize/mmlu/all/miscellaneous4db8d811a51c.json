Pairing him with a peer who is friendly and inclusive can encourage social interaction and gradually build his confidence in engaging with others. It's important to choose a partner who is patient and understanding, and who can model positive social behaviors for Ethan to learn from. This approach can facilitate the development of interpersonal relationships by providing a structured and supportive environment for socialization."
