                    "text": "The homeowner's best theory of recovery in this situation would likely be D. that she did not receive notice of cancellation. Most insurance policies require that the insurer provide notice to the insured of any cancellation or lapse in coverage due to non-payment of premiums. This notice must typically be given within a specific time frame and include information about how the insured can reinstate the policy.\n\nIf the homeowner can prove that she did not receive proper notice of cancellation from the insurance company, she may have a valid claim that the policy was still in effect at the time of the fire. This argument could potentially hold up in court, as failing to provide proper notice of cancellation can be seen as a breach of contract by the insurance company.\n\nOptions A, B, and C are less likely to succeed as theories of recovery:\n\nA. Although she failed to make the last two premium payments, there was a bargained-for exchange: This argument does not address the fact that the homeowner breached the terms of the contract by failing to make the required premium payments. The insurance company's obligation to pay out claims is contingent upon the homeowner fulfilling their end of the agreement, which includes timely payment of premiums.\n\nB. The insurance company's duty to pay was not expressly conditioned on the homeowner's duty to make the payments: This statement is generally incorrect. Insurance policies clearly state that the insurer's duty to pay is contingent upon the insured meeting certain conditions, including the payment of premiums.\n\nC. The insurance company was under an independent duty to pay for the loss: This argument ignores the contractual nature of the relationship between the homeowner and the insurance company. The insurer's duty to pay is not independent but rather is based on the terms of the insurance contract, which includes the requirement for the homeowner to pay premiums."
