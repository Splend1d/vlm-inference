The Truman Doctrine, articulated by President Harry S. Truman in 1947, marked a significant shift in U.S. foreign policy, signaling a commitment to contain the spread of communism globally. This doctrine set the stage for the United States' active involvement in various conflicts around the world during the Cold War era, as it pledged support to countries threatened by totalitarian regimes, particularly those aligned with the Soviet Union. This approach was a cornerstone of U.S. foreign policy throughout the Cold War, influencing actions in regions from Southeast Asia to Latin America."
