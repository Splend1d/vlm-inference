The three-story building had a store on the ground floor and apartments on the other two floors. The investor entered into a leasehold agreement with a tenant, who would lease the first floor, where she planned to open a sporting goods store. After identifying the parties, the operative words of the lease were as follows: \"Landlord hereby agrees to lease for the three years the first floor of his building in the city to tenant, reserving unto said landlord annual rental in the sum of $12,000 payable in advance in monthly installments of $1,000. \"After the tenant took possession and the investor accepted her rent payment for the first floor of the building, which of the following most accurately describes the legal relationship between the parties?\n\nA. A tenancy at will was created.\nB. A periodic tenancy from month-to-month was created.\nC. A periodic tenancy from year-to-year was created.\nD. The tenant's equitable three-year term became a legal three-year term.\n"

                    "text": "The legal relationship between the parties, based on the lease terms provided, is a periodic tenancy from year-to-year. This is because the lease specifies a fixed term of three years and an annual rental amount of $12,000, which is to be paid in advance in monthly installments of $1,000. This arrangement does not fit the definition of a tenancy at will or a month-to-month tenancy, as it has a defined term and rent is specified on an annual basis.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. A periodic tenancy from year-to-year was created.\n\nHowever, it should be noted that while the tenancy is technically for a period of years (three years), the payments and renewals happen on a monthly basis, which might lead some to think this is a month-to-month tenancy. But since the lease specifically states a three-year term and annual rent, the most accurate description is a year-to-year tenancy, even though the payments are made monthly."
