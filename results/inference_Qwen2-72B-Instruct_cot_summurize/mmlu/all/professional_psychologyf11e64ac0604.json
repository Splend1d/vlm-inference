This design can give an indication of age-related differences, but it does not account for cohort effects or individual changes over time. Therefore, if the psychologist uses a cross-sectional design and finds that intelligence test scores are lower in older age groups compared to younger age groups, it may suggest that intelligence declines with age. However, this conclusion would be limited by the fact that the study did not follow the same individuals over time, so it cannot definitively determine whether intelligence actually declines in early adulthood or whether the observed differences are due to other factors such as generational differences or historical events that affected certain age groups differently. \n\nIn contrast, a longitudinal study would follow the same individuals over time and could provide more reliable evidence of age-related changes in intelligence. A cross-sequential design combines elements of both cross-sectional and longitudinal designs by comparing multiple cohorts at different time points, which can help to disentangle age effects from cohort effects. An analogue design involves creating a simulated situation that resembles a real-world scenario, but is not directly related to the question of age and intelligence."
