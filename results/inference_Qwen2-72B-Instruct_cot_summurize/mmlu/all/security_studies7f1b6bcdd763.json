Whilst pandemics present a direct risk to national security, they also have the potential to undermine wider international stability.\nC.

The existing mechanisms for monitoring and treating infectious disease within the international system are capable of effectively containing pandemic outbreaks.\n\nThis statement does not accurately characterize our understanding of disease pandemics within the contemporary international political system because, despite efforts to improve global health security, there have been numerous instances where existing mechanisms have proven insufficient to contain or adequately respond to pandemic outbreaks. For example, the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic have highlighted significant gaps in global preparedness and response capabilities."
