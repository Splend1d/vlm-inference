                    "text": "The correct answer is B.\n\nWhen the retiree passed away, he left the property to his daughter and his friend as joint tenants with the right of survivorship. This means that when one of the joint tenants dies, their share of the property automatically passes to the surviving joint tenant(s), bypassing the probate process.\n\nIn 1999, the daughter conveyed her interest in the northeast quarter of the farm to the co-worker, severing the joint tenancy for that portion of the property and creating a tenancy in common between herself and the co-worker for the northeast quarter. The daughter retained her joint tenancy interest in the rest of the farm with the friend.\n\nIn 2008, the lender sold the daughter's interest in the south half of the farm at an execution sale to the nephew. This sale would have severed the joint tenancy for the south half of the farm, converting it into a tenancy in common between the daughter (or her estate) and the friend. However, since the daughter had already conveyed her interest in the northeast quarter, only her interest in the southwest quarter would have been sold to the nephew. Thus, the friend and the nephew became tenants in common for the south half of the farm.\n\nUpon the daughter's death in 2009, her interest in the northwest quarter of the farm passed to her surviving joint tenant, the friend, due to the right of survivorship. Her interest in the northeast quarter (held in tenancy in common with the co-worker) and her interest in the southwest quarter (held in tenancy in common with the friend and the nephew) passed to her husband as her sole heir since she died intestate.\n\nTherefore, the friend and the co-worker are tenants in common of the northeast quarter of the farm; the friend is the owner in fee of the northwest quarter of the farm; and the friend and the nephew are tenants in common of the south half of the farm."
