May be helpful in diverticular disease - True, fiber supplements can help prevent constipation and strain during bowel movements, which may reduce the risk of diverticular disease.\nB. Are always easily fermented by colonic bacteria - False, not all fiber supplements are easily fermented by colonic bacteria. Some types of fiber supplements, such as insoluble fiber, are not fermentable.\nC. Are usually derived from soluble fiber sources - False, fiber supplements can be derived from both soluble and insoluble fiber sources.\nD. Should be avoided in constipation - False, fiber supplements are often recommended for constipation because they can help add bulk to the stool and make it easier to pass. However, it is important to drink plenty of water when taking fiber supplements to avoid worsening constipation."
