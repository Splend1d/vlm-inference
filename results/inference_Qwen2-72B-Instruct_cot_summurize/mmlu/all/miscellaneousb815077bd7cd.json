Vaccination against parvovirus is a standard part of the vaccination protocol for dogs to protect them from this serious illness. While cats can get a similar but distinct virus called feline panleukopenia virus (FPV) which is also a type of parvovirus, the term \"parvovirus\" in the context of pets typically refers to canine parvovirus. Cats have their own vaccine for FPV as part of their core vaccinations. Hamsters and birds do not receive vaccinations for parvovirus as they are not susceptible to canine or feline parvovirus."
