Program evaluation questions are often identified through the needs of a program\u2019s staff and stakeholders, while traditional research questions are identified by researchers using previous, existing research.\nB. Program evaluation uses unique quantitative and qualitative methodologies to collect data. These methods are different from those that are used in traditional research.\nC. Traditional research and program evaluation have different aims. Traditional research aims to test existing theories and discover generalizable knowledge, while program evaluation aims to collect information important for timely decision-making.\nD. Both traditional research and program evaluation may incorporate rigorous and systematic ways of collecting data in order to address their aims.\n"

These methods are different from those that are used in traditional research.\n\nThis statement is not necessarily true. While it's correct that program evaluation can use various methodologies, the methods used in program evaluation are not inherently unique or distinct from those used in traditional research. Both program evaluation and traditional research can utilize similar quantitative and qualitative methods such as surveys, interviews, observations, and statistical analysis. The primary differences lie in the purpose, focus, and context of the research or evaluation, rather than the specific methods employed."
