These components are responsible for transmitting signals between the central nervous system (the brain and spinal cord) and the rest of the body.\n\nHere's a breakdown of each choice:\n\nA. The brain and spinal cord are part of the central nervous system, not the peripheral nervous system. Cranial nerves are part of the peripheral nervous system.\n\nB. This choice correctly identifies components of the peripheral nervous system: cranial nerves, spinal nerves, and autonomic ganglia.\n\nC. The spinal cord is part of the central nervous system, not the peripheral nervous system. Spinal nerves and sense organs are part of the peripheral nervous system.\n\nD. The medulla, pons, and thalamus are all parts of the brain and therefore belong to the central nervous system, not the peripheral nervous system."
