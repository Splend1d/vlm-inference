The school psychologist has included achievement and aptitude scores as predictor variables for firstyear high school GPA in a regression analysis and is considering whether to also administer a school interest inventory and include those scores. The major concern of the school psychologist when making this decision should be which of the following?\n\nA. The intercorrelation of the aptitude and achievement test scores\nB. The degree to which the school interest inventory score raises the multiple correlation when it is included as a predictor variable of first-year high school GPA\nC. The zero-order correlation of first-year high school GPA and the school interest inventory score\nD.

The degree to which the school interest inventory score raises the multiple correlation when it is included as a predictor variable of first-year high school GPA.\n\nThis is because the primary goal in this context is to improve the prediction of first-year high school GPAs by adding another predictor variable. Including a new variable, such as the school interest inventory score, will only be beneficial if it significantly increases the predictive power of the model beyond what the existing variables (aptitude and achievement scores) can explain. This is assessed by the change in the multiple correlation coefficient (R-squared), which indicates how much variance in the criterion variable (first-year high school GPA) is explained by the set of predictor variables together.\n\nAdding a variable that does not significantly increase the R-squared value would not contribute meaningfully to the prediction and could unnecessarily complicate the model. Therefore, the school psychologist should be interested in knowing whether the inclusion of the school interest inventory scores adds significant predictive value over and above the other variables already in the model."
