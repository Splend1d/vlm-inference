Light-textured soils like loamy sand have larger particle sizes and drain water quickly, so they need more frequent irrigation to keep the soil moist enough for the corn crop. Heavy-textured soils like silty clay can hold more water, so they don't need as much or as frequent irrigation. However, if the soil is too wet, it can lead to problems like root rot, so it's important to balance irrigation with good drainage. Moderate and frequent irrigation would be most appropriate for a corn crop growing in a light-textured soil like loamy sand. The humidity level of the region can also affect how much water the crop needs, but it is not directly related to the type of soil."
