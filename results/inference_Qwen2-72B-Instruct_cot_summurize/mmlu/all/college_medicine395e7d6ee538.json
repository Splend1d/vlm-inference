Creatine supplements can increase muscle strength and power.\n\nWhile increasing protein intake can support muscle growth, especially when paired with resistance training, the specific amount needed varies depending on factors such as activity level, age, and overall health, but generally, recommendations do not exceed 2 grams per kg body mass per day for most active individuals. Amino acid supplements might help in certain contexts, but their effectiveness can vary widely based on diet, exercise regimen, and individual needs. Muscle damage is typically associated with eccentric (lengthening) contractions rather than shortening contractions.\n\nCreatine supplementation has been shown to be effective in increasing muscle strength and power, particularly in high-intensity, short-duration exercises like weightlifting or sprinting. It helps by increasing the availability of energy in muscles during short bursts of activity."
