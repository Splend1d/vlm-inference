                    "text": "To find the probability that the product of the numbers obtained when three standard dice are tossed is equal to \\(180\\), we need to identify all possible combinations of three numbers from the set \\(\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}\\) (the numbers on a die) that multiply to \\(180\\).\n\nFirst, let's factorize \\(180\\) into its prime factors:\n\\[180 = 2^2 \\times 3^2 \\times 5\\]\n\nNow, we need to distribute these prime factors among three numbers such that each number is between \\(1\\) and \\(6\\). The only way to do this using the numbers on a die is by distributing the prime factors as follows:\n\n- \\(2^2\\) can be distributed as \\(4\\).\n- \\(3^2\\) can be distributed as \\(9\\), but since \\(9\\) is not on a die, it must be broken down further. The only combination that works is \\(3\\) and \\(3\\).\n- \\(5\\) remains as \\(5\\).\n\nThus, the only combination that works for the product of \\(180\\) with the constraint of each number being between \\(1\\) and \\(6\\) is \\(4\\), \\(3\\), and \\(5\\), which can be permuted in any order.\n\nThe permutations of \\(4\\), \\(3\\), and \\(5\\) are:\n- \\(4, 3, 5\\)\n- \\(4, 5, 3\\)\n- \\(3, 4, 5\\)\n- \\(3, 5, 4\\)\n- \\(5, 3, 4\\)\n- \\(5, 4, 3\\)\n\nThere are \\(6\\) possible outcomes that satisfy the condition \\(abc = 180\\).\n\nSince there are \\(6\\) sides on each die, there are a total of \\(6^3 = 216\\) possible outcomes when three dice are rolled.\n\nTherefore, the probability of obtaining a product of \\(180\\) when rolling three dice is:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\\text{Total number of outcomes}} = \\frac{6}{216} = \\frac{1}{36}\n\\]\n\nHowever, none of the given options match \\(\\frac{1}{36}\\). It seems there was an oversight in interpreting the answer choices provided. Given the options, the closest match based on the analysis would be:\n\nA. \\(\\frac{1}{30}\\)\n\nBut considering the analysis, none of the provided options directly match the calculated probability of \\(\\frac{1}{36}\\). However, the question and answer choices suggest a potential misinterpretation or error in the options given, as \\(\\frac{1}{36}\\) isn't listed. Based on the provided answer choices, none accurately reflect the calculation. Yet, if forced to choose from the options given, none of them (\\(A, B, C, D\\)) match the correct probability calculation of \\(\\frac{1}{36}\\). \n\nIt's important to note that the question and answer choice discrepancy indicates either a misprint or an error in the original problem statement or the given options."
