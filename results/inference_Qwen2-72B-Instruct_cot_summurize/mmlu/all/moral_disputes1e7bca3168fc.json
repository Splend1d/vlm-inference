                    "text": "According to Immanuel Kant's moral philosophy, particularly his categorical imperative, actions are morally right if they can be universalized as a law that everyone could follow without contradiction. This principle is often summarized as \"Act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law.\"\n\nApplying this principle to the options given:\n\nA. Masturbation - Kantian ethics places a strong emphasis on the respect for persons and treating individuals as ends in themselves rather than as means to an end. Masturbation does not involve another person, so it might not directly violate the categorical imperative. However, Kant also argues that humans have a duty to cultivate their rational capacities and to maintain self-control. Some interpretations of Kantian ethics might argue that masturbation could be seen as failing to exercise proper self-control or as objectifying oneself, which would be contrary to Kant's moral principles.\n\nB. Engage in prostitution - According to Kant, one must never treat others merely as means to an end but always as ends in themselves. Prostitution involves using another person's body for one's own pleasure, which can be seen as treating the prostitute as a mere means to an end, thus violating Kant's moral philosophy.\n\nC. Engage in consensual sexual activity outside of marriage - Kant believed that sexual relations should occur within the bounds of marriage because he viewed marriage as a mutual contract that respects both parties as autonomous beings. He argued that marriage is the only context in which sexual relations can be morally justified because it is the only relationship that fully acknowledges and respects the autonomy and humanity of both partners. Therefore, according to Kant, engaging in consensual sexual activity outside of marriage would not be morally permissible.\n\nGiven these considerations, the answer closest to Kant's view would be D. None of the above. However, it's important to note that Kant's views on sexuality are complex and have been subject to various interpretations, and some scholars might argue differently based on different readings of Kant's work."
