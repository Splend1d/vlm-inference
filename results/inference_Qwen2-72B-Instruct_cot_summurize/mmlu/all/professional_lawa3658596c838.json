The informant gave a detailed description of the two men and the license number of the vehicle. A patrol car was immediately dispatched to the movie theater. A few minutes later, the police saw a car matching the description given parked about two blocks from the movie theater. When the police approached, they saw one man fitting the description provided. The police proceeded to the car and opened the doors of the vehicle. The police then pried open a locked tool case that was situated in the rear of the vehicle. Inside, the police found an envelope that contained about one gram of cocaine. They then placed the driver of the vehicle under arrest. Immediately thereafter, the police opened the glove compartment and found a small amount of marijuana. The driver of the van was subsequently prosecuted and charged with two counts of possession of controlled dangerous substances. He filed a motion to exclude the cocaine and marijuana from evidence. His motion will most likely be\n\nA. granted, as to the cocaine only.\nB. granted, as to the marijuana only.\nC. granted, as to both the cocaine and the marijuana.\nD. denied, as to the cocaine and the marijuana.\n"

The information from the informant may have justified stopping the vehicle and perhaps even searching it if there were exigent circumstances (such as the suspects actively engaged in illegal activity), but prying open a locked container without a warrant or probable cause that contraband is present is generally considered a violation of the Fourth Amendment protection against unreasonable searches and seizures. Similarly, opening the glove compartment after the arrest would also require justification, such as consent from the driver or probable cause based on plain view or another exception to the warrant requirement. Without such justification, the evidence obtained from these searches could be excluded under the exclusionary rule."
