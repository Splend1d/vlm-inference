This means that \\(\\frac{1}{2} * \\frac{X}{2} = \\frac{X}{4}\\) students remain in the class.\n\nGiven that there are 8 students remaining in the class, we can set up the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{X}{4} = 8\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\(X\\), we multiply both sides by 4:\n\n\\[\nX = 8 * 4 = 32\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the original number of students was 32.\n\nThe correct answer is D. 32 students."
