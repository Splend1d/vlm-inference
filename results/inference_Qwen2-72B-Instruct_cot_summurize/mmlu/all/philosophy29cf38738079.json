However, Moore argues against this identification, stating that it commits what he calls the \"naturalistic fallacy.\" He posits that \"good\" is a non-natural property, indefinable in terms of natural properties like pleasure. Therefore, according to Moore, saying \"pleasure is good\" is meaningful only if one means that pleasure and goodness are identical, but he then rejects this identity as a fallacy.\n\nThus, the correct answer, given Moore's position, would be:\n\nA. goodness and pleasure are the same thing.\n\nBut it's important to note that Moore himself does not hold this view; rather, he uses it to set up his argument against identifying \"good\" with any natural property, including pleasure."
