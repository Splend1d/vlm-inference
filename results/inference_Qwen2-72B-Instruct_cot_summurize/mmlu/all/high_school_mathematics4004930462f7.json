Plugging these values into the formula gives:\n\n\\[d = \\sqrt{(12 - 0)^2 + (-5 - 0)^2} = \\sqrt{144 + 25} = \\sqrt{169} = 13\\]\n\nSo, the distance from the origin to the center of the circle is 13 units. Since the radius of the circle is 3 units, the shortest distance from the origin to the circle is:\n\n\\[13 - 3 = 10\\]\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. 10."
