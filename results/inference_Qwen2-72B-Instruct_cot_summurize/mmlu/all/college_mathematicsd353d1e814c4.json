Closure: For all \\(a, b\\) in the set, the result of the operation \\(a \\cdot b\\) is also in the set.\n2. Associativity: For all \\(a, b, c\\) in the set, \\((a \\cdot b) \\cdot c = a \\cdot (b \\cdot c)\\).\n3. Identity element: There exists an element \\(e\\) in the set such that for every element \\(a\\) in the set, the equations \\(e \\cdot a\\) and \\(a \\cdot e\\) return \\(a\\).\n4. Inverse element: For each \\(a\\) in the set, there exists an element \\(b\\) in the set such that \\(a \\cdot b = e\\) and \\(b \\cdot a = e\\), where \\(e\\) is the identity element.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **The integers under addition**:\n- Closure: Yes, the sum of two integers is always an integer.\n- Associativity: Yes, addition is associative.\n- Identity element: Yes, 0 is the identity element because \\(a + 0 = a\\) for any integer \\(a\\).\n- Inverse element: Yes, for any integer \\(a\\), there exists \\(-a\\) such that \\(a + (-a) = 0\\).\n\nSo, the integers under addition do form a group.\n\nB. **The nonzero integers under multiplication**:\n- Closure: Yes, the product of two nonzero integers is always a nonzero integer.\n- Associativity: Yes, multiplication is associative.\n- Identity element: Yes, 1 is the identity element because \\(a \\cdot 1 = a\\) for any nonzero integer \\(a\\).\n- Inverse element: No, not all nonzero integers have a multiplicative inverse that is also an integer. For example, the multiplicative inverse of 2 is \\(1/2\\), which is not an integer.\n\nThus, the nonzero integers under multiplication do not form a group because they fail the condition of having an inverse element for all elements.\n\nC. **The nonzero real numbers under multiplication**:\n- Closure: Yes, the product of two nonzero real numbers is always a nonzero real number.\n- Associativity: Yes, multiplication is associative.\n- Identity element: Yes, 1 is the identity element because \\(a \\cdot 1 = a\\) for any nonzero real number \\(a\\).\n- Inverse element: Yes, for any nonzero real number \\(a\\), there exists \\(1/a\\) such that \\(a \\cdot (1/a) = 1\\).\n\nTherefore, the nonzero real numbers under multiplication do form a group.\n\nD. **The complex numbers under addition**:\n- Closure: Yes, the sum of two complex numbers is always a complex number.\n- Associativity: Yes, addition is associative.\n- Identity element: Yes, 0 (the complex number 0 + 0i) is the identity element because \\(a + 0 = a\\) for any complex number \\(a\\).\n- Inverse element: Yes, for any complex number \\(a + bi\\), there exists \\(-(a + bi) = -a - bi\\) such that \\((a + bi) + (-a - bi) = 0\\).\n\nHence, the complex numbers under addition do form a group.\n\nIn conclusion, the answer is **B. The nonzero integers under multiplication**, as this does not satisfy the group axioms due to the lack of inverses for all elements."
