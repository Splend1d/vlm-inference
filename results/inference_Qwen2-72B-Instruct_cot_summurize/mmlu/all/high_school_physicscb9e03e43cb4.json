According to the first law of thermodynamics:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta U = Q - W\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\Delta U\\) is the change in internal energy, \\(Q\\) is the heat transferred to the system, and \\(W\\) is the work done by the system.\n\nGiven that \\(\\Delta U = 0\\) for an isothermal process (since \\(U\\) is only a function of temperature for an ideal gas), we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n\\[\n0 = Q - W\n\\]\n\nor\n\n\\[\nQ = W\n\\]\n\nSince the work done by the gas is 150 J, the heat added to the gas must also be 150 J to maintain the internal energy at a constant value.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\nA. 150 J of heat was added to the gas."
