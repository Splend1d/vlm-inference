Fearing that the girl would beat out her daughter for the last cheerleading position, the mother decided to kill the girl. One night while the mother and her boyfriend were having dinner, the mother asked him to kill the girl. The mother handed her boyfriend a gun and gave him the home address where the girl lived. Unknown to the boyfriend, the mother gave him the wrong address. By mistake, the boyfriend went to the home of a family who lived across the street from the girl. The boyfriend rang the doorbell and a woman opened the door. The boyfriend asked the woman if her daughter was home. The woman called for her daughter to come to the front door. When she did so, the boyfriend shot and killed both the woman and her daughter. The mother should be found guilty for which, if any, of the following crimes?\n\nA. Conspiracy and voluntary manslaughter.\nB. Conspiracy, attempted murder, and two counts of murder.\nC. Solicitation and two counts of murder.\nD. Solicitation and attempted murder.\n"

She planned to have the girl killed and solicited her boyfriend to carry out the murder. Although the murder was not carried out on the intended victim due to a mistake, the mother's actions led to the death of an innocent woman and her daughter.\n\nSolicitation is a crime because the mother asked her boyfriend to commit a crime (murder). Attempted murder could also apply because she took steps toward committing a murder by providing the means (the gun) and the target's location (even though it was incorrect).\n\nHowever, the deaths that occurred were not a direct result of the mother's actions but rather a consequence of her boyfriend's actions based on the information she provided. In legal terms, this could still fall under the doctrine of transferred intent, meaning the intent to harm one individual is transferred to the actual victim(s) when the harm is mistakenly inflicted on someone else.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most appropriate answer choice from the options provided would be:\n\nB. Conspiracy, attempted murder, and two counts of murder.\n\nConspiracy because she and her boyfriend had an agreement to commit a crime (murder), attempted murder because she took steps towards committing the crime but the intended victim was not harmed, and two counts of murder because her actions indirectly led to the deaths of two individuals. However, it's important to note that specific charges can vary based on jurisdiction and the precise interpretation of the law."
