Language - The left hemisphere is usually responsible for processing and understanding language, including speech production and comprehension.\n\nB. Logic - The left hemisphere is often associated with logical thinking and analytical reasoning.\n\nC. Analytical reasoning - This is another function that is typically handled by the left hemisphere, which tends to focus on detail-oriented tasks and linear thinking.\n\nD. Mathematical reasoning - The left hemisphere is also generally dominant for mathematical skills and calculations.\n\nSo, all of the options A, B, C, and D are correct as they are all functions that the left hemisphere of the brain is dominant for in most people. However, it's important to note that the right hemisphere plays a crucial role in many cognitive processes as well, such as spatial awareness, facial recognition, and processing music and art."
