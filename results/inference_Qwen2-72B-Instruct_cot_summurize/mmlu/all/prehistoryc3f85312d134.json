This culture was adapted to a forested and lakeside environment, relying heavily on hunting, fishing, and gathering for sustenance. They were known for their distinctive stone tools, such as microliths, which were used in composite hunting weapons like arrows and spears. The Maglemosian people also utilized waterways for transportation and fishing, making them well-suited to a lifestyle in close proximity to forests and bodies of water."
