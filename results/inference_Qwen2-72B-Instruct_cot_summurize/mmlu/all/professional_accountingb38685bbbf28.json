We also need to calculate the Average Daily Sales on Credit.\n\nFirst, we subtract the cash sales from total sales to get only the credit sales:\n\n\\[ \\text{Credit Sales} = \\text{Total Sales} - \\text{Cash Sales} = \\$265\\text{M} - \\$25\\text{M} = \\$240\\text{M} \\]\n\nThen, we find the Average Daily Sales on Credit:\n\n\\[ \\text{Average Daily Sales on Credit} = \\frac{\\text{Credit Sales}}{\\text{Number of Days in a Year}} = \\frac{\\$240\\text{M}}{365} \\approx \\$657,534.25 \\]\n\nNow we rearrange the ACP formula to solve for Average Accounts Receivable:\n\n\\[ \\text{Average Accounts Receivable} = \\frac{\\text{Average Collection Period} \\times \\text{Average Daily Sales on Credit}}{\\text{Number of Days in a Year}} \\]\n\nHowever, since we're looking for the ending balance and the question provides an average collection period, we'll assume that the ending balance is approximately equal to the average balance for simplicity, as no additional information is given about how the accounts receivable changed throughout the year. Therefore:\n\n\\[ \\text{Average Accounts Receivable} = \\text{Ending Accounts Receivable} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Ending Accounts Receivable} = \\text{Average Collection Period} \\times \\text{Average Daily Sales on Credit} = 36 \\times \\$657,534.25 = \\$23,671,233 \\]\n\nRounding to the nearest million gives us:\n\n\\[ \\text{Ending Accounts Receivable} \\approx \\$23.7\\text{M} \\]\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nB. $23.7 million"
