Late at night after studying, he would often walk around the campus dressed only in a raincoat and boxers. As he approached young women, he would flash them by opening his raincoat and exposing himself in his shorts. The student believed that he was committing a crime by flashing himself in front of the co-eds. In this jurisdiction, it is a felony to flash or expose oneself in the nude, so, unknown to the student, what he was doing was not a crime. One night, the student broke into a sorority house intending to flash the sorority sisters. Clad only in his raincoat and shorts, he entered the bedroom of one of the sisters who was lying in her bed studying for an exam. The sister, who knew the student, said, \"What are you doing here? Shouldn't you be studying for finals?\" The student then took off his raincoat and responded, \"Study this, baby!\" He then began to run through the sorority house in his shorts. Shortly thereafter, the police arrived and placed the student under arrest. If the student is prosecuted, he should be found guilty of which, if any, of the following crimes?\n\nA. Burglary only.\nB. Attempted violation of the statute.\nC. Both burglary and attempted violation of the statute.\nD. Neither burglary nor attempted violation of the statute.\n"

                    "text": "The student could potentially be charged with both burglary and attempted violation of the statute, but since the act he intended to commit (flashing) is not actually a crime as defined in this jurisdiction (since he was wearing shorts), the charge of attempting to violate the statute might not stick. However, the student did break into a sorority house with the intent to commit an act that he believed to be criminal, which constitutes burglary. \n\nBurglary typically involves entering a building unlawfully with the intent to commit a crime inside. Since the student broke into the sorority house with the intent to flash the sorority sisters, he meets the criteria for burglary regardless of whether the specific act he intended to commit was actually illegal.\n\nAs for the attempted violation of the statute, since the act of flashing while wearing shorts is not illegal in this jurisdiction, the student cannot be charged with attempting to violate a non-existent law. However, some jurisdictions may still consider the act of indecent exposure with the intent to shock or offend as disorderly conduct or a similar offense, even if full nudity is not involved.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most likely charges that could stick would be burglary. Therefore, the answer would lean towards:\n\nA. Burglary only.\n\nHowever, depending on local statutes and how they define \"indecent exposure\" or related offenses, there could be additional charges such as disorderly conduct or harassment. But based on the information provided, the student's actions do not meet the criteria for a violation of the specific flashing statute because he was not nude."
