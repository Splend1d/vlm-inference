As a wedding present to the inventor's brother, the inventor wrote on a wedding card she gave to her brother:\"I hereby assign to you 20 percent of the net profits realized from the production and distribution of my automobile engine within the first year of production. \"The inventor then borrowed money from creditors and began to promote her automobile engine. She was contacted by a major automobile manufacturer about the possibility of using the engine in a new line of cars the manufacturer intended to release during the next calendar year. While on her way to meet with the representatives of the manufacturer, the inventor was killed in an automobile collision. The manufacturer then contracted with the executor of the inventor's estate to license the use of the automobile engine design for a 10-year period for $500,000, payable to the estate. The creditors from whom the inventor borrowed the money to promote her automobile engine have now attached the proceeds from the licensing agreement, which have so far been paid into the estate. The brother also asserts his assigned rights to a share of the proceeds. In subsequent actions by the creditors and the brother, the court will most probably hold in favor of\n\nA. the brother, because the rights of an assignee are superior to a lien against the assignor subsequently obtained by legallequitable proceedings.\nB. the brother, because any proceeds of the assigned right received by the assignor thereafter are held in constructive trust for the assignee.\nC. the creditors, because the inventor's assignment to the brother was unenforceable as a defective assignment.\nD. the creditors, because the rights of creditors/lienors are superior to those of a donee beneficiary.\n"

This means that once the inventor assigned 20% of the net profits to her brother, those profits became his property and the inventor was merely holding them in trust for him. Therefore, even though the creditors may have had a lien on the inventor's assets, they do not have a claim to the brother's portion of the proceeds from the licensing agreement. So the correct answer is B."
