(\u2203x)[(Hx \u2022 Bx) \u2022 Mx]\n\nExplanation:\nLet's break down the statement \"Some blue herons migrate\" and translate it into predicate logic:\n\n- \"Some\" indicates that there exists at least one individual.\n- \"Blue herons\" can be represented as (Hx \u2022 Bx), where Hx stands for \"x is a heron\" and Bx stands for \"x is blue.\"\n- \"Migrate\" can be represented as Mx, where Mx stands for \"x migrates.\"\n\nPutting it all together, we get: (\u2203x)[(Hx \u2022 Bx) \u2022 Mx], which reads \"There exists an x such that x is a heron, x is blue, and x migrates.\" This accurately captures the meaning of the original statement. \n\nOption A, (\u2200x)[(Hx \u2022 Bx) \u2022 Mx], would mean that every blue heron migrates, which is not what the original statement asserts.\n\nOption B, (\u2203x)[(Hx \u2022 Bx) \u2283 Mx], would mean that if there exists a blue heron, then it migrates. This doesn't capture the fact that there are some blue herons that migrate; it only implies a conditional relationship.\n\nOption C, (\u2200x)[(Hx \u2022 Bx) \u2283 Mx], would mean that if something is a blue heron, then it must migrate. Again, this goes beyond what the original statement claims."
