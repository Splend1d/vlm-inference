Without a strong magnetic field, the solar wind stripped away most of the atmosphere, significantly reducing the greenhouse effect and cooling Mars down. Mars's weak magnetic field could not protect the atmosphere from being stripped away by the solar wind, leading to a loss of gases that contribute to the greenhouse effect, such as carbon dioxide. As a result, the planet cooled down over time."
