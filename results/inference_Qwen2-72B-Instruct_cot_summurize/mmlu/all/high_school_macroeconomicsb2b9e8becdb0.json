                    "text": "The scenario you've presented involves two factors that affect the economy in opposite directions:\n\n1. **Technology making production less expensive**: This typically leads to an increase in productivity, meaning more output can be produced with the same amount of inputs. This can lead to lower costs for goods and services, potentially increasing the quantity supplied and lowering prices (assuming demand remains constant). If the increased productivity is widespread across many sectors, it could contribute to an increase in real GDP.\n\n2. **Decrease in exports**: Exports are one component of aggregate demand (along with consumption, investment, and government spending). A decrease in exports means there's less demand for domestic goods and services from foreign buyers, which can lead to a decrease in overall economic activity and potentially lower real GDP.\n\nGiven these two opposing effects, it's not possible to say with certainty how real GDP or the price level will change without knowing the relative magnitude of each effect. However, if we must choose from the options provided and assuming that the decrease in exports significantly outweighs the positive effects of technological improvements on production costs, then:\n\n**B. Real GDP will decrease.**\n\nThis choice assumes that the negative impact of decreased exports on aggregate demand is greater than the positive impact of increased productivity due to technological advancements. This could lead to a situation where, despite lower production costs, the decrease in demand (due to lower exports) causes firms to produce less, leading to a decrease in real GDP. \n\nIt's important to note that the price level could go either way under this scenario, depending on the specific conditions of supply and demand within the economy. If the decrease in exports leads to excess supply, prices might fall (option D), but if other factors like cost-push inflation or supply constraints are at play, prices might rise instead (option C). Without additional information, we cannot determine the price level's direction with certainty."
