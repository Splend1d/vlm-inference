                    "text": "The correct answer is D. Increased hydrostatic pressure.\n\nWhen the efferent arteriole is constricted, it reduces the outflow of blood from the glomerulus. This constriction increases the pressure within the glomerular capillaries because the volume of blood entering the glomerulus through the afferent arteriole remains unchanged while the exit is restricted. As a result, the hydrostatic pressure within the glomerulus rises. This increase in hydrostatic pressure will enhance the filtration force and can lead to an increase in glomerular filtration rate (GFR), assuming that the other Starling forces remain relatively constant.\n\nThe filtration coefficient (Kf) is not directly affected by changes in efferent arteriolar resistance; it depends on the permeability of the glomerular filtration barrier and the surface area available for filtration.\n\nThe oncotic pressure in the glomerular capillaries is mainly determined by the concentration of plasma proteins, which is not altered by the constriction of the efferent arteriole. However, over time, if the increased hydrostatic pressure leads to more filtration, this could dilute the protein concentration in the remaining plasma and thus decrease the oncotic pressure slightly, but this is not the immediate effect of efferent arteriole constriction."
