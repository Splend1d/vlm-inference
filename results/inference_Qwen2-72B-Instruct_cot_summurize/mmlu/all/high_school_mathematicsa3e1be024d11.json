The vertices of the cube can be paired such that each pair consists of opposite vertices, i.e., vertices connected by a space diagonal.\n\nThe product at each vertex will be given by one number from each pair of opposite faces. Since there are 8 vertices, we can pair them up in the following way:\n\n- \\((a, d)\\) \n- \\((b, e)\\)\n- \\((c, f)\\)\n\nThus, the sum of the products at the vertices is given by:\n\\[S = abe + acf + ade + bcf + abd + acd + bce + def\\]\n\nNotice that this expression can be factored into:\n\\[S = (a+d)(b+e)(c+f)\\]\n\nGiven that \\(S = 1001\\), and knowing that \\(1001 = 7 \\times 11 \\times 13\\), we can infer that:\n\\[(a+d)(b+e)(c+f) = 7 \\times 11 \\times 13\\]\n\nSince \\(a, b, c, d, e,\\) and \\(f\\) are all positive integers, and since \\(7, 11,\\) and \\(13\\) are prime numbers, it follows that \\((a+d), (b+e),\\) and \\((c+f)\\) must correspond to these primes (or their multiples, but since they are already prime, the sums themselves must be \\(7, 11,\\) and \\(13\\) respectively).\n\nTherefore, the sum of the numbers written on the faces is:\n\\[S_{faces} = (a+d) + (b+e) + (c+f) = 7 + 11 + 13 = 31\\]\n\nHence, the answer is \\(\\boxed{D. 31}\\)."
