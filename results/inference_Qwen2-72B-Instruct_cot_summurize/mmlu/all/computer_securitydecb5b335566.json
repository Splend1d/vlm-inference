Taking care to avoid activities during a penetration test that might attract attention, e.g., by operators or IDS services.\n\nBeing stealthy during a penetration test means taking measures to minimize detection while conducting the assessment. This can include avoiding actions that would trigger alerts on intrusion detection systems (IDS), not overwhelming network resources, and generally trying to blend in with normal network traffic as much as possible. The goal is to simulate a real-world attack scenario where the attacker would also try to remain undetected."
