(ii) and (iv) only\n\nAdding lagged values of the variables to the regression equation (ii) and trying a model in first differenced form rather than in levels (iv) are plausible approaches to dealing with residual autocorrelation. Taking logarithms of each of the variables (i) can help stabilize variance but does not specifically address autocorrelation. Using dummy variables to remove outlying observations (iii) is not a direct method for addressing autocorrelation, as it deals more with removing the influence of outliers rather than correcting for correlation between residuals."
