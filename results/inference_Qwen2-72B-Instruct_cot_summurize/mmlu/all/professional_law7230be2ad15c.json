During the MRI, the technicians saw at least two identifiable sponges that had been left in her body. She had to be hospitalized for additional surgery. The patient sued the hospital and doctor for medical malpractice. She did not produce the printouts of the MRI. Instead, she attempted to testify to what she observed on the MRI scan. The defense objected and insisted that she must produce the actual MRI printouts. What is the most likely ruling of the trial judge with respect to the objection?\n\nA. She does not have to produce the MRI scan because a layperson can testify to things of common knowledge, such as what a sponge looks like.\nB. She does have to produce the MRI scan because a layperson cannot testify to personal observations.\nC. She does not have to produce the MRI scan because she can testify as to the content of her own medical records.\nD. She must produce the MRI records because it represents the best evidence under the best evidence rule.\n"

She must produce the MRI records because it represents the best evidence under the best evidence rule.\n\nThe best evidence rule requires that original documents or, in this case, original diagnostic images (such as MRI scans) be produced when they are the best evidence of their contents. Testimony about what was seen on the MRI would be considered secondary evidence and would not be admissible if the original MRI printouts are available and relevant to the case."
