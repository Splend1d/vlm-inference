According to Article III, Section 2 of the U.S. Constitution, the Supreme Court has original jurisdiction in cases affecting \"Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls,\" and those in which \"a State shall be Party.\" This means that the Supreme Court is the first court to hear these cases.\n\nHowever, when it comes to disputes between different states, while the Supreme Court does have original jurisdiction, this is an area where its role is most prominent and exclusive. Lower federal courts do not have concurrent jurisdiction in such cases.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nC. different states\n\nDisputes between different states are exclusively under the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, without any concurrent jurisdiction given to lower federal courts."
