Management places the same degree of reliance on the files as they do on files generated from mainframe systems.\n\nThis is because if management relies heavily on these files for decision-making without understanding the potential inaccuracies or lack of controls, it can lead to flawed decisions based on incorrect data. This risk is exacerbated when the level of trust in EUC files is equivalent to that placed in more rigorously controlled mainframe systems, which typically have more stringent validation and control mechanisms in place."
