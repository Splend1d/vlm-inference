Which of the following statements is correct and gives the correct reason for it?\n\nA. The cell dies because it cannot make ATP.\nB. The cell would need to consume glucose at a much greater rate because aerobic respiration is much more efficient as compared with anaerobic respiration.\nC. The cell would need to consume another food source other than glucose because it will not be able to make adequate ATP with only glucose.\nD. The cell will begin to divide rapidly because larger cells require more oxygen and glucose than smaller ones.\n"

The cell would need to consume glucose at a much greater rate because aerobic respiration is much more efficient as compared with anaerobic respiration.\n\nWhen yeast cells are moved from an aerobic to an anaerobic environment, they switch from aerobic respiration to anaerobic fermentation. Aerobic respiration produces significantly more ATP per molecule of glucose than anaerobic fermentation does. Therefore, in order to maintain the same level of ATP production under anaerobic conditions, the yeast cell must consume glucose at a much greater rate. This is why option B is the correct answer."
