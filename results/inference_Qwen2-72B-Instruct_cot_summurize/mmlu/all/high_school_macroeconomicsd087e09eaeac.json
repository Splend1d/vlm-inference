Lower factor prices in major industries\n\nAn expansionary supply shock typically refers to a sudden increase in productive capacity or a decrease in the cost of production that leads to an outward shift of the aggregate supply curve. This can result from lower factor prices (such as cheaper raw materials, energy, or labor), technological advancements, or favorable government policies. Option D, \"Lower factor prices in major industries,\" is an example of an expansionary supply shock because it would reduce production costs and potentially lead to increased output."
