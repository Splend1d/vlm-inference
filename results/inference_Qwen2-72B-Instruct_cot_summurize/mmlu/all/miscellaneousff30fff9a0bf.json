Absorption lines in the solar spectrum are consistent with the presence of sodium.\n\nThis is the correct answer because the spectra of stars, including our Sun, can reveal the elements present in their atmospheres through the characteristic absorption lines of those elements. Sodium produces specific absorption lines at wavelengths of 588.995 and 589.592 nanometers, which are often referred to as the \"sodium doublet.\" These lines have been observed in the Sun's spectrum, providing evidence for the presence of sodium in the Sun's atmosphere."
