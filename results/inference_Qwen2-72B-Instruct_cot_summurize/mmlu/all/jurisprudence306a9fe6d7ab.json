According to Immanuel Kant, the categorical imperative is a moral principle that one should only act according to that maxim whereby you can, at the same time, will that it should become a universal law. In other words, you should act only according to that maxim by which you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law. This means that you should only act in ways that you would be willing to have everyone else act as well. This concept is often summarized as \"Act only according to that maxim whereby you can, at the same time, will that it should become a universal law.\" Option D best captures this idea. Options A, B, and C do not accurately represent Kant's categorical imperative."
