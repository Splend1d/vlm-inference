A man then filed a claim against the estate, alleging that he was the son and heir of the testator. At the trial on the man's claim, the man was unable to produce any proof of a ceremonial marriage, but established the following by undisputed evidence: (a) that his mother and the testator had cohabited for a number of years; and (b) that his mother had predeceased the testator by one day. Assume that this jurisdiction has a relevant Dead Man's Statute in effect. At trial, the man's attorney called a clerk at a winter resort hotel. The clerk testified that the testator and the man's mother had come to the hotel for many years and he often saw the testator sign the hotel register as \"Mr. and Mrs. Testator. \"The trial court should rule the clerk's testimony\n\nA. admissible, because the clerk had personal knowledge of the matter.\nB. admissible as a pedigree exception to the hearsay rule.\nC. inadmissible, because the clerk's testimony is not the best evidence.\nD. inadmissible, under the Dead Man's Statute.\n"

This exception allows for the admission of evidence regarding family history, including relationships, which is what the clerk's testimony pertains to. The fact that the testator signed the hotel register as \"Mr. and Mrs. Testator\" could be seen as evidence of his acknowledgment of a marital relationship with the man's mother, thus supporting the man's claim of being the testator's son and heir. While the Dead Man's Statute may limit the admissibility of certain types of testimony in cases where the decedent cannot speak for themselves, the pedigree exception allows for the admission of this type of evidence."
