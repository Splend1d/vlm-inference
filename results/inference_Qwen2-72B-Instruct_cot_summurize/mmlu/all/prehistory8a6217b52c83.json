The concentration of wealth is a common feature.\n\nArchaeological evidence from various ancient civilizations shows that the concentration of wealth was a common feature. This is evident from the discovery of large palaces, temples, and other monumental structures that required significant resources to build and maintain. Additionally, artifacts such as jewelry, pottery, and weapons made from precious materials indicate that wealth was often concentrated in the hands of a few elite individuals or groups. While warfare has been a part of human history, it is not necessarily linked to the production of art or the concentration of wealth."
