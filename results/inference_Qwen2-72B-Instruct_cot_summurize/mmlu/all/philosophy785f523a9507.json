He specifically opposes the idea that the total amount of harm (in this case, deaths) can be summed up and compared as if it were a quantitative value, like money. According to Taurek, each individual's life has intrinsic value and cannot simply be added together to create a larger total.\n\nIn the context of his argument against utilitarian approaches to ethics, which often involve comparing sums of happiness or suffering, Taurek would likely reject the notion that the sum of two people's losses (their deaths) can be meaningfully compared to the loss of one person's life in terms of overall harm. His view is that each individual's loss must be considered on its own terms, and not merely as part of a larger aggregate.\n\nTherefore, while Taurek does not explicitly state any of the options A through C, his position aligns most closely with an interpretation of option D: the notion of the sum of two people\u2019s losses (deaths) should be rejected as a basis for making moral decisions. However, it's important to note that Taurek's actual argument is more nuanced and complex than any single statement can capture."
