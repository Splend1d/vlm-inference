Adultery) are not permitted by the Qur'an. However, it's important to note that interpretations of religious texts can vary, and practices within communities may differ from the literal text. For instance, while polygyny is mentioned in the Qur'an, it is also accompanied by instructions that emphasize justice and fairness, which many interpret as making the practice extremely difficult to execute without sin."
