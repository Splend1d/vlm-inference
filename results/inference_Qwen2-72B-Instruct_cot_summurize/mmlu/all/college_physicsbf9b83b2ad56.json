Since the object is thrown horizontally, its initial vertical velocity is zero. The only force acting on it vertically is gravity, which causes it to accelerate downwards at approximately \\(9.8 \\, \\text{m/s}^2\\).\n\nThe distance an object falls under constant acceleration can be found using the equation:\n\n\\[ d = v_0t + \\frac{1}{2}gt^2 \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\(d\\) is the distance fallen,\n- \\(v_0\\) is the initial velocity in the direction of the displacement (which is zero in the vertical direction),\n- \\(g\\) is the acceleration due to gravity (\\(9.8 \\, \\text{m/s}^2\\)),\n- \\(t\\) is the time.\n\nPlugging in the values given in the question:\n\n\\[ d = 0 \\times 2.0 + \\frac{1}{2} \\times 9.8 \\, \\text{m/s}^2 \\times (2.0 \\, \\text{s})^2 \\]\n\\[ d = 0 + \\frac{1}{2} \\times 9.8 \\times 4 \\]\n\\[ d = 19.6 \\, \\text{m} \\]\n\nTherefore, the object was thrown from a height of 19.6 meters. The correct answer is D. 19.6 m."
