He was subsequently convicted in state court of possession with intent to distribute narcotics. Following his conviction, the drug dealer was sentenced to a prison term of 10 years. After being sentenced, the drug dealer's attorney appealed the conviction, citing jury misconduct. While his appeal was pending, the drug dealer was then indicted by both a federal and a state grand jury for conspiracy to distribute the same cocaine. The drug dealer's attorney filed motions to dismiss each of the new indictments on the grounds that they violate double jeopardy. In all likelihood, double jeopardy requires the dismissal of\n\nA. both indictments.\nB. the state indictment, but not the federal indictment.\nC. the federal indictment, but not the state indictment.\nD. neither of the indictments.\n"

                    "text": "The principle of double jeopardy prevents a person from being tried twice for the same offense in the same jurisdiction. However, it does not prevent a person from being tried for the same conduct in different jurisdictions (state vs. federal) or for different offenses stemming from the same conduct.\n\nIn this case, the drug dealer has already been convicted and sentenced for possession with intent to distribute narcotics in state court. The subsequent indictments for conspiracy to distribute the same cocaine would be considered the same offense if they were in the same jurisdiction, but since one is federal and one is state, the double jeopardy clause does not automatically apply to prevent these new charges.\n\nHowever, there is a legal doctrine known as \"dual sovereignty,\" which allows for prosecution in both state and federal courts for the same conduct because they are considered separate sovereign entities. This means that the drug dealer can potentially be prosecuted in both state and federal courts for conspiracy to distribute, even though the conduct underlying the charge is the same as the previous charge.\n\nGiven this, the most likely answer is:\n\nD. Neither of the indictments will be dismissed solely based on double jeopardy grounds. However, the defense attorney may have other arguments for dismissal based on the specifics of the case, such as the timing of the indictments or potential overlap in the charges that could lead to an unfair prosecution."
