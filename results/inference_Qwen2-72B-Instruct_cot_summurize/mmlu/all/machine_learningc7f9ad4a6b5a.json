It determines the step size at each iteration while moving toward a minimum of a loss function. If the learning rate is too high, the model might overshoot the optimal solution; if it's too low, the model may take too long to converge or get stuck in a suboptimal solution.\n\nStatement 2 is also true. Dropout is a regularization technique used to prevent overfitting in neural networks. During training, it randomly sets a fraction of input units to 0 at each update, which helps prevent co-adaptation of feature detectors. This means that some activation values are indeed multiplied by zero, effectively \"dropping out\" those neurons from the network for that particular forward and backward pass."
