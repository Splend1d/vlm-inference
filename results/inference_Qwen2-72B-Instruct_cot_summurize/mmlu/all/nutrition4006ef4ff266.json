This function is mainly attributed to Vitamin K. Vitamin A is crucial for vision, growth, cellular function, and immune function. It also plays a role in gene expression and cell differentiation (option D) but it does not activate vitamin D receptors (option B) or thyroid hormone receptors (option C) directly. These latter functions are more related to vitamins D and thyroid hormones respectively."
