It suggests that the person was trying to handle the situation, although it might have been more appropriate to call emergency services instead.\n\nIn Scenario 2, dropping bombs on a schoolyard where children are present is a clear violation of moral standards and is considered morally wrong. This action would result in harm or death to innocent people, which is against the fundamental principles of morality."
