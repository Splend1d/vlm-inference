Information is not important to decision making in economic theory; rather, it is an actor's perceptions of situations that will inform their decision making process.\nB. Information has no special significance to economic decision making, which is guided more by external forces that coerce actors than their own rational choices.\nC. Information plays a significant role in decision making because, although theory asserts that actors act in their own best interest, 'rational action' depends on the information available to them at the time.\nD. Information has become an important resource in the 21st century and can be sold and traded as a market commodity.\n"

Information plays a significant role in decision making because, although theory asserts that actors act in their own best interest, 'rational action' depends on the information available to them at the time.\n\nIn economic science, information is crucial for decision making as it allows individuals and firms to make informed choices about how to allocate resources in order to maximize utility or profit. Economic agents need accurate and timely information to evaluate the costs and benefits of different options. Without adequate information, decisions may be suboptimal or irrational, leading to inefficiencies in the market. Therefore, information is considered a key factor in the process of economic decision making."
