The coastal State enjoys ipso facto and ab initio sovereign rights over its continental shelf for the purpose of exploring it and exploiting its natural resources.\n\nUnder international law, as codified in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), coastal States have sovereign rights over the continental shelf that extends beyond their territorial sea up to 200 nautical miles (or more if certain geological conditions are met). These rights include the exploration and exploitation of the natural resources, whether living or non-living, of the seabed and subsoil together with the superjacent waters. However, these rights do not extend to the water column above the seabed unless the resources are sedentary species. The coastal State's rights over the continental shelf are not dependent on any declaration but are subject to the limits established by UNCLOS."
