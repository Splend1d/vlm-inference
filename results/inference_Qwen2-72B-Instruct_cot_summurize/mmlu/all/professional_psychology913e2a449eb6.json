Factor analysis is a statistical method used to identify underlying factors or dimensions that explain correlations among observed variables. In the context of personality theory, factor analysis has been used extensively to identify the core dimensions or traits that make up human personality. The number of dimensions necessary to adequately describe personality has been a subject of much debate and research in the field of psychology."
