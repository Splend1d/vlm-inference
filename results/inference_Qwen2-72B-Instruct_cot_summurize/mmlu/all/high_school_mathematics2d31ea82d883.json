The volume \\(V\\) can be found using the integral:\n\n\\[V = \\int_{a}^{b} 2\\pi x h(x) dx\\]\n\nwhere \\(h(x)\\) is the height of the shell at a distance \\(x\\) from the axis of rotation.\n\nIn this case, the height of the shell is the difference between the two curves, which is \\(2 - e^x\\), since \\(y = 2\\) is above \\(y = e^x\\) in the interval where they intersect (which we will determine shortly).\n\nThe region of interest is bounded by the y-axis (\\(x=0\\)) and the point of intersection between \\(y = e^x\\) and \\(y = 2\\). To find the x-coordinate of this intersection, set \\(e^x = 2\\) and solve for \\(x\\):\n\n\\[e^x = 2\\]\n\n\\[\\ln(e^x) = \\ln(2)\\]\n\n\\[x = \\ln(2)\\]\n\nSo, the limits of integration are \\(0\\) to \\(\\ln(2)\\).\n\nSubstituting into the formula for the volume:\n\n\\[V = \\int_{0}^{\\ln(2)} 2\\pi x (2 - e^x) dx\\]\n\n\\[V = 2\\pi \\int_{0}^{\\ln(2)} 2x - xe^x dx\\]\n\nThis integral requires integration by parts for the second term, but the first term can be integrated directly:\n\nFor the first part:\n\\[\n\\int_{0}^{\\ln(2)} 2x dx = [x^2]_{0}^{\\ln(2)} = (\\ln(2))^2\n\\]\n\nFor the second part, we integrate by parts:\nLet \\(u = x\\) and \\(dv = e^x dx\\), then \\(du = dx\\) and \\(v = e^x\\).\n\nIntegration by parts gives:\n\\[\n\\int x e^x dx = x e^x - \\int e^x dx = x e^x - e^x + C\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\\[\n\\int_{0}^{\\ln(2)} xe^x dx = [\\ln(2)e^{\\ln(2)} - e^{\\ln(2)}] - [0 - e^0] = 2\\ln(2) - 2 + 1 = 2\\ln(2) - 1\n\\]\n\nPutting it all together:\n\\[\nV = 2\\pi \\left[(\\ln(2))^2 - (2\\ln(2) - 1)\\right]\n\\]\n\n\\[\nV = 2\\pi \\left[(\\ln(2))^2 - 2\\ln(2) + 1\\right]\n\\]\n\n\\[\nV = 2\\pi \\left[(\\ln(2) - 1)^2\\right]\n\\]\n\nApproximating the value of \\(\\ln(2)\\):\n\\[\n\\ln(2) \\approx 0.6931\n\\]\n\nThus,\n\\[\nV \\approx 2\\pi (0.6931 - 1)^2\n\\]\n\n\\[\nV \\approx 2\\pi (-0.3069)^2\n\\]\n\n\\[\nV \\approx 2\\pi (0.0941)\n\\]\n\n\\[\nV \\approx 2\\pi (0.0941) \\approx 2 \\times 3.1416 \\times 0.0941 \\approx 0.592\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the volume of the solid generated by rotating the given region about the y-axis is approximately \\(0.592\\), which corresponds to choice **B. 0.592**."
