                    "text": "To determine whether these statements are true or false, let's analyze each statement individually:\n\n### Statement 1: The set of all rectangles in the 2D plane (which includes non-axis-aligned rectangles) can shatter a set of 5 points.\n\nShattering a set of points means that for any possible binary labeling of those points, there exists a hypothesis in the hypothesis class (in this case, rectangles) that perfectly separates the points according to their labels. In other words, if we have five points and we want to separate them into two groups (say, group A and group B), we should be able to find a rectangle that encloses all points of one group while excluding all points of the other group.\n\nIn the 2D plane, with non-axis-aligned rectangles as our hypothesis class, we indeed have the flexibility to position and orient a rectangle in such a way that it can separate any arbitrary grouping of five points. This is because with five points, no matter how they are arranged, you can always find a rectangle that will enclose some points and exclude others based on any given binary classification.\n\nTherefore, **Statement 1 is True**.\n\n### Statement 2: The VC-dimension of k-Nearest Neighbour classifier when k = 1 is infinite.\n\nThe VC-dimension measures the capacity of a hypothesis space. It is defined as the size of the largest set of points that can be shattered by the hypothesis space. For the k-Nearest Neighbour classifier with \\(k = 1\\), the classifier chooses the label of the closest point in the training set for any new data point. This means that the classifier can perfectly fit any number of points, no matter how they are labeled, simply by choosing the nearest neighbor to each point.\n\nGiven any finite set of points, no matter how large, the 1-Nearest Neighbor classifier can perfectly classify them according to any labeling scheme. This is because for every point, there is at least one other point that can be designated as its \"nearest neighbor\" and labeled accordingly. Thus, the VC-dimension is not bounded by the number of points but rather by the ability of the classifier to adapt to any labeling scheme.\n\nTherefore, **Statement 2 is True**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth statements are true, so the correct answer is:\n\nA. True, True"
