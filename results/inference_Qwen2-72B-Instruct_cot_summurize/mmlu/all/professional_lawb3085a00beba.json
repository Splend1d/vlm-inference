The defendant, who did not challenge the legality of the airport search, was subsequently prosecuted for possession of heroin. At trial, the defendant testified on his own behalf and said that the suitcase belonged to his girlfriend who was accompanying the defendant when he was arrested. The girlfriend died in a skydiving accident two weeks before the defendant's trial. Moreover, the defendant testified that although he was a former heroin addict, he had not used any heroin in the past three years. On cross-examination, the prosecuting attorney asked the defendant to roll up the sleeves of his shirt and exhibit his arms to see if there were any needle marks. This request is\n\nA. objectionable, because the defendant has a privilege against self-incrimination.\nB. objectionable, because the probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.\nC. permissible, because such evidence is relevant to the defendant's credibility.\nD. permissible, because the defendant waived his privilege against self-incrimination by taking the stand.\n"

The mere presence of needle marks would not necessarily prove that the defendant was in possession of the heroin found in the suitcase, nor would it prove that he knew what was in the suitcase. Therefore, the probative value of such evidence (its ability to prove something pertinent to the case) may be low compared to the potential for prejudice (creating a negative impression of the defendant unrelated to the facts of the case)."
