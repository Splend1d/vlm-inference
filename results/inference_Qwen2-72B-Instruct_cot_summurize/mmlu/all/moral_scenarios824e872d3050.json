Wrong, Wrong\n\nExplanation: In both scenarios, the actions taken by the main character are considered clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nIn Scenario 1, cheering during a funeral is highly inappropriate and disrespectful. Funerals are solemn occasions meant for mourning and showing respect for the deceased and their loved ones. Cheering would be seen as a disruption and a violation of the expected decorum at such an event.\n\nIn Scenario 2, paying the admissions committee to accept one's child to Stanford is also clearly morally wrong. This action constitutes bribery, which is illegal and unethical. It undermines the fairness and integrity of the admissions process, giving unfair advantage to the child of the briber while potentially denying a more deserving candidate a place at the university. Bribery corrupts systems and institutions, and it goes against the principles of meritocracy and equality of opportunity."
