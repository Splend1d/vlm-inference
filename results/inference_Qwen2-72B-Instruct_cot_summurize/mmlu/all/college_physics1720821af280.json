The speed of sound in dry air can be approximated using the formula:\n\nv = 331 + (0.6 * T)\n\nwhere v is the speed of sound in meters per second and T is the temperature in degrees Celsius.\n\nAt 20\u00b0C, the speed of sound is:\n\nv_20 = 331 + (0.6 * 20) = 343 m/s\n\nOn a particularly cold day, the speed of sound is 3% lower, so:\n\nv_cold = 0.97 * v_20 = 0.97 * 343 \u2248 332.71 m/s\n\nThe original frequency at 20\u00b0C is 440 Hz, which means that:\n\n440 = (n * 343) / (2 * L)\n\nWe need to find the new frequency when the speed of sound is 332.71 m/s:\n\nf_cold = (n * 332.71) / (2 * L)\n\nDividing the two equations gives us:\n\nf_cold / 440 = 332.71 / 343\n\nf_cold \u2248 440 * (332.71 / 343) \u2248 440 * 0.97 \u2248 426.8 Hz\n\nSo the closest answer choice is B. 427 Hz."
