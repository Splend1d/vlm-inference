However, for this set to be a group, every element must have a multiplicative inverse within the set. This condition is only satisfied when \\(n\\) is prime. If \\(n\\) is not prime, then some numbers in the set will not have multiplicative inverses modulo \\(n\\). Therefore, the statement is false because it is not true for all \\(n > 1\\); it is only true for prime \\(n\\).\n\n### Statement 2: There is an integer \\(x\\) such that \\(63x \\mod 100 = 1\\).\n\nThis statement is asking if there exists an integer \\(x\\) such that \\(63x\\) leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 100. In other words, we are looking for an \\(x\\) that satisfies the congruence equation \\(63x \\equiv 1 \\mod 100\\).\n\nTo solve this, we need to find the multiplicative inverse of 63 modulo 100. The existence of such an \\(x\\) depends on whether 63 is coprime with 100 (meaning their greatest common divisor is 1). Indeed, since 63 is not divisible by 2 or 5 (the prime factors of 100), they are coprime. Therefore, by the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, we can find such an \\(x\\) that satisfies the equation. Thus, this statement is true.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nD. False, True"
