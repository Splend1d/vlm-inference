Sweeping generalization\n\nThe fallacy of accident, also known as a sweeping generalization, occurs when someone applies a general rule to a specific case where the rule does not appropriately apply. This can lead to an invalid argument or conclusion. For example, stating that \"all birds can fly\" and then applying this to penguins, which cannot fly, would be an instance of the fallacy of accident. \n\nHere's a brief explanation of the other options:\n\nB. Black-or-white fallacy (also known as false dilemma or false dichotomy) - This fallacy occurs when someone presents only two options in a situation where there are actually more possibilities.\n\nC. Petitio principii (also known as circular reasoning or begging the question) - This fallacy involves using the conclusion of an argument as one of its premises, essentially assuming what you are trying to prove.\n\nD. False dichotomy - This is another term for the black-or-white fallacy, where complex issues are reduced to only two choices, ignoring other viable alternatives."
