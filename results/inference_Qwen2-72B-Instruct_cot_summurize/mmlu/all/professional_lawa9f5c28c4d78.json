The other conspirators assured him there would be no injuries or killings, but while in the bank they killed two people. Pursuant to the state's felony murder rule, the getaway driver was convicted of first degree murder, and sentenced to death. After exhausting his appeals, the United States Supreme Court agreed to hear his case. He argued that he did not intend to kill and was not even present. What is the most likely holding of the Supreme Court?\n\nA. It is constitutional for a state to authorize the execution of an individual who participates in a robbery in which another robber takes life.\nB. A conviction of first degree murder justifies the execution as long as aggravating circumstances are found to exist.\nC. The felony murder rule is unconstitutional and the defendant's conviction must be reversed.\nD. The execution of the defendant constitutes cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment and cannot be allowed.\n"

It is constitutional for a state to authorize the execution of an individual who participates in a robbery in which another robber takes life.\n\nThis is the most likely holding based on precedent set by the Supreme Court in cases such as Tison v. Arizona (1987) and Enmund v. Florida (1982). In these cases, the Court held that a defendant can be sentenced to death for a murder committed during the course of a felony if they were a major participant in the underlying felony and acted with reckless indifference to human life. However, the Court has also indicated that simply being present or having minor involvement in the felony without intent to kill may not justify a death sentence. Given that the getaway driver in this scenario was involved in the planning and execution of the robbery, it is possible that the Court could uphold his conviction and sentence under the felony murder rule."
