The worker brought a federal diversity action against both the machine's manufacturer and the company responsible for the machine's maintenance. At trial, the worker submitted a proposed jury instruction on negligence. The court did not accept the proposed instruction and instead gave a negligence instruction that the worker's attorney believed was less favorable and legally incorrect. The attorney did not object to the negligence instruction before it was given. The jury returned a verdict for the defendants. The worker has moved for a new trial on the ground that the court's negligence instruction was improper. What argument has the best chance of persuading the court to grant the motion?\n\nA. Issues of law can be raised at any time.\nB. The court's negligence instruction was incorrect and the worker's objection to it was preserved when he submitted his it was preserved when he submitted his proposed negligence instruction.\nC.

Although the worker's attorney did not object to the negligence instruction before it was given, the argument that the instruction constituted plain error that affected the worker's substantial rights could still warrant a new trial. Plain error review is a discretionary remedy used by appellate courts to correct errors that seriously affect the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings, even if no objection was made at trial. If the court agrees that the negligence instruction was plainly erroneous and had a significant impact on the outcome of the case, it may grant a new trial."
