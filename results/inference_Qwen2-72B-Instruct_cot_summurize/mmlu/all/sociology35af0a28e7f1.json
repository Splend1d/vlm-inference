These religions or spiritual movements often adapt to modern life, encouraging followers to find spiritual fulfillment within the context of their everyday lives and careers. They may incorporate elements of traditional religions while also emphasizing personal growth, self-realization, and the attainment of success and prosperity in this world.\n\nIt's important to note that the categorization of religions can be complex, and some may exhibit characteristics of multiple options. However, world-affirming religions primarily focus on aligning with and enhancing the values and goals already present in society, rather than reacting against them or rejecting societal norms entirely."
