                    "text": "The key to solving this question lies in understanding the different types of tenancy and how they affect the distribution of property upon death.\n\nWhen Ann sold an undivided one-half interest in the land to Hunter and Willa as tenants by the entirety on August 1, 2005, she created a type of co-ownership that can only exist between spouses. Upon the death of either spouse, the surviving spouse automatically becomes the sole owner of the entire property interest. This is because tenancy by the entirety includes a right of survivorship that is exclusive to married couples.\n\nWhen Ann sold her remaining half-interest in the land to Hunter and Brandon as joint tenants with rights of survivorship on August 1, 2006, she created another type of co-ownership where each party has an equal share of the property and there is also a right of survivorship. If one of the joint tenants dies, the other automatically inherits the deceased's share of the property.\n\nGiven that Hunter, Willa, and Brandon died in a common disaster and the order of their deaths cannot be established, we must apply the rule of simultaneous death. Typically, when the order of death cannot be determined, the law presumes that the older person died first unless there is evidence to the contrary. However, since the exact ages are not provided and it doesn't matter for the purpose of this question, we'll proceed under the assumption that none can be considered to have survived the others.\n\nFirst, let's consider the interest that Hunter and Willa held as tenants by the entirety. Upon their simultaneous deaths, Hunter's half-interest would pass entirely to Willa (and vice versa) if they had survived each other. However, since they died simultaneously, Hunter's will and Willa's will come into play. Since both Hunter and Willa willed their interest in the land to their son, the son would inherit Hunter and Willa's combined one-half interest in the land.\n\nNow, let's consider the interest that Hunter and Brandon held as joint tenants. Upon Hunter's death, his share would have passed to Brandon if Hunter had survived Brandon. But since they died simultaneously, Brandon's half-interest in the land does not get augmented by Hunter's share because Hunter's interest does not pass to Brandon under the rules of joint tenancy when the order of death cannot be determined. Instead, Hunter's interest would pass according to his will, which also leaves his interest to his son.\n\nThus, the son would inherit Hunter's half-interest from the joint tenancy with Brandon, in addition to Hunter and Willa's combined one-half interest from the tenancy by the entirety. This means the son would own:\n\n- One-half interest from Hunter and Willa's tenancy by the entirety.\n- One-half interest from Hunter's share of the joint tenancy with Brandon.\n\nIn total, the son would own an undivided one-half interest + one-half interest = an undivided one whole interest in the land.\n\nHowever, since the question seems to imply that the son's interest should be represented as a fraction of the whole land, the correct answer based on the options given would be:\n\nD. an undivided three-quarters interest in the land.\n\nBut this is incorrect based on the logic explained above. The son would actually own the entire land, not just three-quarters. The options provided do not include \"an undivided whole interest in the land,\" which is what the son would end up owning under these circumstances."
