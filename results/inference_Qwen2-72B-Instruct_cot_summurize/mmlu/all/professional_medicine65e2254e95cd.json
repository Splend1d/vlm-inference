                    "text": "The sensitivity of a diagnostic test is defined as the proportion of true positive cases that are correctly identified by the test. In this case, we want to know how well the test detects prostate cancer. To calculate sensitivity, you need to know the number of true positives (men with prostate cancer who tested positive) and the total number of actual positive cases (all men with prostate cancer, regardless of their test result).\n\nFrom the information provided:\n\n- 100 men underwent biopsy procedures because they had PSA levels > 5 ng/mL.\n- 90 of those men were found to have prostate cancer.\n\nHowever, to calculate the sensitivity, we also need to know the number of false negatives, which are the men with prostate cancer who did not have PSA levels > 5 ng/mL and thus did not undergo biopsy. This information is not directly provided but can be deduced from option D: \"Prostate biopsies of men with test results equal to or below 5 ng/mL.\"\n\nIn order to find out the number of false negatives, we would need to know how many of the men who did NOT undergo biopsy (because they had PSA levels <= 5 ng/mL) actually had prostate cancer. This would require performing biopsies on at least some of these men to determine if there were any undetected cases.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer to calculate the sensitivity of the test is:\n\nD. Prostate biopsies of men with test results equal to or below 5 ng/mL\n\nThis would allow us to determine the number of false negatives and thereby calculate the sensitivity of the test."
