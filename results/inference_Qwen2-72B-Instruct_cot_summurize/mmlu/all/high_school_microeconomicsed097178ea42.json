Labor demand\n\nIn a monopsony labor market, the marginal factor cost (MFC) curve is above the labor demand curve, just as in a monopoly market, the marginal revenue (MR) curve is below the demand curve. This is because in both cases, the firm has market power: as a monopolist in the product market and as a monopsonist in the labor market. The firm faces an upward-sloping MFC curve because it must pay higher wages to attract additional workers, similar to how a monopolist faces a downward-sloping MR curve because it must lower prices to sell additional units of its product."
