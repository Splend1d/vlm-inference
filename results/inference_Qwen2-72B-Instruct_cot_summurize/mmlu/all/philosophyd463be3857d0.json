In his work \"Utilitarianism,\" Mill posits that actions are right if they promote happiness and wrong if they produce the opposite of happiness. He includes both physical and mental pleasures, with a special emphasis on intellectual and moral pleasures. According to Mill, virtues such as honesty, kindness, and integrity contribute to an individual's overall well-being and happiness, making them valuable components of a good life."
