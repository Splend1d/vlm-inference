The mean life expectancy of one model is twice that of the other.\nB. The mean life expectancy of one model is 6 years, while the mean life expectancy of the other is 12 years.\nC. The probability that the life expectancies are different is 0.90.\nD. We should be 90% confident that the difference in life expectancies is between 6 and 12 years.\n"

We should be 90% confident that the difference in life expectancies is between 6 and 12 years.\n\nExplanation:\nA 90% confidence interval for the difference in life expectancies between two models of refrigerators is given as (6, 12). This means that if we were to repeat the experiment many times, 90% of the intervals calculated would contain the true difference in life expectancies. Therefore, we can be 90% confident that the true difference lies within this interval.\n\nOption A is incorrect because there is no information provided about the ratio of life expectancies between the two models.\nOption B is incorrect because the confidence interval does not provide information about the specific values of the mean life expectancies of each model.\nOption C is incorrect because the confidence interval does not provide information about the probability that the life expectancies are different. The confidence level only pertains to the confidence we have in the interval containing the true difference in life expectancies."
