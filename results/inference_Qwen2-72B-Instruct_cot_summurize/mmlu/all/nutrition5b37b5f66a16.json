Iron is necessary for the production of hemoglobin, a protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen from the lungs to the body's tissues. Copper also plays a role in the formation of red blood cells and is needed for the proper function of enzymes involved in iron metabolism. Deficiencies in both copper and iron can lead to anemia."
