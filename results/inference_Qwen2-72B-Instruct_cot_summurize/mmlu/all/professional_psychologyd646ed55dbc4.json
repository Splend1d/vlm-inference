In this case, since the client has refused, the therapist should inform the attorney who issued the subpoena that the client has asserted her privilege to confidentiality. The therapist can then request to be released from the subpoena based on the client's assertion of privilege. It is important for the therapist to protect the client's confidentiality unless there is a legal obligation to disclose the information, such as a court order specifically overriding the privilege."
