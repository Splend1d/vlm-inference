The state legislature passed a statute requiring payment of a license fee of $25 for each shrimp boat owned by a resident and $2,500 for each boat owned by a nonresident. A resident of a neighboring state was a commercial shrimp fisherman who was denied a license after refusing to pay the $2,500 fee. The resident brought suit in federal court challenging the constitutionality of the state shrimp boat licensing statute. The federal court should\n\nA. hear the case on its merits.\nB. dismiss the suit because the resident lacks standing.\nC. dismiss the suit because it involves a question of state law.\nD. abstain from jurisdiction because the constitutional issue should be litigated first in a state court.\n"

In this scenario, the resident of a neighboring state has standing since he has been directly affected by the statute, and the case involves a federal question regarding the constitutionality of the state's licensing statute.
