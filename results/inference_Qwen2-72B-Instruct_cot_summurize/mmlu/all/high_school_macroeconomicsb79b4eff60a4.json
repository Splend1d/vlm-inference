Out of the options provided, the scenario that best describes stagflation is:\n\nB. decreasing SRAS (Short-Run Aggregate Supply) with constant AD (Aggregate Demand).\n\nWhen SRAS decreases, it leads to higher prices because the cost of production has increased or there is a shortage of goods and services. If AD remains constant, the economy will move up along the SRAS curve, leading to higher prices but lower output. This reduction in output can lead to higher unemployment, which is one of the hallmarks of stagflation. The increase in prices (inflation) combined with reduced output and high unemployment characterizes stagflation.\n\nOption A would typically lead to inflation without stagflation if the SRAS curve is upward sloping, as the economy would move along the curve to a point with higher output and higher prices.\n\nOption C would result in deflation and a recession rather than stagflation, as the reduction in AD would lead to lower prices and lower output.\n\nOption D could potentially lead to stagflation if the decrease in SRAS is more significant than the decrease in AD, resulting in higher prices and lower output. However, this option is less specific to stagflation than option B, which directly points to a key cause of stagflation: a decrease in SRAS."
