Immunity shields States from being sued in the courts of other States\n\nSovereign immunity refers to the legal doctrine that a state cannot commit a legal wrong and is immune from civil suit or criminal prosecution. This means that a state, including its government and certain instrumentalities, cannot be sued in the courts of another state without its consent. This principle is based on the idea of equality among sovereign states and the respect for their independence and territorial integrity. Sovereign immunity applies both domestically and internationally and can be waived by the state itself."
