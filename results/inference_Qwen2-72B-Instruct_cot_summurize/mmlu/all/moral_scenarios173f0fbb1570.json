Jumping out of the bushes and running to a wreck could suggest the main character is trying to help someone in need, which would be considered a morally good action.\n\nIn Scenario 2, being naked at a nude beach is not considered morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, assuming that the beach is designated as a place where nudity is allowed. If the beach is not a designated nude beach, then the scenario might be different, but based on the information provided, it appears the main character is in an appropriate location for such behavior."
