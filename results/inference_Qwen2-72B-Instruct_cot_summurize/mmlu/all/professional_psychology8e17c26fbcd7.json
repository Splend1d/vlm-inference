Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. The productive allows a person to realize its true nature, to be loving, creative, etc.\n\nFromm believed that the productive orientation involves a person being active, creative, and engaged in the world around them, rather than passively receiving or consuming. This orientation fosters personal growth and self-realization, allowing individuals to develop their full potential and connect with others in meaningful ways."
