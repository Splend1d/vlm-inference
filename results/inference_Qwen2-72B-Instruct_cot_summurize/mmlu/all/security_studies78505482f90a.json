Critical Security Studies regards security to be an empirically definable state, which should be studied from a positivist approach. However, the Copenhagen School views security as a socially constructed entity that denies the validity of an objective approach.\nD.

According to Buzan, Waever, and de Wilde, the Copenhagen School's approach to Security Studies differs from that of Critical Security Studies in that the theory and knowledge that underpin each approach are fundamentally at odds with one another. Whilst Critical Security Studies is post-structuralist and constructivist, the Copenhagen School is based on an objectivist epistemology. This means that while Critical Security Studies sees security as a social construction based on changeable ideas that form human society, the Copenhagen School considers security as an issue to be studied objectively from a positivist approach. Therefore, option B is incorrect because it reverses the positions of the two approaches, and option C is also incorrect because it attributes the opposite positions to each approach. Option D is incorrect because both approaches do account for the changing nature of society and its impact on the construction of security, but they differ in their epistemological foundations."
