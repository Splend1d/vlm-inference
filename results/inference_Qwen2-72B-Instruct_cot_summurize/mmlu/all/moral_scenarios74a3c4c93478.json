Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation: In scenario 1, going fishing for trout is not considered morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, assuming that the individual has the proper licenses and follows fishing regulations. In scenario 2, taking money out of an employee's check to put into the business could be seen as morally wrong if it is done without the employee's consent or if it violates any labor laws. However, if the action is legal and transparent (for example, through agreed-upon deductions like taxes or benefits), it may not be considered morally wrong. Since the question asks for clear moral wrongdoing and does not provide enough context to determine if the action in scenario 2 is illegal or unethical, we cannot definitively label it as wrong based on the information given."
