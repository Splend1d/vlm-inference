The exact value depends on the specific device, but it's generally in the range of 2 to 5 times the holding current. Therefore, none of the options provided seem to fit as an appropriate latching current based on the given holding current of 2 mA. However, if we must choose from the given options, option D (0.004 A or 4 mA) is the closest to being a plausible latching current, although still rather low for most devices. A more typical latching current might be around 20-50 mA for a standard thyristor. \n\nFor educational purposes, the correct answer would ideally not be listed among the provided options, as none of them are typically correct for a real-world thyristor. However, if forced to choose, D is the least incorrect.\n\nPlease note that in practice, you would refer to the datasheet of the specific thyristor for accurate values of both the holding and latching currents."
