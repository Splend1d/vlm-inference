This includes both physical health and mental health, as well as factors such as cardiovascular health, which can impact brain function. However, it's important to note that social support (A) and life experience (B) can also play significant roles in maintaining cognitive abilities in later life. Chronological age (C) does affect intellectual functioning, but it is not necessarily the most significant factor when compared to health status."
