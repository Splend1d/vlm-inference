They are seen as bringers of good fortune and prosperity to the family and household. This belief is rooted in the veneration of goddesses like Lakshmi, Saraswati, and Parvati, who embody qualities such as fertility, wisdom, and strength. However, it's important to note that the status and treatment of women in Hindu society have been complex and varied throughout history, influenced by factors such as social norms, regional practices, and historical contexts."
