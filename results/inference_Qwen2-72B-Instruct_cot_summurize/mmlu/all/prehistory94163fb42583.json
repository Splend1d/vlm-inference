They brought animals to the site from outside of the region.\n\nAnalysis of animal teeth from a nearby village has shown that the builders of Stonehenge transported livestock from as far as 100 miles away. This suggests that they had an organized system for procuring resources and possibly held gatherings or ceremonies that required large amounts of food. The teeth of cows, pigs, sheep, and goats have been found, indicating that they had a variety of domesticated animals. However, there is no evidence to suggest that they hunted antelope, gazelle, or bear."
