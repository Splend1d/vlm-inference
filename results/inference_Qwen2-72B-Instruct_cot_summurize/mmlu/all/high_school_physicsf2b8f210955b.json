This means that the total volume of fluid entering the system equals the total volume leaving it at any given time. The volume flow rate is given by:\n\n\\[Q = A \\cdot V\\]\n\nwhere \\(A\\) is the cross-sectional area of the pipe and \\(V\\) is the velocity of the fluid.\n\nFor a single pipe with radius \\(Q\\), the cross-sectional area is:\n\n\\[A_1 = \\pi Q^2\\]\n\nThus, the volume flow rate for the single pipe is:\n\n\\[Q_1 = \\pi Q^2 V\\]\n\nWhen the pipe splits into three separate paths, each with radius \\(\\frac{Q}{2}\\), the cross-sectional area of each smaller pipe is:\n\n\\[A_2 = \\pi \\left(\\frac{Q}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{\\pi Q^2}{4}\\]\n\nSince the volume flow rate must be conserved, the total volume flow rate after the split should equal the initial volume flow rate:\n\n\\[Q_1 = 3Q_2\\]\n\nSubstituting the expressions for \\(Q_1\\) and \\(Q_2\\):\n\n\\[\\pi Q^2 V = 3\\left(\\frac{\\pi Q^2}{4} V_2\\right)\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[V = \\frac{3}{4} V_2\\]\n\nSolving for \\(V_2\\):\n\n\\[V_2 = \\frac{4}{3} V\\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. 4/3 V."
