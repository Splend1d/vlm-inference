Age discrimination occurs when an individual is treated less favorably because of their age, and this treatment cannot be justified by the job requirements or work performance. It is illegal under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) for employers to discriminate against individuals who are 40 years of age or older in hiring, firing, pay, promotions, training, fringe benefits, or any other aspect of employment. The other options listed may be relevant factors in certain cases, but they do not necessarily constitute evidence of age discrimination on their own."
