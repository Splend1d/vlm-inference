Higher electrical conductivities: This allows for efficient transmission of current to the workpiece, minimizing energy loss as heat in the electrode itself.\n\nB. Higher thermal conductivities: This enables the electrode to dissipate heat quickly, preventing overheating and maintaining a stable temperature during the welding process.\n\nC. Sufficient strength to sustain high pressure at elevated temperatures: The electrodes need to apply force to the workpieces being welded while withstanding the high temperatures generated during the welding process without deforming or failing.\n\nTherefore, an ideal electrode material for electrical resistance welding should possess all these properties."
