Forward secrecy.\n\nForward secrecy (also known as perfect forward secrecy) ensures that if an adversary compromises the long-term keys of either Alice or Bob in the future, they will not be able to decrypt past communications. This is because each session between Alice and Bob uses ephemeral (short-lived) session keys that are derived independently for each communication session. Even if an adversary gains access to their computers and obtains their long-term keys after the fact, they won't be able to use those keys to decrypt previous sessions' messages.\n\nNote: The term \"backward secrecy\" is not commonly used in cryptography, but it could be interpreted as the opposite of forward secrecy, i.e., ensuring that compromising current keys does not allow decryption of future messages. Since this doesn't apply to the scenario described, option D is not correct."
