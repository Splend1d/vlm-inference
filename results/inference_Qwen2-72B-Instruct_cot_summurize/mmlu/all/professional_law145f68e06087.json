Violation of the statute was a misdemeanor punishable by a $500 fine and up to 30 days in jail. After the statute's enactment, a defendant sold a pack of cigarettes to a girl who was 17 years of age. Before selling the product to the girl, the defendant carefully examined the girl's driver's license, which indicated that she was, in fact, 17 years old. The defendant nevertheless made the sale because he erroneously believed the age of majority to be 17. The defendant is subsequently charged with violation of the statute, and his mistake is honestly held to have been made. Such a mistake should\n\nA. not prevent his conviction, because mistake of the law is no defense.\nB. not prevent his conviction, because the crime imposes absolute criminal liability.\nC. result in his acquittal, because he took reasonable steps to ascertain the girl's age.\nD. result in his acquittal, because he did not possess the requisite mens rea.\n"

He also took reasonable steps to verify the girl's age by checking her driver's license. If the crime requires a certain mental state (mens rea) for the defendant to be found guilty, such as knowledge that the buyer is a minor, then the defendant's lack of knowledge due to his honest mistake could serve as a defense.\n\nHowever, if the statute imposes strict or absolute liability (option B), where no mens rea is required, then the defendant could still be convicted even if he made an honest mistake. In such cases, ignorance or mistake is generally not a defense. But since the question asks what \"should\" happen given the defendant's actions and beliefs, and assuming the statute does require some level of mens rea, option D is the most appropriate response under common legal principles. \n\nIt's worth noting that the specific wording of the statute would determine whether mens rea is required for a conviction. If the statute specifies that the act must be done \"knowingly,\" then the defendant's lack of knowledge would likely be a defense. If the statute simply states that selling tobacco to a minor is illegal without specifying intent, it may impose strict liability."
