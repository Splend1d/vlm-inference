During the 20th century there was an increasingly sense of panic about the potential damage of a serious pandemic disease outbreak in the newly globalised world. Medical advances and a series of successful contained outbreaks have largely allayed these fears.\nB. Since the early 20th century there has been growing recognition of the success in medical and technological advancements that have the ability to keep infectious diseases at bay in the modern population.\nC. Pandemic disease is a relatively new threat to security, emerging only in the early 19th century. Therefore, human populations are still formulating and testing new ways of controlling outbreaks and minimising their impact on security.\nD. During the 20th century, security analysts were predisposed to focus on the potential threat of nuclear confrontation and military combat. Since the reduction in these threats, there has emerged a series of pandemic diseases, and a sense of growing unease at the future impact of more serious outbreaks in an increasingly globalised population.\n"

The statement that best captures this evolution is a combination of aspects from options A, B, and D:\n\nA modified response might be: \"Health has been recognized as a security issue for some time, but during the 20th century, concerns escalated with the increasing interconnectedness of the world. Initially, security analysts focused on traditional threats such as nuclear confrontation and military combat. However, as medical and technological advancements successfully contained several outbreaks, there was a growing realization of the potential for pandemics to disrupt societies. This was exacerbated by the emergence of new infectious diseases and the ease of their spread in a globalized world, leading to a heightened sense of unease regarding the security implications of future outbreaks.\"\n\nThis response acknowledges the historical perspective on health and security, the initial focus on traditional security threats, the role of medical advancements, and the evolving understanding of the security risks posed by pandemics in the context of globalization."
