Blackbody radiation curves\n\nAlthough quantum mechanics (which was developed later) would go on to explain other phenomena such as electron diffraction patterns and emission spectra of diatomic molecules, these were not directly explained by Planck's original quantum theory. The temperature dependence of reaction rates is typically explained by classical thermodynamics and kinetics, not quantum theory."
