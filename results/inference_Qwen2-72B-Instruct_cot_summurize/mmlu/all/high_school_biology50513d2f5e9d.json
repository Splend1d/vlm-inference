The early atmosphere was primarily composed of gases like carbon dioxide, water vapor, nitrogen, and traces of other gases such as hydrogen sulfide and ammonia. Oxygen began to accumulate in the atmosphere only after photosynthetic organisms evolved and started producing it as a byproduct of photosynthesis."
