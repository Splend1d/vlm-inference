Confirming with those members of management as to whether they are actually option holders could provide some evidence regarding the completeness of the option grants but may not be sufficient on its own due to potential conflicts of interest.\n\nB. Verifying the existence of option holders in the issuer's payroll and human resources records can help ensure that the individuals receiving options are indeed employed by the company, but it does not address whether the grants were authorized or properly accounted for.\n\nC. Tracing the authorization for the options granted to the board of directors' approval is a key audit procedure. This helps ensure that the grants were made in accordance with corporate governance policies and that there is appropriate oversight over such transactions.\n\nD. Reviewing the public records of the SEC to determine whether the options were properly reported is important for ensuring compliance with disclosure requirements but does not directly address the internal authorization and accounting for the transactions.\n\nGiven the options provided, choice C is the most likely action an auditor would take as part of substantive testing regarding the granting of stock options to senior management. It addresses the critical issue of authorization, which is central to ensuring that the transactions are legitimate and properly governed."
