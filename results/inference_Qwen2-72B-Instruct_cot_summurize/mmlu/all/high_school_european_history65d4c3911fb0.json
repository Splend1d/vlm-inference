The genius of Napoleon is astounding. All branches of human knowledge seemed alike familiar to his gigantic mind. His conversations at St. Helena, scattered through the numerous and voluminous memorials of those who gleaned them, are replete with intensest interest. During the long agony of his imprisonment and his death, he conversed with perfect freedom upon the events of his marvelous career, and upon all those subjects or morals, politics, and religion, which most deeply concern the welfare of our race. There is no mind which will not be invigorated by familiarity with these profound thoughts, expressed with so much glow of feeling and energy of diction.\n\u2014John S. C. Abbott, historian, Napoleon at St. Helena, 1855\nWhich of the following actions of Napoleon does the author seem to be ignoring the hypocrisy of in his examination of the high mindedness and praiseworthiness of Napoleon?\n\nA. The invasion of Haiti to stop a slave revolt there\nB. The creation of the Napoleonic Code\nC. Promoting soldiers and government workers based upon their merits only\nD. His conquest of Europe and use of the Continental System\n"

                    "text": "The author seems to be ignoring the hypocrisy of action A: \"The invasion of Haiti to stop a slave revolt there.\" In the passage provided, John S. C. Abbott lavishes praise on Napoleon's intellect, character, and contributions to society without mentioning any of his controversial actions. However, given the context of the question and the options provided, the invasion of Haiti to suppress the slave revolt is an action that could be seen as hypocritical when compared to other aspects of Napoleon's rule that are often portrayed more positively.\n\nNapoleon's decision to invade Haiti in 1798 was aimed at restoring French control over the colony and suppressing the slave revolt led by figures such as Toussaint L'Ouverture. This action contradicts the principles of liberty and equality that the French Revolution, which brought Napoleon to power, purported to stand for. By attempting to re-establish slavery in Haiti, Napoleon demonstrated a disregard for the very ideals he claimed to uphold, thus illustrating a level of hypocrisy in his policies.\n\nThe other actions listed do not necessarily demonstrate hypocrisy in the same way:\n\nB. The creation of the Napoleonic Code was a significant legal reform that standardized laws across France and influenced legal systems around the world. While it can be criticized for its authoritarian elements, it is generally seen as a positive contribution to European legal history.\n\nC. Promoting soldiers and government workers based upon their merits only was a progressive policy that helped to create a meritocracy within the military and civil service, breaking away from the traditional aristocratic system.\n\nD. His conquest of Europe and use of the Continental System can be seen as aggressive and imperialistic, but this does not necessarily reflect hypocrisy; rather, it demonstrates Napoleon's ambition and desire for power.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer to the question is A: The invasion of Haiti to stop a slave revolt there."
