It can lead to difficulty breathing, heart failure, paralysis, and even death. The bacteria produce a toxin that can damage the heart muscle (myocarditis), leading to potential heart failure, which explains the myocardial involvement mentioned. Additionally, the presence of swollen glands could indicate cervical lymphadenopathy, a common finding in diphtheria due to the body's immune response to the infection.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Corynebacterium diphtheriae"
