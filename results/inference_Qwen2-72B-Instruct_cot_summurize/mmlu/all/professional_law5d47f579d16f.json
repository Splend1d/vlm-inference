They had relied on a business attorney in establishing the business. After the business failed, the plaintiff and the defendant disagreed about their respective obligations. At trial, both have hired new counsel. The plaintiff calls the business attorney to testify to representations the defendant made in meetings she had with the plaintiff and the business attorney. The defendant objects to the business attorney's testimony, invoking the attorney-client privilege. Should the court uphold the defendant's privilege claim?\n\nA. No, because the business attorney's professional relationship with the plaintiff and the defendant has ended.\nB. No, because the plaintiff and the defendant consulted the business attorney jointly.\nC. Yes, because either the plaintiff or the defendant may block disclosure of statements made during such meetings.\nD. Yes, because either the plaintiff or the defendant may claim the privilege on behalf of the partnership.\n"

No, because the plaintiff and the defendant consulted the business attorney jointly.\n\nWhen two parties consult an attorney jointly, the attorney-client privilege belongs to both parties. However, if the parties become adversaries, as in this case where one sues the other, the privilege may be waived by one party against the other. The rationale is that the joint client cannot use the privilege to shield information from each other when they are now in dispute over matters related to the joint representation. Therefore, the court is likely not to uphold the defendant's privilege claim if the information sought pertains to communications made during the joint meetings with the business attorney."
