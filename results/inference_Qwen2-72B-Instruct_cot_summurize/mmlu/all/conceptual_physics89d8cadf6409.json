In this process, the uranium-238 nucleus loses two protons and two neutrons (which together form the alpha particle). This decreases its atomic number by 2 and its mass number by 4.\n\nThe atomic number of uranium (U) is 92. Losing two protons means the new element will have an atomic number of 90, which corresponds to thorium (Th). The mass number of uranium-238 is 238. Losing four units of mass (from the alpha particle) results in a new mass number of 234.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. thorium-234"
