Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn scenario 1, hanging garments loose in a farmer's market might be considered disruptive or disorderly, but it is not necessarily morally wrong unless it causes harm or significant inconvenience to others. If the action was intended as an art installation or similar with permission, it could be entirely acceptable.\n\nIn scenario 2, telling the police the right information is typically seen as a morally correct action, as it supports justice and the rule of law. Providing accurate information to authorities when required can help prevent wrongful convictions and ensure that justice is served."
