In the beginning when the protoplanetary disk was spinning faster centrifugal forces flung the lighter materials toward the outer parts of the solar nebula.\nB. In the inner part of the nebula only metals and rocks were able to condense because of the high temperatures whereas hydrogen compounds although more abundant were only able to condense in the cooler outer regions.\nC. Denser materials were heavier and sank to the center of the nebula.\nD. When the solar nebula formed a disk materials naturally segregated into bands and in our particular solar system the denser materials settled nearer the Sun while lighter materials are found in the outer part.\n"

In the inner part of the nebula, only metals and rocks were able to condense because of the high temperatures, whereas hydrogen compounds, although more abundant, were only able to condense in the cooler outer regions.\n\nAs the solar system formed from a rotating cloud of gas and dust (the solar nebula), the temperature closer to the Sun was much higher due to its intense heat. This high temperature prevented volatile substances such as water, methane, ammonia, and other ices from condensing into solid particles. Instead, these volatiles remained gaseous and were more likely to be found in the outer, cooler regions of the solar nebula where they could condense out of the gas phase.\n\nIn contrast, the inner regions of the solar nebula were hot enough that only refractory materials\u2014those with high melting points like silicates and metals\u2014could condense out of the gas phase and accumulate to form the rocky, dense planets we see today: Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. These planets are composed primarily of rock and metal because those were the only materials stable enough to solidify and aggregate under the high-temperature conditions close to the Sun.\n\nThus, the composition of the planets in our solar system is largely determined by their distance from the Sun during the early stages of the solar system's formation."
