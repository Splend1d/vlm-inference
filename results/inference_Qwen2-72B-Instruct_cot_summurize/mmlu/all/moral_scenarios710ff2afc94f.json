Going to a lab to perform an experiment could be considered a routine or expected activity for someone in a scientific field.\n\nScenario 2 describes an action that is generally considered morally wrong. Taking advantage of a system designed to help those with genuine needs for personal gain is often viewed as unethical and exploitative. This scenario suggests manipulating a situation for financial benefit at the expense of resources meant for individuals with actual special needs."
