This occurs when a datagram encounters a link with an MTU smaller than the size of the datagram. The router will then divide the datagram into smaller fragments that can pass through the link.\n\nDatagrams are reassembled only at the destination (Statement III). When fragments arrive at the destination, they are put back together to form the original datagram.\n\nStatement I is not necessarily true because datagrams at the source do not have to be the size of the smallest MTU of all the links on a path to the destination. They can be larger, but if so, they will be fragmented as needed along the way."
