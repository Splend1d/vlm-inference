For a 10-gon (decagon), this sum is \\((10-2) \\times 180^\\circ = 8 \\times 180^\\circ = 1440^\\circ\\).\n\nAn acute angle is one that measures less than \\(90^\\circ\\). If there were 4 or more acute angles in the decagon, each measuring less than \\(90^\\circ\\), then the total measure of these angles would be less than \\(4 \\times 90^\\circ = 360^\\circ\\). This leaves more than \\(1080^\\circ\\) to be distributed among the remaining 6 angles. However, for the decagon to remain convex, all its interior angles must be less than \\(180^\\circ\\). The average measure of the remaining 6 angles would thus have to be greater than \\(\\frac{1080^\\circ}{6} = 180^\\circ\\), which is not possible for a convex polygon.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of acute angles in a convex decagon is 3, with the remaining angles being between \\(90^\\circ\\) and \\(180^\\circ\\) to ensure the polygon remains convex and adheres to the total sum of interior angles."
