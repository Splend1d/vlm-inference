In Scenario 1, riding horseback away from the authorities could be seen as evading law enforcement, which would be wrong if the individual was avoiding legal obligations or investigation. However, without additional context, it is unclear if this is the case. In Scenario 2, quitting a game due to frustration is not morally wrong, although it may be viewed negatively in terms of sportsmanship."
