Since the witness's conviction was only nine years ago, it falls within the time frame where such evidence is generally admissible for impeachment purposes. The court will consider whether the probative value of the evidence outweighs its prejudicial effect, but the fact that less than 10 years have passed makes it less likely that the motion will be granted solely on the basis of the passage of time."
