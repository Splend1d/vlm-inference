The ski lift company had installed and operated the lift pursuant to a concession agreement with the owner of the private park. Visitors gained entry to the park on payment of a $5 fee, which entitled them to go ice skating, tobogganing, or sledding. A ski lift ticket cost an additional $7 per day. At the top of the ski lift, there was a platform for embarking and disembarking passengers. The ski lift company paid the owner a stipulated rental plus 15 percent of the net proceeds from the lift. Two employees of the company operated the lift, one from a station at the bottom and the other from a station at the top of the hill. When the vacationer boarded the ski lift, it was late afternoon and most of the skiers had left. He was the sole passenger on the lift. Meanwhile, the employee at the top had left his post to go to the bathroom, asking his friend to keep watch on the lift and to stop it to allow any passengers to disembark. The friend consented, and the employee showed him how to use the control switch. When the vacationer approached the top, the employee was still away. Instead of stopping the lift to permit the vacationer to get off, the friend allowed the lift to keep moving. The vacationer was carried past the platform, and he was swung violently from side to side as the ski lift started downward. When the employee returned and sized up the situation, he threw the switch, stopping the lift. The vacationer, severely bruised and badly frightened, jumped off the ski lift and completed his descent by foot. In a personal injury action by the vacationer against the owner of the private park, the vacationer will rely on the concept of\n\nA. respondeat superior.\nB. vicarious liability.\nC. joint venture.\nD. imputed negligence.\n"

                    "text": "The vacationer will likely rely on the concept of B. vicarious liability. Vicarious liability is a form of liability where one party is held responsible for the actions (or inactions) of another party. In this case, the vacationer may argue that the owner of the private park is vicariously liable for the actions of the ski lift company's employee and the employee's friend, who was temporarily in charge of operating the lift. Since the ski lift company operates under a concession agreement with the park owner, the park owner may be held responsible for the negligence of the ski lift company's employees while they are performing duties related to the operation of the lift within the park.\n\nRespondeat superior (A) is a specific type of vicarious liability that applies when an employer is held liable for the actions of their employees during the course of employment. Joint venture (C) refers to a business arrangement where two or more parties agree to pool their resources for the purpose of accomplishing a specific task, and imputed negligence (D) is a legal doctrine where the negligence of one person can be attributed to another, such as in the case of a principal-agent relationship. However, in this scenario, vicarious liability (B) is the most appropriate concept to rely on for the vacationer's personal injury claim."
