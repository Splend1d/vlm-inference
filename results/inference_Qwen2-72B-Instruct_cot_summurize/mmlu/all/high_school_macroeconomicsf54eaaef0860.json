This can offset the intended stimulative effects of expansionary fiscal policy. So, while option C is close, a more accurate description would be: Crowding out occurs when increased government borrowing leads to higher interest rates, which discourage private investment and consumption, thereby offsetting the effects of expansionary fiscal policy."
