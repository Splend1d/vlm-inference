Since there are 18 computers and we want as many students as possible to have their own computer, we will allocate one computer per student until all computers are allocated.\n\nAfter allocating 18 computers, we would have accommodated 18 students with a computer each. This leaves us with 26 - 18 = 8 students without a computer.\n\nSince we cannot accommodate these 8 students without pairing them up (as we've already maximized the number of computers being used by single students), the answer to how many students can have a computer to themselves is the number of students we were able to accommodate before running out of computers, which is 18.\n\nHowever, since the question asks for the maximum number of students who can have a computer to themselves, and our options are limited to A. 2, B. 6, C. 10, D. 14, the closest answer that fits within those options is:\n\nD. 14\n\nThis assumes that after allocating 14 computers to 14 students, the remaining 4 computers are shared between the remaining 12 students, allowing those initial 14 students to have their own computers."
