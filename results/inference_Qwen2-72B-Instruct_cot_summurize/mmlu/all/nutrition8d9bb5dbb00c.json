                    "text": "Iron is transported in the circulation bound to transferrin. Therefore, the correct answer is D.\n\nTransferrin is a glycoprotein that binds iron ions with high affinity and transports them through the bloodstream. It picks up iron primarily from the duodenal enterocytes (intestinal cells) and delivers it to various tissues and organs where it is needed for metabolic processes such as oxygen transport by hemoglobin and electron transport in mitochondria. Transferrin also plays a role in regulating iron homeostasis and preventing oxidative damage by sequestering free iron ions which can be toxic if present in excess. Ferritin, on the other hand, is an intracellular protein that stores iron in a non-toxic form within cells. Albumin is a plasma protein that has a low affinity for iron and does not play a significant role in its transport. Simple Fe2+ ions do not circulate freely in the blood because they are highly reactive and can cause oxidative damage."
