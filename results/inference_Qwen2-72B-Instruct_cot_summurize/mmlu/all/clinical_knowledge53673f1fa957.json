Among the options given:\n\nA. 18 gauge.\n\nThis is the correct answer. An 18-gauge cannula has a larger diameter than the other options, allowing for a higher flow rate which is necessary for a rapid transfusion. A 20-gauge cannula could also be used in many cases, but an 18-gauge would generally allow for a faster transfusion if the patient's veins can accommodate it and there are no contraindications such as small or fragile veins."
