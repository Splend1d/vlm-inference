The security guard knew that the barber, an elderly man, had a history of significant heart problems. The security guard decided to play a joke on his friend. The security guard took out his gun, burst through the door of the barber shop, pointed the gun at the friend, and shouted, \"Don't move or I'll shoot!\" The barber, thinking that an armed intruder was about to shoot the friend, suffered a heart attack and collapsed. If the barber brings suit against the security guard for infliction of emotional distress and seeks recovery for damages arising from the heart attack, he should\n\nA. prevail, because the security guard knew the barber was present.\nB. prevail, because the security guard assaulted the friend.\nC. not prevail, because the barber was not a member of the friend's immediate family.\nD. not prevail, because the resulting harm was unforeseeable.\n"

By brandishing a firearm in a manner that could reasonably be expected to cause fear and alarm, the security guard created a situation that led directly to the barber's heart attack. The fact that the security guard was aware of the barber's presence and his medical history makes it more likely that the security guard could be held liable for intentional or negligent infliction of emotional distress, which resulted in physical harm (the heart attack).\n\nWhile option B mentions assault, the primary focus of the suit is the infliction of emotional distress leading to physical harm, not necessarily the assault on the friend. Option C is incorrect because the barber's relationship to the friend is not relevant to his ability to sue for damages caused directly by the security guard's actions. Option D is also incorrect because, given the barber's known heart condition, the potential for harm could be considered foreseeable."
