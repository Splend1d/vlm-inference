Female students who attend half-time are still permitted a $100 tax exemption, whereas male students who attend half-time are no longer permitted any tax exemption. Which of the following most accurately summarizes the correct rule of constitutional law regarding the state tax exemption for students who enroll half-time?\n\nA. The tax exemption would be invalidated as a denial of due process.\nB. The tax exemption would be invalidated as violative of the equal protection clause.\nC. The tax measure would be upheld as within the area of substantive due process.\nD. The tax measure would be upheld as within the power of a municipality to tax different classes of persons unequally.\n"

The tax exemption would be invalidated as violative of the equal protection clause.\n\nThe differential treatment of male and female students in terms of tax exemptions is likely to be seen as a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, which requires that states provide equal protection under the law to all people within their jurisdictions. This includes prohibiting discrimination based on sex unless the state can demonstrate an exceedingly persuasive justification for the distinction. Given that there is no apparent rational basis for treating male and female half-time students differently in this context, the tax exemption policy would likely be struck down as unconstitutional under the equal protection analysis."
