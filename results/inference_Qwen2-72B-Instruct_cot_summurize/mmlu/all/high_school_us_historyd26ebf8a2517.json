We mean to be a part of it\u2014we mean to lead it. For the eyes of the world now look into space, to the moon, and the planets beyond, and we have vowed that we shall not see it governed by a hostile flag of conquest, but by a banner of freedom and peace. We have vowed that we shall not see space filled with weapons of mass destruction, but with instruments of knowledge and understanding.\u2026 We choose to go to the moon. We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win, and the others, too.\n\u2014John F. Kennedy, September 12, 1962\nKennedy's statement best reflects which of the following?\n\nA. American unease in a time of troubles\nB. American confidence in a time of prosperity\nC. A liberal concern for social justice\nD. A conservative fear of big government\n"

He speaks of leading the world into the new age of space exploration and vows that America will not only participate but lead in this endeavor. His words are full of determination and a can-do spirit, typical of the American attitude during times of national pride and progress. The speech also reflects the belief in the power of technology and innovation to solve problems and advance society, which was a hallmark of the post-war era in the United States."
