The educational level and professional experiences of the internal auditor.\n\nWhen assessing an internal auditor's competence, an external auditor should obtain updated information on the educational background and professional experiences of the internal auditor. This includes understanding their qualifications, training, and experience in relevant fields to ensure they have the necessary skills and knowledge to perform their duties effectively. While the other factors mentioned (reporting status, conflict of interest policies, and oversight of employment decisions) are also important for evaluating the independence and objectivity of the internal auditor, they do not directly relate to the auditor's competence as much as their educational level and professional experiences do."
