There is little evidence to substantiate the claim that there is a real and increasing threat posed by the scale and scope of transnational crime in the 1980s to 1990s beyond the consensus that concern over the levels of crime were generated by the military re-conceiving its role in light of the dissolution of the Cold War.\nB. Whereas illegal markets were territorially bounded and isolated in the past, the contemporary form illicit markets tend to be interrelated and mutually supporting and more embedded in the legal economy.\nC. TNC is a response by the dispossessed in response to the asymmetric economic development of nation states and the inequity of global market capitalism married with environmental constraints on development.\nD. Transnational crime is no longer the exclusive domain of certain geographic areas or ethnic groups becoming globalized in operation, increasing the number of groups and countries affected and increasing the size of the illegal market ratio to licit trade.\n"

Let's analyze each statement provided:\n\nA. This statement suggests that concerns over the scale and scope of TNC in the late 20th century may have been influenced by the geopolitical shifts following the end of the Cold War. It implies that the perceived increase in TNC was partly a result of the military and other institutions looking for new roles and threats after the collapse of the Soviet Union. While this might be true to some extent, it doesn't negate the fact that TNC did indeed grow during this period.\n\nB. This statement highlights how illicit markets have changed over time. In the past, they were often localized and isolated, but now they are interconnected and intertwined with legal economies. This transformation has made them more complex and harder to combat, as they can leverage legitimate business structures and networks.\n\nC. This statement offers a socio-economic explanation for the rise of TNC. It suggests that TNC is a reaction to economic disparities between nations and the uneven distribution of wealth created by global market capitalism. Environmental constraints could also play a role, pushing individuals and groups into criminal activities as a means of survival or profit.\n\nD. This statement acknowledges the globalization of TNC. Previously, certain types of transnational crime were associated with specific regions or ethnic groups. However, the modern era has seen a global spread of these activities, affecting more countries and involving a greater number of actors. The size of illegal markets has grown relative to legal trade, indicating an expansion of TNC's reach and influence.\n\nIn conclusion, while TNC is not a new phenomenon, its evolution and expansion in recent decades reflect changes in global economics, technology, and geopolitics. The interconnectedness of today's world has facilitated the growth of TNC, making it a significant challenge for international law enforcement and policymakers."
