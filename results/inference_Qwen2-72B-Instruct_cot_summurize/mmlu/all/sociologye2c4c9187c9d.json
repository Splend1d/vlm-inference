According to her theory, both boys and girls initially develop close attachments to their mothers due to the primary caretaking role often assumed by mothers. However, as boys grow older, they feel the need to separate from their mothers and identify with their fathers or other male figures to resolve conflicts around competing for their mother's attention and to learn masculine behaviors. This process is less emphasized for girls who can continue to identify with their mothers."
