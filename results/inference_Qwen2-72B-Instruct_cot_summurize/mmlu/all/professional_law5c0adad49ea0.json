The professor made a conveyance thereof in these words, \"I hereby convey my 30-acre tract to both my friend and my co-worker as joint tenants with right of survivorship. \"Two years after making the conveyance to the friend and the co-worker, the friend executed a mortgage on the 30-acre tract of land to a bank to secure a loan. One year after executing the mortgage, the friend died intestate, leaving his uncle as his only heir. At the time of the friend's death, the indebtedness had not been paid to the bank. The jurisdiction in which the 30-acre tract of land is located recognizes a title theory of mortgages. In an appropriate action, the court should determine that title to the 30-acre tract of land is vested\n\nA. in the co-worker, with the entire interest subject to the mortgage.\nB. in the co-worker, free and clear of the mortgage.\nC. half in the co-worker and half in the uncle, with both subject to the mortgage.\nD. half in the co-worker, free of the mortgage, and half in the uncle, subject to the mortgage.\n"

The friend and the co-worker originally took title as joint tenants with right of survivorship. Upon the friend's death, the entire interest would normally pass to the surviving joint tenant (the co-worker) due to the right of survivorship, extinguishing any claim the friend's heirs might have.\n\nHowever, the existence of the mortgage complicates matters. Since the jurisdiction follows a title theory of mortgages, the bank holds legal title to the property during the term of the mortgage. The bank's interest as mortgagee is paramount to that of the mortgagor (the friend) and would survive the friend's death. \n\nGiven this information and assuming no payments were made to discharge the mortgage before the friend's death, the bank retains its security interest in the property. Thus, when the friend dies, the co-worker does become the sole owner of the property due to the right of survivorship, but the property is still subject to the mortgage. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. in the co-worker, with the entire interest subject to the mortgage.\n\nThe uncle, as the heir of the friend, has no direct interest in the property because the right of survivorship overrides the inheritance rights. The uncle would not receive any portion of the property unless the co-worker chooses to transfer some interest to him or unless the mortgage is satisfied, and the co-worker decides to sell the property."
