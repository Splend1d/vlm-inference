However, when a monopoly sells additional units, it must lower its price to do so, which means that the marginal revenue (the revenue gained from selling one additional unit) is less than the price of that unit. This is because reducing the price affects all units sold, not just the additional unit. As a result, the marginal revenue curve lies below the demand curve."
