If no score occurred more than once (i.e., there was no mode previously), or if 100 doesn't repeat in future tests, then it won't become the mode either. Thus, we can't conclude that the mode will increase.\n\nB. **The mean will increase.**  \nSince 100 is higher than any of her previous scores, which were all between 75 and 89, adding this score to her total will certainly increase the mean because you're adding a value greater than all existing values, which pulls the average up.\n\nC. **The mean will decrease.**  \nThis is directly contradictory to the logic used for option B. Since 100 is higher than any previous score, the mean cannot decrease.\n\nD. **The median will decrease.**  \nFor the median to decrease, the new score would need to be lower than half of the existing scores. However, since 100 is the highest possible score she could have gotten, it cannot cause the median to decrease; instead, it could potentially increase the median depending on how many tests she had taken before.\n\nTherefore, the only true statement from the given options is:\n\n**B. The mean will increase.**"
