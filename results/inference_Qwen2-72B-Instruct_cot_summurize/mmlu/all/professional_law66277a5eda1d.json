By the terms of the lease, the tenant expressly covenanted to pay a monthly rental of $300 and to pay the taxes on the premises during the term of the lease. The lease also stipulated that the tenant, as lessee, may not assign or sublease the said premises. The tenant and his family lived in the house for two years. Then the tenant, still owing the landlord three months back rent, assigned his leasehold interest in the property to a student, who was unaware of the prohibition against assignments. This written assignment expressly provided that the student would pay the landlord the monthly rental of $300, but was silent concerning the payment of taxes. The landlord never objected to this assignment. Six months after the assignment, the landlord conveyed his property interest in the premises to a new owner. The student failed to pay the taxes on the property. The new owner, after paying the taxes, brought suit against the student for the amount paid. Judgment should be for\n\nA. the new owner.\nB. the student, because he did not contract with the tenant to pay the taxes on the property.\nC. the student, because the covenant to pay taxes will not \"run with the land,\" unless the intent is clearly expressed in the original lease.\nD. the student, because the covenant to pay taxes is merely collateral and does not \"run with the land. \"\n"

The fact that the assignment agreement between the tenant and the student was silent on the issue of tax payments does not relieve the student of the obligation to pay taxes as stipulated in the original lease. Moreover, since the landlord did not object to the assignment, the new owner (who took over the landlord's interest) has the right to enforce the terms of the lease against the student, including the covenant to pay taxes.\n\nThe doctrine of \"covenants running with the land\" generally applies when there is a privity of estate between the parties. In this case, the student, by taking an assignment of the lease, is in privity of estate with the original landlord and thus bound by the covenants in the lease. The covenant to pay taxes is not merely collateral; it is integral to the lease agreement and runs with the leasehold interest.\n\nTherefore, since the student failed to pay the taxes, the new owner, having fulfilled this obligation, can rightfully seek reimbursement from the student."
