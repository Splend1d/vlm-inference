P = MR = MC = ATC\n\nThis means that in the long run, price (P) equals marginal revenue (MR), marginal cost (MC), and average total cost (ATC). Firms in perfect competition will produce at a level where price equals marginal cost, which ensures they cover their average total costs, earning zero economic profit. This is the point of long-run equilibrium for firms in a perfectly competitive market."
