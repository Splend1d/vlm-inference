The approach to reducing disease caused by parvoviruses depends on the specific virus in question. Here's how each of the options you've provided might apply:\n\nA. Transfusion blood is screened: This is relevant for Parvovirus B19, which can be transmitted through blood transfusions. Screening of blood donations for Parvovirus B19 can help prevent transmission.\n\nB. Vaccine has been developed: There is currently no vaccine available for human parvoviruses such as Parvovirus B19. However, there are vaccines for some animal parvoviruses, such as canine parvovirus.\n\nC. A range of new antivirals: Research is ongoing into antiviral treatments for parvoviruses, but as of my last update in early 2023, there were no approved antivirals specifically for human parvoviruses. Supportive care is typically the mainstay of treatment.\n\nD. Social distancing: While social distancing can help reduce the spread of many viral infections, it is not a primary method for controlling parvovirus infections. Parvovirus B19 can spread via respiratory droplets, so avoiding close contact with infected individuals can help prevent its spread.\n\nIn summary, screening of blood donations (option A) is one of the primary methods used to reduce disease caused by Parvovirus B19, while research into antivirals (option C) and supportive care are important for managing infections. Vaccines (option B) are not yet available for human parvoviruses, and social distancing (option D) may have a role in preventing spread but is not the primary method of control."
