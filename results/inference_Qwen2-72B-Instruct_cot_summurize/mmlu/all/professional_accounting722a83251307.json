Since the partnership has $20,000 in recourse liabilities, and Skinner has a 20% partnership interest, his share of these liabilities is:\n\\[ 20\\% \\times \\$20,000 = \\$4,000 \\]\n\nAdding this to his initial basis gives us:\n\\[ \\$7,000 + \\$4,000 = \\$11,000 \\]\n\nHowever, it seems there might have been an oversight in the calculation because we also need to include the fair market value of the land when calculating Skinner's contribution to the partnership, not just its basis. The partnership received assets worth $20,000 ($5,000 cash + $20,000 fair market value of land), but since the basis of the land is less than its fair market value, we only add the basis of the land to the initial basis calculation. \n\nGiven the options provided and the details given in the question, the closest correct answer based on the calculation using the basis of the land would be:\n\nD. $13,000\n\nBut, technically, if we were to include the full fair market value of the land as part of Skinner's contribution, the calculation would look different. Yet, based on the information provided and the options given, option D (\\$13,000) does not exactly match our calculations, but it's the closest to what we calculated (\\$11,000) using the land's basis. There may be an expectation to include the land's fair market value in the calculation which could lead to a different interpretation, but strictly following the instructions given in the question leads us to option D as the closest answer."
