He believed that the purpose of life is to achieve eudaimonia, often translated as 'happiness' but more accurately understood as 'flourishing' or 'living well'. This state is achieved by developing virtues, which are character traits that enable us to act in ways that promote our own and others' flourishing. Virtues are seen as mean states between two extremes of excess and deficiency. For example, courage is the mean between recklessness (excess) and cowardice (deficiency). This emphasis on the development of virtuous character traits as central to ethical living is what makes Aristotle's theory a form of virtue ethics."
