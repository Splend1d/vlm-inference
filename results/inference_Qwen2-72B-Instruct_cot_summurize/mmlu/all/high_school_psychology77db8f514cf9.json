After interviewing the dentist, a local newswriter reports that brushing teeth after lunch prevents cavities. Based on the dentist's research, which of the following statements is true?\n\nA. If at least 100 patients were studied, the writer's statement is justified.\nB. If a minimum of 500 patients were studied, the writer's statement is justified.\nC. At least 100 of the patients needed to have brushed their teeth after lunch for the writer's statement to be justified.\nD.

However, based on the information given, we cannot determine the exact sample size required to justify the writer's statement.\n\nHowever, it is generally accepted in scientific research that larger sample sizes provide more reliable results. Therefore, options A and C, which suggest a minimum sample size of 100, may not be sufficient to justify the writer's statement without additional information about the study's design and statistical analysis.\n\nOption D is too extreme, as it suggests that no amount of data could justify the writer's statement. This is unlikely to be true, as a sufficiently large and well-designed study could provide strong evidence for the effectiveness of brushing teeth after lunch in preventing cavities.\n\nTherefore, the most reasonable answer is B: if a minimum of 500 patients were studied, the writer's statement is justified. This assumes that the study was well-designed and that the results were statistically significant with a large enough effect size to support the claim that brushing teeth after lunch prevents cavities. However, without further information about the study, this answer is still somewhat speculative."
