They must be coerced or closely supervised to get them to work towards organizational goals. This theory suggests that workers do not enjoy responsibility, do not view physical and mental effort as a natural part of work, and do not like to show initiative unless they are forced to do so. Instead, they prefer to be directed and told what to do."
