A weaker currency makes imports more expensive, potentially reducing the quantity of imports. However, it also makes exports cheaper for foreign buyers, potentially increasing the quantity of exports. In theory, this could improve the balance of trade by making domestic goods more competitive abroad.\n\nHowever, in practice, the impact on the balance of trade can be more complex. The increase in money supply and lower interest rates can stimulate domestic demand, leading consumers to buy more, including more imported goods. This increased demand for imports can offset the positive effects on exports, potentially worsening the balance of trade if the increase in imports outpaces the increase in exports. Additionally, if the expansionary policy leads to higher inflation, the real value of the currency might decline, making both imports and exports more expensive in real terms, further impacting the balance of trade negatively."
