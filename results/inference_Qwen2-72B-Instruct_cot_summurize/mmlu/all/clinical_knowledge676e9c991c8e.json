Thyroid swellings, or nodules, may not always elevate on swallowing; this can depend on their location and size.\nB. Lymph node enlargement near a thyroid nodule could indicate spread of cancer and is not generally considered a good prognostic sign.\nC. An ultrasound of the thyroid is useful for determining the size, structure, and vascularity of a nodule, but it cannot directly determine if the nodule is actively secreting hormone. Blood tests measuring thyroid hormones and TSH levels would provide that information.\nD. Functioning (hot) nodules on isotope scanning typically do not secrete excessive amounts of thyroid hormone and are less likely to be malignant compared to non-functioning (cold) nodules."
