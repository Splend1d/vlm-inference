While it is true that the control of munitions and arms sales is an important aspect of security policy, it is not typically considered an economic tool in the same way that the others are. The other options (A, B, and D) all involve the use of economic leverage to achieve security or foreign policy goals, whereas option C is more directly related to military or defense policy. However, it should be noted that controlling munitions and arms sales can have significant economic impacts, both domestically and internationally."
