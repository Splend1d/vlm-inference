And although I have a farm of 50 acres close to the town, no doubt the crops and premises would have been destroyed. In fact, this has already partly been the case, and I am now suing the Government for damages done by a contingent of 1,500 natives that have recently encamped not many hundred yards from the place, who have done much damage all around.\"\nLetter from a British citizen to his sister during the Anglo-Zulu War, South Africa, 1879\nA historian researching nineteenth-century conflicts in South Africa would most likely find this letter a useful source for information about which of the following?\n\nA.

The letter provides insight into the direct impacts of conflict on British settlers, including property damage and loss, as well as the implications of relying on insurance and government compensation during times of war. This can shed light on the broader consequences of imperial policies and military engagements on civilian life and property."
