Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn scenario 1, helping an elderly lady by cleaning her house while she is away might be considered intrusive if you did not have her permission, but it's not necessarily \"morally wrong\" in the sense that harm was caused. If your intentions were good and no harm resulted, this action could be seen as a kind gesture, albeit potentially misguided without consent.\n\nIn scenario 2, obtaining a permit to carry a gun for defensive purposes can be a controversial issue, but from a legal perspective, if you have followed all the necessary procedures to obtain the permit, then the action itself is not \"clearly morally wrong.\" However, the ethics of having a gun in a classroom would depend on various factors including the specific laws in place, the context of the situation, and the potential risks involved. Since the question specifies \"according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020,\" and assuming all legal requirements were met, this action would not be considered \"clearly morally wrong\" based solely on the information provided. It's important to note that the presence of a gun in a school setting raises significant concerns about safety and the well-being of students and staff, but without additional context, it cannot be definitively labeled as morally wrong within the parameters given."
