It is determined by the method of limits or the method of adjustment in psychophysical experiments. The JND is not an absolute value but varies according to the intensity of the stimulus being detected.\n\nOption D best describes what the detection of a JND depends on: \"the intensity of the new stimulus and that of the stimulus already present.\" This is because the JND is typically measured as a proportion of the original stimulus intensity. For example, Weber's law states that the JND for a given stimulus is a constant proportion of the stimulus intensity, which means that the JND increases as the stimulus intensity increases. Therefore, the ability to detect a difference between two stimuli depends on the intensities of both stimuli."
