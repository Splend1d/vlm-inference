Laissez-faire\n\nThe style of government that is most associated with limited regulations on business and working conditions, as described in the passage, is laissez-faire. This term refers to an economic system in which transactions between private parties are free from government intervention such as regulation, privileges, tariffs, and subsidies. The passage describes a situation where working conditions and wages are poor, and there are no regulations to protect workers or children from exploitation. This scenario aligns with a laissez-faire approach to governance, where the government takes a hands-off attitude toward economic affairs."
