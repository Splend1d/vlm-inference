They change the habitat in a way that makes it more habitable for other organisms.\n\nDuring ecological succession, the first organisms to colonize a disturbed or previously unoccupied area are known as pioneer species. These organisms often have traits that allow them to survive and thrive in harsh conditions with little competition. Pioneer species play a critical role in altering the environment to make it more suitable for subsequent species. For example, lichens and mosses can break down rock surfaces and add organic material to the soil, making it easier for plants like grasses and shrubs to take root. As these new plants grow, they create a habitat that supports a greater diversity of life, leading to further changes in the community structure over time."
