Reverse channels\n\nReverse channels typically refer to the process of returning products from the consumer back to the producer or another point in the supply chain, such as for recycling or disposal. In this scenario, the producer is not initiating the transaction or the flow of goods, so it does not include a producer in the traditional sense of driving the supply chain forward. The other options (A, C, D) all involve producers in the distribution process."
