Tracking the number of products reworked.\n\nTracking the number of products that require rework is an effective way to measure improvements in product quality as a result of addressing internal failure costs. Internal failure costs include costs associated with defects found before the product reaches the customer, such as scrap, rework, and inspection. By reducing the number of products that need reworking, you can directly see improvements in the manufacturing process and product quality. This metric can help pinpoint where quality control efforts should be focused to reduce waste and improve efficiency."
