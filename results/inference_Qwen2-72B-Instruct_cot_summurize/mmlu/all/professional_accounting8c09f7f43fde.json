Selling costs in this market consist of $10 per unit shipping and a fixed licensing fee of $50000 per year. Reno Co. wishes to buy 5000 of these units on a special order. There would be no shipping costs on this special order. What is the lowest price per unit at which Match should be willing to sell the 5000 units to Reno?\n\nA. $110\nB. $140\nC. $190\nD. 200\n"

The same goes for the fixed portion of the selling costs.\n\nSince there are no additional shipping costs for the special order, the only costs that increase with the production of the 5,000 units for Reno Co. are the variable costs. Therefore, Match Co. should be willing to sell the units to Reno Co. for at least the variable cost per unit, which is $110.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\nA. $110"
