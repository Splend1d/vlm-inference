This stone tool culture is characterized by the use of prepared-core techniques to produce flake tools, such as scrapers, points, and handaxes. While the Acheulean tool tradition was used by earlier hominins including Homo erectus and early Homo sapiens, and the Aurignacian is associated with anatomically modern humans, the Mousterian is most often linked with Neandertals in Europe and Western Asia during the Middle Paleolithic period. However, it's worth noting that some late Acheulean tools have been found at Neandertal sites, so option D could also be considered correct in a broader context."
