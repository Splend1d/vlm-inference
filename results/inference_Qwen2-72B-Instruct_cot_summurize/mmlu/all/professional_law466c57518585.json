The defendant may not introduce evidence of truthfulness unless it is inquired into on cross-examination.\n\nIn a criminal case, the defendant may offer evidence of a pertinent trait of his character only after the prosecution has introduced evidence to rebut that trait or after the defendant's character for that trait has been attacked. In the context of this question, the defendant's character for truthfulness could be relevant if his credibility as a witness is at issue, but he cannot simply offer evidence of his good character without any foundation or prior attack on his character. If the prosecution questions the defendant's honesty or truthfulness during cross-examination, then the defense may introduce evidence to support the defendant's character for truthfulness. However, under Federal Rules of Evidence Rule 404(a)(1), character evidence is not admissible to prove conduct on a specific occasion, except in certain circumstances such as when character is an essential element of a charge, claim, or defense."
