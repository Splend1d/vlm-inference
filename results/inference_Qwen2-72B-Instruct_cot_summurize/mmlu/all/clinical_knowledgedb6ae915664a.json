Stridor due to compression of the trachea (not the oesophagus)\nC. Hoarseness due to compression of the recurrent laryngeal nerve (not directly from compression of the trachea, but because the nerve innervates the vocal cords)\nD. The size of the goitre does not necessarily correlate with the severity of thyrotoxicosis; it depends on the function of the thyroid tissue.\n\nHowever, among the options given, dysphagia (difficulty swallowing) is indeed an indication for surgical intervention in cases of goitre, as it can significantly impact quality of life and may be indicative of significant compressive effects of the goitre on surrounding structures."
