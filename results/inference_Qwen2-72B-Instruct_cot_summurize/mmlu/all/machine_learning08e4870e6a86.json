A 1-nearest neighbor (1-NN) classifier will always classify a point based on its closest neighbor in the training set. Since it uses the closest neighbor, if you were to predict the class of any training point, it would look at its own label (as it is its closest neighbor), and thus, it would always predict correctly for the training data. Hence, the training error would be 0.\n\nStatement 2: As the number of data points grows to infinity, the MAP estimate approaches the MLE estimate for all possible priors. In other words, given enough data, the choice of prior is irrelevant.\n\nThis statement is also true. The Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimate incorporates prior knowledge into the estimation process, whereas the Maximum Likelihood Estimate (MLE) does not. However, as the amount of data increases, the influence of the prior diminishes because the likelihood function becomes more dominant. This means that the MAP estimate will approach the MLE estimate regardless of the prior chosen, assuming the prior is not pathological or assigns zero probability to some parameter values that could be supported by the data.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nA. True, True"
