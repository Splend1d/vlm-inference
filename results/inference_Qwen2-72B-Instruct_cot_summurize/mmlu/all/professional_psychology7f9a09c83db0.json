Adler.\n\nThis notion is most consistent with the philosophy of Alfred Adler, an Austrian psychiatrist and psychotherapist who emphasized the importance of social interest, which involves being connected to others, contributing to society, and feeling a sense of belonging. Adler believed that individuals must balance their own needs with the needs of others in order to lead a fulfilling life. He identified three primary areas where social interest can be expressed: work (occupation), community involvement (friendship), and love relationships (love)."
