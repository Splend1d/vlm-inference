He is sexually active with multiple male and female partners and uses condoms inconsistently. He takes no medications. He drinks two to five beers on social occasions. He occasionally smokes marijuana. His temperature is 36.9\u00b0C (98.4\u00b0F). There is no lymphadenopathy. Examination shows three sessile, flesh-colored lesions on the shaft of the penis that are 10 mm in diameter. On application of a dilute solution of acetic acid, the lesions turn white. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?\n\nA. Oral acyclovir therapy\nB. Oral doxycycline therapy\nC. Intramuscular penicillin therapy\nD. Cryotherapy\n"

The most appropriate next step in management would be:\n\nD. Cryotherapy\n\nCryotherapy is an effective treatment for genital warts and involves freezing the warts with liquid nitrogen. Other treatments include topical medications, surgical excision, and laser therapy, but cryotherapy is a common first-line treatment due to its effectiveness and low cost.\n\nOptions A, B, and C are incorrect because they are treatments for other conditions:\n- Oral acyclovir therapy is used for herpes simplex virus infections.\n- Oral doxycycline therapy is used for bacterial infections, such as chlamydia or gonorrhea.\n- Intramuscular penicillin therapy is used for syphilis and other bacterial infections."
