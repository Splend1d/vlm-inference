Unlike many other ancient civilizations around the world, those in pre-Columbian South America did not develop a written language in the traditional sense. Instead, they used complex systems of record-keeping such as the Inca's quipu, which was a system of knotted strings used for accounting and record-keeping. However, this does not constitute a true written language as we understand it today.\n\nIt's important to note that while these civilizations didn't develop a written language, they did create monumental works, such as the Nazca lines in Peru and the Moche temples; they also developed sophisticated irrigation technologies, like the extensive canal systems of the Norte Chico civilization; and they had significant armies, as evidenced by the military conquests of the Inca Empire."
