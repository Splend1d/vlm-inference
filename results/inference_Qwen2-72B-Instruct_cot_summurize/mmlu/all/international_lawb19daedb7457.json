The determination of baselines is instrumental to the establishment of all maritime zones, since they constitute the starting point for measuring the breadth of each zone.\n\nBaselines under the law of the sea are crucial because they serve as the reference lines from which the breadth of various maritime zones is measured. These include the territorial sea, the contiguous zone, the exclusive economic zone (EEZ), and the continental shelf. The determination of these baselines is therefore fundamental for defining the extent of a coastal State's jurisdiction and rights over adjacent waters and seabed resources."
