Idiopathic fibrosing alveolitis.\n\nIdiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), also known as idiopathic fibrosing alveolitis, is a lung disease characterized by progressive scarring of the lung tissue. This can lead to stiffness and shrinkage of the lungs, causing the trachea to be pulled to the affected side, resulting in tracheal deviation. The other options may cause some lung pathology, but they are less likely to cause significant tracheal deviation compared to IPF."
