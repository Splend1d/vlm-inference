                    "text": "The correct answer is A. stomata on the top surface and relatively few water-conducting (xylem) cells.\n\nAquatic plants like Nymphaea odorata have evolved to live in environments where water is abundant. Their leaves often have stomata on the upper surface because the lower surface is in contact with the water, which makes gas exchange (oxygen intake and carbon dioxide release) more difficult due to the high density of water compared to air. Stomata on the top surface allow for easier gas exchange with the atmosphere.\n\nAdditionally, aquatic plants may have fewer xylem cells because they do not need to transport as much water from roots to leaves as terrestrial plants do. Water is readily available in their environment, so the demand for water transport through xylem is reduced."
