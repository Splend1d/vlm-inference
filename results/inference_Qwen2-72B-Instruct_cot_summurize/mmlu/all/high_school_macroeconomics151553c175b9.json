This increased attractiveness leads to an increase in demand for the country\u2019s currency as foreign investors need to buy the currency to invest in these assets.\n\nAn increase in demand for a country\u2019s currency generally causes the value of that currency to appreciate (rise) relative to other currencies. When a country\u2019s currency appreciates, its goods become more expensive for foreign buyers, which can lead to a decrease in net exports (exports minus imports). The higher price of domestic goods reduces their competitiveness abroad, potentially leading to fewer sales overseas. Additionally, the appreciation of the currency makes imports cheaper for domestic consumers, which could increase the volume of imports.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Increases   Appreciate   Decreases"
