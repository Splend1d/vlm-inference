                    "text": "To determine whether the argument is valid using indirect truth tables, we will test all possible combinations of truth values for the propositions K, L, M, and N. The argument consists of three premises:\n\n1. (K \u00b7 L) \u2283 M\n2. N \u2283 ~M\n3. N \u2228 K\nAnd the conclusion is:\nL \u2283 K\n\nWe will examine each case where the premises are true and see if the conclusion must also be true.\n\nLet's start by listing out all the possible truth value combinations for K, L, M, and N:\n\n1. K = T, L = T, M = T, N = T\n2. K = T, L = T, M = T, N = F\n3. K = T, L = T, M = F, N = T\n4. K = T, L = T, M = F, N = F\n5. K = T, L = F, M = T, N = T\n6. K = T, L = F, M = T, N = F\n7. K = T, L = F, M = F, N = T\n8. K = T, L = F, M = F, N = F\n9. K = F, L = T, M = T, N = T\n10. K = F, L = T, M = T, N = F\n11. K = F, L = T, M = F, N = T\n12. K = F, L = T, M = F, N = F\n13. K = F, L = F, M = T, N = T\n14. K = F, L = F, M = T, N = F\n15. K = F, L = F, M = F, N = T\n16. K = F, L = F, M = F, N = F\n\nNow let's check the truth values of the premises in each case:\n\nPremise 1: (K \u00b7 L) \u2283 M\nPremise 2: N \u2283 ~M\nPremise 3: N \u2228 K\n\nAnd the conclusion:\nL \u2283 K\n\nWe can eliminate cases where any premise is false since those cases do not support the argument being valid.\n\nFor instance, in case 3 (K = T, L = T, M = F, N = T), Premise 1 ((K \u00b7 L) \u2283 M) would be false because K and L are both true but M is false. This means case 3 does not support the validity of the argument.\n\nLet's check for a counterexample where the premises are all true but the conclusion is false.\n\nIn case D (L and N are true and K and M are false), we have:\n- K = F, L = T, M = F, N = T\n\nChecking the premises:\n1. (K \u00b7 L) \u2283 M becomes (F \u00b7 T) \u2283 F, which simplifies to F \u2283 F, which is true.\n2. N \u2283 ~M becomes T \u2283 ~F, which simplifies to T \u2283 T, which is true.\n3. N \u2228 K becomes T \u2228 F, which simplifies to T.\n\nAll premises are true. Now let's check the conclusion:\nL \u2283 K becomes T \u2283 F, which is false.\n\nThus, there is a counterexample where the premises are all true but the conclusion is false, specifically when L and N are true and K and M are false.\n\nThe answer is:\n\nD. Invalid. Counterexample when L and N are true and K and M are false."
