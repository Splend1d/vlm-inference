                    "text": "The best way for the defendant to seek relief from the judgment is C. Move for relief from the judgment on the ground that the plaintiff committed a fraud in obtaining damages for permanent injuries.\n\nThis option is the most appropriate because it directly addresses the fact that the plaintiff misrepresented the nature and extent of her injuries to the court. The evidence of the plaintiff jogging with her doctor, which was not available during the trial, clearly shows that she did not suffer from the permanent paralysis she claimed. This constitutes a fraud upon the court, as it was material to the case and influenced the jury's decision to award damages based on false information.\n\nOption A (Move for a new trial or in the alternative for remittitur) might be considered if the issue was merely the amount of damages awarded, but in this case, the fundamental basis of the claim has been called into question due to the plaintiff's apparent misrepresentation.\n\nOption B (Move for relief from the judgment on the ground that the judgment was based on the jury's mistaken belief) does not specifically address the fraudulent behavior of the plaintiff. While it is true that the judgment was based on a mistaken belief, the reason for that mistake was the plaintiff's fraud.\n\nOption D (Move for relief from the judgment on the ground that there is newly discovered evidence) could also be valid, but it does not specifically mention the fraudulent conduct of the plaintiff. Since the evidence suggests that the plaintiff intentionally misled the court, alleging fraud is more direct and appropriate. However, newly discovered evidence can be a ground for relief under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 60(b)(2), especially when it pertains to fraud. In practice, both grounds might be included in the motion, but alleging fraud is likely to have a stronger impact on the court's consideration of the motion."
