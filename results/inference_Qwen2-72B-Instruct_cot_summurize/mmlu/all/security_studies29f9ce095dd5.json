Investigations into the consequences of state security policies showed that women were subject to masculine dominated war policies as the likely victims as casualties of war or as post conflict targets. Women are increasingly subject to violence as a product of social circumstance.\nB. Gendered consequences of security issues have not challenged international relations theory. Constructivist theories of the state were mainstreamed without undermining the ideas of state as the centre of military power, or as the highest organization of human community.\nC. Feminist and critical security theory shows us that war can have gendered consequences. Recognition of those consequences has allowed us to address the way in which we think about 'male' and 'female' expectations in warfare, and has shaped the way in which we theorise, participate, and protest against those roles.\nD. The literature that emerged in the 1980s and 1990s was primarily concerned with the ways in which women had served the purposes of nationalist campaigns, focusing on the biological characteristics of women as sexually reproductive beings, and with little focus on critical analysis.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is C.\n\nFeminist and critical security theory have significantly expanded our understanding of gender security issues by highlighting the gendered consequences of security policies and practices. These investigations have shown that women are often disproportionately affected by war and conflict, both as direct casualties and as targets of post-conflict violence. By recognizing these gendered consequences, feminist and critical security theory have challenged traditional notions of masculinity and femininity in warfare, and have encouraged us to rethink our assumptions about the roles and expectations of men and women in conflict situations. This has led to a more nuanced understanding of the ways in which gender intersects with other forms of identity, such as race, class, and sexuality, to shape experiences of insecurity and violence. Overall, feminist and critical security theory have enriched our understanding of security issues by bringing a gender lens to bear on traditionally male-dominated fields of study, and by highlighting the importance of intersectional analysis in understanding complex social phenomena. Answer A is partially correct but does not fully capture the breadth of feminist and critical security theory's contributions to our understanding of gender security issues. Answer B is incorrect because feminist and critical security theory have indeed challenged international relations theory by questioning the centrality of the state and the use of military force in resolving conflicts. Answer D is also incorrect because while some early feminist literature did focus on women's roles in nationalist campaigns, feminist and critical security theory have since moved beyond this narrow focus to explore a wide range of gendered security issues."
