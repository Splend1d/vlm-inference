This means that one should only act on principles that they would want everyone else to follow. This is known as the Categorical Imperative, which is a central concept in Kant's moral philosophy. It contrasts with utilitarianism (option A), which focuses on maximizing happiness, and other ethical theories that emphasize virtue or selflessness."
