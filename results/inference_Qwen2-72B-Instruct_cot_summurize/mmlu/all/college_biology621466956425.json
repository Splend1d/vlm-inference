This means that among various possible forms of a trait, the one that provides the best balance between the benefits it offers and the costs it incurs will be favored by natural selection and therefore more likely to be passed on to future generations. This concept emphasizes the relative fitness advantage of a trait compared to its alternatives rather than an absolute measure of benefit or cost."
