The defendant claimed that he acted in self-defense after he was attacked by the victim, who was drunk and belligerent. At trial, the defendant called a witness who testified that the victim was the aggressor in the altercation. On cross-examination of the witness, the prosecuting attorney asked the witness the following question:\"Isn't it true that when you filed your federal income tax return last year, you failed to report the interest income from your savings accounts?\" The prosecuting attorney was informed of this fact by the witness's accountant. Upon objection by the defendant's attorney, the prosecutor's question is\n\nA. improper, because it is not relevant to the issues in the case.\nB. improper, because the defendant has not been convicted of any crime in connection with the tax return.\nC. within the court's discretion to allow, because filing a false income tax return is an act that bears on the witness's truthfulness.\nD. within the court's discretion to allow, because federal income tax evasion is a crime punishable by imprisonment in excess of one year.\n"

                    "text": "The prosecutor's question is potentially within the court's discretion to allow under certain circumstances. Under Federal Rules of Evidence Rule 608(b), evidence of a witness's specific instances of conduct is not admissible to prove the character of the witness for truthfulness or untruthfulness unless the evidence is offered to rebut evidence that the witness's character for truthfulness has been attacked. However, Rule 609(a)(2) allows for the admission of evidence of a witness's conviction for a crime if the crime involved dishonesty or false statement, regardless of the punishment.\n\nIn this case, the witness's failure to report interest income on his federal income tax return could be seen as an act involving dishonesty or false statement. Therefore, the prosecutor's question might be considered proper under Rule 609(a)(2) to challenge the witness's credibility based on an act of dishonesty. However, this would only be the case if the witness had been convicted of the crime related to the false tax return.\n\nIf there has been no conviction, then the question would not be admissible under Rule 609(a)(2). Instead, the prosecutor would have to argue that the question is admissible under Rule 608(b) as evidence of the witness's character for truthfulness. However, Rule 608(b) generally prohibits the use of specific instances of conduct to attack or support a witness's character for truthfulness unless they are part of the direct examination's subject matter or are used to rebut evidence of the witness's character for truthfulness.\n\nGiven that the question pertains to an act that involves dishonesty, but assuming there has been no conviction, the most accurate answer to the scenario presented would be:\n\nC. within the court's discretion to allow, because filing a false income tax return is an act that bears on the witness's truthfulness.\n\nHowever, it should be noted that whether such evidence is ultimately allowed is at the discretion of the court, which must balance the probative value of the evidence against its potential prejudicial effect and consider whether other rules or statutes might limit its admissibility."
