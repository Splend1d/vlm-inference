When DFP binds to ACE, the ACE enzyme is rendered permanently inactive. This makes DFP a potent toxin, with lethal amounts at less than 100 mg. The interaction between DFP and ACE can best be characterized as:\n\nA. Competitive inhibition\nB. Noncompetitive inhibition\nC. Irreversible inhibition\nD. Partially competitive inhibition\n"

Irreversible inhibition\n\nThe interaction between DFP and ACE can best be characterized as irreversible inhibition because DFP permanently inactivates the enzyme by binding to the active site. This type of inhibition cannot be overcome by increasing the concentration of substrate, as the inhibitor forms a stable covalent bond with the enzyme, rendering it inactive permanently."
