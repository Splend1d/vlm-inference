In Scenario 2, playing the guitar while your roommate is listening might be inconsiderate if it disturbs them, but it is not necessarily morally wrong unless there was an agreement or understanding that you wouldn't play during certain times. Without additional context, it's hard to determine if this action breaches a specific agreement, so it's categorized as \"not wrong\" based on the information provided."
