Autotrophs, which make their own food, had to evolve.\n\nThis is because autotrophs, such as cyanobacteria and plants, use photosynthesis to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen. This process releases oxygen into the atmosphere, which eventually led to the oxygenation of Earth's atmosphere. Before this could happen, autotrophs needed to evolve to perform photosynthesis. Heterotrophs, which consume other organisms for energy, do not produce oxygen and therefore did not play a direct role in filling the atmosphere with oxygen."
