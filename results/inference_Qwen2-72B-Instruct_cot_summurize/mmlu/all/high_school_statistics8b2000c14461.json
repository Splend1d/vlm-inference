The first study is an observational study, while the second is a controlled experiment.\n\nThe first study observes the difference in weight between two groups of people based on their dietary habits (meat eaters vs. vegetarians) without any intervention from the researchers. This makes it an observational study.\n\nThe second study involves an intervention where researchers control the diets of the participants by assigning them either a meat-based or a vegetarian diet for 6 months. This makes it a controlled experiment."
