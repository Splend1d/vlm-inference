He saw two police officers walking toward him. The officers were checking on a 911 call from a resident who observed a man in jeans and a jacket apparently selling drugs to people on the street. When the police first saw him, he was walking alone, in the area that the woman identified. As they approached, he suddenly crossed the street by jaywalking. They followed, and approaching from behind, asked him to stop. He started walking faster, away from them. The officers saw what appeared to be a heavy object bulging in his pocket as he moved. The officers, with over 10 years of foot patrol experience, stepped up and stopped him. They patted him down and found a concealed, unlicensed handgun in the jacket pocket. They then made a full search and found 50 packets of heroin. He filed a motion to suppress the gun and drug evidence. Will the court likely suppress the evidence?\n\nA. No, because the accumulation of factors all added up to reasonable suspicion for a stop and articulable suspicion for a frisk.\nB. No, because the police had probable cause to make an arrest when the man began to walk away from them and walk even faster as they followed him.\nC. Yes, because they didn't know if this was the same man, they observed nothing illegal except jaywalking, and he had a right to avoid them under the circumstances.\nD. Yes, because the police lacked reasonable suspicion to stop the man simply because he crossed the street and walked faster away from them.\n"

No, because the accumulation of factors all added up to reasonable suspicion for a stop and articulable suspicion for a frisk.\n\nThe police officers had received a specific tip about someone matching the man's description selling drugs in the area. The man's behavior of crossing the street abruptly (jaywalking) and increasing his pace when he noticed the officers could be seen as evasive behavior, which is often associated with criminal activity. The visible bulge in his pocket that appeared to be a heavy object could also suggest he was carrying a weapon or contraband. Given the high-crime area and the officers' extensive experience, these factors together provided them with reasonable suspicion to stop and frisk the man for officer safety, which led to the discovery of the handgun and heroin. This level of suspicion meets the legal standard set by Terry v. Ohio for a temporary detention and protective search."
