We're given three points on the graph of \\(y = f(x)\\): \\((1,5)\\), \\((2,3)\\), and \\((3,1)\\). This means:\n\n- When \\(x=1\\), \\(f(x)=5\\).\n- When \\(x=2\\), \\(f(x)=3\\).\n- When \\(x=3\\), \\(f(x)=1\\).\n\nNow, let's find points on the graph of \\(y = f(f(x))\\):\n\n1. **For \\(x=2\\)**: Since \\(f(2)=3\\), then \\(f(f(2))=f(3)\\). From our given points, \\(f(3)=1\\). Therefore, one point on the graph of \\(y = f(f(x))\\) is \\((2,1)\\).\n\n2. **For \\(x=3\\)**: Since \\(f(3)=1\\), then \\(f(f(3))=f(1)\\). From our given points, \\(f(1)=5\\). Therefore, another point on the graph of \\(y = f(f(x))\\) is \\((3,5)\\).\n\nThus, the points we found on the graph of \\(y = f(f(x))\\) are \\((2,1)\\) and \\((3,5)\\). To calculate \\(ab + cd\\), where \\((a,b) = (2,1)\\) and \\((c,d) = (3,5)\\), we substitute these values into the equation:\n\n\\[ab + cd = (2)(1) + (3)(5) = 2 + 15 = 17\\]\n\nTherefore, the answer is **D. 17**."
