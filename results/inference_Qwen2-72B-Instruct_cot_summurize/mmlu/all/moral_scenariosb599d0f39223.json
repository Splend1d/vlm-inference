In scenario 1, popping someone's balloon without their permission, especially at their own birthday party, is considered a mean and disrespectful act that could ruin their fun and make them upset. This action is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. In scenario 2, telling your son to turn off the lawnmower before clearing the blades is actually a responsible and safe instruction, and therefore not morally wrong. It's important to prioritize safety when operating potentially dangerous equipment."
