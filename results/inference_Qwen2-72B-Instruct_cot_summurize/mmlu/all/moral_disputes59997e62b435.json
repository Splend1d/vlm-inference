According to Ross, the duty of reparation is one of the seven prima facie duties that people have in their interactions with others. This duty requires individuals to make restitution or compensation to those they have wronged, even if doing so may be difficult or inconvenient. It is based on the idea that justice requires that people take responsibility for their actions and make things right when they have caused harm to others."
