The sun was gone, but he had left his footprints in the sky. It was the time for sitting on porches beside the road. It was the time to hear things and talk. These sitters had been tongueless, earless, eyeless conveniences all day long. Mules and other brutes had occupied their skins. But now, the sun and the bossman were gone, so the skins felt powerful and human. They became lords of sounds and lesser things. They passed nations through their mouths. They sat in judgment. The description of the sun in the second sentence contains which of the following literary devices?\n\nA. Foreshadowing\nB. Irony\nC. Flashback\nD. Personification\n"

This is because the author attributes human qualities to the sun by stating that it \"had left his footprints in the sky.\" This personification helps to create a vivid image and sets the tone for the scene being described."
