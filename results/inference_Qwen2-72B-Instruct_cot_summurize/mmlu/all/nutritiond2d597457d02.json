A difference in perception of risk\n\nThe Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE), commonly known as mad cow disease, significantly impacted food choices due to a change in the public's perception of risk associated with consuming beef products. The potential link between BSE in cattle and variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) in humans led to widespread concern about the safety of beef, causing many people to reduce their consumption of beef or avoid it altogether. This shift in consumer behavior was driven by fears over health risks rather than economic factors, distrust in authorities, or scientific research into meat alternatives."
