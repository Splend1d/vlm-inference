This often results in too little of the good being produced or consumed from society's perspective because the producer does not capture the full social benefit of their actions.\n\nTo correct for this market failure and encourage more production or consumption of the good with a positive externality, a government subsidy can be provided to either producers or consumers. This subsidy helps to align private incentives with social benefits by making the good cheaper to produce or consume, thus increasing its quantity in the market to a socially optimal level."
