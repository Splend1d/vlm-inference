All of the above.\n\nIn all three methods - Best-subset selection, Forward stepwise selection, and Forward stagewise selection - the models obtained during the feature selection process can indeed differ from the final model. This is because these methods involve iterative or exhaustive searches to identify the optimal subset of features, and the coefficients of the features in the intermediate models may change as new features are added or removed. In the case of best-subset selection, all possible models are considered, and the \"best\" one is chosen based on some criterion (like AIC, BIC). In forward stepwise and stagewise selection, the process is more sequential, with features being added one at a time based on their contribution to model improvement, but the final model could still be different due to the nature of these iterative processes."
