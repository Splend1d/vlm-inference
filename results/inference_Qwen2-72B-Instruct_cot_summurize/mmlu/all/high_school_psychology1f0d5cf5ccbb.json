Major depressive disorder.\n\nLearned helplessness is a psychological state in which an individual feels powerless to affect change in their life, even when opportunities for change are present. This concept is often linked to the development of depression and other mood disorders. It was first observed in experiments with dogs who, after receiving inescapable electric shocks, failed to escape even when they could have done so later on. This behavior is similar to what can be seen in humans suffering from depression, leading to the suggestion that learned helplessness might play a role in the development of major depressive disorder."
