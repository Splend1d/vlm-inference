Mechanical solidarity\n\nHowever, it's important to note that while there are similarities, they are not exactly the same. Gemeinschaft refers to social bonds based on personal social interactions, which are common in traditional, small-scale societies. This is akin to mechanical solidarity described by \u00c9mile Durkheim, where society is held together by shared values and beliefs, common in pre-industrial societies.\n\nBut T\u00f6nnies' concept of Gemeinschaft also encompasses a sense of community and a personal connection between individuals that may not be fully captured by Durkheim's term. In contrast, Gesellschaft, another concept by T\u00f6nnies, refers to modern social relationships that are more impersonal and based on individual self-interests, similar to organic solidarity where society is held together by interdependence arising from the specialization of work."
