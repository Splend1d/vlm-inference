In many primate species, males that are larger or more robust than females may use their size to compete with other males for access to mates. This can lead to pronounced differences in physical characteristics between males and females, such as body size, strength, or weaponry like horns or antlers in other animals (though not typically in primates). Thus, a high degree of sexual dimorphism is often associated with intense male-male competition over mating opportunities."
