Passive Transport\n\nPassive transport includes diffusion and osmosis, both of which rely on the concentration gradient of substances to move across the cell membrane without the expenditure of energy by the cell. In contrast, active transport requires energy (ATP) to move substances against their concentration gradient. Endocytosis is a form of active transport where the cell membrane engulfs and brings in material from the extracellular space."
