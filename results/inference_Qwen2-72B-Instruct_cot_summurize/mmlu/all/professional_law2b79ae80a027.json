Since a fundamental right is involved, the state must show the regulation is necessary to vindicate a compelling government interest.\nB. Since no fundamental right is involved, the petitioner must show the age restriction is not rationally related to a legitimate government interest.\nC. The state must show the age regulation substantially furthers an important government objective and does not impair the fundamental right to vote.\nD.
