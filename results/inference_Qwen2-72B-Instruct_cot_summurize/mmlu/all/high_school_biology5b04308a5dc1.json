They carry blood away from the heart.\n\nArteries are typically muscular and elastic, designed to withstand high pressure as they transport blood from the heart to the rest of the body. While most arteries do carry oxygenated blood, there are exceptions, such as the pulmonary artery which carries deoxygenated blood from the heart to the lungs. Arteries do not have valves; veins are the blood vessels that contain valves to prevent backflow."
