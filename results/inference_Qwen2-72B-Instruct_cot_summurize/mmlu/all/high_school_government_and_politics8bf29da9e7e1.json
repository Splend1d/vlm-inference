This type of coverage tends to emphasize the strategic aspects of the election, including campaign strategies, fundraising, and endorsements, but may not delve deeply into the specific policy positions of the candidates. While some information about candidates' positions on both international and domestic issues may be covered, it is typically the polling data that receives the most consistent and prominent attention. Endorsements by special interest groups might be reported, but they are less likely to be a central focus of news coverage compared to polling data."
