Just before the parties signed the one-page written contract, the homeowner called to the contractor's attention the fact that the contract did not specify a time of completion. The parties orally agreed but did not specify in the contract that the contractor would complete the work in 60 days, and then they both signed the contract. The contract did not contain a merger clause. The contractor failed to finish the work in 60 days. The homeowner has sued the contractor for breach of contract. Is the court likely to admit evidence concerning the parties' oral agreement that the work would be completed in 60 days?\n\nA. No, because the court must ascertain the meaning of the agreement from the terms of the written contract.\nB. No, because the oral agreement was merely part of the parties' negotiations.\nC. Yes, because the contract is ambiguous.\nD. Yes, because the time limit is an additional term that does not contradict the partially integrated written contract.\n"

Yes, because the time limit is an additional term that does not contradict the partially integrated written contract.\n\nIn this scenario, the written contract did not include all the terms agreed upon by the parties, specifically the time of completion. Since there is no merger clause stating that the written contract contains all the terms of the agreement, the court can consider evidence of the oral agreement regarding the 60-day completion time frame as it is an additional term that does not contradict the terms included in the written contract. This allows the court to fully understand the intentions of the parties and the scope of their agreement."
