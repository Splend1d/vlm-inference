II only\n\nCombinational circuits do not have memory and do not rely on previous input states, while sequential circuits do have memory elements that can retain information from previous inputs. Therefore, statement II is true. Statement I is false because combinational circuits do not have feedback loops, while sequential circuits may have them. Statement III is also false since combinational circuits do not require an external clock to function, whereas sequential circuits often do."
