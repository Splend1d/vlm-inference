The velocity of money is stable.\n\nMonetarism, an economic theory developed by Milton Friedman, assumes that the velocity of money (the rate at which money changes hands in an economy) is stable and predictable over time. This allows monetarists to argue that changes in the money supply will directly affect the overall price level in the economy, thus influencing inflation. According to monetarist theory, if the money supply grows faster than the real output of the economy, it will lead to inflation. Therefore, controlling the growth rate of the money supply becomes a key policy tool for managing inflation."
