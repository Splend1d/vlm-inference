Then, for all \\(a, b \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\),\n\\[f(a + b) = f(a) + f(b)\\]\n\nSince \\(\\mathbb{Z}_2 = \\{[0], [1]\\}\\), where \\([0]\\) is the equivalence class of 0 and \\([1]\\) is the equivalence class of 1 in \\(\\mathbb{Z}_2\\), the only possible values for \\(f(a)\\) are \\([0]\\) or \\([1]\\).\n\nConsider \\(f(1)\\). Since \\(f\\) is a homomorphism,\n\\[f(n) = f(1 + 1 + \\cdots + 1) = nf(1)\\]\nfor any integer \\(n\\). However, since \\(f(n) \\in \\mathbb{Z}_2\\), the only possible values for \\(nf(1)\\) are \\([0]\\) and \\([1]\\). This means that \\(f(1)\\) must be chosen so that \\(nf(1)\\) can only take on the values \\([0]\\) and \\([1]\\) for all \\(n \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\).\n\nIf \\(f(1) = [0]\\), then for any \\(n \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\), \\(f(n) = nf(1) = n[0] = [0]\\). Thus, \\(f\\) maps every element of \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\) to \\([0]\\) in \\(\\mathbb{Z}_2\\). This defines one homomorphism.\n\nIf \\(f(1) = [1]\\), then for even \\(n\\), \\(f(n) = nf(1) = n[1] = [0]\\) (since an even number times \\([1]\\) is equivalent to \\([0]\\) in \\(\\mathbb{Z}_2\\)). For odd \\(n\\), \\(f(n) = nf(1) = n[1] = [1]\\) (since an odd number times \\([1]\\) is equivalent to \\([1]\\) in \\(\\mathbb{Z}_2\\)). This also defines a valid homomorphism.\n\nThus, there are exactly two homomorphisms from \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\) to \\(\\mathbb{Z}_2\\):\n1. The trivial homomorphism which maps everything to \\([0]\\).\n2. The non-trivial homomorphism which maps even numbers to \\([0]\\) and odd numbers to \\([1]\\).\n\nThe answer is:\n\nB. 2"
