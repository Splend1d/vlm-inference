He also has had fever, headache, stiff neck, and vomiting since he returned from summer camp 2 days ago. His parents say he does not use illicit drugs. On arrival, he is combative and there is evidence of hallucinations. His temperature is 40\u00b0C (104\u00b0F), pulse is 80/min, respirations are 17/min, and blood pressure is 100/70 mm Hg. A lumbar puncture is performed. Results of cerebrospinal fluid analysis show cysts and trophozoites. The most likely portal of pathogen entry into this patient's central nervous system is which of the following?\n\nA. Facial nerve\nB. Frontal sinus\nC. Mastoid sinus\nD. Olfactory nerve\n"

Certain parasites can gain access to the brain through the olfactory nerve, which connects the nasal cavity directly to the brain. This could explain the presence of cysts and trophozoites in the cerebrospinal fluid. However, it's important to note that without additional context or specific information about the type of cysts and trophozoites identified, other routes of entry cannot be completely ruled out. But given the options provided, olfactory nerve invasion is the most plausible route for parasitic infection leading to meningoencephalitis."
