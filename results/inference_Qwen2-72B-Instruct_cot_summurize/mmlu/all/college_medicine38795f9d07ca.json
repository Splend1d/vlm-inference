To coat the proteins with a large positive charge, since amino acid side chains may have positive, negative, or neutral charges, and a large uniform charge is necessary to get good separation in the gel.\nB. To allow the electrophoresis to separate the proteins solely on the basis of the length of the primary sequence.\nC. To prevent the protein from denaturing so that the electrophoresis can accurately resolve the proteins on the basis of tertiary structure.\nD. To break the intramolecular bonds holding the tertiary and primary structure of the protein together, thereby generating linear fragments that may be sorted on size.\n"

However, this statement is not entirely accurate. The correct rationale should be:\n\nD. To break the intramolecular bonds holding the tertiary and quaternary structures of the protein together, thereby allowing the proteins to take on a linear shape. This is done so that the electrophoresis can accurately resolve the proteins based on their size (molecular weight) rather than their shape or charge.\n\nSDS (sodium dodecyl sulfate) binds to the proteins, giving them a uniform negative charge per unit of mass. This ensures that the migration of the proteins through the gel during electrophoresis is determined by their size rather than their intrinsic charge or shape. The heat applied during the sample preparation also helps to denature the proteins, contributing to the linearization of their structure."
