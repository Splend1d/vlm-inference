Men who are honorable in their dealings with their white neighbors will cheat a Negro without feeling a single twinge of their honor. To kill a Negro they do not deem murder; to debauch a Negro woman they do not think fornication; to take the property away from a Negro they do not consider robbery. The people boast that when they get freedmen affairs in their own hands, to use their own classic expression, 'the niggers will catch hell.'\n\"The reason of all this is simple and manifest. The whites esteem the blacks their property by natural right, and however much they may admit that the individual relations of masters and slaves have been destroyed by the war and the President's emancipation proclamation, they still have an ingrained feeling that the blacks at large belong to the whites at large, and whenever opportunity serves they treat the colored people just as their profit, caprice or passion may dictate.\"\n\u2014Congressional testimony of Col. Samuel Thomas, Assistant Commissioner, Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen and Abandoned Lands, 1865\nWhich of the following specific developments contributed to the general sentiment expressed in Federalist #15?\n\nA. Great Britain refused to evacuate forts in the Great Lakes region.\nB. Spanish forces retook Florida from the United States.\nC. French forces aided American Indians in conducting raids on New England.\nD. Dutch traders forced American ships to extend tribute payments in order to dock in Holland.\n"

                    "text": "The question seems to be referencing Federalist #15, but the text provided is actually a quote from Congressional testimony of Col. Samuel Thomas in 1865 regarding the treatment of African Americans after the Civil War. The context does not relate to Federalist #15, which was written by Alexander Hamilton and discusses the need for a stronger federal government to address the weaknesses of the Articles of Confederation.\n\nHowever, since the question asks about a development contributing to the sentiment expressed in Federalist #15, we should consider historical events that might have led to the arguments made in that essay. Federalist #15 addresses the need for a strong central government to deal with issues that the states cannot handle individually, such as defense, foreign policy, and interstate disputes.\n\nNone of the answer choices (A, B, C, D) directly relate to the context of Col. Samuel Thomas' testimony, but if we were to consider them in relation to the themes of Federalist #15, option A could potentially fit. Great Britain refusing to evacuate forts in the Great Lakes region could be seen as a challenge to the young nation's sovereignty and a situation where a strong federal government would be necessary to negotiate or enforce its demands on foreign powers.\n\nSo, if we must choose from the options given and relate them to Federalist #15's theme, the answer would be:\n\nA. Great Britain refused to evacuate forts in the Great Lakes region. \n\nThis event could have contributed to the sentiment that a stronger federal government was needed to manage external threats and ensure national security, which is one of the themes addressed in Federalist #15."
