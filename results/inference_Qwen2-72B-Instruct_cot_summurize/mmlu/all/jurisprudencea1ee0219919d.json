Gemeinschaft is a society based on community, Gesellschaft one based on association.\n\nGemeinschaft typically refers to a social structure characterized by close personal relationships, shared values, and a strong sense of community, often found in rural or traditional societies. In contrast, Gesellschaft describes a more modern social structure where relationships are more impersonal and based on individual self-interests and associations, often found in urban or industrial societies."
