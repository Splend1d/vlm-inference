                    "text": "The statement by Hart reflects the idea that legal validity and moral correctness are distinct concepts. Legal positivism, as a theory, maintains that the existence and content of law are one thing, and its merits and demerits (moral value) are another. Therefore, Hart's assertion aligns most closely with option D: that there is no moral duty to obey an unjust law. This suggests that while a law may be legally valid (i.e., properly enacted according to the rules of the legal system), it does not automatically follow that individuals are morally obligated to comply with it if it is unjust.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that this interpretation does not mean that all legal positivists would agree with Hart's view on the relationship between law and morality. Some positivists might argue that the legality of a law is entirely separate from its morality, and that citizens have a duty to obey the law regardless of its moral content. Hart's position, though, seems to suggest a more nuanced understanding where legal validity does not necessarily entail moral legitimacy."
