He signed a note to the bank and secured repayment of the loan with a mortgage. After purchasing the house, the man borrowed money from his credit union to make the repairs. The man signed a note to the credit union; this note was also secured by a mortgage on the house. Both mortgages were promptly recorded in the order granted. The man was personally liable on both loans. The man moved into the house and made the necessary repairs. He later defaulted on the debt to the bank, and the bank initiated judicial foreclosure proceedings, naming both the man and the credit union as parties to the action. An outside party acquired the house at the foreclosure sale. After the expenses of the sale and the balance due the bank have been paid, $5,000 remains in the sale the bank have been paid, $5,000 remains in the sale proceeds. The outstanding balance of the credit union loan is $20,000. The man and the credit union both claim the $5,000. There is no applicable statute. Who is entitled to the $5,000?\n\nA. The credit union, because the credit union has priority.\nB. The credit union, because the man is personally liable on the debt.\nC. The man, because of his equitable right of redemption.\nD. The man, because the outside party received title to the house subject to the second mortgage.\n"

                    "text": "The answer is A. The credit union, because the credit union has priority.\n\nIn real estate law, when there are multiple mortgages on a property, the priority of the mortgages determines the distribution of the proceeds from a foreclosure sale. The first mortgage (in this case, the one held by the bank) takes priority over subsequent mortgages (the one held by the credit union). When the first mortgage is satisfied from the sale proceeds, any remaining funds go to the holder of the second mortgage, assuming it was properly recorded and is superior to any other junior liens.\n\nSince the bank's mortgage was recorded first and has been fully satisfied, the remaining $5,000 goes to the credit union, which holds the second mortgage. The fact that the man is personally liable on the debt does not affect the priority of the mortgages or the distribution of the sale proceeds. Additionally, the man's equitable right of redemption would allow him to reclaim the property before the foreclosure sale is confirmed, but it does not apply after the sale has been completed and the surplus determined. The outside party who acquired the house at the foreclosure sale did so free and clear of the man's rights, except for any junior liens that were not addressed in the foreclosure sale. However, since the credit union's lien was prior to any other potential junior liens, it is entitled to the remaining funds."
