The adjustments include adding back non-cash expenses and removing gains that do not result in cash inflows. Among the options given:\n\nA. Purchase of equipment - This is a cash outflow and would be subtracted from cash flow when reconciling from net income to cash flow from operations under the direct method. However, under the indirect method, this item does not directly affect the adjustment of net income because it's already included as a use of cash in investing activities.\n\nB. Payment on long-term debt - This is also a cash outflow and would be subtracted from cash flow under the direct method, but under the indirect method, it is not added back to net income. It is instead reported in the financing activities section.\n\nC. Depreciation - This is a non-cash expense that reduces net income but does not actually decrease cash. Therefore, depreciation must be added back to net income when calculating cash flow from operating activities under the indirect method.\n\nD. Decrease in accounts payable - A decrease in accounts payable represents a use of cash, so this would reduce cash flow from operating activities under both the direct and indirect methods. Under the indirect method, this decrease would be subtracted from net income.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nC. Depreciation."
