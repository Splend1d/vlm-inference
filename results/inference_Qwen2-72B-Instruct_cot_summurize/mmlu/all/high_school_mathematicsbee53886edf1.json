All 4 balls in one box: There is only 1 way to do this since the boxes are indistinguishable.\n\n2. 3 balls in one box and 1 ball in the other:\n   - ABC in one box, D in the other.\n   - ABD in one box, C in the other.\n   - ACD in one box, B in the other.\n   - BCD in one box, A in the other.\n   \n   That's 4 ways.\n\n3. 2 balls in each box:\n   - AB in one box, CD in the other.\n   - AC in one box, BD in the other.\n   - AD in one box, BC in the other.\n   \n   That's 3 ways.\n\nAdding these up, we get 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 ways.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. 8."
