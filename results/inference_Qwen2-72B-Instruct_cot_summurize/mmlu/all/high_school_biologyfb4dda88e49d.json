                    "text": "When a reaction is at equilibrium, it means that the forward and reverse reactions are occurring at the same rate, and the concentrations of reactants and products remain constant over time. To shift the equilibrium and produce more product C, we need to alter conditions in such a way that the forward reaction (A + B \u2192 C) is favored.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Removing some of reactant A: This will decrease the concentration of A, which will cause the equilibrium to shift towards the reactants, reducing the production of C.\n\nB. Removing some of product C: According to Le Chatelier's principle, if you remove some of the product from a reaction at equilibrium, the reaction will shift to replace what was removed. Thus, removing some of product C will cause the equilibrium to shift to the right, favoring the forward reaction and producing more C.\n\nC. Adding more enzyme K: Enzymes increase the rate of a reaction by lowering the activation energy required for the reaction to proceed. However, they do not affect the equilibrium position of a reaction. Therefore, adding more enzyme K will speed up both the forward and reverse reactions equally, but it will not change the amount of product C at equilibrium.\n\nD. Increasing the temperature of the system: Increasing the temperature can shift an exothermic reaction to the left (towards the reactants) and an endothermic reaction to the right (towards the products). Without knowing whether the reaction A + B \u2192 C is exothermic or endothermic, it is difficult to determine how this will affect the equilibrium. However, in general, increasing the temperature increases the kinetic energy of molecules, leading to more collisions and potentially more product formation, but this depends on the reaction specifics.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most direct way to produce more product C when the reaction is at equilibrium is to **remove some of the product C** (option B), which will cause the equilibrium to shift to the right, favoring the production of more C.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **B. removing some of reactant C**."
