Double fertilization\n\nDouble fertilization is a process specific to angiosperms (flowering plants) where two sperm cells from the pollen grain fuse with two different cells in the ovule. One sperm fuses with the egg cell, forming a zygote, and the other sperm fuses with two polar nuclei, forming the endosperm. This dual fertilization event is unique to angiosperms and plays a crucial role in their reproductive biology."
