This is a common financial arrangement for acquiring temporary use of a vehicle.\n\nIn Scenario 2, sitting astride a dog and prodding it to carry you is considered morally wrong. This action can cause physical harm or psychological distress to the animal, which is against animal welfare principles and ethical treatment of animals."
