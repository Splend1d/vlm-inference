Nightmares usually occur during REM (Rapid Eye Movement) sleep, which is when most dreaming happens. They can be triggered by various factors such as stress, medications, sleep disorders, or traumatic experiences. In this case, Quinn's dream about falling to his death is consistent with the typical content of a nightmare."
