Sandel argues that by attempting to control or manipulate the traits of future generations through genetic engineering, we are overstepping our bounds as human beings and assuming a god-like role in determining the characteristics of life. This is seen as problematic from a religious perspective because it challenges the idea that life is sacred and should be left to the natural order established by a higher power."
