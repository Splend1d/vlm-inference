In scenario 2, while the action might be seen as selfish or irrational, it is not necessarily morally wrong unless there were other people in danger who could have been saved instead of the doll. However, the scenario does not provide enough context to determine if there were others in need, so based on the information given, it cannot be deemed clearly morally wrong."
