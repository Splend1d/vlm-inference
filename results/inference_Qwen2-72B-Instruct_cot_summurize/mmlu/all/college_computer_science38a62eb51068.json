Routing packets through the network\n\nWhile IP (Internet Protocol) does contribute to some aspects of reliability and compatibility, its primary function is to route packets from their source to their destination across potentially complex networks. It doesn't guarantee reliable delivery or handle multi-packet message assembly, which are typically tasks for higher-level protocols like TCP (Transmission Control Protocol). Similarly, dealing with differences among operating system architectures is more related to application layer protocols and interfaces."
