This means that the number is divisible by $10$, which implies it is divisible by both $2$ and $5$.\n\n2. The sum of its digits is divisible by $3$. This means that the number itself is divisible by $3$ (since a number is divisible by $3$ if and only if the sum of its digits is divisible by $3$).\n\nSo far, we have determined that the number must be divisible by $2$, $3$, and $5$.\n\nNow let's consider the remaining numbers in the list: $4$, $6$, $8$, and $9$.\n\n- For divisibility by $4$, the last two digits of the number must form a number that is divisible by $4$. Since we know the number ends in $0$, this condition is met as long as the second to last digit is even (i.e., $0$, $2$, $4$, $6$, or $8$). However, without more information about the specific number, we cannot guarantee this divisibility.\n  \n- A number is divisible by $6$ if it is divisible by both $2$ and $3$. We've already established that the number is divisible by both $2$ and $3$, so it is also divisible by $6$.\n\n- For divisibility by $8$, the last three digits of the number must form a number that is divisible by $8$. Again, without more information about the specific number, we cannot guarantee this divisibility.\n\n- For divisibility by $9$, the sum of the digits must be divisible by $9$. Since we only know that the sum of the digits is divisible by $3$, we cannot guarantee divisibility by $9$ unless the sum of the digits is specifically a multiple of $9$.\n\nGiven the information provided, we can guarantee that the number is divisible by $2$, $3$, $5$, and $6$.\n\nThus, the answer is $\\boxed{D. 4}$."
