When demand is inelastic, consumers are not very responsive to price changes, meaning they will continue to buy the product even if the price increases.\n\nGiven this information, the correct answer is:\n\nD. increase price because demand is inelastic\n\nBy increasing the price, the business can generate more revenue since the quantity demanded will not drop significantly in response to the higher price."
