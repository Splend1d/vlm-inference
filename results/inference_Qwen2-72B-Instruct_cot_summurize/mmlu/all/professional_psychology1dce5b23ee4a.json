This type of feedback helps correct behaviors or actions that deviate from the norm, promoting equilibrium within the family unit. Positive feedback, on the other hand, reinforces behaviors by providing rewards or encouragement, which can sometimes lead to an increase in the behavior rather than maintaining stability."
