Since disposable income has increased and we know that people will both consume and save some portion of this increase, option D (saving remains constant) cannot be correct. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Saving increases by less than $X.\n\nThis implies that when disposable income rises, saving does indeed rise, but not by the full amount of the increase in income because some of it goes toward increased consumption."
