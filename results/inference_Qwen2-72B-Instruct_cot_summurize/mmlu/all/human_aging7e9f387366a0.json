However, I can provide some insights based on research and statistics:\n\nA. More frequent for women than men: This statement used to be true in the past, but recent data suggests that this may no longer be the case. According to the Pew Research Center, as of 2013, men are now slightly more likely to remarry than women (64% vs. 52%).\n\nB. Typically more successful: There is no evidence to suggest that remarriages are typically more successful than first marriages. In fact, some studies indicate that remarriages may have a higher divorce rate than first marriages.\n\nC. Typically less successful: This statement is partially true. According to the National Stepfamily Resource Center, about 50% of first marriages end in divorce, while the divorce rate for second marriages is estimated to be around 67%, and for third marriages, it's around 73%.\n\nD. Most common among those who have never been married before: This statement is false. Remarriages are most common among people who have been previously married, either through divorce or widowhood.\n\nIn summary, remarriages are not more frequent for women than men, they are not typically more successful, and they are not most common among those who have never been married before. However, they do tend to have a higher divorce rate than first marriages."
