Enslaved man has multiplied his strength, [but] having become free, he has become unjust to his companion. Oh, women, women! When will you cease to be blind? What advantage have you received from the Revolution? A more pronounced scorn, a more marked disdain. If our leaders persist, courageously oppose the force of reason to their empty pretentions of superiority. Regardless of what barriers confront you, it is in your power to free yourselves!\nOlympe de Gouges, \"Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen,\" 1791\nThe independence? Nothing of what I hoped for was achieved. I had expected that my children would be able to have an education, but they did not get it. We were poor peasants then, we are poor peasants now. Nothing has changed. Everything is the same. The only thing is that we are free, the war is over, we work without fear\u2014but apart from that, nothing has changed.\nHalima Ghomri, interviewed in the 1970s, after Algeria's war of independence\nBased on both passages, which of the following conclusions can be most reasonably made about revolutions?\n\nA. The new liberties gained by revolution are rarely worth the bloodshed.\nB. The new liberties gained by revolution typically fail to benefit women or ethnic minorities.\nC. The new liberties gained by revolution are sometimes distributed unequally or inconsistently.\nD. The new liberties gained by revolution do not always bring about economic improvement.\n"

The new liberties gained by revolution are sometimes distributed unequally or inconsistently.\n\nBoth passages suggest that while revolutions may bring about changes and new liberties, these benefits are not always equally distributed among all members of society. Olympe de Gouges' declaration highlights the continued oppression and lack of recognition of women's rights even after the French Revolution, while Halima Ghomri's account reflects on the limited improvements in social and economic conditions for peasants in Algeria after its war of independence. Therefore, option C is the most reasonable conclusion based on the provided information. Option D could also be considered valid based on Halima Ghomri's perspective, but option C encompasses both passages' themes more broadly."
