To break down large markets into smaller markets: This allows companies to better understand and address the specific needs and preferences of different groups of consumers.\n\nC. By grouping together customers with similar needs, it provides a commercially viable method of serving these customers: This helps companies tailor their products, services, and marketing strategies to meet the unique demands of each segment, leading to higher customer satisfaction and loyalty.\n\nD. To allow the achievement of greater market share: By targeting specific segments more effectively, companies can increase their sales and market share within those segments.\n\nWhile option B (to provide an opportunity to surpass competitors) is not explicitly mentioned as a reason for market segmentation, it can be considered an indirect outcome. By better understanding and serving specific market segments, companies can gain a competitive advantage and potentially surpass their rivals in those segments.\n\nTherefore, the primary reasons for carrying out market segmentation are A, C, and D."
