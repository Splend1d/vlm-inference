There is no one distinguishing feature that identifies an issue as philosophic, only an overlapping of issues roughly associated with one another. This idea is based on Ludwig Wittgenstein's concept of \"family resemblance,\" which suggests that members of a group may not share a single defining characteristic but rather have a cluster of overlapping features that make them recognizable as part of the same category. In the case of philosophy, this means that while there may not be a single defining feature that makes an issue philosophic, there are certain themes, questions, and methods that are commonly associated with philosophical inquiry and can help us recognize when we are engaging in philosophy. Options B, C, and D do not accurately reflect the concept of \"family resemblance\" as it applies to philosophy."
