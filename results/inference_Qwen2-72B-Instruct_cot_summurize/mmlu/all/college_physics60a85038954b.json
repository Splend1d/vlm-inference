Fermions have antisymmetric wave functions and obey the Pauli exclusion principle. \n\nTo explain further, particles in quantum mechanics can be classified as either bosons or fermions based on their spin and symmetry properties. Bosons have integer spin (0, 1, 2, etc.) and symmetric wave functions, meaning that the wave function does not change sign when two particles are exchanged. They do not obey the Pauli exclusion principle, which states that no two fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously.\n\nFermions, on the other hand, have half-integer spin (1/2, 3/2, 5/2, etc.) and antisymmetric wave functions, meaning that the wave function changes sign when two particles are exchanged. They do obey the Pauli exclusion principle, which is why electrons, for example, cannot all occupy the same energy level in an atom."
