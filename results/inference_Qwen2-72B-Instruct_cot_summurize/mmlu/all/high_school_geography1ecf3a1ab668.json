While pesticides can indirectly contribute to better health by increasing agricultural yields and potentially reducing disease vectors, their primary purpose is not to improve human health directly. In fact, improper use of pesticides can lead to health problems and environmental damage, which could increase mortality rates.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that all these factors can have complex interactions and impacts on public health and mortality rates in different contexts. For example, while pesticides might not directly reduce mortality, they can be crucial for food security in some regions, thereby indirectly affecting mortality through famine prevention. Similarly, new medicines, improved birth control methods, and famine relief are all critical in addressing specific health challenges and improving overall well-being in developing countries."
