This action is considered morally wrong because it violates principles of fairness and impartiality.\n\nIn Scenario 2, turning the radio louder might be inconsiderate, but it doesn't necessarily constitute a clear moral wrongdoing unless it significantly disturbs your neighbor's peace or violates noise ordinances. Without additional context about the extent of the disturbance or the time of day, this scenario may not meet the threshold for being considered clearly morally wrong."
