When the corpus callosum is cut in a right-handed patient, often the patient cannot name objects placed in the left hand if the patient cannot see them. This is because the left hemisphere of the brain, which controls language for most people, cannot communicate with the right hemisphere, which processes visual information from the left hand. Therefore, the patient cannot name the object because the language center does not receive information about it."
