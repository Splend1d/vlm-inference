A diagonal is a line segment that connects two non-adjacent vertices.\n\nA hexagon has 6 vertices. The formula to find the number of diagonals \\(D\\) in a polygon with \\(n\\) sides (or vertices) is given by:\n\n\\[D = \\frac{n(n-3)}{2}\\]\n\nThis formula comes from the fact that each vertex can connect to \\(n - 3\\) other vertices with a diagonal (since it cannot connect to itself and its two adjacent vertices). Since each diagonal connects two vertices, we divide by 2 to avoid double counting.\n\nSubstituting \\(n = 6\\) into the formula:\n\n\\[D = \\frac{6(6-3)}{2} = \\frac{6 \\times 3}{2} = 9\\]\n\nTherefore, there are 9 distinct diagonals that can be drawn in a convex hexagon.\n\nThe correct answer is C. 9."
