It is a fee simple determinable, and title ends automatically if drugs are used.\n\nIn fact, based on the description provided, this is more likely a fee simple subject to a condition subsequent (option B), where the grantor (in this case, B) retains the right to reenter and retake the premises if the condition (no drug use on the premises) is violated. The title does not automatically revert; instead, the grantor must take some action to reclaim the property (option D). Option C is also true in that the estate does not revert automatically upon the occurrence of the specified event."
