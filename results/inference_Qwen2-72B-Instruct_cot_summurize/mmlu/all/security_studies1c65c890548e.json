Woman as 'victim' is, and continues to be, an important narrative of war stories. In 1990 an estimated 90% of war casualties were civilian, the majority women and children. Reports that women are the primary casualties of war has contributed to the enduring perception that women are dependent on men for protection, and that men are responsible for sacrificing their own well bring for the protection of women and the state (often confused with one another through propaganda and imagery).\nB. The role of men as intrinsically heroic has been marginalized as the traumas of war, desertion, and conscription become more apparent. When imagining victims, there is no longer a gender divide. Instead, there is a growing perception that those who fight are courageous and heroic, whilst those who do not take on female characteristics.\nC. Increasing awareness regarding the barbaric nature of warfare and the problems of trauma in war has led to a reversal in the belief that the idea of war is a natural place for males. In contemporary societies across the globe, men are regarded as the victims of gender stereotypes that coerce them into violent behaviour as 'protectors' or aggressors on behalf of the state.\nD. All of these options.\n"

Option A highlights how the portrayal of women as victims contributes to the perception that they are dependent on men for protection. This narrative reinforces traditional gender roles and can lead to the marginalization of women's agency and resilience.\n\nOption B points out that the traditional view of men as intrinsically heroic has been challenged by the realities of war, including the traumas experienced by soldiers and the recognition of non-combatant roles. This shift in perspective can blur the gender divide and challenge the notion that only men can be seen as courageous and heroic.\n\nOption C addresses the increasing awareness of the negative effects of war on both men and women. It suggests that men are also victims of gender stereotypes that pressure them into violent behavior, often as protectors or aggressors on behalf of the state. This understanding challenges the assumption that war is a natural place for men and recognizes the harm it causes to all genders.\n\nOverall, the idea of 'victim' plays a significant role in shaping perceptions of gender security by influencing how different genders are portrayed and understood in relation to violence, protection, and vulnerability."
