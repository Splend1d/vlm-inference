This is the primary source of salt in the ocean. While the other factors can contribute to the salinity of the ocean to some extent, they are not the principal sources. Marine biological activity can alter local salinity levels but does not significantly affect overall ocean salinity. Atmospheric deposition, such as dust and volcanic ash, can add some salts but in much smaller quantities compared to continental weathering. Undersea hot-spot volcanoes can also contribute some salts, but again, this is a minor source compared to the weathering of continental rocks."
