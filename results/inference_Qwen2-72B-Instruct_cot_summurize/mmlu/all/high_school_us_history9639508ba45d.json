Moreover, I am cognizant of the interrelatedness of all communities and states. I cannot sit idly by in Atlanta and not be concerned about what happens in Birmingham. Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly affects all indirectly. Never again can we afford to live with the narrow, provincial 'outside agitator' idea. Anyone who lives inside the United States can never be considered an outsider anywhere in this country. . . .\"\n\u2014Martin Luther King, Jr., \"Letter from a Birmingham Jail,\" April 16, 1963\nThe language of this passage by Susan B. Anthony demonstrates which of the following continuities in U.S. history?\n\nA. Debates over free speech.\nB. Debates over voting rights.\nC. Debates over federal power and states' rights.\nD. Debates over the procedures of amending the Constitution.\n"

However, if we were to analyze it for themes that connect to broader debates in U.S. history, option C would be the closest fit, as MLK's words touch on issues of federal power and states' rights.\n\nIn his letter, King argues against the concept of being an \"outsider\" when it comes to fighting injustice, even in another state. He emphasizes the interconnectedness of all Americans and suggests that injustice in one part of the country is a threat to justice everywhere. This argument aligns with a view that supports strong federal action to ensure civil rights and justice across all states, rather than leaving such matters to individual states where they might not be adequately addressed.\n\nSo, while the passage doesn't specifically discuss the continuity of debates over federal power and states' rights, it does reflect a perspective that supports federal intervention in matters of civil rights\u2014a stance that has been at the heart of many debates regarding the balance of power between the federal government and the states throughout U.S. history. Thus, if we must choose from the given options, C would be the most appropriate answer."
