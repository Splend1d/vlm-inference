He argues that governments have an obligation to respect and protect natural rights, and that failures to do so constitute injustices. Huemer holds that individuals have certain fundamental rights, such as rights to life, liberty, and property, which governments should not violate. Therefore, when the government fails to recognize or protect these natural rights, it is committing an injustice.\n\nOptions A, B, and C may be views held by others in political philosophy, but they do not accurately represent Huemer's position. While some philosophers might argue that it is sometimes acceptable for the government to disregard natural rights under certain circumstances (such as in cases of extreme harm or self-protection), Huemer maintains a strong stance on the inviolability of natural rights."
