According to the first law of thermodynamics, the change in internal energy (\u0394E) of a system is equal to the heat added to the system (q) minus the work done by the system (w):\n\n\u0394E = q - w\n\nFor an ideal gas, the internal energy (E) depends only on the temperature. Since the temperature is constant during an isothermal process, there is no change in internal energy (\u0394E = 0). Therefore, we have:\n\n0 = q - w\n\nRearranging this equation gives us:\n\nq = w\n\nHowever, since the gas is expanding and doing work on its surroundings, the work done (w) is negative (-w) from the perspective of the system. Thus, the correct relationship is:\n\nq = -w\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. q = -w"
