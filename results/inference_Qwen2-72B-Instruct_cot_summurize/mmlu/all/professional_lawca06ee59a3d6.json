Defendant was standing in front of the passenger and holding on to the hand rail. Seeing the pocketbook unattended, he suddenly grabbed it and tried to run away. As he did so, the passenger became very frightened and fell backward. She struck her head against the window and was knocked unconscious. In the commotion, Defendant dropped the pocketbook and hurriedly exited the subway car empty-handed. Defendant should be found guilty of\n\nA. larceny.\nB. attempted larceny.\nC. assault.\nD. robbery.\n"

However, since he did not successfully complete the theft and left the pocketbook behind, it would be considered attempted larceny. Additionally, the defendant's actions caused harm to the passenger, resulting in her falling and being knocked unconscious. This could also be considered an assault. However, since the primary intent was to commit a theft, the most appropriate charge would be attempted larceny.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\nB. attempted larceny.\n\nHowever, depending on jurisdiction and specific circumstances, charges could also potentially include assault due to the harm caused to the passenger. But in the context of the options given, attempted larceny best fits the description of the defendant's actions."
