This is typically allowed when the defendant can show \"good cause,\" meaning there must be a valid reason for needing this information that goes beyond mere curiosity or convenience. The purpose is often to ensure a fair trial by allowing the defense to investigate potential biases or conflicts of interest among jurors. However, the specifics can vary by jurisdiction and are subject to the discretion of the court."
