Glaucon uses this story to argue that people only behave justly out of fear of being caught and punished, suggesting that if one could act unjustly without consequence (like Gyges), they would do so. Cicero references this tale to discuss the nature of justice and whether it is pursued for its own sake or merely as a means to avoid punishment."
