While all the options listed can be involved in such efforts, the term that best fits the description given is not explicitly mentioned among the choices. However, \"public relations\" (option C) could be seen as the closest match since public relations professionals often use media programs to convey information and educate the public about various topics.\n\nOpinion leaders (option D) can also play a role in this process by influencing the attitudes and behaviors of others through their positions or expertise, but the term itself does not describe the approach of using television and radio programs for mass education.\n\nTherefore, if I have to choose the best answer from the provided options, it would be:\n\nC. Public relations. \n\nHowever, it's important to note that the term \"mass media campaign\" or \"public broadcasting\" might more accurately describe the approach mentioned."
