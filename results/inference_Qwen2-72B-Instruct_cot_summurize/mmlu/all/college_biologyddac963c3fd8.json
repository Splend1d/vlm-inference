This sporophyte generation produces spores through meiosis. These spores then develop into the less conspicuous gametophyte generation, which is usually a small, heart-shaped prothallus. The gametophyte produces gametes (eggs and sperm) by mitosis. Therefore, in ferns, there is an alternation between a dominant sporophyte generation and an independent gametophyte generation."
