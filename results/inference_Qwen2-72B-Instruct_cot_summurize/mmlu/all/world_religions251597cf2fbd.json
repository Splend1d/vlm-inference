Devotion and piety\n\nThe Sikh Gurus, including Guru Nanak, emphasized the use of specific ragas in their hymns primarily to enhance devotion and piety among the followers. These ragas were believed to have the power to evoke certain emotions and spiritual states that could help in deepening one's connection with the divine. While harmony, balance, love, and goodwill are also important values in Sikhism, the primary purpose of using ragas was to foster devotion and piety."
