They were engaged to be married when they purchased an undeveloped parcel of land on a hillside overlooking the Pacific. The deed, which was properly executed and recorded, named the student and the boyfriend as grantees, \"not as tenants in common but as joint tenants with right of survivorship. \"Thereafter, the boyfriend, who was experiencing financial difficulties, offered to sell the property to his co-worker. Without the student's knowledge, the boyfriend executed a deed that purported to convey the hillside property to the co-worker in fee simple. The boyfriend signed his name and forged the student's name. He then delivered the deed of conveyance to the co-worker, who paid the boyfriend $150,000, which was the fair market value of the property. The co-worker immediately recorded the deed received from the boyfriend. The common law joint tenancy is unmodified by statute.

By forging the student's signature, the boyfriend committed fraud, making the conveyance of the student's interest void. However, the co-worker, as a bona fide purchaser for value without notice of the forgery, could acquire good title to the boyfriend's interest in the property. Since the boyfriend's interest has been sold, the joint tenancy has been severed as to his interest, converting it into a tenancy in common between him and the co-worker. But since the co-worker acquired the boyfriend's entire interest, the co-worker becomes the sole owner in fee simple, subject to any legal actions the student might take against the boyfriend or the co-worker to recover her interest or damages. However, based solely on the information provided and assuming the co-worker was unaware of the forgery, the title would be in the co-worker."
