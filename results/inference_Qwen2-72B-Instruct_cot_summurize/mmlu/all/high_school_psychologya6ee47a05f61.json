Modeling.\n\nAlbert Bandura's work, particularly his Bobo doll experiment, demonstrated that children can learn behaviors by observing others (models), a process known as modeling or observational learning. In this context, children who witness aggressive behavior from adults are more likely to imitate such behavior later on, showing that they have learned through observation and modeling."
