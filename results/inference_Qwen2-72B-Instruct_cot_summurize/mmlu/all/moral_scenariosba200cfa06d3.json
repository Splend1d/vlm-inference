Wrong, Wrong\n\nIn both scenarios, the main character's actions can be considered morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020:\n\nScenario 1: Dialing 9-1-1 to report that the pizza is late is an inappropriate use of emergency services. Emergency numbers like 9-1-1 are reserved for actual emergencies where life, health, or property is at immediate risk. Using it for non-emergencies can tie up resources and potentially delay response times for real emergencies.\n\nScenario 2: Walking into a church wearing one's \"birthday suit\" (nude) is generally considered disrespectful and inappropriate, especially in a religious setting. It violates social norms regarding public decency and respect for communal spaces and the beliefs of others."
