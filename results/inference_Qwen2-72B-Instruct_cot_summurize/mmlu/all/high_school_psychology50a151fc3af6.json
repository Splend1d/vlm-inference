This ensures that every test-taker is assessed under the same conditions, which helps to make the test results comparable across different individuals. Standardization does not necessarily guarantee that a test is valid (measures what it is supposed to measure) or reliable (produces consistent results), but it is an important step in ensuring these qualities."
