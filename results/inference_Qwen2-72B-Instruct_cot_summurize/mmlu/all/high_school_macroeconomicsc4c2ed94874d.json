Supply shifts to the left; demand shifts to the right.\n\nWhen supply shifts to the left, it means that suppliers are willing to sell less corn at every price, which decreases the overall supply. When demand shifts to the right, it means that consumers want to buy more corn at every price, which increases the overall demand. The combination of these two factors will definitely increase the equilibrium price of corn because there is now more demand for a smaller supply."
