If no such n exists, then the ring has characteristic 0.\n\nLet's consider the given ring \\(\\mathbb{Z}_3 \\times 3\\mathbb{Z}\\).\n\n- \\(\\mathbb{Z}_3\\) is the ring of integers modulo 3. Its characteristic is 3 since \\(3 \\cdot [1]_3 = [0]_3\\).\n- \\(3\\mathbb{Z}\\) is the ring of all multiples of 3. This is an infinite ring with characteristic 0 because you can never add any non-zero element to itself enough times to get back to 0 (the additive identity of this ring).\n\nThe characteristic of the direct product of two rings is the least common multiple (LCM) of the characteristics of each ring. Since one of the characteristics is 0, the LCM of 3 and 0 would typically be considered undefined because any number multiplied by 0 is 0, but in the context of ring theory, when we have a ring with characteristic 0, it essentially means there is no finite characteristic. However, for the sake of understanding the problem, if we were to interpret the LCM of 3 and 0 in terms of ring characteristics, we would say the result is 0 since any finite number combined with 0 cannot yield a finite result under this operation.\n\nTherefore, the characteristic of the ring \\(\\mathbb{Z}_3 \\times 3\\mathbb{Z}\\) is:\n\nA. 0\n\nThis is because the presence of a ring with characteristic 0 in a direct product results in the overall characteristic being 0. The answer is A. 0."
