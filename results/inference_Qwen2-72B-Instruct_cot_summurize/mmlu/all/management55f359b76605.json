Shared values (A), shared beliefs (C), and norms (D) can all be considered components or manifestations of these levels. However, pre-conceptions are not explicitly part of Schein's model. Pre-conceptions refer to pre-existing ideas or notions that individuals bring to their experiences, which may influence how they interpret and internalize cultural elements, but they are not a formal part of Schein's framework for understanding culture."
