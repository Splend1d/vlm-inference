It is often used in collaborative learning environments where participants work together to develop new knowledge and understanding. Through dialogue, individuals can share their experiences, ask questions, challenge assumptions, and build on each other's ideas to create new insights and solutions. This process of learning together is often referred to as co-learning or collaborative learning."
