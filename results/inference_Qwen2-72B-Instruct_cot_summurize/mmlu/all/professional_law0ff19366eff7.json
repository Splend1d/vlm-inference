Since both parties have filed summary judgment motions that assert there are no genuine issues of material fact, summary judgment for plaintiff or defendant will be granted.\nD.

Summary judgment can be entered before all discovery has been completed if there are no genuine issues of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\nB. A motion for summary judgment is not the proper motion on the grounds that the plaintiff's complaint fails to state a cause of action. This is typically addressed through a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\nC. While it is true that both parties filing motions for summary judgment indicates they agree there are no genuine issues of material fact, the court still must determine whether one party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law based on the evidence presented. Simply because both parties agree does not automatically result in summary judgment being granted for one or the other."
