However, based on the options provided, the view that \"only whole ecosystems (not any of the individuals that make up those ecosystems) have direct moral standing\" most closely aligns with what some might call ecoholism. This perspective emphasizes the moral significance of the ecosystem as a whole over the individual components.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be:\n\nA. only whole ecosystems (not any of the individuals that make up those ecosystems) have direct moral standing.\n\nThis view is similar to deep ecology or holistic environmental ethics, which prioritize the well-being of entire ecological systems rather than individual organisms. However, it's important to note that the term \"ecoholism\" itself is not widely recognized or used in academic discussions on environmental ethics."
