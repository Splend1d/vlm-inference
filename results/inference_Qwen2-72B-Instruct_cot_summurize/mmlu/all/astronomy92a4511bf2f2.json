From radioactive dating of rocks and meteorites.\n\nThe age of the Earth is determined primarily through radiometric dating techniques, which use the known rates of decay of radioactive isotopes to calculate the time since the rock or mineral formed. By analyzing rocks from Earth and meteorites, scientists have determined that the Earth is approximately 4.54 billion years old."
