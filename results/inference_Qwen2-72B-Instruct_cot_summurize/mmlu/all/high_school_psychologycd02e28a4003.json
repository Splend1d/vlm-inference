At this level, one's actions are guided by a desire to maintain good relationships and fulfill social roles and responsibilities.\n\nOption B could also be seen as reflecting the conventional level of morality, as it suggests adherence to societal laws and rules, but option C more directly indicates a concern for the opinions of others, which is a key characteristic of the conventional level according to Kohlberg's theory."
