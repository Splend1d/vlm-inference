Reciprocity theorem\n\nThe Reciprocity theorem states that in a linear, bilateral network (like a balanced bridge), the direction of the current in any branch of the network due to an applied emf is unchanged if the emf and the corresponding resistance are interchanged. In the context of a balanced bridge, this means that if the positions of the detector and source are interchanged, the bridge will still remain balanced as long as the circuit elements and their connections have not changed."
