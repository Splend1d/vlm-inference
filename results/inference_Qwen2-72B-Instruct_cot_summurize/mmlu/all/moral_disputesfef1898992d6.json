However, the most well-known individual with this name is likely Ernest van den Haag, who was an American professor of political science and a prominent advocate for the death penalty. Therefore, the answer to your question would be:\n\nC. a retentionist. \n\nThis means that he supported the continued use of capital punishment as a form of criminal justice."
