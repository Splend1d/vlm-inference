Alkaline phosphatase is an enzyme that is often elevated in conditions affecting the bones or liver, but in the context of vitamin D deficiency, its elevation is primarily related to bone turnover. Vitamin D deficiency can lead to decreased calcium absorption and subsequent secondary hyperparathyroidism, which increases bone resorption and can result in increased levels of alkaline phosphatase due to increased osteoblastic activity attempting to compensate for the calcium imbalance."
