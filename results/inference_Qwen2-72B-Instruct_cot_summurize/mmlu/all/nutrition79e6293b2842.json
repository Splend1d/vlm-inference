Weight loss of more than 10% or birth weight is not regained by day 14\n\nIt's normal for newborns to lose some weight after birth due to water loss and the time it takes for feeding to become established. Typically, a baby may lose up to 10% of their birth weight within the first few days. However, if the weight loss exceeds 10%, or if the baby has not regained their birth weight by about 2 weeks of age, this can be a cause for concern and should be discussed with a healthcare provider. It might indicate that the baby is not getting enough nutrition or could be experiencing other health issues."
