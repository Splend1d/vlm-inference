The total energy consumption of electric vehicles (EVs) depends on many factors, such as the number of EVs on the road, the efficiency of the vehicles, and how far people drive them. According to the US Department of Energy, if every car in the US were an electric vehicle, it would increase electricity demand by about 25%. As of 2021, the total annual electricity consumption in the US was approximately 4*10^20 J (or about 1,000 TWh). A 25% increase in this amount would be about 1*10^20 J (or 250 TWh). Therefore, none of the options provided is correct."
