Preoperational\n\nDuring the preoperational stage of Piaget's theory of cognitive development (approximately ages 2-7), children begin to use symbols, such as words, to represent objects and events in their world. This is when they start to develop the ability to think about things symbolically and can describe people, events, and feelings verbally. However, their thinking is still largely egocentric and lacks logical operations.\n\nIt's important to note that \"Symbolic\" is not one of Piaget's official stages, but rather a term often used to describe aspects of the preoperational stage where children begin to use symbols in their thinking and communication."
