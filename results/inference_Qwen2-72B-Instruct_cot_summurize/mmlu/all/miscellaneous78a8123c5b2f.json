Since Christmas Day is on a Saturday, New Year's Day will also be on a Saturday.\n\nHowever, since there might be a misunderstanding in interpreting \"the following New Year's Day\" as being in the next year after the given scenario, I'll clarify:\n\n- If Christmas Day (December 25) is on a Saturday, then New Year's Day (January 1) of the same year is also on a Saturday.\n- If you mean the New Year's Day of the year following this scenario, then we must consider that December has 31 days. So, from December 25 (Saturday) to January 1 of the following year is 7 days (which is a full week). Thus, New Year's Day of the following year would still be on a Saturday.\n\nSo the answer is D. Saturday, regardless if you're considering the immediate following New Year's Day or the one in the year after that."
