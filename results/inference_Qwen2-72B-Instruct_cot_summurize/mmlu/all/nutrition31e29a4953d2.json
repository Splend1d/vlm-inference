Observational epidemiology studies can identify associations between food contaminants and health effects, but they cannot establish causality or quantify risk because it is challenging to accurately measure exposure levels and account for other potential confounding factors. Without reliable dose-response data, it is difficult to assess the risk posed by specific levels of exposure to food contaminants."
