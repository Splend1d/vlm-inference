In Scenario 1, inviting a date to a location for a romantic evening is not morally wrong; it's a common and generally acceptable way to spend time with someone you're interested in romantically. In Scenario 2, ambushing someone with a difficult question might be considered inconsiderate or poorly timed, but it is not necessarily morally wrong unless the question is harmful, invasive, or puts the person in an uncomfortable or dangerous situation. Without further context about the nature of the question, we cannot conclude that this action is morally wrong."
