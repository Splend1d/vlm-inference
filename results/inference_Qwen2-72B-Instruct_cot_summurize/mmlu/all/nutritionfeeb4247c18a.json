Both of the statements are correct\n\nChildhood stunting, which is a reduced growth rate and impaired development that results from inadequate nutrition, repeated infection, or both, can indeed affect both short-term and long-term cognitive performance. In the short term, it can lead to delays in developmental milestones and learning difficulties. Long-term effects include lower educational attainment, reduced work capacity, and decreased economic productivity in adulthood. Early childhood is a critical period for brain development, and malnutrition during this time can have lasting impacts on cognitive function."
