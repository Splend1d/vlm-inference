It had a contingency clause requiring him to make a completed application for a mortgage within a specified time. It said that time was of the essence. The purchaser failed to apply but instead asked a mortgage broker friend for his opinion as to whether he would qualify. The seller told the purchaser that she rescinded the sale because there was no mortgage application within the agreed time. A few days later, the purchaser made a belated application and received approval, but the seller insisted on a rescission of the contract. Will the seller likely prevail in rescinding the transaction?\n\nA. Yes, because the purchaser did not make a timely application and lost the protection of the contingency clause.\nB. Yes, because she rescinded the sale prior to his notifying her of the approval \u0080\u0093 the first notice communicated is the effective one.\nC. No, because the amount of time that he was late was a \"de minimus\" delay that should not preclude him from the benefit of the bargain.\nD. No, because the original request to his mortgage broker friend was a timely application within the spirit of the agreement.\n"

When the purchaser failed to apply for the mortgage within the agreed time frame and instead sought an opinion from a mortgage broker friend, they breached the terms of the agreement. As a result, the seller was justified in rescinding the sale due to the failure of the purchaser to meet the condition precedent (the mortgage application) within the specified time frame. The belated application and approval do not change the fact that the initial breach occurred, and thus, the seller is likely to prevail in rescinding the transaction."
