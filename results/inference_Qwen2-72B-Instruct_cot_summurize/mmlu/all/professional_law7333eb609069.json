The contract provided the following:\"The cost is $2,500 per deck, to be paid upon completion of the decks in each of the eight beach houses. \"On the morning of March 25, the man went to one of the beach houses as the contractor and his assistants were completing the work on the fourth deck. The man said to the contractor, \"I'm very pleased with your progress to date. If you are willing, I would like you to build the same kind of decks on four identical beach houses that I own in a neighboring town, on the same terms and conditions as our existing contract, the work to be completed by May 20. If you can meet that deadline, I'll pay you $10,000 at that time. \" The contractor replied, \"Agreed. Let's shake hands on it. \" They shook hands. The contractor completed the work on the beach houses located in the city by April 15 and immediately started the construction of the decks on the four beach houses located in the town. On April 22, a hurricane totally destroyed four of the man's beach houses in the city. In addition, the hurricane demolished a beach house in the town on which the contractor had completed 85 percent of the deck work. Two of the contractor's assistants were seriously injured, and all of his equipment was washed away. The man then received a letter from the contractor, which stated:\"The hurricane destroyed my equipment, worth $4,000. I am dead broke and cannot complete the work on the three remaining beach houses in the town. Please pay me $20,000 for the work I did in the city, and please send me $2,500 for the deck I built on the beach house in the town. \"What is the maximum amount that the contractor may recover from the man for the construction that he completed prior to the hurricane?\n\nA. $10,000. 00\nB. $10,000 plus the amount due for 85 percent of the completed work on the town beach house.\nC. $20,000. 00\nD. $20,000 plus the amount due for 85 percent of the work completed on the town beach house.\n"

                    "text": "The contractor can potentially recover the following amounts:\n\n1. For the eight decks in the city: Since the work was completed before the hurricane struck, the contractor is entitled to receive payment for these decks. According to the original contract, the cost is $2,500 per deck, so for eight decks, the total comes to $20,000.\n\n2. For the deck in the town that was 85% completed: Even though the deck was not fully completed due to the hurricane, the contractor can still claim payment for the work done up to the point of destruction. Since the contract stipulates a price of $2,500 per deck, the contractor can claim 85% of this amount, which is $2,125.\n\nTherefore, the maximum amount the contractor can recover is $20,000 (for the eight decks in the city) + $2,125 (for the 85% completed deck in the town), which totals $22,125. However, this option is not listed among the choices provided.\n\nGiven the options provided, the closest answer is:\n\nD. $20,000 plus the amount due for 85 percent of the work completed on the town beach house.\n\nThis implies the contractor can recover $20,000 for the work in the city and an additional amount for the 85% completed work on the town beach house, which aligns with the calculation above."
