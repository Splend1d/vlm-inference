                    "text": "The set of all nth roots of unity under multiplication of complex numbers forms a D. abelian group.\n\nHere's why:\n\n1. **Closure**: The product of any two nth roots of unity is also an nth root of unity. This means that if you multiply any two elements in the set, the result is still in the set.\n\n2. **Identity Element**: The number 1 (which can be thought of as \\(e^{i0}\\)) is an nth root of unity and acts as the identity element because multiplying any nth root of unity by 1 does not change it.\n\n3. **Inverse Elements**: Every nth root of unity has an inverse that is also an nth root of unity. For example, if \\(z\\) is an nth root of unity, then \\(\\frac{1}{z}\\) is its inverse and is also an nth root of unity because \\(z\\cdot\\frac{1}{z} = 1\\).\n\n4. **Associativity**: Multiplication of complex numbers is associative. That is, for any three nth roots of unity \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), \\((ab)c = a(bc)\\).\n\n5. **Commutativity**: Multiplication of complex numbers representing nth roots of unity is commutative. That is, for any two nth roots of unity \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), \\(ab = ba\\).\n\nGiven these properties, the set of all nth roots of unity under multiplication of complex numbers forms an abelian group, which is a group where the operation is commutative. Thus, option D is correct."
