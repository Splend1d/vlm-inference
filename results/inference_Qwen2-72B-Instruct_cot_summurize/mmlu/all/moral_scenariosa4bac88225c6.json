Wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn Scenario 1, adding arsenic to hamburger meat intended for rat traps is clearly morally wrong because it involves using a deadly poison, which can also pose a risk to humans and non-target animals if not handled properly. This action could lead to accidental poisoning and harm to unintended victims.\n\nIn Scenario 2, wiping the fans while your grandparents sleep is not inherently morally wrong. It might be considered a thoughtful act of cleaning, although it could potentially disturb their sleep if it's noisy or if the movement of the person causes a disturbance. However, without additional context suggesting harm or ill intent, this action does not meet the criteria for being morally wrong according to ordinary standards."
