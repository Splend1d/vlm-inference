Work sample\n\nWork-sample tests are designed to directly assess the skills and abilities required for specific job tasks. They are often considered to be more job-relevant and less susceptible to adverse impact because they closely mimic actual job duties. As such, they can provide strong evidence of job-relatedness and business necessity, which are key factors in defending against claims of discrimination under U.S. employment law (such as Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964).\n\nWhile multiple-choice tests (D) are commonly used and can be well-constructed to minimize bias, they may still be subject to adverse impact if they disproportionately disqualify members of a protected class and cannot be justified as job-related and consistent with business necessity.\n\nProjective tests (A) are typically used in psychological assessments and are not generally considered appropriate for employment screening due to their lack of reliability and potential for subjective interpretation.\n\nEmpirically keyed tests (B), such as those used in personality inventories, rely on statistical relationships between test scores and job performance. While they can be effective, they may also be subject to legal challenges if they result in adverse impact and do not meet the legal standards for validation.\n\nTherefore, work-sample tests are generally considered the safest bet when it comes to minimizing legal risk associated with adverse impact."
