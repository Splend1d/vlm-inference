Each of the five managers will be asked to place the 200 time cards of their respective employees in a bag, shake them up, and randomly draw out six names. The six names from each plant will be put together to make up the sample. Will this method result in a simple random sample of the 1000 employees?\n\nA. Yes, because every employee has the same chance of being selected.\nB. Yes, because every plant is equally represented.\nC. Yes, because this is an example of stratified sampling, which is a special case of simple random sampling.\nD. No, because not every group of 30 employees has the same chance of being selected.\n"

No, because not every group of 30 employees has the same chance of being selected.\n\nIn a simple random sample, every possible group of 30 employees out of the 1000 should have an equal chance of being selected. However, in this scenario, each manager selects 6 out of 200 employees from their respective plants. This means that there's a higher probability of selecting groups that include at least one employee from each plant (since the selection is stratified by plant) than there would be if the sample were truly simple random. Thus, not every possible group of 30 employees has the same chance of being selected. This is actually an example of stratified sampling, where the population is divided into strata (in this case, the plants) and samples are drawn from each stratum."
