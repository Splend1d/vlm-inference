This allows researchers to compare the new therapy's outcomes against those of existing, established treatments to determine if it is more effective.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that the term \"cure\" is not typically used in mental health research, as many psychological disorders are chronic conditions that can be managed but not necessarily cured. Instead, studies often look at symptom reduction, functioning, quality of life, or other relevant outcomes. Comparing these outcomes between the new therapy and current treatment modalities would provide valuable information about the new therapy's efficacy."
