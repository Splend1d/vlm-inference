Calling the police on someone for being late is an unusual response unless there were extenuating circumstances that would make the lateness a matter of public safety or a violation of law, which is not suggested in the scenario.\n\nScenario 2 clearly depicts a morally wrong action. Taking someone else's property (in this case, a checkbook) without permission and using it for personal gain (shopping) is theft, which is against both legal and moral standards in the US."
