However, none of the options provided directly match this description.

The other options don't fit the description at all:\n\nA. ad ignorantium (appeal to ignorance) assumes something to be true because it hasn't been proven false.\nC. plurium interrogationum (complex question fallacy) involves asking a question that contains multiple questions within it, making it difficult to answer.\nD. Extension (not a standard term in logical fallacies) doesn't seem to relate to the fallacy described. \n\nSo, the closest match in your list is B. a priori, but it's important to note that \"cherry-picking\" or \"confirmation bias\" better describe the fallacy you've mentioned."
