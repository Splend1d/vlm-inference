And none of them derives his genealogy from his father but, on the contrary, from his maternal uncle. A man does not pass on inheritance except to the sons of his sister to the exclusion of his own sons. . . . They are Muslims keeping to the prayers, studying fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence) and learning the Qur'an by heart. With regard to their women, they are not modest in the presence of men; they do not veil themselves in spite of their perseverance in the prayers. He who wishes to marry among them can marry, but the women do not travel with the husband, and if one of them wanted to do that, she would be prevented by her family. The women there have friends and companions amongst men outside the prohibited degrees of marriage [i.e., other than brothers, fathers, etc.]. Likewise for the men, there are companions from amongst women outside the prohibited degrees. One of them would enter his house to find his wife with her companion and would not disapprove of that conduct.\n\u2014Adapted from an account by Ibn Battuta of his travels in Mali during the 1300s\nWhat was the likely cause of women not wearing the veil?\n\nA. They were probably rebelling against the oppression of women in Islam.\nB. It was a continuation of a preexisting cultural pattern.\nC. As sexual objects, they were prevented from veiling themselves.\nD. The climate of Mali makes veiling women impractical.\n"

It was a continuation of a preexisting cultural pattern.\n\nThe passage suggests that the lack of veiling among women in Mali during the 1300s was part of a broader cultural context that included unique social practices such as tracing lineage through the maternal uncle and specific inheritance rules. These customs indicate that the society had its own traditions that did not necessarily conform to the more widely known practices of Islamic societies elsewhere. Therefore, it is most likely that the women not wearing the veil was a continuation of a preexisting cultural pattern rather than a rebellion against oppression, a statement about their status as sexual objects, or a response to the climate."
