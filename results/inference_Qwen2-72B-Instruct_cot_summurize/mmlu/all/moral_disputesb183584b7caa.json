                    "text": "According to philosopher Anita M. Superson's interpretation of philosopher Marilyn Friedman's views, Gill holds that the moral value of autonomy mostly consists in C. the ability to make important life decisions on the basis of our deepest values. This understanding of autonomy emphasizes the importance of individuals being able to act in accordance with their own values and beliefs, rather than simply being free from external constraints or having the ability to make any choice without interference from others. It also suggests that autonomy is not just about individual freedom, but also about the ability to live a meaningful and fulfilling life in accordance with one's own values. Note that this answer may vary depending on which philosopher named Gill you are referring to, as there are multiple philosophers with that surname. If you could provide more context or specify which philosopher named Gill you are asking about, I can provide a more accurate answer. However, based on the options provided, option C best captures the general understanding of autonomy as the ability to make important life decisions based on one's own values. Option A focuses on freedom from distress, which is an aspect of autonomy but does not fully capture its moral value. Option B refers to the controversial issue of assisted suicide or voluntary euthanasia, which is not necessarily central to the concept of autonomy. Option D describes a duty related to respecting others' autonomy, but it does not define the moral value of autonomy itself."
