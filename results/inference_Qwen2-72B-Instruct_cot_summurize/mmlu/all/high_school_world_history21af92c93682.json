We can inject the voice of reason into world affairs. We can mobilize all the spiritual, all the moral, all the political strength of Asia and Africa on the side of peace. Yes, we!

The context of the statement comes from a speech given at the Bandung Conference in 1955, an event that brought together leaders from Asian and African nations that were mostly newly independent or seeking independence from colonial powers. The focus was on promoting economic and cultural cooperation among these nations and standing against racial discrimination, colonialism, and neocolonialism. Therefore, the revolutions mentioned are those of countries gaining independence and self-determination after being under colonial rule."
