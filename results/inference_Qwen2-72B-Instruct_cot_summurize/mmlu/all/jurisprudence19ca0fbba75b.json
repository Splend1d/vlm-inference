Without peace everyone has a right to everything - including another's life.\n\nHobbes believed that in the state of nature, where there is no political authority or social order, every person has a right to everything, leading to a situation he famously described as the \"war of all against all.\" In this chaotic environment, individuals are constantly in fear for their lives and have no security. According to Hobbes, peace is necessary for the establishment of a common power (such as a government) that can enforce laws and maintain order, ensuring the safety and security of its citizens. Therefore, peace is the first law of nature because it is required to escape the brutal state of nature and establish a civil society."
