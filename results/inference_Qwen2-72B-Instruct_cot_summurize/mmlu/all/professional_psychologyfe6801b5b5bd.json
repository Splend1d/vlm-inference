Transference\n\nFrom a Jungian standpoint, transference is the phenomenon that takes place when contents of either the personal or collective unconscious are projected onto the analyst. This occurs when a patient unconsciously redirects feelings and desires, especially those feelings felt towards people in their past, onto the therapist or analyst. This can provide important insights into the patient's psyche and can be used as part of the therapeutic process to explore and resolve underlying issues."
