Universal values are meaningless.\n\nIn this context, \"meta-narratives\" refer to grand theories or overarching stories that claim to explain everything or provide a single framework for understanding the world (e.g., religion, Marxism, Enlightenment rationalism). Postmodern thinkers like Lyotard argue that these meta-narratives are not only often false but also serve to suppress alternative viewpoints and experiences. Thus, postmodernism is characterized by skepticism towards such universal claims and a preference for acknowledging the complexity and diversity of human experience.\n\nWhile options A, B, and D may be related to postmodern critiques in various ways, they do not directly capture the essence of Lyotard's statement about incredulity toward meta-narratives. Option C most closely aligns with his critique of the presumed universality and truth of grand narratives."
