However, most historical accounts suggest that Alexander had relationships with both men and women. He married several times, most notably to Roxana, a woman from Bactria, and he also had a close relationship with Hephaestion, one of his male companions. Therefore, if we have to categorize based on modern terms, Alexander the Great was most likely A. bisexual. But it's important to note that ancient societies had different norms and categories regarding sexuality compared to contemporary ones."
