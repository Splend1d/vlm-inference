We cannot conclude anything about the standard deviation of the population based solely on the sample's standard deviation. The population could have a standard deviation greater than zero even if our particular sample does not.\n\nB. The sample mean and sample median will indeed be equal because all values in the sample are the same. However, this is a consequence of all values being equal rather than a direct implication of the standard deviation being zero.\n\nC. If the standard deviation of the sample is zero, the sample cannot have outliers since outliers would introduce variation into the data, resulting in a non-zero standard deviation.\n\nD. We cannot infer the shape of the population distribution from the standard deviation of a single sample. A population with a zero standard deviation in a sample might still have an asymmetric distribution; we just happened to select values that were all the same in our sample.\n\nTherefore, the true statement given the information is:\n\nB. The sample mean and sample median are equal."
