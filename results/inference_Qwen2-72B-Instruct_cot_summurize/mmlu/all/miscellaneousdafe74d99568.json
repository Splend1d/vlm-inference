Salary expense is increased by $300,000; cash is decreased by $300,000\n\nThis is because when a corporation pays out salaries, it is essentially converting cash (an asset) into an expense. The salary expense account increases (as part of the income statement), while the cash account decreases (as part of the balance sheet). This transaction does not directly affect liabilities. However, if the corporation was previously accruing salaries payable as a liability, paying out the salaries would decrease that liability. But based on the options given, they do not include this scenario."
