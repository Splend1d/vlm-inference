                    "text": "A mother whose child had birth defects sued the pharmaceutical company that made the purportedly dangerous drug prescribed to her during pregnancy. At trial, she offered an expert witness to prove that the drug was a substantial factor in causing the baby's injuries. The expert was a Ph.D. medical researcher with an additional degree in computer science. He had experience in the research and development of similar drugs for other large pharmaceutical companies. He had published relevant articles in peer review journals describing the dangers of these types of drugs. The findings were endorsed by other experts in the field. On the subject litigation, he performed a differential diagnosis, conducted several scientifically valid tests, and made various calculations. He concluded that the drug was the culprit in this case. The Defendants made a Daubert motion challenging the witness' qualifications and the reliability of his testimony, arguing he was a mere researcher and not a physician. Is the court likely to grant the motion and preclude the witness as an expert?\n\nA. Yes, the proposed testimony was not reliable in that it was based on scientific testing only and did not discuss medical science or rule out other causes.\nB. No, the testimony was admissible because several factors militated in favor of the expert's opinion being reliable, and thus helpful to the jury in determining the critical issue of causation.\nC. Yes, the proposed testimony was inadmissible because it was general and did not tie in the expert's knowledge with the case being litigated.\nD. No, the testimony was admissible because the expert's opinion was so authoritative that the court would order the jury to adopt its findings as a matter of law.\n"

No, the testimony was admissible because several factors militated in favor of the expert's opinion being reliable, and thus helpful to the jury in determining the critical issue of causation.\n\nThe expert witness in question appears to have extensive qualifications relevant to the subject matter of the case, including a Ph.D. in medical research and a background in computer science, which could be pertinent to data analysis. His experience in the research and development of similar drugs, publication of relevant articles in peer-reviewed journals, and the endorsement of his findings by other experts all contribute to the reliability of his testimony. The fact that he conducted a differential diagnosis, scientifically valid tests, and made various calculations further supports the reliability of his methods.\n\nWhile the defendants argue that the expert is merely a researcher and not a physician, this does not necessarily disqualify him from providing expert testimony. The key consideration under Daubert is whether the expert's testimony is based on sufficient facts or data, is the product of reliable principles and methods, and whether the expert has reliably applied the principles and methods to the facts of the case. Given the information provided, it seems the expert's testimony meets these criteria, making it likely that the court would find his testimony admissible."
