Anointed one\n\nThe Hebrew word \"mashiach\" (\u05de\u05e9\u05d9\u05d7) translates to \"anointed one.\" In Jewish tradition, it refers to a person who is consecrated with oil for a specific divine mission, such as a king, priest, or prophet. However, it is most commonly associated with the messianic figure expected to lead the Jewish people in the end times."
