This is based on the theory that capitalist economies need to constantly expand and find new sources of profit. This expansion often leads to imperialism, where powerful countries exploit weaker ones for resources, labor, and markets. In this context, US foreign policy would be seen as an extension of its capitalist economic system, aiming to secure and expand markets and resources to sustain and grow its economy."
