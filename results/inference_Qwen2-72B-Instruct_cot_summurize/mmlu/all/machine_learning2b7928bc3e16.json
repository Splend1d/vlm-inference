Therefore, the closest answer would be:\n\nA. Linear in K\n\nThis is because k-fold cross-validation involves splitting the dataset into k 'folds' or subsets. For each unique group, the group is held out as a test set and the model is trained on the remaining data (k-1 folds). This process is repeated k times, each time with a different held-out test set. So, the total amount of work is roughly proportional to k, assuming the cost of training the model on (k-1)/k of the data is roughly constant for different values of k. However, it's important to note that the actual time taken can also depend on other factors such as the size of the dataset, the complexity of the model, and the hardware being used."
