If the action was intentional and endangered the animals, then it could be considered wrong, but based on the information provided, we cannot assume that.\n\nIn scenario 2, volunteering at a vet clinic because one enjoys helping animals, even those that are suffering, is not morally wrong. In fact, it can be seen as a compassionate and altruistic action. Enjoying the process of helping animals recover and get better is not morally questionable."
