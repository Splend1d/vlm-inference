That quantum jump would have to be made before the various scientific, technological, agricultural, and industrial revolutions on which our post-quantum-leap world rests. It could only be accomplished by exploiting the ecosystems, mineral resources, and human assets of whole continents outside the lands of the society making the jump. Western Europe did just that by means of its brutality and guns and, more important, by geographical and ecological luck.\"\nCopyright \u00a9 2015 Cambridge University Press.\nAlfred Crosby, historian, Ecological Imperialism, 2004\nBased on your knowledge of world history, which of the following contributed LEAST to Western European global hegemony between 1450 and 1750 C.E.?\n\nA. The exchange of food sources between the Americas and Europe\nB. Refinement of gunpowder technologies\nC. The development and application of steam-powered technologies\nD.

Steam-powered technologies were not a significant factor in Western European global hegemony between 1450 and 1750 C.E. The Industrial Revolution, which saw the widespread adoption of steam power, occurred later, primarily in the late 18th and early 19th centuries.\n\nA. The exchange of food sources between the Americas and Europe (the Columbian Exchange) was a major contributor to European economic and demographic growth, as it introduced new crops like potatoes and maize that increased agricultural yields and supported larger populations.\n\nB. Refinement of gunpowder technologies played a crucial role in European military conquests and colonial expansion during this period, giving them an advantage over other regions.\n\nD. The implementation of joint-stock companies facilitated European exploration and colonization by allowing for the pooling of capital and spreading of risk among investors, thus enabling large-scale ventures."
