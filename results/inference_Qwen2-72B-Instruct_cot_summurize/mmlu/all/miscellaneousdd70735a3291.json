This provides them with the independence necessary to make decisions based on the law and Constitution rather than political pressure. While Congress can remove federal judges through impeachment (which contradicts option A), and the President does have influence over the composition of the Supreme Court through nominations (contradicting option C), and federal judges do have limited opportunities for advancement within the judiciary (contradicting option D), the primary consequence of the \"good behavior\" clause is the political independence it grants to federal judges."
