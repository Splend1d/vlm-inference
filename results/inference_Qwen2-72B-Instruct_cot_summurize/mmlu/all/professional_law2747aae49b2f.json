The defendant has pleaded not guilty, claiming that he made an honest mistake as to the date the expenses were paid. At trial, the prosecutor offers evidence of the defendant's involvement in an earlier scheme to help a different client falsify tax returns in the same way. Is the evidence of the defendant's involvement in the earlier scheme admissible?\n\nA. No, because it is impermissible character evidence.\nB. No, because it is not relevant to the issues in this case.\nC. Yes, to show absence of mistake.\nD. Yes, to show the defendant's propensity to commit the crime.\n"

Yes, to show absence of mistake.\n\nEvidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts may be admissible for purposes other than proving character or propensity to commit crimes. In this case, the evidence of the earlier scheme can be used to demonstrate that the defendant had knowledge of how to manipulate tax returns and that the alleged \"mistake\" in the current case was not actually a mistake but rather a deliberate action. This falls under Federal Rules of Evidence Rule 404(b), which allows such evidence to be admitted for purposes such as proving motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, absence of mistake, or lack of accident."
