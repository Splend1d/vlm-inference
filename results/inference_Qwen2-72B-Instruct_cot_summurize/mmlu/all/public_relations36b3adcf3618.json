Active receivers are not uniformly affected by mass communication messages.\n\nCurrent thinking in mass communication theory suggests that audiences are not passive recipients but rather active interpreters of media messages. People's responses to media content are influenced by their individual experiences, beliefs, and social contexts, leading to varied interpretations and effects of the same message. This perspective is known as the \"uses and gratifications\" theory, which posits that individuals actively seek out media to fulfill specific needs and desires."
