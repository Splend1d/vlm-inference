This fallacy occurs when someone assumes that what is true for the group as a whole must also be true for each individual member of the group. In this case, the student is assuming that because the class as a whole was the best class the professor had ever had, it follows that no individual student in the class could have failed. However, it is possible for a class to be excellent overall while still having some students who do not perform well individually. Therefore, the fact that the class was the best the professor had ever had does not necessarily mean that no student deserved to fail. So the answer is A. Fallacy of Composition."
