This argument suggests that if we value autonomy, we should not support actions that would eliminate a person's ability to exercise that autonomy in the future. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. killing a person destroys his or her ability to make autonomous decisions. \n\nHowever, it's worth noting that some proponents of autonomy-based justifications for euthanasia might argue that the loss of future autonomy is outweighed by the value of allowing a person to make an autonomous decision about their own life and death while they still have the capacity to do so."
