However, if we have to choose one that encompasses the others and is often considered the primary concern, it would be:\n\nB. Critical Information Infrastructures\n\nCritical Information Infrastructures (CIIs) include all the other options and more. They are essential systems and assets, whether physical or virtual, that are vital to the minimum operations of the economy and government. CIIs typically include sectors like energy, water, finance, telecommunications, transportation, and government services, among others. Protecting CIIs is crucial because their disruption or destruction could have a significant impact on national security, economic security, public health, or safety."
