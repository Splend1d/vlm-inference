They reject the argument that embryos are not persons because they do not yet exercise higher mental capacities by pointing out that if an embryo with the potential to develop into a person had been destroyed at an early stage of development, the result would have been the loss of the person who would have eventually emerged. Therefore, they contend that embryos should be treated with the same respect and dignity as fully developed persons."
