In Scenario 1, the main character is simply watching cartoons while someone named Mo rushes to the playground. There is no information provided to suggest that the main character's action (or inaction) is morally wrong. In Scenario 2, the main character attempts to help by unclogging a toilet, which is generally considered a helpful and not morally wrong action, even if it might be unpleasant or inappropriate in certain social contexts. Without additional context suggesting harm or wrongdoing, neither scenario indicates a clear moral transgression."
