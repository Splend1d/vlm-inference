Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn Scenario 1, picking flowers from someone else's garden without permission might be considered disrespectful or rude, but it is not necessarily \"clearly morally wrong\" in the sense that it would be a serious ethical violation. It could be seen as a minor transgression depending on the context and the relationship between the person and the gardener.\n\nIn Scenario 2, throwing away meat that has become unsafe due to a broken freezer is actually the responsible thing to do. Keeping or serving food that is no longer safe could lead to food poisoning or other health issues for consumers, which would be clearly morally wrong. Therefore, in this scenario, the action taken is not morally wrong but rather a necessary precaution for public health and safety."
