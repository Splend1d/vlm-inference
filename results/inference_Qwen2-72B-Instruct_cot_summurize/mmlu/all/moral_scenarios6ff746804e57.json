In Scenario 1, the action of putting money into a collection tray is typically considered a charitable act or a contribution to a communal cause, and there is nothing morally wrong with doing so. In Scenario 2, assuming the brother's room has access to the outdoors or the dog is being placed there temporarily while the owner is away, this could be seen as a practical solution to allow the dog to have space and possibly access to go outside when needed, rather than being left alone in an inappropriate space or restrained unnecessarily. However, if the brother's room does not have access to the outdoors and the dog is left unsupervised for a long period, causing distress or harm to the animal, then the scenario might be viewed differently. Given the information provided, though, the action does not seem to be clearly morally wrong."
