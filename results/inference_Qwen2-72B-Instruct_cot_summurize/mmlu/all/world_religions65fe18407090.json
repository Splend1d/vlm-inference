Soto Zen is a school of Zen Buddhism that emphasizes the practice of zazen (sitting meditation) and the gradual cultivation of wisdom and compassion over time. This approach is often contrasted with the Rinzai school of Zen, which places greater emphasis on sudden enlightenment through koan study and other forms of intense mental discipline."
