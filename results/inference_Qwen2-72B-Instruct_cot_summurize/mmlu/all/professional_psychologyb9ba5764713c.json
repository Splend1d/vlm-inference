A child with an insecure/anxious-avoidant pattern of attachment shows little distress when separated from the caregiver and often ignores or avoids the caregiver upon return, even if the child was upset during the separation. This behavior suggests that the child has learned not to expect consistent support or comfort from the caregiver in times of need."
