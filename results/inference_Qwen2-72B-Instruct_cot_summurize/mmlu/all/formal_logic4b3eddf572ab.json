The closest option would be C. H \u2228 ~R, but this option does not accurately represent the sentence because it translates to \"Doctors are helpful or patients are not rude,\" which does not convey the conditional relationship between the two propositions.\n\nTherefore, none of the given options A, B, C, or D accurately symbolize the sentence \"Doctors are helpful unless their patients are rude.\"\n\nIf we were to create an option that does represent the sentence, it would be something like:\nE. ~R \u2192 H"
