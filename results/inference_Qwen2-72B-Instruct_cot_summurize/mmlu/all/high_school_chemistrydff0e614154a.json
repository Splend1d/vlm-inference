Determine the parent chain: The longest continuous chain of carbon atoms is 5, making it a pentane derivative.\n2. Number the carbon atoms in the chain so that the substituents have the lowest possible numbers. In this case, the bromine (Br) and chlorine (Cl) atoms are already on the second and third carbon atoms respectively.\n3. Name the substituents (bromo and chloro) and place them in front of the parent name (pentane), using the lowest possible numbers to indicate their positions on the carbon chain.\n\nThus, the name is 2-bromo, 3-chloropentane."
