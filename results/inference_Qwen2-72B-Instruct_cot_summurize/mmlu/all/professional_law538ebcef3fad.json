The prosecutor has called the friend's mother to testify to a conversation she had with her son the day before he left the country. She implored him not to go, but he said, \"Mom, I have to go. I was involved in a robbery at [the bank], and I don't want them to catch me.\" The prosecutor has other evidence indicating that the defendant and the friend were together on the morning of the robbery. Is the statement by the friend to his mother admissible?\n\nA. No, because inculpatory statements against penal interest do not satisfy the confrontation clause.\nB. No, because the friend's statement to his mother was not corroborated.\nC. Yes, as a statement against penal interest that is not testimonial under the confrontation clause.\nD. Yes, as a statement of the friend's state of mind that is not testimonial under the confrontation clause.\n"

Yes, as a statement against penal interest that is not testimonial under the confrontation clause.\n\nThe friend's statement to his mother is a statement against his own penal interest because it admits involvement in a crime, which could lead to legal consequences for him. Such statements are generally considered reliable because people are unlikely to make self-incriminating statements unless they believe them to be true. Furthermore, under the confrontation clause, statements that are not testimonial in nature can be admitted into evidence even if the declarant is unavailable to testify. Since the statement was not made during any formal proceeding or police interrogation, it is likely not considered testimonial and thus may be admissible."
