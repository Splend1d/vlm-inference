Social consensus, Temporal immediacy, Proximity\n\nThese three factors are recognized in the ethical decision-making literature as components that can influence the perceived moral intensity of a situation. Social consensus refers to the degree of agreement within a society about whether an action is right or wrong. Temporal immediacy refers to how soon the effects of an action will be felt. Proximity involves the physical or emotional closeness between the decision-maker and the people affected by the decision. These factors can all contribute to the strength of the moral imperative to act in a particular way."
