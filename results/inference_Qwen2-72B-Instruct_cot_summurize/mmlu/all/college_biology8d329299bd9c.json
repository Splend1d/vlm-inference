Transformation of one segment into another\n\nHomeotic cluster genes, also known as Hox genes, play crucial roles in specifying the identity of segments along the anterior-posterior axis during development. Mutations in these genes can lead to transformations where one body part is replaced by another that normally develops in a different segment. This phenomenon is often referred to as homeotic transformation. For example, in Drosophila, a mutation in the Antennapedia gene can cause legs to develop in place of antennae."
