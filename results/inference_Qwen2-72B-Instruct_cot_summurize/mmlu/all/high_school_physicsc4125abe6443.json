                    "text": "The correct answer is C. Conservation of momentum indicates that two identical gamma rays moving off in opposite directions could be created.\n\nWhen a positron (the antiparticle of an electron) interacts with an electron, they can mutually annihilate each other, converting their rest mass energy into other forms of energy. According to the conservation of momentum, the total momentum before the interaction must equal the total momentum after the interaction. Since the positron is moving slowly and the electron is at rest, their combined momentum is quite small. If the annihilation results in the production of two gamma rays moving in opposite directions, the momenta of these gamma rays will cancel each other out, thus conserving the total momentum.\n\nAdditionally, the conversion of the electron and positron rest mass into gamma ray energy satisfies the conservation of energy principle. However, option D incorrectly suggests that only the positron is converted into energy while the electron remains, which would violate both conservation of charge and conservation of momentum principles.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it does not take into account the conversion of mass into energy, as described by Einstein's equation E=mc^2. Option B is incorrect because it implies that all new particles created would have no charge, whereas the annihilation process typically results in neutral particles like photons (gamma rays), but this does not apply to \"all\" new particles since no other charged particles are necessarily produced in this specific reaction."
