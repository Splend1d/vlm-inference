Therefore, the correct answer is D.\n\nPruning a decision tree involves removing some of the branches that have little or no effect on the outcome of the tree. This process helps to simplify the model and reduce its complexity, which can prevent it from fitting too closely to the noise in the training data. By avoiding overfitting, the pruned decision tree can generalize better to new, unseen data. \n\nWhile pruning may also result in saving computing time during testing and saving space for storing the decision tree, these are not the primary reasons for pruning. Similarly, pruning does not necessarily make the training set error smaller; in fact, it may increase the training error slightly in order to improve generalization performance on new data."
