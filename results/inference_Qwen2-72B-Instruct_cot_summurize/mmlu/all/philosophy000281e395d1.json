These include the complexity of the rules (option A), the likelihood of people adhering to them (option B), and the costs of the restrictions imposed by the rules, such as feelings of guilt or other negative consequences (option C). Therefore, according to Brandt's perspective, all three of these aspects play a role in determining whether a moral code can be considered ideal."
