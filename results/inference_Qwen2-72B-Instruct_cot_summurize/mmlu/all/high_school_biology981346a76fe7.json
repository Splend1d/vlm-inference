Populations tend to increase at a faster rate than their food supply normally allows.\n\nThis idea is central to Thomas Malthus' theory of population growth, which suggested that populations will always grow at an exponential rate while resources such as food and space will only grow arithmetically, leading to a struggle for existence. This concept influenced Charles Darwin's thinking on natural selection, as he realized that this struggle would lead to competition for resources, where individuals with advantageous traits would be more likely to survive and reproduce, passing those traits on to future generations."
