However, your question doesn't specify what the 467 tickets at $7 each represent. Assuming they are adult tickets or some other type of ticket, we can still analyze the given expressions.\n\nLet's break down each option:\n\nA. \\((215 \\times 3) - (467 \\times 7)\\)\n\nThis expression calculates the total revenue from 215 youth tickets sold at $3 each and then subtracts the total revenue from 467 tickets sold at $7 each. This would give us the difference in revenue if the revenue from the higher-priced tickets is subtracted from the lower-priced tickets' revenue, which might not make sense in this context since typically you'd want to see the total profit or compare revenues in a way that makes logical sense for the scenario.\n\nB. \\((215 \\times 7) - (467 \\times 3)\\)\n\nThis flips the multipliers for the number of tickets and their prices, so it calculates as if the 215 tickets were sold at $7 each and the 467 tickets were sold at $3 each, and then finds the difference. Again, this would not necessarily make sense without knowing the context.\n\nC. \\((467 \\times 3) - (215 \\times 7)\\)\n\nThis calculates the total revenue from 467 tickets sold at $3 each and then subtracts the total revenue from 215 tickets sold at $7 each. This gives the difference in revenue if the revenue from the lower-priced tickets is subtracted from the higher-priced tickets' revenue.\n\nD. \\((467 \\times 7) - (215 \\times 3)\\)\n\nThis calculates the total revenue from 467 tickets sold at $7 each and then subtracts the total revenue from 215 tickets sold at $3 each. This gives the difference in revenue if the revenue from the higher-priced tickets is subtracted from the lower-priced tickets' revenue, but in reverse order compared to A.\n\nGiven the typical scenario where one might want to compare the total revenue from two different types of ticket sales, option D: \\((467 \\times 7) - (215 \\times 3)\\) would be the most likely choice if you are looking for how much more revenue was generated by the higher-priced tickets compared to the lower-priced tickets. However, without additional context about what the 467 tickets at $7 each represent, it's difficult to definitively state which is the correct answer."
