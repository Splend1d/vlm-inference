Higher government funding of research on clean energy supplies\n\nThis option is most likely to contribute to faster rates of economic growth because investing in research and development (R&D), especially in areas like clean energy, can lead to technological advancements, increased efficiency, and the creation of new industries. This, in turn, can stimulate economic growth by creating jobs, increasing productivity, and fostering innovation.\n\nOptions A, B, and C are generally not associated with faster economic growth:\n\nA. A more restrictive immigration policy could limit the labor force and potentially reduce economic dynamism.\nB. Negative net investment means that the capital stock is shrinking, which is detrimental to economic growth.\nC. Higher taxes on households and firms can reduce disposable income and discourage investment, which may slow down economic growth."
