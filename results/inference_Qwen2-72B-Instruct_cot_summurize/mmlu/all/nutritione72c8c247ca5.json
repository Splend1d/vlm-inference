However, among the options given, none directly provide NADPH. But considering the question's context and the closest relation to the reduction reactions, we should look for a vitamin that contributes to the production of NADPH or its precursors.\n\nVitamin B3 (Niacin) is converted into NAD+ and NADP+, which can be reduced to NADH and NADPH, respectively. NADPH is crucial for fatty acid synthesis as it acts as a reducing agent.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be:\n\nB. Niacin"
