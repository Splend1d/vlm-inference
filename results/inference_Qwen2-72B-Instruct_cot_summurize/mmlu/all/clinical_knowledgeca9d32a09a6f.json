Prolapsed stomas - A surgical support can help provide additional support to a prolapsed stoma, which occurs when the stoma protrudes excessively from the abdominal wall.\n\nB. High output stomas - A surgical support can help manage a high output stoma by providing extra support and stability to the stoma and surrounding skin, potentially reducing leakage and skin irritation caused by the high volume of output.\n\nC. Herniation around the stoma - A surgical support can be used to help manage a peristomal hernia, which is a herniation that occurs around the stoma site. It can provide support to the herniated area and reduce discomfort or complications associated with the hernia.\n\nD. Retraction of the stoma - A surgical support can assist in managing a retracted stoma, which occurs when the stoma sinks below the level of the skin. The support can help elevate the stoma closer to or above the skin level, improving appliance fit and reducing the risk of leakage."
