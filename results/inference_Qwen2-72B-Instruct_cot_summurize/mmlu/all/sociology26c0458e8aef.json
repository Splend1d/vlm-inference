In fact, the print revolution allowed for greater dissemination of knowledge, education, and serious literature to a wider audience. The other options (B, C, and D) do not accurately describe the outcomes of the print revolution of the 19th century. Option B is incorrect because newspapers were typically owned by private entities or individuals rather than being publicly owned. Option C refers to the emergence of cinema, which occurred after the print revolution and was a separate development. Option D is incorrect because the concept of 'virtual communities' on the Internet is a much more recent phenomenon and unrelated to the 19th-century print revolution."
