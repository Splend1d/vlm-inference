This will allow him to provide the best possible care to his clients while also continuing to learn and grow as a professional. Refusing to see the clients would leave them without access to mental health care, which could be harmful to their well-being. Using only interventions he has experience with may not be in the best interest of the client if those interventions are not appropriate for their specific issues. Agreeing to see clients only during a crisis would not provide adequate ongoing support for those who need it."
