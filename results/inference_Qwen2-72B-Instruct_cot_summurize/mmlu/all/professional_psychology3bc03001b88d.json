Serving as both a fact witness and an expert witness in the same case creates a conflict of interest and can compromise the psychologist's objectivity and professional judgment. This dual role may also confuse the court and other parties about the psychologist's impartiality and credibility. Therefore, it is considered unethical to accept such dual roles."
