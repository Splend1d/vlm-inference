                    "text": "Let's analyze these statements one by one:\n\n**Statement 1:**\nThe kernel density estimator (KDE) is a non-parametric way to estimate the probability density function of a random variable. It works by placing a kernel (a symmetric, real-valued function that integrates to 1) at each data point and summing them up. The value \\(Y_i = \\frac{1}{n}\\) at each point \\(X_i\\) in the original data set suggests that we are essentially spreading out the total weight of 1 (the total probability) evenly across all points. This is indeed how KDE works; it places a small \"bump\" (the kernel) at each data point, which collectively estimates the underlying density of the data. So, this statement is **True**.\n\n**Statement 2:**\nIn theory, the depth of a learned decision tree can indeed be larger than the number of training examples. However, in practical implementations, especially when using algorithms like CART (Classification and Regression Trees), the depth of the tree is often constrained to prevent overfitting. Even without explicit constraints, once every training example has been classified into a pure node (i.e., a node where all examples belong to the same class), further splits would not provide additional information and thus, the tree would typically stop growing. However, if one were to consider an algorithm or scenario where splitting continues even after perfect classification, then theoretically, the tree could grow deeper than the number of training examples. For instance, in a pathological case where each split creates two child nodes, one with a single example, and the other with the rest, you could end up with more levels than training examples. Therefore, while not common in practice due to overfitting concerns, this statement is technically **True** under certain conditions.\n\nThus, the correct answer is **A. True, True**."
