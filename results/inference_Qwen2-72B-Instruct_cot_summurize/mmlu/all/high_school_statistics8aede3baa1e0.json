                    "text": "To solve this problem, we will use the conditional probability formula and the properties of the normal distribution.\n\nFirst, let's standardize the values given to us. The mean (\u03bc) is 75,000 miles, and the standard deviation (\u03c3) is 12,000 miles. We need to find the probability that a taxi has been driven less than 100,000 miles given that it has been driven over 80,000 miles.\n\nThe z-score for 100,000 miles is:\n\\[z = \\frac{X - \\mu}{\\sigma} = \\frac{100,000 - 75,000}{12,000} = \\frac{25,000}{12,000} = 2.0833\\]\n\nAnd the z-score for 80,000 miles is:\n\\[z = \\frac{X - \\mu}{\\sigma} = \\frac{80,000 - 75,000}{12,000} = \\frac{5,000}{12,000} = 0.4167\\]\n\nUsing a standard normal table or calculator, we can find the probabilities associated with these z-scores. \n\nLet P(X < x) be the probability that a taxi has been driven less than x miles.\nThen, P(80,000 < X < 100,000) = P(Z < 2.0833) - P(Z < 0.4167)\n\nFrom the standard normal table:\nP(Z < 2.0833) \u2248 0.9812\nP(Z < 0.4167) \u2248 0.6628\n\nTherefore,\nP(80,000 < X < 100,000) = 0.9812 - 0.6628 = 0.3184\n\nHowever, this is not the final answer since we want the probability that a taxi has been driven less than 100,000 miles GIVEN that it has been driven over 80,000 miles. This is a conditional probability problem:\n\n\\[P(X < 100,000 | X > 80,000) = \\frac{P(80,000 < X < 100,000)}{P(X > 80,000)}\\]\n\nWe already calculated the numerator as 0.3184. Now we need the denominator, which is the probability that a taxi has been driven over 80,000 miles. This is simply 1 minus the probability that a taxi has been driven less than or equal to 80,000 miles.\n\nSo,\n\\[P(X > 80,000) = 1 - P(X < 80,000) = 1 - 0.6628 = 0.3372\\]\n\nThus,\n\\[P(X < 100,000 | X > 80,000) = \\frac{0.3184}{0.3372} \u2248 0.944\\]\n\nThe closest option to our calculated value is D. 0.94."
