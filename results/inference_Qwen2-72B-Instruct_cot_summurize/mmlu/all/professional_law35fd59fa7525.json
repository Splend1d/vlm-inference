The state called the homeowner to testify, but his identification testimony was inconclusive. The homeowner testified that he was asleep during the burglary and awoke as the burglar was fleeing the premises. The homeowner admitted that he didn't see the face of the burglar and couldn't even tell whether the person was male or female. Thereafter, the prosecution offers evidence that at the time of the burglary, the defendant needed money to defend himself against other burglary charges. This proffered evidence should be\n\nA. admitted without restriction as probative evidence of motive.\nB. admitted, provided the court instructs the jury to limit use of the evidence to the defendant's motive to burglarize.\nC. excluded as lacking any probative value.\nD. excluded as substantially more unfairly prejudicial than probative.\n"

                    "text": "The evidence in question is the defendant's need for money to defend himself against other burglary charges. This evidence could potentially be relevant to show motive, which is an element of the crime of burglary. However, it also carries a significant risk of unfair prejudice, as it may lead the jury to conclude that the defendant is guilty simply because he has been charged with other crimes.\n\nGiven this, option A, admitting the evidence without restriction, is not appropriate because it fails to account for the potential for unfair prejudice.\n\nOption B, admitting the evidence with a limiting instruction, is a more reasonable approach. The court can admit the evidence for the limited purpose of showing motive, while also providing a clear instruction to the jury that they should not consider the evidence as proof of the defendant's propensity to commit crimes.\n\nOption C, excluding the evidence as lacking probative value, is not accurate. While the evidence may have limited probative value, it does have some relevance to the issue of motive, and therefore cannot be categorically excluded on these grounds.\n\nOption D, excluding the evidence as substantially more unfairly prejudicial than probative, is a possible outcome. Under Federal Rules of Evidence Rule 403, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. In this case, the probative value of the evidence may be outweighed by the risk of unfair prejudice, making exclusion under Rule 403 a plausible decision.\n\nHowever, given the context of the question and the options provided, Option B seems to be the most balanced and legally sound choice: admitting the evidence with a limiting instruction to the jury regarding its proper use. This balances the need for the prosecution to present relevant evidence against the defendant's right to a fair trial. Therefore, the correct answer would be:\n\nB. admitted, provided the court instructs the jury to limit use of the evidence to the defendant's motive to burglarize."
