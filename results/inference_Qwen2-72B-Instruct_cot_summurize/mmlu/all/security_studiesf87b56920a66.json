If a threat posed by one group to another is military - particularly when linked to the defence of the historic homeland - armed response is required. At the intra-state level, many societal groups have no such means of armed protection and are compelled to employ non-military counter-measures.\nB. Intra-state collectives faced with a political or military threat to their identity will form their own militia or defensive force as a means of protection. This results in the establishment of quasi-states which may undermine the territorial integrity of the nation.\nC. Being aligned with the state, society has immediate and unequivocal access to the use of state forces (in the form of military retaliation) if there is a threat to societal security.\nD. Societal groups do not face military threats; being constituted by identity and social cohesion, military forces are not engaged against societal groups in any meaningful way.\n"

When a threat to a societal group is military in nature, especially if it involves the defense of a historic homeland, an armed response might indeed be necessary. However, this option is often limited to groups that have some level of autonomy or recognition within the state structure, allowing them access to arms or the support of state forces. For many groups, especially those within a larger state, non-military strategies such as diplomacy, legal action, and cultural preservation become the primary means of defense.\n\nB. Threatened societal groups sometimes resort to forming militias or defensive forces to protect themselves. These groups can operate independently or in semi-autonomous regions, potentially leading to the creation of quasi-states. This can challenge the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the nation, leading to internal conflicts or civil wars.\n\nC. Societal groups that are closely aligned with the state may indeed benefit from the state's military forces for protection. However, this scenario assumes a level of unity and cooperation between the state and the societal group that may not always exist. In cases where the state is either unwilling or unable to provide protection, the group might still be vulnerable.\n\nD. While it is true that societal groups are primarily constituted by identity and social cohesion, they can and do face military threats. Historical examples abound where groups have been targeted for military action based on their ethnicity, religion, or other identifiers. Military forces have indeed been engaged against societal groups in meaningful ways, often resulting in significant human rights abuses and tragedies.\n\nIn conclusion, the extent to which societal identity can be defended militarily depends on various factors including the nature of the threat, the relationship between the societal group and the state, and the availability of resources to mount a defense. Military defense is only one tool in a broader toolkit of responses to threats against societal identity."
