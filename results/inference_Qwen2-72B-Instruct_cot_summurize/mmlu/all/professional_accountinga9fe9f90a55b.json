A taxable gift would occur when the ownership of the policy is transferred to another person or when the insured no longer has any incidents of ownership in the policy. Since the taxpayer is still the owner of the insurance contract and continues to make all premium payments, there has been no transfer of any interest in the property (the insurance contract) to the children.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Zero."
