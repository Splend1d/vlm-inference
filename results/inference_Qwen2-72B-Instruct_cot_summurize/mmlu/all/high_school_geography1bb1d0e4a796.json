Bulk-reducing products\n\nBulk-reducing products, such as paper or aluminum cans that are processed into smaller, lighter forms (like bales of recycled paper or ingots), do not necessarily need to be close to their markets because the cost of transporting them decreases after they have been processed. This is in contrast to dairy foods, which are perishable and require proximity to the market for timely consumption; bulk-gaining products, which increase in volume and weight during processing, making transportation costs higher the further they are from the market; and single-market products, which are designed specifically for one market and thus need to be produced close by to meet that market's demands."
