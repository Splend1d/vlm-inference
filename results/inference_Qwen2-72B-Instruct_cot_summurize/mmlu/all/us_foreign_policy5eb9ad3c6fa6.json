These theories argue that the structure of the international system, characterized by the distribution of power among states, shapes the behavior and policies of individual states. States are seen as rational actors seeking to maximize their security and interests within this anarchy-ridden system. Therefore, the balance of power, alliances, and the relative capabilities of states are crucial factors influencing a state's foreign policy decisions."
