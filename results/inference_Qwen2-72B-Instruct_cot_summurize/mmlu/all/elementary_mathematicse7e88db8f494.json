To compare them easily, notice that \\(2/5\\) is the same as \\(4/10\\), and clearly \\(1/10 < 4/10\\).\n\nC. \\(4/10\\) is equal to \\(2/5\\), not greater. Since both represent the same quantity (two parts out of five or four parts out of ten), this is not the answer.\n\nD. \\(5/10\\) is greater than \\(2/5\\). \\(5/10\\) can be simplified to \\(1/2\\), and half is more than \\(2/5\\). In decimal form, \\(2/5 = 0.4\\) while \\(5/10 = 0.5\\), confirming that \\(5/10\\) is indeed greater than \\(2/5\\).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. \\(5/10\\)."
