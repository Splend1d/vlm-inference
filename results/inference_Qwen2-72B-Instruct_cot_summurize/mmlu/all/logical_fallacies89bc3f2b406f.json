This is because there is an inconsistency in his argument: while he claims that his opium use does no harm because he is too old to work, he then reveals that he lives off the earnings of his grandmother, which implies that someone else's labor is supporting him. This inconsistency undermines his claim that his opium use has no negative impact on others. However, it should be noted that the given options do not perfectly cover all possible logical fallacies, and this argument might also be considered a form of Red Herring or Irrelevant Conclusion, as it diverts attention from the legality of his actions to his personal circumstances."
