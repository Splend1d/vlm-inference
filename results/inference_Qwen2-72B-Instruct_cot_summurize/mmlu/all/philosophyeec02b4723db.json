Anscombe, in her influential paper \"Modern Moral Philosophy\" (1958), argues that the concept of \"moral obligation\" as it is used in modern times does not refer to any real concept at all (option D). She criticizes the notion of moral obligation that is detached from divine law and suggests that the language of obligation has become confused since it no longer refers to the commands of a divine lawgiver. According to Anscombe, without such a lawgiver, there is no clear basis for saying that one \"ought\" to do something, as this would imply an authority that can command obedience.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that Anscombe's view is a specific interpretation within the context of philosophical ethics, and other philosophers may define or understand \"moral obligation\" differently."
