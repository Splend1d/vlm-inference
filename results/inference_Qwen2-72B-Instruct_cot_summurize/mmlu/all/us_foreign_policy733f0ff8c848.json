While it is true that certain types of regimes might be more inclined to seek nuclear weapons for security or prestige reasons, the mere fact of being a democracy, dictatorship, or other regime type does not necessarily correlate with the pursuit of nuclear weapons. Factors such as security concerns, rivalry with a nuclear-armed state, economic capability to fund a nuclear program, and receipt of sensitive nuclear assistance are typically more direct indicators of a state's potential to acquire nuclear weapons."
