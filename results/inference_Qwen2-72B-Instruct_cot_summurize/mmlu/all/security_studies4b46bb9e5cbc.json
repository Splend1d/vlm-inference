The European school is based on a hegemonic form of knowledge. Knowledge is conceived as the understanding of causal mechanisms in relation to the material on which they act.\nC.

                    "text": "The differences that have emerged with regard to theorizing on both sides of the Atlantic can be understood through the following points:\n\nA. From a US perspective, security studies often emphasize an external threat environment. There is a focus on identifying and addressing external security challenges, such as military threats from other states or non-state actors. This perspective tends to prioritize state-centric security concerns and the role of military power in maintaining national security.\n\nB. In contrast, the European school of security studies tends to adopt a more comprehensive and inclusive approach to security. It recognizes a broader range of security issues beyond traditional military threats, including economic, environmental, and societal dimensions. European scholars often emphasize the importance of understanding the underlying causes of insecurity and the need for cooperative and multilateral approaches to address them.\n\nC. The different forms of knowledge and their relationship to policy also differ between the two schools. In the US, there is a strong tradition of problem-solving research that seeks to provide practical solutions to policy challenges. This approach is often associated with positivist methods and empirical analysis. In Europe, there is a greater emphasis on critical studies that question the assumptions and biases underlying security policies. Critical scholars often adopt post-positivist or constructivist approaches that seek to understand the social and political contexts in which security policies are developed.\n\nD. While there are some parallels in the use of empirically substantiated cause-and-effect relationships in security studies on both sides of the Atlantic, the theoretical frameworks and methodologies used to analyze these relationships can differ significantly. For example, US scholars may rely more heavily on quantitative methods and game theory, while European scholars may use qualitative methods and critical theory.\n\nOverall, the differences in theorizing on both sides of the Atlantic reflect broader cultural, political, and historical contexts. These differences can lead to distinct perspectives on security challenges and policy responses, but they can also provide opportunities for cross-fertilization and collaboration in the field of security studies."
