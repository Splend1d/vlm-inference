It is a sequence of nops preceding injected shellcode, useful when the return address is unknown.\n\nA \"nop sled\" (short for \"no operation sled\") is a technique used in computer security, particularly in the context of exploiting vulnerabilities that lead to arbitrary code execution. The term refers to a long string of NOP (No Operation) instructions placed before the actual payload or shellcode. When the control flow reaches the start of the nop sled, it slides through the NOPs without any effect until it hits the actual code intended to be executed. This technique is often used when the exact location where the shellcode will be executed is not known, as the nop sled ensures that the execution will eventually hit the payload regardless of where it starts within the nop sled."
