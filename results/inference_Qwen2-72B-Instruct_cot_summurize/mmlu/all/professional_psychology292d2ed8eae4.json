Parkinson's disease\n\nParkinson's disease often presents with motor symptoms such as tremors, rigidity, and bradykinesia (slowness of movement), along with non-motor symptoms that can include depression and changes in emotional expression. However, it's important to note that a proper diagnosis would require a thorough evaluation by a medical professional, including a neurological examination and possibly additional tests to rule out other conditions."
