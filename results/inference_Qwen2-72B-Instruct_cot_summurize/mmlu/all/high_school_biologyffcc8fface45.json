Subsequent generations of a population should have greater proportions of individuals that possess traits better suited for success.\n\nThis statement reflects the core concept of natural selection, which was proposed by Charles Darwin. According to this theory, organisms with traits that are advantageous for reproduction and survival will tend to pass those traits on to their offspring at a higher rate than those without such advantageous traits. Over time, this leads to a population where more individuals possess traits that are beneficial in their specific environment, as these traits become more common through successive generations."
