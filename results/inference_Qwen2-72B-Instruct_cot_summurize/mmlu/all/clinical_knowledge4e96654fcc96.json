It typically happens when someone falls onto an outstretched hand with the wrist extended. This type of fracture often results in the wrist being bent backwards and the bones forming a characteristic 'dinner fork' deformity. The ulna, which is the other bone in the forearm, may also be injured but it's not typically fractured in a Colles fracture in the same way as the radius."
