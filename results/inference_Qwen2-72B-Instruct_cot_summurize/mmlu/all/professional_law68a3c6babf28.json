                    "text": "The correct answer is B. The neighbor will most likely recover because the farmer was negligent in leaving the fire unattended. Negligence occurs when someone fails to exercise reasonable care, resulting in damage or injury to another person. In this case, the farmer had a duty to control the fire he started and failed to do so, which led to the spread of the fire and damage to the neighbor's property. This failure to exercise reasonable care can be considered negligence, making the farmer liable for the damages caused by the fire.\n\nA is incorrect because strict liability generally applies to ultra-hazardous activities, such as transporting explosives or operating a nuclear power plant, which are not present in this situation.\n\nC is also incorrect because a public nuisance typically involves an unreasonable interference with a right common to the general public, such as air pollution or excessive noise. While the fire may have been a nuisance to the neighbor, it does not rise to the level of a public nuisance.\n\nD is incorrect because the wind gust cannot be considered an act of God if the farmer's negligence contributed to the spread of the fire. An act of God refers to natural disasters that are unforeseeable and uncontrollable, but in this case, the farmer could have taken steps to prevent the spread of the fire, such as attending to it or taking precautions against the wind."
