The subjects consist of undergraduate students at the university where the experiment is being conducted. The subjects are randomly assigned to groups that are compensated either $10 or $20 for their participation, are given either 15 minutes or 30 minutes to learn the facts, and are asked to recall the facts either in the same room in which they learned the facts or in a very different, unfamiliar setting. Which of the following are dependent variables in this experiment?\nI. The amount the subjects were compensated.\nII. The room in which the subjects were asked to recall facts.\nIII. The number of facts the subjects can recall.\nIV. The time the subjects were given to learn the facts.\n\nA. II only\nB. III only\nC. I and IV only\nD. I and III and IV only\n"

In this case, the dependent variable is what the researchers are interested in measuring to see how it is affected by the conditions they manipulate.\n\nIn the described experiment, the conditions manipulated by the researcher (the independent variables) are:\n- The amount compensated ($10 vs. $20)\n- Time given to learn the facts (15 minutes vs. 30 minutes)\n- Location of recall (same room vs. different setting)\n\nThe outcome that the researchers are measuring (the dependent variable) is the number of facts the subjects can recall. This is because the researchers want to see if changing the compensation, learning time, or recall location affects the subjects' ability to recall the facts.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\nB. III only\n\nThe number of facts the subjects can recall is the dependent variable. The other options listed (I, II, and IV) are independent variables that are being manipulated to observe their effect on the dependent variable."
