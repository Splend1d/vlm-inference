No, all States are considered equal as sovereign States (the principle of sovereign equality, enshrined in article 2, para 1 UN Charter)\n\nWhile it's true that certain states hold more influence or power in specific international organizations, such as the Permanent Five Members of the UN Security Council having veto power, the principle of sovereign equality asserts that all states have equal rights and duties under international law. This means they are equal in terms of their legal personality and capacity to exercise rights and obligations under international law. However, it should be noted that in practice, geopolitical realities often mean that some states wield more influence than others."
