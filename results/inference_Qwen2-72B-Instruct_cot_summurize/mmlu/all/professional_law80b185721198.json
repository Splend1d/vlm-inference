The invitation can be express or implied, and the person does not have to be there for the purpose of conducting business with the owner. The primary reason for the public invitee's presence is usually related to the business's purpose (such as shopping), but incidental uses like using the restroom are often included in the scope of the invitation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC.
