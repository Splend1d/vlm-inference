When people are hungry, they often desire to eat food (A) because their body needs nourishment, and they also desire the pleasant gustatory sensations (B) that come from eating tasty food. However, it is important to note that Feinberg's specific philosophical stance on desires might nuance this answer depending on his particular arguments. Without more context on Feinberg's exact position, the most straightforward interpretation of his claim would suggest he believes hunger leads to desires for both food consumption and the pleasurable experience of eating."
