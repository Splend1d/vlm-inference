Two of the guests got into an argument, and one of them got up from the table and lunged at the other with a large hunting knife. The host stepped in with a baseball bat and hit the attacker in the chest with it, preventing the imminent contact by the attacker with his target. The blow knocked the attacker down and caused several broken ribs. The injured guest sued the host for aggravated assault and battery. Is the court likely to grant the host's motion to dismiss the claim for failure to state a sufficient claim for relief?\n\nA. Yes, because the host had the privilege of \"defense of others.\"\nB. No, because the host's use of force was excessive under the circumstances.\nC. Yes, because the host has the privilege of host immunity.\nD. No, because the host escalated the conflict by getting involved.\n"

Yes, because the host had the privilege of \"defense of others.\" The host intervened to prevent an imminent attack on another person using what he reasonably believed to be necessary force. This is typically covered under the defense of others doctrine, which allows a person to use reasonable force to protect another from harm. However, the reasonableness of the force used (a baseball bat) in comparison to the threat (a large hunting knife) will be a key factor in determining whether the defense applies. In this case, given the potentially lethal nature of the knife, the use of the baseball bat might be considered reasonable to prevent serious bodily harm or death."
