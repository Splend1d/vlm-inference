After a recital of a case of peculiar hardship one of them exclaimed: \"Wouldn't it be fine if we had a boarding club of our own, and then we could stand behind each other in a time like this?\" After that events moved quickly. We \u2026 discussed all the difficulties and fascinations of such an undertaking, and on the first of May, 1891, two comfortable apartments near Hull House were rented and furnished. The Settlement was responsible for the furniture and paid the first month's rent, but beyond that the members managed the club themselves.\u2026 At the end of the third year the club occupied all of the six apartments which the original building contained, and numbered fifty members.\n\u2014Jane Addams, Twenty Years at Hull House, 1912\nA settlement house worker was most likely to be motivated by which of the following?\n\nA.

Settlement houses aimed to improve living conditions and provide services for poor urban communities. The motivation behind these efforts was often rooted in the Social Gospel, a progressive movement within Protestant Christianity that applied Christian ethics to social problems, particularly issues of social justice that arose from industrialization. The Social Gospel emphasized the responsibility of Christians to work for social change and improve the lives of the less fortunate. In contrast, Social Darwinism, Communism, and the support of an urban political machine do not align with the motivations and actions described in the passage."
