Price skimming\n\nPrice skimming is the most appropriate strategy for a new and unique product because it allows a company to maximize profits by initially setting high prices. This strategy targets early adopters who are willing to pay a premium for the latest and greatest product. As the market becomes saturated with competitors, the price can be lowered over time."
