If their mean diameter is under 1.23 centimeters or over 1.27 centimeters, the machinery is stopped and an engineer is called to make adjustments before production is resumed. The quality control procedure may be viewed as a hypothesis test with the null hypothesis H0: \u03bc = 1.25 and the alternative hypothesis Ha: \u03bc \u2260 1.25. The engineer is asked to make adjustments when the null hypothesis is rejected. In test terminology, what would a Type II error result in?\n\nA.

In this context, that would mean that the machinery is producing ball bearings with diameters that are significantly different from 1.25 cm (the alternative hypothesis Ha is true), but the quality control procedure fails to detect this difference and does not call for an engineer to make adjustments.\n\nGiven the options provided:\n\nA. A warranted halt in production to adjust the machinery - This would not be the result of a Type II error; instead, this would be the correct action if the null hypothesis were truly false and was correctly rejected.\n\nB. An unnecessary stoppage of the production process - This would be a Type I error, where the null hypothesis is incorrectly rejected when it is actually true.\n\nC. Continued production of wrong size ball bearings - This is the result of a Type II error because the incorrect state of the process (producing bearings of the wrong size) continues undetected.\n\nD. Continued production of proper size ball bearings - This would be the case if there were no error in hypothesis testing.\n\nThus, the answer is C. Continued production of wrong size ball bearings."
