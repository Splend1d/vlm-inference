Research has consistently shown that high levels of interparental conflict, whether before, during, or after divorce, are associated with poorer outcomes for children. This includes increased risk for emotional and behavioral problems, as well as difficulties in academic performance and social relationships.\n\nWhile the other factors listed can also have an impact on a child's adjustment, the level of ongoing conflict between parents is generally considered to be the most significant factor. It's important to note, however, that not all children react in the same way to divorce and its aftermath, and individual differences, such as age, temperament, and previous experiences, can also play a role in how they adjust."
