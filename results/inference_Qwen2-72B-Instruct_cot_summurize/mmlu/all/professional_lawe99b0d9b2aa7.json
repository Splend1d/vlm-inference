A divisible contract is one in which the obligations of the parties are severable into distinct parts, each of which can stand on its own. In this case, the employee was hired for a year but was paid on a weekly basis. The fact that the employee was paid weekly suggests that the contract could be divided into smaller, separate parts (each week's work and pay) rather than being an entire contract where the entire performance must be completed before payment is due.\n\nSo the correct answer is:\n\nB. a divisible contract."
