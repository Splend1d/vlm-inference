The parent(s) provide(s) written consent and the child assents verbally to participate in therapy.\n\nThis option respects both the legal authority of the parents or guardians to consent on behalf of the minor and the child's autonomy by obtaining their assent. It is important to ensure that the child understands what therapy involves and agrees to participate, even if they cannot legally consent. This approach aligns with ethical guidelines in psychology that emphasize informed consent and respect for individuals' rights and dignity."
