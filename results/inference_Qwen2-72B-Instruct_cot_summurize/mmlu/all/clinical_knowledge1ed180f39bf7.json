Females have two X chromosomes (XX), while males have one X and one Y chromosome (XY). The Y chromosome carries the SRY gene which triggers male development. Since mothers can only pass on an X chromosome to their offspring, it is the father who determines the sex of the child by passing on either an X or a Y chromosome. If the child inherits an X chromosome from the father, they will be female (XX); if they inherit a Y chromosome from the father, they will be male (XY)."
