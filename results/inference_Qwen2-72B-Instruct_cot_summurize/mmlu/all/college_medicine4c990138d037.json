Lactate can be taken up by the liver, heart, and other tissues where it can be converted back to glucose through a process called gluconeogenesis or it can be oxidized (burned) for energy. The Cori cycle describes the process where lactate produced in muscles during anaerobic metabolism is transported to the liver, converted to glucose, and then sent back to the muscles for use as energy."
