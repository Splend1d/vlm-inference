It is breaded and fried veal cutlets topped with tomato sauce and cheese, then baked until the cheese is melted and bubbly. \n\nSushi typically does not include cheese as an ingredient. French fries may be served with cheese as a topping (such as in poutine), but it is not a necessary ingredient. Chicken pot pie may include cheese as a topping or mixed into the filling, but it is not a necessary ingredient."
