A 90% confidence interval estimate for the difference in proportions between Toyota and Subaru car owners who are satisfied with their drive systems is reported to be -0.197 \u00b1 0.081. Which is a proper conclusion?\n\nA. The interval is invalid because probabilities cannot be negative.\nB. The interval is invalid because it does not contain zero.\nC. Subaru owners are approximately 19.7% more satisfied with their drive systems than are Toyota owners.\nD. We are 90% confident that the difference in proportions between Toyota and Subaru car owners who are satisfied with their drive systems is between -0.278 and -0.116.\n"

We are 90% confident that the difference in proportions between Toyota and Subaru car owners who are satisfied with their drive systems is between -0.278 and -0.116.\n\nExplanation:\n\nA. This statement is incorrect because the negative sign indicates that Subaru owners have a higher satisfaction rate compared to Toyota owners, not that the probability itself is negative.\n\nB. This statement is also incorrect. Confidence intervals can include zero if there is no significant difference between the two groups being compared. However, the absence of zero in this case means that we can say with 90% confidence that Subaru owners are indeed more satisfied than Toyota owners.\n\nC. While the interpretation of the negative value is correct (Subaru owners are more satisfied), the statement doesn't reflect the range of uncertainty provided by the confidence interval. It's not accurate to simply state the midpoint of the interval without acknowledging the range of possible values.\n\nD. This conclusion properly interprets the confidence interval, stating that we are 90% confident that Subaru owners are between 11.6% and 27.8% more satisfied with their drive systems than Toyota owners, based on the data from the samples."
