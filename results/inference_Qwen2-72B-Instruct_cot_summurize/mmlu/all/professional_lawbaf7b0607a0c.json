When the store manager refused to give him any money, the man shook the gun at her to scare her into cooperating. The gun fired, killing the manager. A clerk ran in from the back stockroom. The man fired a shot into the air to scare the clerk. Unbeknownst to the man, the clerk had a heart condition, and the fright caused her to suffer a fatal heart attack. Can the man properly be convicted of felony murder?\n\nA. No.\nB. Yes, but only for the death of the store manager.\nC. Yes, but only for the death of the clerk.\nD. Yes, for the deaths of both the manager and the clerk.\n"

Yes, for the deaths of both the manager and the clerk.\n\nIn this scenario, the man's actions led to two deaths during the commission of a felony (the attempted robbery). The doctrine of felony murder holds that if someone dies during the commission of a dangerous felony, such as a robbery, the perpetrator can be charged with murder even if the death was unintentional. This applies to both the store manager, who was directly killed by the man's action, and the clerk, whose death was a result of the fear and panic induced by the man's actions. Therefore, the man could potentially be convicted of felony murder for both deaths."
