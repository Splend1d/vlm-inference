The observation that hydrogen emits light at specific wavelengths when excited suggested that electrons in atoms exist at discrete energy levels. This led to the development of quantum mechanics and the Bohr model of the atom, which described the electron as existing in specific orbits around the nucleus with quantized energy levels."
