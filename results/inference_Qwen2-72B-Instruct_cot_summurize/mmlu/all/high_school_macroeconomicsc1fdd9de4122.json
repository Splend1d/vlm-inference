                    "text": "The question is about the relationship between different measures of national income and how they relate to each other when transfer payments exceed the sum of Social Security contributions, corporate taxes, and retained earnings. Let's break down the components mentioned:\n\n1. **Transfer Payments**: These are payments made by the government to individuals or institutions without receiving any goods or services in return. Examples include unemployment benefits, social security benefits, and welfare payments.\n\n2. **Social Security Contributions**: These are taxes levied on employees and employers to fund the Social Security program, which provides retirement, disability, and survivor benefits.\n\n3. **Corporate Taxes**: These are taxes imposed on the profits of corporations.\n\n4. **Retained Earnings**: This refers to the portion of a company's profit that is not distributed as dividends to shareholders but instead kept within the company for reinvestment or paying off debt.\n\nNow let's look at the options given:\n\nA. **NDP will be greater than GDP.**\n   - This statement is incorrect because NDP (Net Domestic Product) is calculated by subtracting depreciation from GDP (Gross Domestic Product). GDP is always greater than or equal to NDP.\n\nB. **NI will be greater than GDP.**\n   - This statement is also incorrect. NI (National Income) is the total income earned by the factors of production in an economy, which includes wages, rents, interest, and profits. GDP includes all final goods and services produced within a country's borders, including capital consumption allowances (depreciation). GDP is typically larger than NI because it includes indirect business taxes and subsidies, which are not part of NI.\n\nC. **PI will be greater than NI.**\n   - This statement could be correct under certain conditions. PI (Personal Income) is the sum of all income received by individuals before personal taxes are deducted. It includes wages, salaries, interest, dividends, rent, and transfer payments. If transfer payments are indeed greater than the sum of Social Security contributions, corporate taxes, and retained earnings, this would increase PI disproportionately compared to NI since NI does not directly include transfer payments.\n\nD. **DPI will be greater than PI.**\n   - This statement is incorrect. DPI (Disposable Personal Income) is PI minus personal taxes. Therefore, DPI cannot be greater than PI; it is always less because you're subtracting taxes from PI.\n\nGiven the conditions specified in the question, the most accurate answer is:\n\n**C. PI will be greater than NI.**\n\nThis is because if transfer payments significantly exceed the sum of Social Security contributions, corporate taxes, and retained earnings, the total amount of personal income (which includes these transfer payments) would be larger relative to national income, which does not include transfer payments as a component."
