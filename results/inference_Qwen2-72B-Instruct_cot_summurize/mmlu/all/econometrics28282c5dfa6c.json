The 10-day forecast of the total variance would be the sum of the individual 1-step to 10-step ahead conditional variance forecasts. However, since you're interested in the standard deviation (volatility), you need to take the square root of this total variance to get the forecasted 10-day volatility. This approach accounts for the dynamic nature of volatility captured by the GARCH model and provides an estimate of the cumulative volatility over the next 10 days."
