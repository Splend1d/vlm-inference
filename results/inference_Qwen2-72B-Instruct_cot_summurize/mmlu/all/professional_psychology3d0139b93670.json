This association can be very strong and enduring, often influencing the animal's later behaviors and preferences. Imprinting is particularly well-known in the context of ducklings and goslings following their mother, but it also occurs in other species, including humans. For example, certain aspects of human language acquisition may be influenced by a critical period early in life."
