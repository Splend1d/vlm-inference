For a natural monopoly, the government might regulate the price to ensure that this condition holds, even if it means the firm does not cover its average total costs in the short term. This ensures that resources are allocated efficiently from a societal perspective, even though the firm may not be maximizing its profits. However, over the long term, the government may aim for the price to be set at a level where the firm can cover its average total costs to ensure its sustainability."
