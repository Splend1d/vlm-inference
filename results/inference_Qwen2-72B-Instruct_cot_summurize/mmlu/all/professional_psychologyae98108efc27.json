This can lead to patients not receiving the full benefits of individual therapy, which can address issues that may not be suitable for group discussion or may require more personalized attention. Additionally, patients may also use their two therapists' words to refute group members' suggestions for behavior change (Option D), leading to confusion and mixed messages, which can hinder the therapeutic process. However, Option B and C are not typically considered as major concerns regarding concurrent individual and group therapy."
