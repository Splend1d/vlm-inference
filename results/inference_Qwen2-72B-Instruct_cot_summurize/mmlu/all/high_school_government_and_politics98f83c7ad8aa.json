This means that citizens have the right to ask the government to address their concerns or complaints, either individually or as part of a group. This right is often exercised through protests, demonstrations, and other forms of public advocacy. Options A, B, and C are actually protections guaranteed by other parts of the U.S. Constitution, specifically the Fifth, Fourteenth, and Eighth Amendments, respectively."
