Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation:\nScenario 1: Eating all the candy your mother bought for you might not be considered morally wrong by ordinary standards unless there were other factors involved, such as depriving others of food or violating an agreement about sharing. It could be seen as a lack of self-control or unhealthy behavior, but it's not inherently morally wrong.\nScenario 2: Collecting money from your church to pay your taxes could be morally neutral if the money was given to you as part of a legitimate financial arrangement or support system within the church community. However, if you misrepresented the purpose of the funds or used them for personal gain without permission, that would be morally wrong. Since no details about misrepresentation or misuse are provided, we cannot assume wrongdoing."
