Countermeasures are illegal when inter alia are disproportionate or in violation of a peremptory norm of international law (e.g. the use of force, human rights)\n\nUnder international law, countermeasures must adhere to certain principles to be considered lawful. They must be proportionate to the initial wrongful act and must not contravene obligations arising from peremptory norms (jus cogens) of international law. This includes prohibitions on the use of force and serious violations of human rights.\n\nOptions B, C, and D do not necessarily make countermeasures illegal under international law. The legality of countermeasures during an armed conflict would depend on whether they comply with the laws of war. Violating bilateral treaties could render a countermeasure unlawful if it breaches international obligations, but this is not automatically the case for all treaties. Consent of the responsible state is not required for countermeasures to be legal; rather, their legality depends on compliance with international law."
