While other hominins like Neandertals (C) had larger brains in absolute terms, when you account for body size, modern humans have the highest encephalization quotient (EQ), which measures brain size relative to what would be expected for an animal of similar body size. This higher EQ is thought to be related to our complex cognitive abilities and behaviors."
