Eukarya utilize the general transcription factors TBP (TATA-binding protein) and TFIIB in transcription, whereas Bacteria do not. At least one member of Archaea has a protein similar to TBP and a protein similar to TFIIB. Based on this observation, which of the following scenarios is most likely?\n\nA. Archaea and Eukarya diverged after their common ancestor diverged from Bacteria.\nB. Archaea and Bacteria diverged after their common ancestor diverged from Eukarya.\nC. Bacteria and Eukarya diverged after their common ancestor diverged from Archaea.\nD. Archaea, Eukarya, and Bacteria diverged simultaneously from a common ancestor.\n"

This is because these transcription factors are essential components of the transcription machinery in eukaryotes but are absent in bacteria. Therefore, the most likely scenario is that Archaea and Eukarya diverged after their common ancestor diverged from Bacteria.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Archaea and Eukarya diverged after their common ancestor diverged from Bacteria."
