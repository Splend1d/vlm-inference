Firstly, the answer is that the operation of the imperialist system bears major responsibility for African economic retardation by draining African wealth and by making it impossible to develop more rapidly the resources of the continent. Secondly, one has to deal with those who manipulate the system and those who are either agents or unwitting accomplices of the said system. The capitalists of Western Europe were the ones who actively extended their exploitation from inside Europe to cover the whole of Africa.\"\nWalter Rodney, historian, How Europe Underdeveloped Africa, 1974\nBased on your knowledge of world history, which of the following contributed LEAST to Europe's ability to penetrate Africa in the period 1750 to 1900 C.E.?\n\nA. The invention of the machine gun\nB. The invention of vaccines for tropical diseases\nC. The development of the joint-stock company\nD. The invention of steam-powered ships\n"

By the late 18th and early 19th centuries, European powers were increasingly relying on direct state control and military force to establish colonies in Africa rather than on private ventures funded through joint-stock companies.\n\nIn contrast:\n- The invention of the machine gun (A) gave Europeans a significant military advantage over African armies, facilitating conquest and control.\n- The invention of vaccines for tropical diseases (B) allowed Europeans to survive longer in Africa, where they had previously succumbed to illnesses like malaria and yellow fever.\n- The invention of steam-powered ships (D) made transportation faster and less dependent on favorable winds, enabling more efficient deployment of troops and supplies to African colonies.\n\nTherefore, while joint-stock companies were important in earlier periods of European expansion, they played a less critical role in the specific context of European penetration into Africa between 1750 and 1900 compared to military technology, medical advancements, and improvements in maritime technology."
