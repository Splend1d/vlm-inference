She obtains a simple random sample of 30 adults as they leave a Wall Street office building one weekday afternoon. All but two of the adults agree to participate in the survey. Which of the following conclusions is correct?\n\nA. Proper use of chance as evidenced by the simple random sample makes this a well-designed survey.\nB. The high response rate makes this a well-designed survey.\nC. Selection bias makes this a poorly designed survey.\nD. A voluntary response study like this gives too much emphasis to persons with strong opinions.\n"

Selection bias makes this a poorly designed survey.\n\nThe researcher's method of selecting participants (i.e., sampling people leaving a Wall Street office building) introduces selection bias because it does not represent a cross-section of the entire adult population in the U.S. Instead, it likely skews the sample towards individuals who have a particular interest or stake in the economy, such as financial workers or investors. This group may have different views on the economy compared to the general adult population, which would affect the validity of the survey results when trying to generalize them to all U.S. adults."
