Other older adults\n\nOlder adults often have a more positive view of aging and other older adults because they can relate to the experiences and changes that come with age. They may also have a better understanding of the contributions and wisdom that older individuals bring to society. In contrast, children, adolescents, and young adults might hold more negative stereotypes or fears about aging due to less personal experience with the aging process or societal influences that emphasize youth and beauty. However, this can vary greatly depending on individual experiences, cultural background, and personal values."
