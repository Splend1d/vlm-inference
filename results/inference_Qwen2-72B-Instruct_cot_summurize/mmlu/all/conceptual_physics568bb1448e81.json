This principle, formulated by Dutch scientist Christiaan Huygens in the late 17th century, posits that every point on a wavefront can be considered as the source of secondary spherical wavelets that spread out in the forward direction at the speed of light. The new wavefront is the envelope of these wavelets. This concept was developed to explain the wave behavior of light, such as diffraction and interference."
