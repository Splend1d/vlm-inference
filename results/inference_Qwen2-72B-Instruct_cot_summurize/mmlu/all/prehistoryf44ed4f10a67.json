This change in vegetation is often associated with fluctuations in atmospheric CO2 levels, which can be inferred from carbon isotope ratios found in fossilized plant material and marine sediments. The expansion of grasslands created new ecological niches and pressures that likely influenced the evolution and adaptation of early hominids, including changes in diet, locomotion, and social behavior."
