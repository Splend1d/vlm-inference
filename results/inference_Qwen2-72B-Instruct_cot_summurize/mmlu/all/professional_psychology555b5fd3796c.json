However, according to several studies in the United States, young women (ages 15-24) have higher rates of attempting suicide and seeking mental health services than other age groups of women. This is not necessarily specific to any ethnic group, but young people in general, including young ethnic minority women, might be more likely to seek help due to factors such as increased awareness, access to information, and less stigma associated with mental health issues. Therefore, among the given options, **A. Young ethnic minority women** might be the subgroup that has been shown to be the most frequent users of suicide prevention services. However, it's important to note that suicide rates and service usage can vary widely based on many factors, including cultural background, socioeconomic status, and availability of resources."
