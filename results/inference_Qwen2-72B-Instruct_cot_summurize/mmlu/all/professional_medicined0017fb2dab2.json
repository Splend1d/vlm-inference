She is sexually active and does not use any contraception. Her last menstrual period ended 6 days ago. Temperature is 38.3\u00b0C (101.0\u00b0F). Physical examination discloses abdominal tenderness in the lower quadrants bilaterally with rebound and guarding. Pelvic examination discloses leukorrhea at the cervical os and tenderness of the uterus to palpation. The adnexal areas are tender but no masses are palpable. Which of the following is the most appropriate diagnostic study?\n\nA. Cervical culture\nB. Culdocentesis\nC. Laparoscopy\nD. Serum \u03b2-hCG concentration\n"

This test will help determine if the patient is pregnant, which could explain her symptoms and guide further management. However, given the patient's symptoms of fever, abdominal pain, and pelvic tenderness, it is also important to rule out pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), which can present similarly. A cervical culture (option A) may be useful in diagnosing PID by identifying the causative organism. If the \u03b2-hCG test is negative and PID is suspected, further evaluation such as ultrasound or laparoscopy (option C) may be necessary. Culdocentesis (option B) is typically used to diagnose a ruptured ectopic pregnancy or abscess, and would not be the first-line diagnostic test in this scenario."
