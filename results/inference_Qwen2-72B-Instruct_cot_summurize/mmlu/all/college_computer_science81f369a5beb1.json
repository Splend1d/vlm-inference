Smaller pages lead to less waste due to internal fragmentation, which occurs when some space within a page is unused because it cannot accommodate an allocation request smaller than the page size.\nIII. The dominant factor in disk access time is usually seek time, which is not directly related to page length. Therefore, using longer pages can be advantageous in terms of reducing the number of disk accesses, although this might increase internal fragmentation."
