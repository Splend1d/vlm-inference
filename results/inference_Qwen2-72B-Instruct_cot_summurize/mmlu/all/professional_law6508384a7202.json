The state police attributed the violence to greed and fear at the casinos. To prevent such violence, the state legislature passes a statute prohibiting all gambling at privately owned casinos in the state. Is this law likely to be held constitutional if most casinos in the state were owned by those from out-of-state?\n\nA. Yes, because the act was expressly authorized by the state legislature.\nB. Yes, but only if the local interest in safety outweighs the burden of interstate commerce.\nC. No, because out-of-state casinos are part of interstate commerce.\nD. No, because the statute violates the due process rights of the owners of the casinos.\n"

Yes, but only if the local interest in safety outweighs the burden of interstate commerce.\n\nThe constitutionality of the statute would be evaluated under the Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution, which gives Congress the power to regulate commerce among the states. This clause has been interpreted to also limit states' abilities to pass laws that unduly burden interstate commerce. However, states have the right to regulate activities within their borders for the protection of public health, safety, and welfare (the \"police power\"). \n\nIf the state can demonstrate that the prohibition on gambling is necessary to protect public safety and that this interest outweighs any burden on interstate commerce, the law could be upheld. This would require showing that the prohibition is narrowly tailored to achieve the safety objective and does not discriminate against or excessively burden interstate commerce. If the law disproportionately affects out-of-state businesses without a sufficient justification, it might be struck down as an impermissible burden on interstate commerce. \n\nChoices A, C, and D are incorrect based on the following reasons:\n\nA. While the act was authorized by the state legislature, this alone does not determine its constitutionality. The law must also pass muster under the federal Constitution, including the Commerce Clause.\n\nC. The fact that most casinos are owned by out-of-state entities does not automatically render the law unconstitutional. The state's police powers allow for regulation of activities within its borders, even if they affect interstate commerce, provided the regulation is justified by a legitimate local purpose that is not served adequately by available alternatives with lesser burdens on commerce.\n\nD. The statute does not necessarily violate the due process rights of the owners of the casinos. Due process requires fair procedures before depriving someone of life, liberty, or property. The question of whether due process has been violated would depend on whether the state provided adequate notice and opportunity to be heard before enacting the statute, as well as whether the statute itself is rationally related to a legitimate government interest. In this case, preventing violence related to gambling could be considered a legitimate government interest."
