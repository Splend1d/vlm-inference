At trial, the court has allowed the plaintiff to introduce the deposition testimony of a witness, now deceased, that he was with the plaintiff at the time of the incident. The defendant now seeks to impeach the testimony of the witness with his 13-year-old conviction for burglary (for which he served 18 months in prison) for breaking into the home of a neighbor while she was away and taking some of her valuable jewelry. Should the court allow evidence of the conviction?\n\nA. No, because the witness did not testify at trial.\nB. No, unless the court finds, in the interests of justice, that the probative value of the conviction, supported by specific facts and circumstances, substantially outweighs its prejudicial effect.\nC. Yes, because prior convictions are probative to impeach the witness's character for truthfulness.\nD. Yes, because the crime involved an act of dishonesty.\n"

No, unless the court finds, in the interests of justice, that the probative value of the conviction, supported by specific facts and circumstances, substantially outweighs its prejudicial effect.\n\nThe Federal Rules of Evidence generally allow for the admission of evidence regarding a witness's criminal convictions for the purpose of attacking their character for truthfulness under certain conditions. However, Rule 609(b) specifically states that if more than 10 years have passed since the witness\u2019s conviction or release from confinement, whichever is later, it may only be admitted if the court determines that the probative value of the conviction substantially outweighs its prejudicial effect to the witness, and the proponent of the evidence notifies the adverse party in advance of the details of the conviction.\n\nIn this case, the witness is deceased and cannot be cross-examined at trial, but the deposition testimony is being used. The conviction is 13 years old, which means it falls under the special rule for convictions older than 10 years. The court must balance the probative value against the prejudicial effect and make a determination based on the specific facts and circumstances of the case. Therefore, the correct answer is B."
