An enhancer is a short sequence of DNA that can increase the likelihood of transcription of a particular gene by interacting with regulatory proteins. However, it's important to note that your question initially asks for a feature \"by promoter\" and then lists \"promoter\" as an option, which is a bit confusing. The promoter itself is where transcription begins, and while it interacts with regulatory proteins (like sigma factors in prokaryotes or general transcription factors in eukaryotes), it's not typically described as assisting transcription through interaction with regulatory proteins in the same way an enhancer does."
