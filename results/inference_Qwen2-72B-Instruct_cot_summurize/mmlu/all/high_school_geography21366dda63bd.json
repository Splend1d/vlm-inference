The Italian government has taken steps to protect the Italian language from what some see as contamination by foreign words, particularly from English. For example, in 2012, the Italian government passed a law requiring that all public signs and menus be written in Italian. Additionally, the Accademia della Crusca, an official body dedicated to the study and preservation of the Italian language, has been working for centuries to maintain the purity of the language. However, it's worth noting that many countries have efforts to preserve their native languages, so this is not unique to Italy."
