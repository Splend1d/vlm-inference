                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of drawing a pair from a 52-card deck when selecting 3 cards.\n\nFirstly, let's determine how many ways there are to select any 3 cards from the deck. This can be done using combinations, denoted as \\(C(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\\), where \\(n\\) is the total number of items, and \\(k\\) is the number of items to choose.\n\nThe total number of ways to select 3 cards from a 52-card deck is:\n\\[C(52, 3) = \\frac{52!}{3!(52-3)!} = \\frac{52!}{3!49!} = \\frac{52 \\times 51 \\times 50}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 22100\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of ways to form a pair. We need to choose a rank for the pair (of which there are 13), and then choose 2 out of the 4 cards of that rank. Then, we need to choose a different rank for the third card (of which there are 12 left) and pick one card from that rank.\n\nSo, the number of ways to form a pair is:\n\\[13 \\times C(4, 2) \\times 12 \\times C(4, 1)\\]\n\\[= 13 \\times \\frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} \\times 12 \\times \\frac{4!}{1!(4-1)!}\\]\n\\[= 13 \\times \\frac{4 \\times 3}{2 \\times 1} \\times 12 \\times 4\\]\n\\[= 13 \\times 6 \\times 12 \\times 4\\]\n\\[= 13 \\times 288\\]\n\\[= 3744\\]\n\nFinally, we can calculate the probability of drawing a pair by dividing the number of ways to draw a pair by the total number of ways to draw 3 cards:\n\n\\[P(\\text{pair}) = \\frac{3744}{22100}\\]\n\nSimplifying the fraction:\n\n\\[P(\\text{pair}) = \\frac{3744}{22100} = \\frac{72}{425}\\]\n\nThus, the answer is D. \\(\\frac{72}{425}\\)."
