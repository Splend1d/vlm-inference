This causes the pitch of the siren to sound higher than when the fire engine is stationary or moving away from the observer.\n\nIt's important to note that the speed of sound itself does not change (assuming constant conditions like temperature and medium), but the frequency and wavelength do change relative to the observer because of the motion of the sound source. The wavelength appears shorter to the observer when the source is approaching, which corresponds to a higher frequency."
