If the reason is valid, such as if the customer has declared bankruptcy or if the receivable is under dispute, then the auditor may need to consider alternative audit procedures to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the existence and valuation of the account receivable.\n\nOption A (Verify the account balance by inspecting the client's bank statements and cash receipt records) could be a viable alternative procedure to confirm the existence and valuation of the account receivable. However, it may not provide the same level of assurance as direct confirmation from the customer, and the auditor would need to evaluate whether additional procedures are necessary.\n\nOption B (Select at random a different account for confirmation that is approximately the same size) is not necessarily a good alternative because it does not address the specific reason why the original account was not confirmed. The auditor should focus on obtaining sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the specific account in question.\n\nOption C (Request the client's management to document the matter in the management representation letter) could be appropriate in some cases, but it does not address the auditor's responsibility to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the account receivable.\n\nOption D (Explain to the client that the request will most likely cause the auditor to disclaim an opinion) is too extreme and may not be necessary if the auditor can perform alternative audit procedures to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the account receivable.\n\nIn summary, the auditor should consider the specific reason for the client's request and determine whether alternative audit procedures can be performed to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the account receivable. Option A could be a viable alternative procedure, but the auditor should evaluate whether additional procedures are necessary."
