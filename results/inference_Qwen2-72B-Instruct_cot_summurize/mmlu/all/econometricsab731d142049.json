For an MA(q) process, the PACF will cut off after lag q, meaning it will be zero for lags greater than q.\n\niii) The PACF for an AR(p) model will be zero beyond lag p: This is true. For an AR(p) process, the PACF will tail off gradually, but theoretically, it should be zero for lags greater than p.\n\niv) The ACF and PACF will be the same at lag two for an MA(1) model: This can be true for specific cases, but it is not a general rule. In an MA(1) model, the ACF will cut off after lag 1, and the PACF will typically trail off. However, at lag 2, both could potentially be zero or very close to zero, making them equal, but this is not always the case.\n\nGiven these analyses, the correct answer is B. (i) and (iii) only. Statement (ii) is incorrect regarding the behavior of the PACF for an MA(q) model, and statement (iv) is not universally true for all MA(1) models."
