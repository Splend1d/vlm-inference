In the post-9/11 reversion to traditional security thinking, environmental security as a concept is likely to enjoy continued attention from security analysts and policymakers.\nB. Increasing evidence of the negative effects of environmental insecurity may increasingly govern national security interests and behaviour. The relevance will increase until national unilateralist initiatives are taken to retain the social organization of the nation which may have the adverse affect of increasing the prospect of conflict.\nC. National security practices are the most effective means to achieving environmental security reforms to consolidate the socio-economic organizational base of the country against threat. The state on a practical level remains the most capable body - having the monopolization over the instruments of violence, and centralization of resources - to enter into trans-national agreements for the management of environmental constraints.\nD. The impact of environmental problems seems unlikely to diminish so that the relevance of environmental security for policy will likely increase, particularly multilateral action on common security concerns to achieve forms of social organization that are ecologically sustainable. In some sense, current practices of national security are an impediment to achieving environmental security for all people.\n"

Increasing evidence of the negative effects of environmental insecurity may increasingly govern national security interests and behavior. This trend suggests that as the impacts of climate change, resource depletion, pollution, and other environmental issues become more severe and widespread, they will become central concerns for national security. This could lead to national unilateralist initiatives aimed at protecting the social organization of the nation, but such actions may also increase the likelihood of conflict with other nations.\n\nC. National security practices are likely to remain important in achieving environmental security reforms. States have the power to enter into transnational agreements and manage environmental constraints through centralized control of resources and instruments of violence. However, this approach may not be sufficient to address the global nature of environmental challenges.\n\nD. The relevance of environmental security for policy is likely to increase, particularly in terms of multilateral action on common security concerns. Achieving forms of social organization that are ecologically sustainable will require cooperation among nations, and current national security practices may impede progress toward this goal.\n\nOverall, the trend suggests that environmental security will become an increasingly significant concern for policymakers and security analysts, and that achieving environmental security will require both national and international action. The challenge will be to balance national security interests with the need for global cooperation to address environmental challenges."
