Functional immunity covers the act and incidentally also the person committing the act.\n\nFunctional immunity, also known as ratione materiae immunity, is a principle in international law that provides immunity to a state official for acts performed in their official capacity. This immunity is attached to the functions of the office and not the individual, meaning it covers the act itself and, as a consequence, the person who committed the act while acting in an official capacity. This form of immunity does not protect officials for acts performed in their personal capacity or for criminal acts that are universally condemned, such as war crimes or crimes against humanity."
