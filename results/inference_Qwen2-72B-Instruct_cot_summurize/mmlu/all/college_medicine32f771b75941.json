                    "text": "Firstly, we need to balance the chemical equation. The balanced equation for the combustion of ethane (which seems mistakenly written as C2H4 but should be C2H6) is:\n\n```\n2 C2H6 + 7 O2 -> 4 CO2 + 6 H2O\n```\n\nFrom this, we can see that 2 moles of ethane produce 4 moles of carbon dioxide.\n\nNext, let's calculate the molar mass of ethane (C2H6):\n\n- Carbon has an atomic mass of 12 amu, so two carbons have a mass of 24 amu.\n- Hydrogen has an atomic mass of 1 amu, so six hydrogens have a mass of 6 amu.\n- Therefore, the total molar mass of ethane is 30 g/mol.\n\nNow, let's determine the number of moles of ethane in 84g:\n\n```\nNumber of moles = mass / molar mass\n                 = 84g / 30 g/mol\n                 = 2.8 mol\n```\n\nGiven that 2 moles of ethane yield 4 moles of CO2, we can find out how many moles of CO2 will be produced from 2.8 moles of ethane:\n\n```\nMoles of CO2 = (2.8 mol C2H6 * 4 mol CO2) / 2 mol C2H6\n              = 5.6 mol CO2\n```\n\nFinally, let's calculate the mass of 5.6 moles of CO2:\n\n- The molar mass of CO2 is 44 g/mol (12 g/mol for carbon + 2*16 g/mol for oxygen).\n- Mass of CO2 = number of moles * molar mass\n               = 5.6 mol * 44 g/mol\n               = 246.4 g\n\nNone of the options exactly match 246.4g, but the closest one is:\n\nC. 264g\n\nHowever, based on the calculations using the information given, the correct answer should be around 246.4g, which is not listed among the options. Given the choices, C. 264g is the closest, but it's important to note that the precise calculation does not perfectly align with any of the provided options."
