All proteins that are to be catabolised are tagged with the peptide ubiquitin.\n\nThis is a key process in targeted protein degradation, where the ubiquitin-proteasome system tags proteins destined for degradation with ubiquitin molecules, marking them for destruction by the proteasome. \n\nHowever, it's important to note that while this statement is true, it does not encompass all mechanisms of protein degradation. Lysosomal degradation, for instance, can occur without ubiquitination. But among the given options, statement C is the most accurate. Statements A, B, and D are incorrect due to the variability in protein catabolism rates, differences in degradation rates among various proteins, and the existence of multiple mechanisms for protein catabolism beyond lysosomal enzymes alone."
