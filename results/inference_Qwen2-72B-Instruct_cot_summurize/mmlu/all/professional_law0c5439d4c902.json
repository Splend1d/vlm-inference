During her testimony, the victim recounted the incident and described how the defendant savagely beat her with a baseball bat. She was not asked by the prosecution whether she made any statements during the attack. After the victim was excused and left the witness stand, the prosecution called another witness to testify. The witness proposes to testify that when the beating stopped, the victim screamed, \"I'm dying. Don't let the defendant get away with this. \"Upon objection by the defendant's attorney, the witness's proffered testimony is\n\nA. admissible as an excited utterance.\nB. admissible as a dying declaration.\nC. inadmissible as hearsay not within any recognized exception.\nD. inadmissible, because the victim was not questioned about the statement before being excused.\n"

An excited utterance is a statement made while the declarant was under the stress of excitement caused by an event or condition. The statement must be made close in time to the event and must be made spontaneously without time to fabricate. Here, the statement was made immediately after the beating stopped, and it appears to have been made under the stress of the event. Therefore, the statement is likely admissible under the excited utterance exception to the hearsay rule.\n\nAnswer: A. admissible as an excited utterance."
