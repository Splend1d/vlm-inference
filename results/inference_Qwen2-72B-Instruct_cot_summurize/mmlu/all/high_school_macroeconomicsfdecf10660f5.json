Specifically, menu costs are the costs that businesses incur when they change their prices in response to economic conditions, such as inflation. These costs can include printing new menus or price lists, updating signs and advertisements, reprogramming cash registers, and training employees on the new prices. Because of these costs, businesses may not adjust their prices as frequently as they would if there were no menu costs, leading to potential misallocation of resources in the economy."
