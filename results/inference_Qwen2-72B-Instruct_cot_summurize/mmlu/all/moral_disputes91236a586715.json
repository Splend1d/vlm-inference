A utilitarian who recognizes rights will attempt to explain rights on the basis of utility by claiming that a moral right is a kind of claim that is justified by the fact that its recognition will contribute to the maximization of overall welfare. This means that recognizing and respecting certain rights will lead to the greatest good for the greatest number of people, which is the ultimate goal of utilitarianism. Option A is incorrect because it denies the existence of moral rights altogether, while option B is also incorrect because it suggests that a right can be justified even if its recognition does not contribute to maximizing overall welfare. Option D is incorrect because it includes options A and B, which are incorrect."
