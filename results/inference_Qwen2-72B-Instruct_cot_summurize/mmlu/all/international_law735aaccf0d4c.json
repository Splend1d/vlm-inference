The UN Human Rights Council scrutinises the human rights records of member states on the Council and each member state of the UN\n\nThis statement best describes the function of the UN Human Rights Council, which is responsible for promoting and protecting human rights around the world by addressing situations of human rights violations and making recommendations. It conducts the Universal Periodic Review (UPR) to assess the human rights situation in all UN Member States. However, it should be noted that the Council consists of 47 member states, not 27. Statement D is incorrect regarding the number of member states. The Council does not have the power to impose economic sanctions; that authority rests with the UN Security Council. And the Human Rights Council did not replace the Economic and Social Committee but rather the former UN Commission on Human Rights."
