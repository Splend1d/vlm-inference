Network, vulnerability, and port scanning are the primary types of scanning in the context of cybersecurity.\n\n1. **Port Scanning**: This type of scan is used to identify open ports on a server or device. It's crucial for understanding what services might be available or potentially vulnerable to attack.\n\n2. **Network Scanning**: This involves mapping out the devices on a network and identifying their operating systems, network services, and other characteristics. It's used for inventory purposes as well as security assessments.\n\n3. **Vulnerability Scanning**: This type of scan goes beyond just identifying open ports or devices; it also checks for known vulnerabilities in software and configurations that could be exploited by attackers.\n\nHowever, option C (Passive, active, and interactive) refers to different scanning methods rather than types of scans:\n\n- **Passive Scanning**: Involves listening to network traffic without sending any packets, making it less likely to be detected.\n- **Active Scanning**: Sends packets to a target to elicit responses and gather information, which can be more accurate but also more likely to trigger defensive mechanisms.\n- **Interactive Scanning**: Typically involves human interaction during the scanning process, such as guiding the scan based on real-time results.\n\nOption D (Server, client, and network) refers to different entities within a network or system that might be scanned, but these terms do not represent distinct types of scanning themselves."
