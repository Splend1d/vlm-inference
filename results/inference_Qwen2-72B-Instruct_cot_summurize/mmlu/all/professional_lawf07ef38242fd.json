The trapped hook caused her to cough blood uncontrollably, and she was rushed to a hospital for emergency surgery. The restaurant later defended the customer's lawsuit by showing that it had done everything reasonable to eliminate foreign objects from its product and there was no negligence. Will the lawsuit be dismissed and judgment entered for the restaurant?\n\nA. No, because even without negligence there is strict liability imposed for selling an unreasonably dangerous product.\nB. Yes, because a customer voluntarily assumes the foreseeable risk that fish will contain metal fish hooks.\nC. Yes, because customers are expected to know that a fish sandwich will often have foreign objects in it.\nD. No, because the seller did not post a warning that its fish might contain fish hooks.\n"

No, because even without negligence there is strict liability imposed for selling an unreasonably dangerous product.\n\nIn this scenario, the presence of a large metal object, specifically a fish hook, in the food served by the restaurant makes the product unreasonably dangerous. Under the doctrine of strict liability, a manufacturer or seller can be held liable for injuries caused by defective products without the need for the injured party to prove negligence. The fact that the restaurant took precautions to prevent such occurrences does not absolve them of responsibility if the product they sold was inherently unsafe and led to injury."
