The homeowner then gives an investor a mortgage on the property to secure a loan from the investor to the homeowner in the amount of $80,000. The friend then records his mortgage. The homeowner then gives a bank a mortgage on the property to secure a loan from the bank to the homeowner in the amount of $50,000. The investor then records. The bank then records. The homeowner lost his job and was unable to pay the mortgages on the property. In a foreclosure proceeding in which the friend, the investor, and the bank were parties, the property sold for $160,000. The recording statute in this jurisdiction provided \"unless recorded, all written instruments affecting title to land are void as to subsequent purchasers who paid value and without notice. \"What dollar amount, if any, should go to the friend?\n\nA. $0. 00\nB. $30,000. 00\nC. $80,000. 00\nD. $100,000. 00\n"

However, since the friend recorded his mortgage before the investor and the bank, the recording statute does not apply to them.\n\nThe order of priority is determined by the recording date of each mortgage. Since the friend recorded first, followed by the investor, and then the bank, the friend has the first priority lien on the property, followed by the investor and then the bank.\n\nThe friend's lien is for $100,000, so he would be entitled to receive that amount first from the sale proceeds. Since the sale proceeds are $160,000, the friend would receive the full amount of his lien, or $100,000.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. $100,000.00."
