Episodic memory\n\nEpisodic memory, which involves the recollection of specific events and experiences that occurred at a particular time and place, is most affected by aging. This type of memory includes personal experiences, such as what you ate for breakfast yesterday or where you were when a significant historical event occurred. In contrast, other types of memory, like semantic memory (knowledge about facts and concepts) and procedural memory (how to perform tasks), tend to be more resilient to the effects of aging. Sensory memory, being very short-term, is also less affected by aging."
