It is not relevant to the specific circumstances of the incident in question, which involve self-defense during an altercation. Character evidence is generally not admissible to prove conduct on a specific occasion unless it pertains to a pertinent trait related to the case, such as peacefulness or aggressiveness in a self-defense claim."
