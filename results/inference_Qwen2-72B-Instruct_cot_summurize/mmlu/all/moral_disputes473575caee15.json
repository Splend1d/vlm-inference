This argument suggests that drug laws and regulations are necessary to control the use of drugs and prevent their abuse, which would not be possible if they were freely available. The idea is that by limiting access to illegal drugs, people will be less likely to use them in harmful ways. However, Shapiro argues that this view is flawed because it ignores the fact that drug laws often create black markets and increase the availability of drugs, leading to more harm than good."
