However, we want it to be true only for ages 16 and 17, since someone who is 18 can both drive and vote.\n\nII. (age \u2265 16) AND (NOT(age \u2265 18)): This expression correctly evaluates to true only for ages 16 and 17. It checks that the age is at least 16 and not 18 or older.\n\nIII. (age < 18) AND (NOT(age < 16)): This expression also evaluates to true only for ages 16 and 17. It checks that the age is less than 18 and not less than 16."
