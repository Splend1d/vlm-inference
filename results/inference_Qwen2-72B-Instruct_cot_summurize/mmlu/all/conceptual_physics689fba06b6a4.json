Mathematically, this can be expressed as:\n\n\\[ F = k \\frac{|q_1 q_2|}{r^2} \\]\n\nwhere \\(F\\) is the force between the charges, \\(k\\) is Coulomb's constant (\\(8.9875 \\times 10^9 N m^2 C^{-2}\\)), \\(q_1\\) and \\(q_2\\) are the magnitudes of the charges, and \\(r\\) is the distance between them.\n\nIf the distance \\(r\\) is halved (i.e., the charges are placed twice as close), then the new force \\(F'\\) will be:\n\n\\[ F' = k \\frac{|q_1 q_2|}{(r/2)^2} = k \\frac{|q_1 q_2|}{r^2/4} = 4k \\frac{|q_1 q_2|}{r^2} = 4F \\]\n\nTherefore, if the distance between the charges is halved, the force becomes four times stronger."
