Chlorine has a higher dipole moment than fluorine.\nB. The intramolecular bonds in Cl2 are much weaker than those in F2.\nC.

The Cl2 electron clouds are much more polarizable than the F2 electron clouds, resulting in much stronger London forces.\n\nExplanation: The boiling point of a substance is influenced by the strength of intermolecular forces between its molecules. In both F2 and Cl2, the primary intermolecular force is the London dispersion force, which arises from the temporary fluctuations in electron density that create instantaneous dipoles. Larger and more polarizable atoms have stronger London dispersion forces because they can induce larger dipoles in neighboring molecules.\n\nChlorine atoms are larger than fluorine atoms, meaning that they have more electrons and a greater polarizability. This leads to stronger London dispersion forces between Cl2 molecules compared to F2 molecules, which results in a higher boiling point for chlorine."
