It was a US initiative designed to aid the economic recovery of Europe after World War II by giving condition-based grants to help rebuild European economies. It also aimed to prevent the spread of communism by making the economies of Western Europe more stable and thus less susceptible to Soviet influence. By providing substantial financial assistance for rebuilding war-torn regions, the program helped to embed American influence in Europe, promoting political stability and economic cooperation."
