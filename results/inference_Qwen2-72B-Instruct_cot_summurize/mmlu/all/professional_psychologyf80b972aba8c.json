This phenomenon is known as the \"bystander effect\" or \"diffusion of responsibility,\" where individuals are less likely to offer help to a victim when other people are present. When there is only one bystander, they feel more personally responsible for taking action and intervening. As the number of bystanders increases, each individual feels less responsible for helping, assuming that someone else will step in. However, it's important to note that this isn't always the case, and various factors can influence whether or not a bystander intervenes."
