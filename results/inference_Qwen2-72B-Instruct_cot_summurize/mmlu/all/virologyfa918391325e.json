Vaccines have been shown to be highly effective in preventing the spread of Ebola. For instance, the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine was found to be 100% effective in preventing Ebola in a large-scale clinical trial during the 2014-2016 West African outbreak.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that a comprehensive approach is necessary, which includes rebuilding scientific, medical, and nursing infrastructure and training staff (A), as well as ensuring early and accurate diagnosis with molecular kits (B). These measures are crucial for strengthening health systems and enabling quick response to any potential outbreaks.\n\nRapid intervention by international forces (D) can also play a role in containing outbreaks, especially in terms of logistics and security, but it is not the primary solution for prevention. The focus should be on building local capacity and resilience within affected countries to manage and prevent future outbreaks effectively.\n\nIn summary, while all options have their place in a comprehensive strategy, developing effective vaccines (C) is currently one of the most critical steps in preventing future Ebola outbreaks."
