The World Health Organization (WHO) defines severe acute malnutrition as:\n\n- Weight-for-height Z score (WHZ) < -3 standard deviations from the median of the WHO Child Growth Standards,\n- Mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) < 115 mm, or\n- Bilateral pitting oedema.\n\nNone of the options provided exactly match this definition, but option C comes closest to the WHO's criteria for diagnosing severe acute malnutrition when considering that weight-for-height Z score is a measure used instead of height-for-age Z score:\n\nC. Height-for-age Z score <-3 or weight-for-height Z score <-3 or oedema\n\nHowever, for the most accurate definition according to international standards, it would be more precise to replace \"Height-for-age Z score <-3\" with \"Weight-for-height Z score <-3\" in option C. Therefore, an improved answer would be:\n\n- Weight-for-height Z score <-3 or MUAC < 115 mm or bilateral pitting oedema. \n\nBut based on the given options, the closest one would be:\n\nC.
