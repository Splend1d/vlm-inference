The importance of the issue to a particular individual or group\n\nThis definition encompasses the idea that the salience of an issue can vary based on who you ask and what their priorities or experiences are. However, it's worth noting that A (the amount of coverage the issue receives in the major news media) also plays a significant role in determining how salient an issue might be to the general public, as media coverage can influence public perception and awareness. But since the question asks for a definition, option D is more directly related to the concept of salience."
