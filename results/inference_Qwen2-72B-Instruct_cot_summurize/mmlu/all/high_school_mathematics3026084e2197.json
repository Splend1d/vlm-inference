This is because the only prime factors that can appear in the denominator for a terminating decimal are 2 and 5.\n\nGiven that we're looking for the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $\\frac{1}{n}$ is a terminating decimal and $n$ contains the digit 9, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. 32 = $2^5$. This does not contain the digit 9.\n\nB. 64 = $2^6$. This also does not contain the digit 9.\n\nC. 4096 = $2^{12}$. This does contain the digit 9 and is of the form $2^m$, which means it will result in a terminating decimal when used as a denominator.\n\nD. 256 = $2^8$. This does not contain the digit 9.\n\nAmong these options, the smallest positive integer that fits the criteria is C. 4096. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. 4096."
