They argued that racism in schools undermined the move towards equality of opportunity for children from ethnic minorities. This perspective highlights the systemic barriers and prejudices that can impact the educational experiences and outcomes for students from different ethnic backgrounds. It suggests that despite efforts to create a level playing field, racism within educational institutions can hinder the progress towards equal opportunities for all students."
