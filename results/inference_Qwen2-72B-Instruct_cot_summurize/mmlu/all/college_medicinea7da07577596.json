This can be expressed as P1V1 = P2V2 where P1 and V1 are the initial pressure and volume, and P2 and V2 are the final pressure and volume.\n\nGiven: P1 = 200 atm, V1 = 0.1 L, P2 = 1 atm\n\nWe need to find V2.\n\nUsing Boyle's law:\n\nP1V1 = P2V2\n200 atm * 0.1 L = 1 atm * V2\nV2 = (200 atm * 0.1 L) / 1 atm\nV2 = 20 L\n\nSo the correct answer is B. 20L."
