Cognitivism.\n\nEthical relativism holds that moral standards are culturally based and therefore subject to a person's individual choice or social context. This view can lead to the conclusion that human rights are not universal but rather a product of specific cultural values. However, cognitivism in ethics asserts that moral statements express beliefs about the world and can be true or false. If human rights are considered to be objective moral truths, then they should be recognized and respected universally, regardless of cultural differences. This argument directly challenges ethical relativism by suggesting that there are some moral principles, such as human rights, that transcend cultural boundaries and should be upheld universally."
