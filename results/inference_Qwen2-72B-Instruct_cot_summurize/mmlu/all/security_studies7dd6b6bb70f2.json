Social dominance of men over women that results from the designation of 'masculine' characteristics as more valued than 'feminine' characteristics.\n\nHegemonic masculinity refers to the culturally idealized form of masculinity that is dominant over other masculinities and femininities, often resulting in the social, political, and economic subordination of women and other non-dominant masculinities. It is not about inherent promotions or the acknowledgment of gender diversity, but rather about power dynamics and cultural norms that privilege certain traits and behaviors traditionally associated with masculinity."
