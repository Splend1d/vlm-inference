The prosecution presented a professor of art history to authenticate each piece. The defense objected on the basis that the museum curator where the paintings were housed had to identify if these were in fact the paintings that were stolen. Assuming that others will testify to the fact of the burglary, is the court likely to reject this witness as being qualified to authenticate the paintings in question, and why or why not?\n\nA. Yes, because art works and other physical evidence must be authenticated by their official custodian.\nB. Yes, because an outside person may be able to partially authenticate the painting but he can't say whether it is the one that was in the museum or that was stolen.\nC. No, granting the objection will simply waste the court's time if the court has to bring in the museum curator and go through hoops to authenticate the paintings.\nD. No, because the authentication can be accomplished in several different ways that will verify that it is the genuine piece of art in question.\n"

No, because the authentication can be accomplished in several different ways that will verify that it is the genuine piece of art in question.\n\nThe court is unlikely to reject the witness based solely on the argument that only the museum curator can authenticate the paintings. A professor of art history with expertise in Picasso's work would be considered a qualified expert to authenticate the paintings. Authentication can be achieved through various means, such as examining the style, medium, provenance, and other characteristics of the artwork. Additionally, if necessary, the prosecution can call the museum curator to testify about the specific paintings that were stolen and any unique identifying features that connect them to the recovered pieces. However, the testimony of the art history professor alone could potentially be sufficient to authenticate the artworks."
