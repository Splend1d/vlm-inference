(1/3) AU.\n\nWhile the exact average distance from Mercury to the Sun is about 0.387 AU, among the given options, (1/3) AU is the closest approximation. The relationship between a planet's orbital period and its average distance from the Sun can be described by Kepler's third law, which states that the square of the orbital period of a planet is directly proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit. Since Mercury's orbital period is about 1/5th that of Earth, its distance from the Sun must be less than 1 AU, but not as low as the other options provided."
