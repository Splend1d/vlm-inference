During this process, introns (non-coding regions) are removed from the pre-mRNA (preRNA), while exons (coding regions) are joined together. Additionally, a 5\u2032 cap is added to the 5\u2032 end of the molecule, and a poly-A tail is added to the 3\u2032 end, both modifications occurring before the mature mRNA exits the nucleus and is transported to the cytoplasm for protein synthesis."
