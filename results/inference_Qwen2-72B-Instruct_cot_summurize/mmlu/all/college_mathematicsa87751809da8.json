                    "text": "To find how many positive numbers \\(x\\) satisfy the equation \\(\\cos(97x) = x\\), we need to analyze the behavior of both sides of the equation and their possible intersections.\n\nThe left side of the equation, \\(\\cos(97x)\\), is periodic with a period of \\(\\frac{2\\pi}{97}\\). The cosine function oscillates between -1 and 1, so it can only be equal to \\(x\\) if \\(0 \\leq x \\leq 1\\).\n\nThe right side of the equation, \\(x\\), is a linear function that increases from 0 to infinity as \\(x\\) goes from 0 to infinity.\n\nNow, let's consider the intervals where these functions could possibly intersect:\n\n1. **On the interval \\([0, 1]\\):** Here, both functions are defined and the cosine function oscillates between -1 and 1. Since the cosine function starts at 1 (at \\(x=0\\)) and decreases to -1 before increasing back to 1 periodically, and since \\(x\\) increases linearly from 0 to 1, there will be intersections whenever \\(\\cos(97x)\\) crosses \\(y=x\\) from above or below.\n\n2. **Outside the interval \\([0, 1]\\):** For \\(x > 1\\), the right-hand side, \\(x\\), grows without bound while the left-hand side, \\(\\cos(97x)\\), stays within \\([-1, 1]\\). Therefore, there can be no intersections for \\(x > 1\\).\n\nTo determine the number of intersections, we look at the periods of \\(\\cos(97x)\\) over the interval \\([0, 1]\\):\n\n- The first complete cycle of \\(\\cos(97x)\\) occurs at \\(\\frac{2\\pi}{97}\\).\n- The last complete cycle that intersects with the interval \\([0, 1]\\) is when \\(97x = 2\\pi n\\), where \\(n\\) is an integer, and this must be less than \\(97\\) because \\(x < 1\\). So, \\(n < 97/2\\).\n\nSince \\(\\cos(97x)\\) oscillates between -1 and 1 in each cycle, and \\(x\\) increases linearly from 0 to 1, there are two intersections per cycle (one where \\(\\cos(97x)\\) goes from above \\(x\\) to below \\(x\\), and one where it goes from below \\(x\\) to above \\(x\\)).\n\nThus, the total number of intersections is twice the number of complete cycles of \\(\\cos(97x)\\) over the interval \\([0, 1]\\), which is:\n\n\\[2 \\times \\left\\lfloor\\frac{97}{2\\pi}\\right\\rfloor\\]\n\nSince \\(\\pi \\approx 3.14\\), we have:\n\n\\[\\left\\lfloor\\frac{97}{2\\pi}\\right\\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor\\frac{97}{6.28}\\right\\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor15.44\\right\\rfloor = 15\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of intersections, and thus solutions, is:\n\n\\[2 \\times 15 = 30\\]\n\nHowever, we must also consider the initial point of intersection at \\(x=0\\) (where \\(\\cos(0) = 1\\)), which adds one more solution, making the total number of solutions:\n\n\\[30 + 1 = 31\\]\n\nSo, the correct answer is **C. 31**."
