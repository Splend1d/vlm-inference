The action could be perceived as an attempt at kindness, albeit misguided.\n\nIn Scenario 2, keeping a wallet that you find without attempting to return it to its rightful owner is considered morally wrong. The right course of action would be to try to find the owner or turn it into local authorities or lost and found."
