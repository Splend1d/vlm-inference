However, it's important to note that having a family member with schizophrenia does not guarantee that one will develop the condition.\n\nAccording to various studies and sources, if a person has a first-degree relative with schizophrenia, their risk of also developing schizophrenia is approximately 6-13%, which is higher than the general population risk of around 1%. This means the probability is much closer to:\n\nA. 0.01 (or 1%)\n\nBut since 1% is quite low and the options provided don't include a precise value in this range, the closest option would be:\n\nA. 0.01\n\nHowever, none of the provided options accurately reflects the actual statistical risk based on current scientific understanding. The correct answer would likely fall between A and B, but since the exact percentage isn't listed, and given the options provided, A is the closest to the actual risk."
