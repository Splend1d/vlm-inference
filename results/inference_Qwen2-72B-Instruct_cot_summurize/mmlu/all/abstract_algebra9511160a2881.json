Since A and B are non-singular, their product AB will also be non-singular (i.e., have a non-zero determinant), so AB is also in G.\n\n2. **Associativity**: Matrix multiplication is associative: for any three matrices A, B, C in G, we have (AB)C = A(BC).\n\n3. **Identity**: The n x n identity matrix I, which has 1s on the diagonal and 0s elsewhere, is in G since it is non-singular and has rational entries. For any matrix A in G, AI = IA = A.\n\n4. **Invertibility**: Every non-singular matrix has an inverse, which is also a non-singular matrix with rational entries. So, for every A in G, there exists an A^(-1) in G such that AA^(-1) = A^(-1)A = I.\n\nHowever, this group is not necessarily abelian because matrix multiplication is generally not commutative. That is, for two matrices A and B in G, AB may not equal BA. Therefore, G is not an abelian group.\n\nAlso, the group G is infinite because there are infinitely many rational numbers, and thus infinitely many possible non-singular matrices with rational entries.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\n**C. Infinite, non-abelian group**."
