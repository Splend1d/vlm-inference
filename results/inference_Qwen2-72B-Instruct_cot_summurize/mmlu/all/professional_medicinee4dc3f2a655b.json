Four days ago, he returned from a cruise to the Caribbean, during which he swam in the ship\u2019s pool and used the hot tub. He appears well. His vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows the findings in the photograph. The infectious agent causing these findings most likely began to proliferate in which of the following locations?\n\nA. Apocrine gland\nB. Dermis\nC. Eccrine gland\nD. Hair follicle\n"

This condition is caused by the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which can colonize improperly maintained pools and hot tubs.\n\nPseudomonas folliculitis typically presents as red, itchy bumps or pustules that can appear on areas of the body that were exposed to contaminated water. These lesions are usually found around hair follicles, suggesting that the infectious agent began to proliferate in the hair follicles.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Hair follicle"
