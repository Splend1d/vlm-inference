                    "text": "When a satellite in circular orbit receives an impulse that increases its speed without changing its direction at a specific point (P), it will enter into an elliptical orbit. This is because the increased speed at that point causes the satellite to move faster than its original orbital velocity, which was perfectly balanced for a circular path around Earth.\n\nIn an elliptical orbit, there are two points of interest: the perigee, which is the closest point to the Earth, and the apogee, which is the farthest point from the Earth. The point where the impulse was applied (P) will become either the perigee or the apogee depending on whether the speed increase was sufficient to cause the satellite to move away from or closer to the Earth at that point.\n\nSince the satellite's speed increased at point P, this means that it would have more kinetic energy at that point compared to what it needs to maintain its previous circular orbit. As a result, the satellite will move farther away from the Earth after point P, making point P the closest approach to the Earth (the perigee).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. The satellite now orbits in an ellipse, with P as the closest approach to Earth."
