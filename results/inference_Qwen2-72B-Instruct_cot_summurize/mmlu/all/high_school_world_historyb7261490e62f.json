Up on the Huanacavelica range there are 3,000 or 4,000 Indians working in the mercury mine, with picks and hammers, breaking up the ore. And when they have filled up their little sacks, the poor fellows, loaded down, climb up those ladders and rigging, so distressing that a man can hardly get up them. That is the way they work in this mine, with many lights and the loud noise of the pounding and great confusion. Nor is that the greatest evil; that is due to thievish and undisciplined superintendents. According to His Majesty's warrant, the mine owners at Potos\u00ed have a right to the mita of 13,300 Indians. These mita Indians earn each day 4 reals. Besides these there are others not under obligation, who hire themselves out voluntarily: these each get from 12 to 16 reals, and some up to 24, according to how well they wield their picks or their reputation for knowing how to get the ore out.\nAntonio Vasquez de Espinosa, report on mining in Huanacavelica and Potos\u00ed, 1620s\nThe third principal reason the local Yakut and Tungus natives are ruined is that from the time they first came under Russian control, they have been forced to pay yasak tribute. Some have paid in sables, others in red foxes, still others in cash. At first there were plenty of furbearing animals there, but now there are no sables and not many foxes in those lands, from the shores of the Arctic Ocean all the way south to the great Lena River. Moreover, almost half the natives cannot hunt because they no longer have horses, many of which have been pawned to the yasak collectors.\nHeinrich von F\u00fcch, \"On the Treatment of Natives in Northeast Siberia,\" 1744\nBoth passages are best seen in the context of which of the following broad developments?\n\nA. Emerging systems of coerced labor\nB. The expansion of chattel slavery\nC. Increased reliance on prison-camp workforces\nD. Colonization of overseas territories by joint-stock companies\n"

Emerging systems of coerced labor\n\nBoth passages describe situations where indigenous populations are being forced to work under harsh conditions for the benefit of colonial powers. In the first passage, Antonio Vasquez de Espinosa details the use of the mita system, where indigenous people are compelled to work in mercury mines in the Spanish colonies in South America. In the second passage, Heinrich von F\u00fcch discusses the exploitation of native populations in Siberia through the collection of yasak tribute, a form of taxation paid in furs that led to overhunting and economic hardship for the indigenous peoples. Both examples illustrate the development and implementation of coerced labor systems during the era of European colonial expansion."
