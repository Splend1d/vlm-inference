                    "text": "The probability of an individual carrying two specific alleles, each with a frequency of 0.2, can be calculated using the Hardy-Weinberg principle. The frequency of homozygotes for any given allele is p^2 (where p is the frequency of the allele). In this case, the probability of an individual being homozygous for either of these alleles would be 0.2 * 0.2 = 0.04.\n\nHowever, since the question asks about the likelihood of an individual carrying two specific alleles, not necessarily being homozygous for them, we need to consider the heterozygous state as well. The frequency of heterozygotes for two different alleles (p and q) is 2pq. Since both alleles have the same frequency (0.2), we calculate the probability of being heterozygous for these two alleles as 2 * 0.2 * 0.2 = 0.08.\n\nBut remember, we want the total probability of an individual having either two copies of one allele or one copy of each, so we add the probabilities together: 0.04 (probability of being homozygous for one allele) + 0.08 (probability of being heterozygous for the two alleles) = 0.12.\n\nHowever, none of the provided options match 0.12. It seems there might be a misunderstanding in the question's intent or in the options provided. If the question is asking specifically about the probability of being heterozygous for two specific alleles, then the correct answer from the provided options would be:\n\nC. 0.08\n\nThis assumes that \"carrying two specific alleles\" means being heterozygous for those alleles."
