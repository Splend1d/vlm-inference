It may be an inconvenience for the roommates, but it is not a moral failing.\n\nIn Scenario 2, taking pictures of women walking on a runway could be seen as part of documenting a public event, such as a fashion show, and is not inherently morally wrong. However, if the photographer was taking pictures in a context where the women had an expectation of privacy or without their consent in a non-public setting, then it could be considered morally wrong. Since no such context is provided, we cannot assume it's morally wrong based on the information given. If the scenario involved a public fashion show where photography is expected, then it would not be considered morally wrong."
