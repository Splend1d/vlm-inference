They were not members of a recognized religious organization; instead, they requested an exemption based on their personal spiritual beliefs against immunization. Will the courts declare the existing exemption to be invalid?\n\nA. Yes, it will be invalidated because it cannot override the state's interest in having its school students immunized.\nB. No, it will not be invalidated \u0080\u0093 it is a fair exemption that the state has chosen to provide for religious groups.\nC. Yes, it will be invalidated because when an exemption is provided it may not unfairly discriminate and favor one type of religion or religious belief over another.\nD. No, it won't be invalidated because it is a valid exercise of the state's right to protect the privacy of its citizens.\n"

Yes, it will be invalidated because when an exemption is provided it may not unfairly discriminate and favor one type of religion or religious belief over another.\n\nThe Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment requires that states must treat all individuals equally under the law. By providing an exemption only to members of recognized religious organizations, Public Health Law 2122(a) could be seen as discriminating against individuals who hold sincere religious beliefs but are not part of a formal religious organization. This could potentially violate the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, which prohibits the government from making any law respecting an establishment of religion, as well as the Free Exercise Clause, which protects the free exercise of religion. The courts might rule that the exemption must be broadened to include those with sincerely held personal spiritual beliefs against immunization to avoid such discrimination."
