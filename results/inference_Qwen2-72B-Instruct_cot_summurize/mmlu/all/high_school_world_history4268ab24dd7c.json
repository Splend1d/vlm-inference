Instead, he continued the practice of serfdom, which was a form of feudalism where peasants were bound to the land and owned by their lords. This system provided the necessary labor for the large agricultural estates and helped to maintain social order. Peter also believed in a strong central government and did not support decentralization of power. While he did open up Russia to the outside world and engage in international trade and diplomacy, he did not adopt the civil and political rights of individual men embodied in constitutions, bills of rights, and parliaments that he observed in Protestant Europe."
