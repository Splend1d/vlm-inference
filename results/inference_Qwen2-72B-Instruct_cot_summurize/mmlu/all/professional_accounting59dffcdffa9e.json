This means that the $800,000 cost would be divided by 20 years, resulting in a $40,000 annual depreciation expense. However, since the question seems to imply that they do not capitalize the asset and instead expense it immediately (which is what happens under the modified approach where capital assets are not recorded), but then also asks for an expense related to depreciation, we can infer that it's looking for the annual equivalent if they were to depreciate it.\n\nSo, the annual depreciation expense (which is the equivalent of the expense reported in the statement of activities) would be $40,000 per year ($800,000 / 20 years). But given the options provided, and assuming the question meant to ask for the annual depreciation expense rather than the total cost expensed in the current year, the closest answer would be B. $20,000. However, this seems to be a typo or error in the options provided since based on the information given, the correct expense should be $40,000. If the options were to include $40,000, that would be the correct choice. Given the options, none accurately reflects the calculation, but following the logic of the question, B. $20,000 is not the mathematically correct answer based on the information provided."
