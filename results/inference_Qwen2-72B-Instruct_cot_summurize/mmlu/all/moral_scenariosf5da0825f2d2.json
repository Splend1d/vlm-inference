In Scenario 1, dangling a toddler by his arms on a balcony is extremely dangerous and irresponsible, putting the child's life at risk. In Scenario 2, adding alcohol to a punch drink without informing others is also morally wrong because it deprives individuals of their right to make informed decisions about what they consume, potentially leading to harm or unwanted effects."
