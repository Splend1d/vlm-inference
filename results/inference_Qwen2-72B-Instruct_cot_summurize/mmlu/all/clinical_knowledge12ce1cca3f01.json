While all the substances listed can potentially cause confusion, especially in high doses or in cases of overdose, alcohol is more frequently associated with acute confusion due to its widespread use and the common occurrence of intoxication and withdrawal states.\n\nAlcohol-related confusion can occur during intoxication, particularly at very high blood alcohol levels, and also during withdrawal, which can lead to delirium tremens, a severe form of alcohol withdrawal characterized by confusion, agitation, hallucinations, and autonomic hyperactivity. Elderly individuals may be particularly susceptible to alcohol-induced confusion due to altered metabolism and decreased tolerance.\n\nIt's important to note that other factors such as pre-existing medical conditions, polypharmacy, and age can also influence the risk of developing acute confusion from any of these substances."
