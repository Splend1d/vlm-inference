He defines law as \"the command of the sovereign backed by sanctions\". Austin's theory is known as legal positivism which separates law and morality, stating that the existence of a law is one thing; its merit or demerit is another. Hence, according to him, the science of jurisprudence should not be concerned with whether laws are just or unjust, but simply with their existence and operation."
