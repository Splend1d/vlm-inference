Ben Bitdiddle notes that NaCl uses Intel x86 segmentation to ensure that the sandboxed module does not read or write memory outside its own data area, and does not execute instructions outside its own code. Ben thinks that with these restrictions alone, executing the sandboxed module must be safe; that is, he thinks validation is not needed. Ben is wrong. Circle the types of x86 machine instructions that the validator always forbids in sandboxed code. Please ignore trampoline and springboard code.\n\nA. all instructions that modify segment state\nB. all loads or stores to addresses that are not 0 mod 32\nC. all indirect loads or stores (via an address in a register or variable)\nD. all indirect jumps (via an address in a register or variable)\n"

Among the options provided:\n\nA. All instructions that modify segment state - This is correct. The validator forbids instructions like `LDS`, `LES`, `LFS`, etc., which can change the segment registers. Since NaCl relies on segmentation for its security model, allowing such instructions could potentially break the sandbox.\n\nC. All indirect loads or stores (via an address in a register or variable) - This is also correct. Indirect memory accesses can lead to arbitrary memory access if not properly validated, which would defeat the purpose of the sandbox.\n\nD. All indirect jumps (via an address in a register or variable) - This is correct as well. Indirect jumps can lead to control flow hijacking, allowing an attacker to jump to arbitrary code within the sandbox or potentially escape it.\n\nOption B, \"all loads or stores to addresses that are not 0 mod 32,\" is not something that the validator would typically forbid. Memory accesses do not need to align to specific boundaries unless specified by the architecture or the system's memory management (e.g., page boundaries). Therefore, this option is not related to the types of instructions that the validator would forbid for safety reasons.\n\nSo, the correct answers are:\n\nA. All instructions that modify segment state\nC. All indirect loads or stores (via an address in a register or variable)\nD. All indirect jumps (via an address in a register or variable)"
