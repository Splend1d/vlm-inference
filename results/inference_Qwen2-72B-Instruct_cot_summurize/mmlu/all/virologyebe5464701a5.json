Inability to vaccinate in some countries.\n\nWhile all of the factors you mentioned have played some role in the ongoing struggle against polio, the primary reason for its continued existence is the inability to vaccinate every child in certain parts of the world. This is often due to conflict, poor infrastructure, and lack of access in remote areas. As long as even a single child remains unvaccinated, the virus can continue to circulate and infect others.\n\nPolio vaccines are generally safe and effective, so B (poor quality or unsafe vaccines) is not a significant factor preventing eradication. Genetic variation (C) does play a role, as there are different strains of the poliovirus, but vaccines have been developed that protect against all three strains. Expense (D) is also a challenge, but international efforts like the Global Polio Eradication Initiative have significantly reduced the cost of vaccination campaigns. However, the cost can still be prohibitive in very poor regions, contributing to the problem of vaccine access."
