Relaxation oscillator.\n\nRelaxation oscillators are relatively easy to fabricate in a monolithic integrated circuit (IC) because they do not require any precise frequency-determining components such as inductors or crystals, which can be difficult to integrate into an IC due to size and tolerance issues. Relaxation oscillators use the charging and discharging of capacitors through resistors to generate a non-sinusoidal waveform, typically a square wave or a sawtooth wave. This makes them well-suited for digital circuits where the exact frequency is not critical, but a stable periodic signal is needed."
