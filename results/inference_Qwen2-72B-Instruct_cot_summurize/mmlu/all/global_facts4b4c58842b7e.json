The exact figure isn't one of the options you've provided. In fact, it was around 4%, which is significantly lower than any of the options given (A. 26%, B. 46%, C. 66%, D. 86%). However, since none of the provided options match the actual data, based on the choices you have, none of them would be correct. It's important to note that perceptions of corruption and actual experiences can vary widely, and this statistic reflects only those who reported paying a bribe among survey respondents."
