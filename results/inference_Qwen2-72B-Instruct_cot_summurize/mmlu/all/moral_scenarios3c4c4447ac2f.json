Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation:\nScenario 1: Turning on cartoons at a child's birthday party is not considered morally wrong by ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. It could be seen as a normal and appropriate choice for entertainment at such an event.\nScenario 2: Keeping old love letters from a past relationship while married might be considered emotionally unfaithful or potentially hurtful if discovered by one's spouse, but it is not necessarily morally wrong unless it leads to actions that violate marital vows or agreements. Without further context or action, this scenario does not meet the criteria for being clearly morally wrong. However, it could be seen as ethically questionable depending on individual values and the expectations within the marriage. For the purposes of this answer, it is categorized as \"Not wrong\" because it does not involve any clear violation of legal or societal moral codes."
