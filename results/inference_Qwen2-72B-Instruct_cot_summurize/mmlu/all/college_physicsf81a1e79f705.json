The uncertainty in the kinetic energy will then depend solely on the uncertainty in the velocity. Since the uncertainty in the velocity is given as 10%, we need to find how this percentage uncertainty affects the kinetic energy.\n\nThe differential of the kinetic energy with respect to velocity is:\n\n\\[ dK = mvdv \\]\n\nDividing both sides by \\(K\\), we get the relative uncertainty in kinetic energy:\n\n\\[ \\frac{dK}{K} = \\frac{mvdv}{\\frac{1}{2}mv^2} = 2\\frac{dv}{v} \\]\n\nGiven that \\(\\frac{dv}{v}\\) is the relative uncertainty in velocity (\\(10\\%\\)), the relative uncertainty in kinetic energy is twice that because of the square term in the kinetic energy formula:\n\n\\[ \\frac{dK}{K} = 2 \\times 10\\% = 20\\% \\]\n\nTherefore, the uncertainty in the kinetic energy of the ball is 20%.\n\nThe correct answer is D. 20%."
