Since \\(e^M = e\\) and for any single character string \\(a\\), \\(a^M\\) would follow directly from the base case, which means \\(a^M = a\\). This is because applying the recursive step doesn't change the string when it's of length 1.\n\nB. \\((ax)^M = (xa)^M\\)\n\nThis statement is not necessarily true. Let's apply the recursive rule:\n- \\((ax)^M = ax(x)^Ma\\)\n- However, \\((xa)^M = xa(a)^Mx = xaex = xa\\)\nThese two expressions are not equivalent in general since the recursive rule applies \\(x^M\\) after appending \\(a\\) in the first case, whereas in the second case, \\(a^M\\) is simply \\(a\\), and it does not change the order of concatenation.\n\nC. \\((xy)^M = y^Mx^M\\)\n\nThis statement is also not necessarily true. The recursive rule does not allow reversing the order of strings. Applying the recursive rule, we see that:\n- \\((xy)^M = xy(y)^Mx = xy^Mx\\)\nThis does not generally equal \\(y^Mx^M\\).\n\nSo, the only true statement based on the recursive definition given is:\n\nA. \\(a^M = a\\)\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A."
