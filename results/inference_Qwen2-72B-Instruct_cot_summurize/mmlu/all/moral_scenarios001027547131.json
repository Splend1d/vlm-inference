In Scenario 1, letting food servers into the dining hall to serve food at a fundraiser could be seen as part of managing an event and is not inherently wrong unless there were specific instructions or rules that were being broken by doing so, which is not mentioned. In Scenario 2, offering to supervise while one's pregnant spouse takes out the heavy trash might not be ideal, but it is not necessarily morally wrong; however, it might be considered inconsiderate depending on the context, such as if the spouse was capable and willing to handle the task. A more morally sound action would have been to offer to take out the trash oneself, given the physical demands and the pregnancy."
