This allows it to generate inputs that specifically target certain paths or conditions within the code, making it more likely to explore paths covering every line of code compared to other styles of fuzzers. Whitebox fuzzers can use techniques like symbolic execution and concolic testing to systematically explore the program's logic.\n\nGenerational (also known as grammar-based) and mutation-based fuzzers typically do not have visibility into the program's internal structure. They generate or mutate inputs based on predefined models or by randomly altering existing inputs, respectively. While they can be effective at finding certain types of bugs, they may not as efficiently cover every line of code due to their lack of insight into the program's control flow.\n\nBlackbox fuzzing refers to a style where the fuzzer does not require any information about the internal workings of the software under test, similar to generational and mutation-based approaches, and thus may also not cover every line of code as comprehensively as whitebox fuzzing."
