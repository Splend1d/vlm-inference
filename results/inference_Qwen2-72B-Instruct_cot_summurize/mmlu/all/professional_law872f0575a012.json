This amount was the fair market value of the work to be performed. The landscaper performed the work for four months but was then offered another job for $500 per month and, after notifying the homeowner, stopped doing the promised work and took the other job. The homeowner refused to pay the landscaper anything. The homeowner could have hired a comparable landscaper to complete the work for $300 per month. In a lawsuit between the landscaper and the homeowner, what is the likely result?\n\nA. The homeowner will recover $600, which is the cost of completing the work at prevailing market rates.\nB. The homeowner will recover $400, which constitutes the unjust enrichment of the landscaper.\nC. The landscaper will recover $1,200 for the work done before the breach.\nD. Neither the landscaper nor the homeowner will recover, because neither has suffered any loss.\n"

Since the landscaper breached the contract by stopping the work before the agreed-upon six months, he cannot claim the full amount for the remaining two months. However, he may be entitled to payment for the four months of service he did provide.\n\nThe homeowner, on the other hand, can seek damages for the breach of contract if they incurred additional costs to hire someone else to complete the work or if there were other losses due to the breach. However, since the homeowner could have hired a comparable landscaper for the same rate ($300 per month), there is no additional cost incurred.\n\nGiven these circumstances, the most likely outcome would be:\n\nE. A variation not listed among the options: The landscaper will recover $1,200 for the four months of work completed, and the homeowner will not be required to pay for the two months of uncompleted work. There would be no recovery for the homeowner since they could have hired a replacement landscaper for the same price, thus avoiding any damages.\n\nThis result is based on the principle of compensation for services actually provided and the concept of mitigating damages (the homeowner taking reasonable steps to minimize their losses). It ensures that the homeowner does not overpay for the services and that the landscaper is compensated for the work they did perform."
