The person did not have enough money to buy a present and chose to spend their money on themselves, which can be seen as a personal choice rather than a moral failing.\n\nIn scenario 2, the action is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards. Voting should be based on personal beliefs and what is best for society, not influenced by personal gain such as being paid money. This action undermines the democratic process and is considered bribery or corruption."
