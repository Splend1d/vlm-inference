The temperature of the CMB is inversely proportional to the scale factor of the universe's expansion. This means that when the temperature was higher, the universe was smaller and more dense.\n\nIf we consider a time when the temperature was 12 K, this is four times higher than it is now (12 K / 3 K = 4). Therefore, the scale factor at that time would be 1/4 of what it is today because the temperature is inversely proportional to the scale factor.\n\nThis implies that the distance between typical objects in the universe, like galaxies, was also one-fourth of what it is today because the expansion of the universe affects these intergalactic distances.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\nA. one-quarter as distant as they are today."
