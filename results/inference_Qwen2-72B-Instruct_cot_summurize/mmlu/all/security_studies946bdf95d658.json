A culture characterized by friendship, where force and violence is eschewed in favour of cooperation in matters of security.\n\nIn a Lockean culture, states view each other as friends and are able to cooperate with one another, reducing the likelihood of conflict and increasing the potential for peaceful resolution of disputes. This culture is named after the philosopher John Locke, who believed that in a state of nature, people could live together in peace and harmony without a common superior. In international relations, this translates into a system where states can rely on each other for help and work together to maintain stability and security."
