It is misleading to pigeon-hole judges in this way.\n\nLlewellyn's distinction between grand and formal styles suggests that some judges engage in a more expansive, policy-oriented approach (grand style) while others adhere strictly to precedent and legal rules (formal style). However, this dichotomy oversimplifies the complex nature of judicial decision-making. In reality, judges often employ elements of both styles in their reasoning, and the distinction may not accurately capture the nuances of their thought processes. Additionally, the use of one style over another may depend on the specific context or case at hand, rather than being a consistent feature of a judge's overall approach."
