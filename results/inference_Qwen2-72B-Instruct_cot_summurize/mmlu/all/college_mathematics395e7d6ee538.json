In metric spaces, which is where completeness is usually discussed, \"complete\" means that every Cauchy sequence converges to a point within the space.\n\nA. Not every compact space is complete. Compactness is a topological property, while completeness is a metric property. A space can be compact without being complete if it is not also a metric space, or even if it is a metric space but not all Cauchy sequences converge. However, in metric spaces, it's true that every compact space is complete, because in a metric space, compactness implies sequential compactness, which in turn implies completeness.\n\nB. Not every complete space is compact. Completeness does not imply compactness. For example, the real numbers with the standard metric form a complete space, but they are not compact. The space must also be totally bounded for it to be compact.\n\nTherefore, neither statement A nor B is universally true. In specific cases, like in metric spaces, compactness does imply completeness, but completeness does not imply compactness. So, the correct answer is C. Neither (a) nor (b). However, it's important to note that in metric spaces, compactness does imply completeness, making the nuanced answer more complex than simply choosing option C. But given the options, C is the best choice as presented."
