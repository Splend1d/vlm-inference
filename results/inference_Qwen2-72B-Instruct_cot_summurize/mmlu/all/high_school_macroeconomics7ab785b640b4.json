Cyclical unemployment occurs when there are fluctuations in the business cycle, such as during a recession. At the natural rate, the economy is considered to be at full employment, although this does not mean 0% unemployment, but rather a stable level where the unemployment rate is not affected by short-term economic conditions. The other options do not necessarily follow from operating at the natural rate of unemployment:\n\nB. The inflation rate being zero is not guaranteed; the natural rate of unemployment is compatible with a positive but stable inflation rate.\n\nC. Structural unemployment can still exist at the natural rate of unemployment because it is due to factors like skill mismatches or geographic immobility.\n\nD. Experiencing a recession is not consistent with being at the natural rate of unemployment, as recessions are typically associated with higher than natural rates of unemployment due to cyclical factors."
