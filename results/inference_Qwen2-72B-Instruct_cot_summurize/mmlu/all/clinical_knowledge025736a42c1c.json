Schober's test is designed to quantify the flexion of the lumbar spine\n\nSchober's test is indeed used to measure the flexibility of the lumbar spine by assessing how far two points on the back move apart when a person bends forward from the waist with their knees straight.\n\nRegarding the other options:\n\nA. Back pain is actually a very common complaint, affecting a large percentage of the population at some point in their lives.\n\nC. Ankylosing spondylitis is a form of arthritis that causes inflammation and stiffness in the spine, often leading to decreased mobility rather than hypermobility.\n\nD. Pregnancy can cause an increase in the curvature of the lower back (lordosis) due to changes in body weight distribution and hormonal effects, rather than a loss of lordosis. However, this varies among individuals and depends on factors such as posture and abdominal muscle strength."
