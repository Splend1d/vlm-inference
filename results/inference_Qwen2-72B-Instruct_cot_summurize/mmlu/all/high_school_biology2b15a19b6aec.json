A and C only\n\nWhen more loci are fixed in a population, it means that there is less genetic variation at those loci because one allele has become predominant or exclusive at each of those sites. This directly leads to a reduction in nucleotide variability (A) since fewer different nucleotide sequences are present. Additionally, with fewer alleles present at each locus, the average heterozygosity (C) also decreases as individuals are more likely to be homozygous for the predominant allele(s). Genetic polyploidy (B), which refers to the presence of multiple sets of chromosomes in a cell, is not directly related to the fixation of alleles at loci."
