As the number of sprints increases, the demand for energy also increases, leading to a greater reliance on anaerobic pathways. This can result in an accumulation of metabolic byproducts like lactate, which can lower the muscle pH but typically not below 6.0. Blood glucose levels may be used during exercise, but they do not necessarily fall below 3 mmol/L unless the athlete is in a state of prolonged fasting or has depleted glycogen stores. Aerobic metabolism does contribute to energy production during rest periods between sprints, but its relative contribution might decrease if the rest periods are very short compared to the duration of the sprints."
