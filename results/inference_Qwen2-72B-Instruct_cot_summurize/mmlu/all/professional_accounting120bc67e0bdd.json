Substantial authority is a higher standard than reasonable basis or a reasonable possibility of success and generally involves legal precedent, such as court cases or IRS rulings, that support the position taken on the tax return. If substantial authority exists for a tax shelter transaction or any other position on a tax return, the preparer has met the requirements to avoid penalties under the accuracy-related penalty provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. The other options (B, C, and D) describe lesser standards of support that may not necessarily protect against penalties if the position is later challenged by the IRS. However, among these, option B is also a defense against preparer penalties under the \"more likely than not\" standard, but it is not as strong a defense as \"substantial authority.\""
