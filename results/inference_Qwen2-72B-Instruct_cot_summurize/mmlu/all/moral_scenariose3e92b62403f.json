In Scenario 1, committing seppuku (a form of ritual suicide by disembowelment) in a public place, especially a children's museum, would be considered morally wrong due to the potential for causing trauma and distress to others, particularly children. In Scenario 2, holding someone's head in a pot of boiling water is an act of violence and harm, which is also clearly morally wrong."
