                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to figure out how many times we have to divide the original amount by 2 (since each half-life reduces the amount of substance by half) until we get to 1.0 microgram from 10.0 kg.\n\nFirst, let's convert everything into the same units for consistency. There are 1e6 (one million) micrograms in a gram, so there are 1e9 (one billion) micrograms in a kilogram.\n\nSo, 10.0 kg is equal to 10.0 * 1e9 = 1e10 micrograms.\n\nWe want to find out how many times we can divide 1e10 by 2 until we reach 1 microgram.\n\nLet \\( n \\) be the number of half-lives. Then:\n\n\\[ 1e10 * (1/2)^n = 1 \\]\n\nDivide both sides by 1e10:\n\n\\[ (1/2)^n = 1 / 1e10 \\]\n\nTaking logarithms on both sides gives us:\n\n\\[ \\log_2((1/2)^n) = \\log_2(1 / 1e10) \\]\n\n\\[ -n = \\log_2(1e-10) \\]\n\n\\[ n = -\\log_2(1e-10) \\]\n\n\\[ n = \\log_2(1e10) \\]\n\nUsing the change of base formula for logarithms:\n\n\\[ n = \\frac{\\log_{10}(1e10)}{\\log_{10}(2)} \\]\n\n\\[ n = \\frac{10}{\\log_{10}(2)} \\]\n\n\\[ n = \\frac{10}{0.301} \\] (approximating \\(\\log_{10}(2)\\))\n\n\\[ n \\approx 33.22 \\]\n\nSince the number of half-lives must be an integer, and we cannot have a fraction of a half-life, we round up to the nearest whole number because any fraction of a half-life would still result in less than 1 microgram remaining. Thus, it takes approximately 34 half-lives to reduce 10.0 kg of a radioactive substance to 1.0 microgram.\n\nThe correct answer is D. 34."
