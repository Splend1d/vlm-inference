In essence, option A is the closest to defining this theory: \"Recognition is determinative of statehood.\" According to this theory, a political entity does not become a state until it is recognized as such by other existing states. This contrasts with the declaratory theory, which posits that a state exists independently of recognition by other states, and that recognition merely acknowledges an existing fact.\n\nOptions B, C, and D are not accurate descriptions of the constitutive theory of recognition. They introduce additional conditions (constitutional approval, human rights guarantees, possession of a valid constitution) that are not part of the core concept of the constitutive theory. While these conditions might be relevant in specific contexts or as part of broader international law considerations, they do not define the constitutive theory itself."
