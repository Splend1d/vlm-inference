Hart argued that the state should not interfere with private acts between consenting adults, even if those acts are considered immoral by some members of society. This position is often referred to as the harm principle, which holds that the only justification for state intervention is to prevent harm to others. By asserting that society has no right to use the criminal law to preserve its moral and social cohesion, Hart was effectively arguing against Devlin's view that the state has a legitimate interest in enforcing certain moral standards."
