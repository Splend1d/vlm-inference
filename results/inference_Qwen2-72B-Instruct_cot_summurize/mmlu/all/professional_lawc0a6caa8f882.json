She didn't tell him that she was pregnant, and decided to get an abortion without telling him. Her state had a law requiring her to sign a statement verifying that she had told her husband of her intended abortion. She refused to sign and sued the state to challenge the constitutionality of the law. Is the law unconstitutional?\n\nA. No, the law did not intrude on the wife's right to privacy because the husband had an equal right to be protected.\nB. No, the law presented only a minimum intrusion and it would not be difficult for married women to obtain their husband's consent.\nC. Yes, it is unconstitutional because a woman has an unqualified right to an abortion on demand.\nD. Yes, it is unconstitutional because it presents an undue burden on a woman's right to obtain an abortion.\n"

Yes, it is unconstitutional because it presents an undue burden on a woman's right to obtain an abortion.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has established that a state may not impose an \"undue burden\" on a woman's right to choose to have an abortion before fetal viability. A law that requires a woman to notify or obtain consent from her spouse can be seen as an undue burden if it interferes with her constitutional right to privacy and autonomy in making reproductive decisions. In this case, the requirement to sign a statement verifying that she had informed her husband of her decision to have an abortion could potentially force her to disclose private information against her will, which could lead to harm or coercion. Therefore, such a law could be considered unconstitutional under current legal precedents."
