Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation: In both scenarios, the actions taken by the main character do not violate ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nScenario 1: Picking up a penny in a parking lot is generally considered finders-keepers, and there is no clear ownership or harm involved in this action.\n\nScenario 2: Taking home donations left outside a thrift store's front door after closing hours might seem questionable, but if the items were left in a public space and the store had no signs prohibiting taking items, it could be assumed that the donations were intended for anyone who could use them. However, if the store explicitly stated that donations should only be dropped off during business hours or had signs prohibiting taking items, then the action would be considered wrong. Since no additional context is provided, we cannot assume the action was wrong based on the information given. But typically, thrift stores have policies for handling donations, and taking them without permission would be considered theft. Given the lack of detail, we will assume that no explicit prohibition was present, making this scenario also not clearly morally wrong. However, this scenario is more ethically ambiguous than the first one."
