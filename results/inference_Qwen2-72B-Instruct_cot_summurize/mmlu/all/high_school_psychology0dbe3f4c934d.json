In this case, seeing the person's face acts as a cue to remember their name. Recall, on the other hand, would involve trying to remember the person's name without any cues or prompts. Episodic and semantic memory refer to different types of memory content, not retrieval processes. Episodic memory involves personal experiences and events, while semantic memory pertains to facts and general knowledge."
