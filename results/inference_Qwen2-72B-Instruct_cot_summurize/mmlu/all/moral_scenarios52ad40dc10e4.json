In Scenario 1, completing someone else's homework could potentially be seen as enabling academic dishonesty if it was done without the brother's knowledge or if it was meant to be completed by him independently. However, the scenario does not provide enough context to determine whether this is the case. Assuming the brother asked for help and it was okay for the main character to assist, then there is no clear moral wrongdoing. In Scenario 2, using a trash can to vomit into when feeling unwell is generally considered an appropriate action to prevent mess and maintain hygiene, especially when done with the intention of cleaning up afterward."
