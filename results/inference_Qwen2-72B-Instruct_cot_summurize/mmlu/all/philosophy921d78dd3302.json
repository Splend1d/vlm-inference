Knowing the logos of a thing means understanding its essence, its cause, and its purpose, which goes beyond merely knowing what to call it based on personal experience or agreeing on a common definition. In other words, knowing the logos of a thing involves grasping its universal and necessary properties, which are independent of individual perceptions and opinions. This type of knowledge is more reliable and objective than mere conceptual understanding, which can be influenced by subjective factors such as cultural background, language, and personal biases."
