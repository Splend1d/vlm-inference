In this scenario, Michelle recognizes David Letterman on television because she is used to seeing him in that context (i.e., as the host of a TV show). However, when she encounters him on the streets of Manhattan, he is outside of his usual context, which makes him less recognizable to her. This demonstrates how our perception can be influenced by the context in which we encounter stimuli."
