Processing could refer to any number of geological or human-induced changes that have occurred after the rock's formation, and these processes can occur on Earth as well as in space. The other three characteristics (fusion crust, solidified spherical droplets known as chondrules, and a different elemental composition from Earth) are more indicative of a meteoritic origin."
