A larger surface area relative to volume facilitates diffusion, which is crucial for cell function because it allows nutrients to enter and waste products to exit the cell. If cells were much larger, their volume would increase at a faster rate than their surface area, making it difficult for them to get enough nutrients or remove enough waste through their membranes."
