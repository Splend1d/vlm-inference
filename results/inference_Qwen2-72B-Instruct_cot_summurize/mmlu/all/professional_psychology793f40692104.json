This is because the reinforcement (or lack thereof) has the greatest impact on the behavior immediately following it. By intervening at this critical juncture, self-control procedures can help to modify or prevent the undesired behavior from occurring. For example, in the case of alcohol abuse, this might involve avoiding situations where drinking is likely to be reinforced, or finding alternative ways to cope with stress that do not involve alcohol."
