Surplus food stored in large, collective facilities leads to the development of granaries and storehouses, which require management and administration, contributing to social stratification and the rise of specialized roles.\n\nB. Crop irrigation through the construction of dams or canals necessitates organized labor and engineering skills, as well as centralized planning and decision-making, leading to more complex governance structures.\n\nC. Sedentary communities often need to defend themselves against nomadic groups or rival settlements, which results in the development of military organizations, fortifications, and alliances, further increasing societal complexity."
