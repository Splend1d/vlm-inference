It would oscillate back and forth from one opening to the other indefinitely.\n\nHere's why: when you drop an object down the hole, it will accelerate towards the center of the Earth due to gravity. As it passes through the center, it will start to decelerate because the gravitational force acting on it decreases as it moves away from the center. When it reaches the other side, it will have lost all its kinetic energy and will start to fall back towards the center again, oscillating back and forth like a pendulum. This would continue indefinitely in ideal conditions with no friction or air resistance to slow it down. In reality, however, the object would eventually come to a stop due to these factors."
