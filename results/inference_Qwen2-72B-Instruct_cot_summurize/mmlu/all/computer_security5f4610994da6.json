It sends a SYN packet to the target and waits for a response. If the port is closed, the target will respond with a RST (reset) packet. An open port will respond with a SYN/ACK packet. The scanner then sends an RST packet back to close the connection without completing the full three-way handshake required to establish a complete TCP connection."
