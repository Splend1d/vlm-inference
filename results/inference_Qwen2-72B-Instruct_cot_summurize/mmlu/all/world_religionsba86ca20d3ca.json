Here's a brief summary of the myth:\n\nIn the beginning, there was a god named Hwanin who lived in heaven. His son, Hwanung, wanted to come down to earth and rule over it. Hwanin granted his wish and sent him down with three bears and tigers. Hwanung set up a residence on top of a mountain and instructed the animals that if they could live in a cave for 100 days without going outside, he would turn them into humans.\n\nThe bears and tigers agreed, but after 20 days, the tigers couldn't stand being cooped up and left the cave. The bears, however, stayed inside for the full 100 days. As a result, Hwanung turned them into humans. The female bear became known as Ungnyeo, and she later gave birth to a son named Dangun with Hwanung.\n\nDangun went on to found the kingdom of Gojoseon, which is considered the first Korean kingdom. So the correct answer is B. Hwanung."
