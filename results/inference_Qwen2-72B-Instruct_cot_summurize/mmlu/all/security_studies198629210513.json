Both Historical Materialism (HM) and realism do indeed acknowledge the existence of certain discernible realities within society. Realism emphasizes the anarchic nature of the international system and the role of power politics, while HM focuses on material conditions and class relations as driving forces in societal development.\n\nB. Historical Materialism shares some similarities with other theoretical perspectives like realism, liberalism, and social constructivism, but it places unique emphasis on the dynamics of class conflict within capitalist societies. This focus sets it apart from other theories that may not give such prominence to class struggle or the economic base of society.\n\nC. While HM acknowledges the role of the state in the international system, it argues that states often act to protect and promote the interests of the ruling-class elite. This perspective contrasts with realism's emphasis on state sovereignty and national interest, which can be broader than just the interests of the elite.\n\nTherefore, option D correctly identifies that all three statements describe valid aspects of the relationship between Historical Materialism and realism."
