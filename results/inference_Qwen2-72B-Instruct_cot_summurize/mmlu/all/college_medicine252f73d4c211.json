ATP is primarily produced in the mitochondria through oxidative phosphorylation, which requires oxygen as the final electron acceptor. When oxygen is no longer supplied to the cell, the production of ATP through this pathway ceases. While some ATP can still be generated through anaerobic glycolysis, the amount produced is much less than what is produced aerobically, and it cannot sustain cellular functions for long without oxygen. Therefore, ATP production will stop first when oxygen is no longer supplied to the cell."
