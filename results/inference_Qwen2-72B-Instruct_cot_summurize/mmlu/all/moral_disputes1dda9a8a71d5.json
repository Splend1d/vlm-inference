This is because Sinnott-Armstrong argues that particularism, which holds that moral judgments should be made based on the particular circumstances of a situation rather than on universal principles, is a more plausible approach to ethics than traditional theories that rely on general principles. If we cannot identify a relevant moral principle to apply to a particular case, then particularism would suggest that we need to consider the specific details of the situation in order to determine what is morally right or wrong. Therefore, we cannot simply assume that wasteful driving is wrong without further analysis."
