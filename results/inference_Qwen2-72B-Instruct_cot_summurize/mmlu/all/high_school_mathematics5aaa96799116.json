Then, we have:\n\n\\[ z \\cdot (5 + 3i) = 32 - 8i \\]\n\nTo solve for $z$, we divide both sides by Hardy's number:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{32 - 8i}{5 + 3i} \\]\n\nTo simplify this expression, we multiply the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator, which is $5 - 3i$:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{(32 - 8i)(5 - 3i)}{(5 + 3i)(5 - 3i)} \\]\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{160 - 96i - 40i + 24i^2}{25 - 15i + 15i - 9i^2} \\]\n\nRecall that $i^2 = -1$. Substituting this in, we get:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{160 - 136i - 24}{25 + 9} \\]\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{136 - 136i}{34} \\]\n\n\\[ z = 4 - 4i \\]\n\nSo, the number picked by Ramanujan is $\\boxed{\\text{D. } 4 - 4i}$."
