According to historical economic data, the real GDP per capita in the U.S. in 1850, when adjusted to 2011 international dollars (a common measure used for PPP comparisons), is approximately around $1,500 to $3,000. However, most estimates lean closer to the lower end of that range.\n\nGiven the options you've provided:\n\nA. About $300\nB. About $3k\nC. About $8k\nD. About $15k\n\nThe closest answer would be B. About $3k.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that historical economic data can be revised as new research and methodologies emerge, so these figures are approximations based on current understanding and available data."
