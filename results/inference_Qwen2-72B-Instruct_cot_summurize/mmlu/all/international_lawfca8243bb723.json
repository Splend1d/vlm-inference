It means having rights and duties under international law and a capacity to enforce these by or against the relevant actor.\n\nInternational legal personality refers to the status of an entity in the international legal system which allows it to have rights and obligations under international law. This status enables an entity to enter into relations with other subjects of international law and to be held accountable for its actions in the international arena. Traditionally, states were the primary subjects of international law, but over time, international organizations, certain territories, and even individuals have been recognized as possessing some form of international legal personality."
