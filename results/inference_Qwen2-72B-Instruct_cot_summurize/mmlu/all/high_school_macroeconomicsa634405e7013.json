This situation leads to an increase in exports of copper from the United States. Therefore, we would expect:\n\nA. The United States to be a net exporter of copper.\n\nThe other options do not directly follow from the given condition:\n\nB. Imposing a tariff on imported copper would make sense if the domestic price was higher than the world price, to protect domestic producers from cheaper foreign competition, but this is not the case described.\n\nC. The demand for U.S. copper would likely increase, as it becomes more attractive for foreign buyers due to its lower price relative to the world market.\n\nD. A growing trade deficit in the United States in goods and services could result from many factors, but an increase in the export of copper would actually contribute to a decrease in the trade deficit, not an increase."
