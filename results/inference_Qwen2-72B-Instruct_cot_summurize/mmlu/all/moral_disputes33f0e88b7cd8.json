According to philosopher Cornel West, feminist rhetoric has sometimes obscured the harms of noncoerced, consensual sex by implying that because what is coerced is bad, what is noncoerced is automatically good. This can lead to an oversimplification of complex issues surrounding sexuality and consent. However, it's important to note that different feminists have different views on these issues, and not all feminist rhetoric would fall into this trap."
