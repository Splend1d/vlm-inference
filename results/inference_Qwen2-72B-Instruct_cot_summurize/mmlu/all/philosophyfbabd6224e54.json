He argues that we become virtuous by doing virtuous acts and that vice develops through the repeated performance of bad actions. This is encapsulated in his famous saying, \"We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.\" Therefore, according to Aristotle, we have the power to choose and cultivate virtue or vice through our actions and habits."
