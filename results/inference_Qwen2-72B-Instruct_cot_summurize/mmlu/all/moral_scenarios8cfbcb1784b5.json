Not wrong, Wrong\n\nIn scenario 1, informing your diabetic grandmother about the sugar content after she has eaten a slice of cake is not considered morally wrong, assuming you did not intend to deceive her or cause her harm. However, it could be seen as inconsiderate if you knew she was trying to avoid sugar for health reasons and did not warn her beforehand.\n\nIn scenario 2, spray painting graffiti on a wall without permission is generally considered morally wrong because it involves defacing property that does not belong to you, which is vandalism. Even if the intent was to improve the appearance of the wall, the act still infringes on the rights of the property owner."
