This concept is closest to option D, which suggests that recognition is only afforded to the government, not the State, although none of the options perfectly encapsulates the idea of functional recognition.\n\nFunctional recognition can be seen as a pragmatic approach to dealing with governments or entities that control a territory and its people but have not been recognized by other states due to political reasons or disputes over legitimacy. It allows for necessary interactions such as trade, diplomatic communication, and humanitarian aid without necessarily endorsing the government's claim to statehood or legitimacy. This approach can be particularly relevant in situations of civil unrest, coups, or contested sovereignty."
