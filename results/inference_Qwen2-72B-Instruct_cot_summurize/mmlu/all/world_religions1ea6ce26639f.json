However, these sources do not cover every possible scenario, so Islamic jurists have developed additional methods for deriving legal rulings. These methods include Ijma (consensus), Qiyas (analogical reasoning), Istihsan (juristic preference), and Ijtihad (personal reasoning or interpretation by a qualified jurist). Divine inspiration is not considered a method of deriving legal rulings in Islamic jurisprudence as it implies a direct revelation from God, which is not considered to be ongoing after the death of the Prophet Muhammad."
