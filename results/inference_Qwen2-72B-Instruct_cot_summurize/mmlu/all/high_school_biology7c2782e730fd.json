The pathogens that cause the diseases are primarily transmitted by the bite of an infected mosquito.\n\nZika fever, West Nile fever, and malaria are all transmitted primarily through the bite of an infected mosquito. Zika and West Nile are indeed caused by viruses, but malaria is caused by a protozoan parasite. None of these diseases are treatable with antibiotics, as antibiotics are ineffective against viruses and most strains of malaria (though resistance is a concern for antimalarial drugs, not antibiotics). These diseases can occur in various geographic regions, not exclusively in tropical countries."
