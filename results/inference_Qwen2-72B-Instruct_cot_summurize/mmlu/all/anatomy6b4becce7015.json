The mandibular canal, maxillary sinus, hard palate and zygomatic arch\n\nA dental panoramic radiograph (also known as a Panoramic X-ray or Panorex) is capable of displaying multiple structures in the oral and maxillofacial region in a single image. This includes the mandibular canal, which is the pathway for the inferior alveolar nerve, the maxillary sinus, the hard palate, and the zygomatic arch (cheekbone). These structures are typically visible on a panoramic radiograph along with the teeth, jaws, and other important anatomical features."
