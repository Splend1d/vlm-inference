Current liabilities of $500,000; long-term liabilities of $1,550,000.\n\nExplanation:\nThe $250,000 drawn from the line of credit is due within one year, so it is a current liability.\nThe first installment of the $750,000 secured note (which is $150,000) is also due within one year, so it is a current liability.\nThe $300,000 three-year balloon note is due in three years, so it is a long-term liability.\nThe remaining balance of the secured note ($600,000) is due after one year, so it is a long-term liability.\nTherefore, the total current liabilities are $250,000 + $150,000 = $400,000, and the total long-term liabilities are $600,000 + $300,000 = $900,000.\nHowever, the question asks for the presentation of debt in the classified balance sheet as of December 31, Year 2, and since the first installment of the secured note is due within one year, it should be classified as a current liability. Therefore, the correct answer is B: Current liabilities of $500,000 (which includes the $250,000 line of credit and the $250,000 first installment of the secured note) and long-term liabilities of $1,550,000 (which includes the remaining $600,000 of the secured note and the $300,000 three-year balloon note)."
