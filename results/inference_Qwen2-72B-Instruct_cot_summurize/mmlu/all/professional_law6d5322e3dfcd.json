The friend would receive the sister's interest in the property, but the resulting ownership structure would no longer be a joint tenancy with the brother because the brother did not join in the conveyance. Instead, the brother and the friend would hold their respective interests as tenants in common.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. An undivided one-half interest without right of survivorship.\n\nThe friend now owns an undivided one-half interest in the property alongside the brother, but neither has the right of survivorship over the other's interest. If either the brother or the friend were to pass away, their interest would not automatically pass to the survivor but would instead become part of the deceased's estate to be distributed according to their will or state law if there is no will."
