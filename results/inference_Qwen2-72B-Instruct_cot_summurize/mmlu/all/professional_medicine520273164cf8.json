She has a 2-year history of hypertension treated with a thiazide diuretic and an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. Examination, including neurologic examination, shows no abnormalities except for multiple ecchymoses. Her hemoglobin concentration is 13 g/dL, leukocyte count is 5000/mm3 , and platelet count is 35,000/mm3 . A serum antiplatelet antibody assay is negative. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis?\n\nA. CT scan of the abdomen\nB. CT scan of the chest\nC. Bronchoscopy\nD. Bone marrow aspiration\n"

The low platelet count (thrombocytopenia) could be due to several causes, including bone marrow suppression or infiltration by cancer cells, which can occur as a complication of radiation therapy for lung cancer. A bone marrow aspiration and biopsy would help determine if there is any bone marrow involvement or other pathology that might explain the thrombocytopenia.\n\nWhile a CT scan of the abdomen (option A) or chest (option B) or bronchoscopy (option C) may be useful in evaluating the status of her lung cancer or looking for new lesions, they would not specifically address the cause of her thrombocytopenia and easy bruising. Given the history of lung cancer and recent treatment with radiation, it is important to evaluate the bone marrow's function, which directly impacts platelet production."
