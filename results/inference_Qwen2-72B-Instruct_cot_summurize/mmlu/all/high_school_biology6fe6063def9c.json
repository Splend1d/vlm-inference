This type of genetic variation neither benefits nor hinders an organism, and thus does not contribute to natural selection. Neutral variations can include changes in DNA sequences that do not affect protein function or regulatory processes.\n\nA. Nucleotide diversity refers to the variety of nucleotides (the building blocks of DNA) at a particular locus within a population. Neutral variation can actually increase nucleotide diversity because it accumulates over time without being filtered out by natural selection.\n\nB. Average heterozygosity, which is the frequency of individuals with different alleles at a given gene locus, can also be affected by neutral variation. In fact, neutral theory predicts that heterozygosity will remain relatively constant over time due to mutation and genetic drift.\n\nC. Our ability to measure the rate of evolution can be influenced by neutral variation. By studying neutral genetic markers, scientists can estimate mutation rates and evolutionary timescales without the confounding effects of natural selection.\n\nThus, the statement that neutral variation should have no effect on relative fitness is accurate, as neutral variation does not influence an organism's survival or reproductive success."
