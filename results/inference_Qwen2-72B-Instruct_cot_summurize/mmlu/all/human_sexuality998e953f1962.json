Sexual arousal, including an erection, requires proper blood flow to the genital area, a process known as vasocongestion. Anxiety and stress can lead to the release of stress hormones such as adrenaline, which can cause blood vessels to constrict and reduce blood flow. This can interfere with the ability to achieve or maintain an erection. Relaxation techniques such as deep breathing, meditation, or other stress-reduction methods may help improve blood flow and erectile function."
