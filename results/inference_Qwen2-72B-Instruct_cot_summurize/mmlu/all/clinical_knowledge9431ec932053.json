Its main function is to regulate the concentration of calcium ions (Ca\u00b2\u207a) within the cell, which is crucial for muscle contraction and relaxation. During muscle contraction, the SR releases stored Ca\u00b2\u207a into the cytoplasm, allowing the interaction between actin and myosin filaments. Conversely, during muscle relaxation, the SR reabsorbs Ca\u00b2\u207a, reducing its concentration in the cytoplasm and enabling the muscle to relax."
