Reports of the drug being tied to cases of premature dementia surfaced, and a number of lawsuits were filed by injured consumers, alleging strict liability for a defective product. At trial, the manufacturer proved that thorough testing was done but that new scientific discoveries, not then available, now show a vulnerability in certain people to the drug. Is the company strictly liable to the victims even though the medical knowledge was not available when the product was developed and put on the market?\n\nA. Yes, strict liability applies to pharmaceutical companies and questions of knowledge of defects is irrelevant.\nB. Yes, the manufacturer must assume the cost of compensating those innocent victims who took the defective drug.\nC. No, the company has no duty to conduct research to determine a product's safety.\nD. No, when the medical or scientific information regarding a defect has not yet been discovered, the company will not be held strictly liable for putting that product on the market.\n"

No, when the medical or scientific information regarding a defect has not yet been discovered, the company will not be held strictly liable for putting that product on the market.\n\nStrict liability in product liability cases generally means that a manufacturer is liable for damages caused by a defective product, regardless of fault or negligence. However, the concept of \"state of the art\" defense can come into play, where the manufacturer can argue that they could not have known about the defect due to the limits of medical or scientific knowledge at the time the product was developed and sold. If the manufacturer can prove that the defect was not discoverable with the knowledge and technology available at the time, they may not be held strictly liable. This does not absolve them of all responsibility, as they may still face liability under other legal theories such as negligence if it can be shown that they failed to act reasonably in light of what was known at the time."
