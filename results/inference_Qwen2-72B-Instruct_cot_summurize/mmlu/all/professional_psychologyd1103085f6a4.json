Emotional reactivity is often increased: Using aversive techniques can lead to an increase in emotional reactivity, such as fear or anxiety, which can make it more difficult for the individual to learn new behaviors.\n\nB. Punishment merely suppresses unwanted behavior: While punishment may temporarily suppress unwanted behavior, it does not necessarily teach new, desirable behaviors. It can also create negative associations with the person administering the punishment, leading to avoidance or aggression towards that person.\n\nD. Inhibition of conditioning is encountered: Aversive techniques can lead to inhibition of learning, as the individual may become so focused on avoiding the aversive stimulus that they are unable to learn new behaviors. This can also lead to learned helplessness, where the individual gives up trying to change their behavior because they believe it will not make a difference.\n\nC is incorrect because the frequency of behavior is not necessarily related to the effectiveness of using aversive techniques to teach new behaviors. However, it is worth noting that using aversive techniques to teach new behaviors is generally not recommended due to the potential negative effects on the individual's emotional well-being and the limitations of punishment in teaching new behaviors. Positive reinforcement is typically a more effective and humane approach to teaching new behaviors."
