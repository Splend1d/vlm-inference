In that case:\n\nA. at least two pi bonds - This statement is incorrect because an alkene by definition only has one pi bond, as it is part of the double bond.\n\nB. at least four sigma bonds - This is generally true for most alkenes, including the simplest one, ethene.\n\nC. a tetrahedral configuration - This is not true for alkenes since the carbons in an alkene have a trigonal planar configuration due to the sp2 hybridization.\n\nD. cis-trans isomers - Alkenes can exhibit cis-trans isomerism if there are different groups attached to each carbon of the double bond. However, this is not a characteristic of all alkenes, as simple alkenes like ethene do not have cis-trans isomers.\n\nSo, the correct answer based on generality and correctness would be:\n\nB. at least four sigma bonds"
