A decrease in the price of ice cream, a complimentary good to ice cream cones, could both cause an increase in the demand for ice cream cones. When the price of a good decreases, it becomes more affordable, which can lead to an increase in demand. Similarly, when the price of a complementary good decreases, it can also lead to an increase in demand for the good in question because they are often consumed together. In this case, cheaper ice cream might encourage people to buy more ice cream cones to enjoy with their ice cream."
