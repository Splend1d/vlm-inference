In this context, we need to identify which of these substances contains a transition metal with multiple oxidation states that would require the use of Roman numerals in its name.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. CaCl2 - Calcium (Ca) is not a transition metal and does not form multiple oxidation states.\nB. CuCl2 - Copper (Cu) is a transition metal and can exist in two common oxidation states: +1 (CuI) and +2 (CuII). Since copper in CuCl2 has a +2 charge, it would indeed be named using Roman numerals as copper(II) chloride.\nC. AlBr3 - Aluminum (Al) is not a transition metal and does not form multiple oxidation states.\nD. K2Cr2O7 - Chromium (Cr) is a transition metal but in this compound, it is in the +6 oxidation state, which is commonly known and does not require specifying the oxidation state with Roman numerals because there is no ambiguity about the oxidation state of chromium in this compound.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. CuCl2, which should be named using Roman numerals after the cation, resulting in \"copper(II) chloride.\""
