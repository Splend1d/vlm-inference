Since Friday was the Fourth of July, the judge asked the jurors to return on Monday. The trial began again on Monday morning at 8:30. By late evening the judge had instructed the jury. Due to the lateness of the hour, the jurors were sequestered for the evening to allow them to get an early start the next morning. The jurors returned Tuesday morning and were unable to reach a verdict. Unable to reach a verdict, the trial judge allowed the jurors to go home that evening. On Wednesday morning, the jury assembled and returned a verdict of guilty. On appeal, which of the following is Billy's strongest issue for seeking a reversal?\n\nA. The fact that the jurors did not begin to consider evidence until several days after they were empaneled.\nB. The fact that the jury was allowed to go home after being sworn.\nC. The fact that the jury took several days to return a verdict.\nD. The fact that the jury was allowed to go home after they began deliberations.\n"

The fact that the jury was allowed to go home after they began deliberations.\n\nThis is because once a jury begins deliberations, they are typically required to remain sequestered until they reach a verdict or are officially discharged by the court. Allowing jurors to go home during deliberations could potentially expose them to outside influences, such as media coverage or discussions with family and friends about the case, which could compromise their impartiality and the integrity of the deliberative process. This could provide grounds for an appeal based on juror contamination or improper influence."
