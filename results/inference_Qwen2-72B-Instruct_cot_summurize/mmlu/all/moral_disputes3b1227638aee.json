Shapiro cites the study of Vietnam veterans to argue that addiction is not solely determined by the properties of the drug itself, but also by the social context in which it is used. The veterans had access to heroin while in Vietnam, but when they returned home and were no longer in that environment, their use decreased significantly. This suggests that factors such as peer pressure, availability, and cultural norms can play a significant role in addiction."
