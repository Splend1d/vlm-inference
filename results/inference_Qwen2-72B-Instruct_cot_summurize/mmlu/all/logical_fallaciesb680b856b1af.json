Among the options you've provided, none directly corresponds to this, but \"argument by consensus\" (option A) is the closest in meaning, as it suggests that a claim is valid because many people agree with it.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that \"appeal to the people\" can sometimes refer to a different kind of fallacy where an argument is made to sway the emotions of the audience rather than using logic or facts. In this case, none of the provided options would be an exact match. But if we're considering the most common interpretation, \"argument by consensus\" is the best fit."
