A plan that provided economic assistance to rebuild Europe.\n\nThe Marshall Plan, officially known as the European Recovery Program, was an American initiative to aid Western Europe, in which the United States gave over $12 billion (approximately $100 billion in 2018 dollars) in economic assistance for the reconstruction of European economies after the end of World War II. The plan was named after Secretary of State George C. Marshall, who proposed it in 1947. The goal was to help rebuild war-torn regions, remove trade barriers, modernize industry, and improve European prosperity. It was also intended to prevent the spread of communism by helping to stabilize and economically revive war-torn European nations."
