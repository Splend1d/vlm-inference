The neighbor then moved into possession of the farm and used it openly and exclusively, paying the taxes for 23 years. He did not use his easement during that period. The woman returned and tried to evict the neighbor from the farm. The court held that the neighbor had acquired the farm by adverse possession. The neighbor then sold the farm back to the woman, who then put a chain across the easement. The neighbor has now brought an action to remove the chain. In most jurisdictions, the neighbor will\n\nA. lose, because he abandoned his easement.\nB. lose, because he did not use his easement for the statutory period of 20 years.\nC. lose, because, rather than using his easement, he used all of the farm.\nD. win, because mere non-use of an easement does not extinguish it.\n"

The easement continues until it is legally extinguished, regardless of whether it is being actively used or not. Mere non-use of an easement does not generally result in its abandonment or extinguishment. Therefore, the neighbor's failure to use the easement during the time he was occupying the farm does not automatically mean that he has lost his right to use it. In order to establish abandonment, there must be clear evidence of the intent to abandon the easement, which is typically more than just non-use. Since the neighbor has not shown any such intent, he would likely win the case to remove the chain blocking the easement."
