This was part of a broader strategy known as the Reagan Doctrine, which supported anti-communist movements in various countries and significantly increased military spending to counter the perceived threat from the Soviet Union. Reagan believed that a strong U.S. military posture would help to deter Soviet aggression and ultimately lead to the collapse of the communist system."
