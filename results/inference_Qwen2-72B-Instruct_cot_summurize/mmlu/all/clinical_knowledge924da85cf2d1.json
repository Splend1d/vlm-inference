Expiratory component louder and longer with a gap between inspiration and expiration\n\nIn bronchial breathing, the expiratory phase is more prominent and lasts longer than the inspiratory phase, and there can be an audible pause between the end of expiration and the beginning of inspiration. This type of breathing sound is typically heard over the large airways (bronchi) in the neck or in areas of lung consolidation, such as in pneumonia or lung abscess."
