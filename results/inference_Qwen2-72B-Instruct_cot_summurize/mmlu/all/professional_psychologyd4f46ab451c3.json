This can provide the patient with a fresh perspective and potentially more effective treatment strategies. It's important to handle this situation sensitively and collaboratively, ensuring the patient feels supported in their decision-making process. Terminating treatment abruptly (option A) is generally not recommended without careful consideration and discussion with the patient. Treating it as an instance of resistance (option C) might not address the underlying issues effectively. Increasing the frequency of sessions (option D) could also be counterproductive if the current approach isn't meeting the patient's needs."
