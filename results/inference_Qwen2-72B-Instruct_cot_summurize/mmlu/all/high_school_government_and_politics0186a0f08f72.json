The rules of the House make it extremely difficult for representatives to influence legislation on the House floor, which means that much of the real work and power lies in the committee system. Therefore, House members are more concerned about their committee assignments than are senators. Additionally, while House members may serve on multiple committees, they often have to choose between them due to time constraints and scheduling conflicts. Senate committees do have significant power to alter legislation, and bills do not necessarily have to pass through all committees before reaching the Senate floor."
