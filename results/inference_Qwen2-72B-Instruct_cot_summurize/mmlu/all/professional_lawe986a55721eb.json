The motel manager authorized the officers to enter the room and provided them with a passkey. Without obtaining a warrant, the officers knocked on the room's door, announced their presence, and told the occupants that they would like to speak with them. The officers then heard yelling and repeated flushing of the toilet. They then used the passkey and entered the room, where they saw the occupants dumping drugs into the toilet. The occupants of the room were charged with drug dealing and have moved to suppress the drugs. Should the court grant the motion to suppress?\n\nA. No, because exigent circumstances justified the officers' entry.\nB. No, because the motel manager consented to the officers' entry.\nC. Yes, because exigent circumstances cannot excuse the lack of a warrant.\nD. Yes, because the officers cannot benefit from exigent circumstances that they created.\n"

No, because exigent circumstances justified the officers' entry.\n\nThe officers had probable cause to believe that drug dealing was taking place, and when they heard the flushing of the toilet after announcing their presence, this constituted an exigent circumstance. Exigent circumstances allow law enforcement to enter a premises without a warrant if there is an immediate need to prevent the destruction of evidence, protect public safety, or prevent the escape of a suspect. In this case, the destruction of evidence (the drugs being flushed) is the relevant exigent circumstance."
