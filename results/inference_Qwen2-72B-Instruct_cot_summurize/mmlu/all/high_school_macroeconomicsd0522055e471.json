This means that the price of a good or service will adjust based on how much of it is available (supply) and how much people want to buy (demand). When demand exceeds supply, prices tend to rise; when supply exceeds demand, prices tend to fall. The role of the government in setting prices is limited, although there can be regulations or interventions in certain markets. Prices are not necessarily a reflection of basic values, although they can sometimes indicate what people are willing to pay for different goods and services, which might give some insight into societal priorities. However, this does not mean that prices are inherently fair, as market dynamics can sometimes lead to inequalities or exploitative situations."
