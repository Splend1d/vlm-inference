The woman readily agreed and delivered the microwave to the handyman, who promised to have it ready in two weeks. One week later, the handyman realized that he had so much work to do that he would not be able to repair the microwave on time. He then took the microwave to a repair store. The repair store agreed to repair the microwave for $80 within one week. The owner of the repair store that contracted with the handyman was unaware that the woman actually owned the microwave. If the repair store fails to repair the microwave, which of the following is the most accurate statement?\n\nA. The woman has a cause of action against the repair store only.\nB. The woman has a cause of action against the handyman only.\nC. The woman has a cause of action against both the repair store and the handyman.\nD. The woman has no cause of action against either the repair store or the handyman.\n"

The woman has a cause of action against the handyman only.\n\nExplanation: The woman entered into a contract with the handyman, not the repair store. Therefore, any breach of contract would be between the woman and the handyman. The handyman is responsible for fulfilling his promise to repair the microwave, regardless of whether he subcontracts the work to another party. Since the repair store did not contract directly with the woman, she does not have a direct cause of action against them. However, the handyman may have a cause of action against the repair store for their failure to fulfill their agreement with him."
