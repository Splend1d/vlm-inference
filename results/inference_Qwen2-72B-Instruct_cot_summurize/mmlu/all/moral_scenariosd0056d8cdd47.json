In scenario 1, serving mud pie to stuffed animals is harmless pretend play and has no real-world consequences. In scenario 2, while there may be an element of deception, presenting a ring in a Tiffany box to one's girlfriend could be seen as a playful or romantic gesture rather than a morally wrong act, especially if there is no intent to permanently deceive her about the value or authenticity of the ring. If the intent is to propose marriage, however, it could be considered ethically questionable if the deception is intended to mislead her into accepting under false pretenses. Without further context, though, the action itself is not necessarily morally wrong."
