However, it could be seen as unethical if the hotel explicitly prohibits this and you are aware of that prohibition.\n\nIn scenario 2, taking money out of the cash register at your job is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. This action constitutes theft and is both illegal and unethical, regardless of the reasons behind it."
