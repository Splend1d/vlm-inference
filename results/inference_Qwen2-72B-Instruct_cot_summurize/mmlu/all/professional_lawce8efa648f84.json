While she was performing her exercises, one of the janitors in the building warned her that \"she was bound to get hurt if she keeps it up, because there are problems with the floor.\" After falling and breaking a leg due to a loose floorboard, she brought suit against the building owner. The building owner wants to testify that: \"The janitor told me 'I told her that running too fast is dangerous and she was bound to get hurt.' \". Is the building owner's statement likely to be held admissible?\n\nA. Yes, because it is as an exception to hearsay as a spontaneous declaration to an opponent-party.\nB. Yes, because the building owner can testify and be questioned about what the janitor told him.\nC. No, because it is irrelevant and immaterial.\nD. No, because it is hearsay within hearsay, and there are no hearsay exceptions that apply.\n"

No, because it is hearsay within hearsay, and there are no hearsay exceptions that apply.\n\nThe statement by the building owner is hearsay because it is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted (that the janitor warned the dance student). This statement itself contains another hearsay statement (the janitor's warning to the dance student). For the statement to be admissible, there would need to be exceptions to the hearsay rule that apply to both layers of hearsay. However, the options provided do not indicate any applicable exceptions, and a spontaneous declaration or the ability to question the building owner does not make the statement admissible if it is otherwise hearsay without an exception. The relevance of the statement could also be challenged, but the primary issue here is the hearsay nature of the statement."
