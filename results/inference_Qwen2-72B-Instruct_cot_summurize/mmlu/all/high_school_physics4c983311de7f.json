This statement is incorrect because the acceleration due to gravity acts vertically downward throughout the projectile's flight, regardless of whether it is moving upward or downward. It does not point in the opposite direction to the velocity vector on the way up nor in the same direction as the velocity vector on the way down.\n\nB. This statement is incorrect because the speed at the top of the trajectory is not zero. At the top of its path, the projectile's vertical component of velocity becomes zero for an instant, but it still has a horizontal component of velocity (assuming no air resistance).\n\nC. This statement is also incorrect because the object's total speed does not remain constant during the entire flight. Due to gravity, the vertical component of the velocity changes continuously, affecting the total speed of the projectile.\n\nD. This statement is correct. The vertical component of the velocity decreases as the projectile moves upward against gravity until it reaches zero at the highest point. As the projectile falls back toward Earth, the vertical component of the velocity increases in the downward direction due to gravity."
