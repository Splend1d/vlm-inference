In the Orthodox tradition, icons are considered to be \"windows to heaven\" and are believed to possess a certain spiritual power. They are typically found in churches, homes, and other places of worship, and are often adorned with candles, flowers, and other offerings. While icons may also be found in some other Christian traditions, they are most closely associated with the Orthodox Church."
