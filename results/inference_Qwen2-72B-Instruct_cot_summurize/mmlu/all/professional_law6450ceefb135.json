According to the contract, settlement (or closing) was to take place on March 1 of the same year. On January 20, a barn on the property was destroyed by fire. When the buyer was notified of the loss the following day, he contacted the seller and told him that the deal was off because of the fire. As a result, the buyer filed suit against the seller on January 25 for a refund of his down payment of $5,000. In his suit, the buyer will be unsuccessful and will be obliged to complete the contract if the court determines that on January 20\n\nA. the buyer held the legal title to the farm.\nB. the seller held the legal title to the farm.\nC. the buyer held the equitable title to the farm.\nD. the seller held the equitable title to the farm.\n"

                    "text": "In this scenario, the key factor is whether the risk of loss had passed from the seller to the buyer at the time of the fire on January 20. Generally, in real estate transactions, the risk of loss remains with the seller until the closing date, unless the contract specifies otherwise. The equitable title often passes to the buyer upon the signing of the contract, but this does not necessarily mean that the risk of loss has also passed.\n\nGiven that the contract stated that settlement was to take place on March 1, it's likely that the risk of loss remained with the seller until that date, unless the contract explicitly shifted it to the buyer earlier. Therefore, if the court determines that the seller held the legal title to the farm on January 20, the buyer's claim would likely fail because the fire occurred while the seller still bore the risk of loss. The buyer would then be required to complete the contract as agreed.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nB. the seller held the legal title to the farm."
