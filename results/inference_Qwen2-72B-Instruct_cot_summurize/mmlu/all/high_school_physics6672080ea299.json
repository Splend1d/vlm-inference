                    "text": "The relationship between the volume (V) and temperature (T) for an ideal gas at constant pressure (P) is given by Charles's Law: V/T = constant. This can also be written as V = kT, where k is a constant that includes the pressure and number of moles of gas.\n\nWhen we plot volume (V) against temperature (T), with V on the vertical axis and T on the horizontal axis, we get a straight line with a positive slope. The slope of this line is k, which is directly proportional to the pressure (P) since k = V/T = nR/P, where n is the number of moles of the gas and R is the ideal gas constant. Therefore, the slope is linearly proportional to the pressure of the gas.\n\nAs for the y-intercept, when T = 0 K (absolute zero), the volume would theoretically be 0 m^3 if the ideal gas law held perfectly at such low temperatures. However, it's important to note that real gases deviate from the ideal gas law at very low temperatures and high pressures, but for the purposes of this question and assuming an ideal gas, the intercept would be 0 m^3.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. The slope will be linearly proportional to the pressure of the gas and the intercept will be 0 m^3."
