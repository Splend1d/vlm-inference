Alpha waves (8-12 Hz) are typically seen when a person is in a relaxed but alert state with their eyes closed, while beta waves (13-30 Hz) are associated with active, engaged, or focused mental states. As a person moves into the various stages of sleep, the EEG patterns change to include slower wave activity."
