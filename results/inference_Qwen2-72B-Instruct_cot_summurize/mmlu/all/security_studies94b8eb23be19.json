Engagement of military forces to expel certain social groups from within a state.\n\nWhile all four statements discuss mechanisms through which various actors can exert influence or control over society, Statement C is distinct in its overtly coercive and potentially violent nature. The other three statements describe more normative processes: cultural reproduction (A), political strategy (B), and peaceful separation (D). The use of military force to expel social groups, as described in Statement C, raises significant ethical concerns and is generally considered a violation of human rights, unlike the other actions which, while they can have negative consequences, do not inherently involve the same level of force or harm."
