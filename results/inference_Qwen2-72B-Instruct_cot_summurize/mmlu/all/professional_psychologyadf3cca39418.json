These batteries typically include various subtests that evaluate different cognitive, motor, and personality traits, providing a more comprehensive understanding of an individual's capabilities and potential.\n\nBy using multiple aptitude batteries, employers can gain insight into a candidate's strengths that might not be evident through standard testing methods, potentially leading to fairer hiring practices and improved employment opportunities for disadvantaged groups."
