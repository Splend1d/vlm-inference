In these reactions, hydrogen nuclei (protons) combine to form helium. The correct answer is:\n\nB. four hydrogen atoms and one helium atom\n\nThis process, specifically known as the proton-proton chain reaction, occurs in stars like the Sun where the high temperature and pressure allow protons to overcome their electrostatic repulsion and fuse together. The net result can be simplified as follows:\n\n4 Hydrogen (H-1) nuclei -> 1 Helium (He-4) nucleus + Energy\n\nThe energy released comes from the mass difference between the reactants (four hydrogen nuclei) and the product (one helium nucleus), as described by Einstein's famous equation E=mc^2, where E is energy, m is mass, and c is the speed of light."
