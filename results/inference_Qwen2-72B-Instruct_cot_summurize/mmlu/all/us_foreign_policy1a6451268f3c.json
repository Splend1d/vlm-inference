Creation of the National Intelligence Director\n\nThe 9/11 Commission recommended the creation of a National Intelligence Director (NID) to oversee and coordinate all national intelligence elements within the United States Government. The NID would have authority over all national intelligence agencies, including the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), and would be responsible for developing the National Intelligence Program budget, which Congress would then appropriate directly to the NID. This was intended to improve coordination and information sharing among the various intelligence agencies. The position was later established as the Director of National Intelligence (DNI)."
