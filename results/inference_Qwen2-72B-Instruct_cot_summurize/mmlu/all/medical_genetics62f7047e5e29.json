Autosomal recessive\n\nAutozygosity mapping is particularly useful for mapping disorders that show an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance, as it relies on the identification of long stretches of homozygous DNA in consanguineous families or isolated populations where such disorders are more likely to manifest due to the increased probability of inheriting two copies of a mutant gene."
