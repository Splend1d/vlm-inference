While it is true that defensive realism advocates for a more restrained approach to power politics, it does not necessarily view cooperation as the primary means for achieving security. Instead, defensive realists argue that states should avoid unnecessary conflicts and power struggles, focusing on maintaining a balance of power to ensure their security. Cooperation might be a tool to maintain this balance, but it is not the defining characteristic of defensive realism. Therefore, the statement \"Defensive realism regards cooperation as the way in which states can achieve security\" oversimplifies the theory."
