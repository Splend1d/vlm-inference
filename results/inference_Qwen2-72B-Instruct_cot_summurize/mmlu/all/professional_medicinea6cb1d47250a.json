Significant findings can be reported with greater confidence\n\nSetting a lower alpha level (0.01 instead of 0.05) means that you are setting a stricter criterion for determining statistical significance. This reduces the probability of a Type I error (false positive), which occurs when you incorrectly reject the null hypothesis (i.e., conclude there is an effect when in reality there isn't). As a result, if your study does find a statistically significant difference between the new drug and placebo, you can report those findings with greater confidence that they are not due to random chance.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that reducing alpha also decreases the study's power (option B), which is the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when it is false. This increases the likelihood of a Type II error (false negative), where you fail to detect a real effect (option C). Therefore, options B and C are incorrect in this context.\n\nOption D is also incorrect because decreasing alpha actually makes it harder to achieve statistical significance, thus decreasing the likelihood of statistically significant findings rather than increasing it."
