Initially, these sounds are not restricted to those found in the child's native language. Instead, they encompass a wide range of phonemes, including those that may not occur in any language the child will eventually speak. This is because the infant has not yet learned to restrict their vocalizations to the phonemes of their native language(s). Over time, as the child is exposed more and more to the sounds of their native language, they begin to specialize in producing those sounds and the babbling becomes more like the phonemes of the language(s) they hear around them."
