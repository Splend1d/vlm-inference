A child inherits one sex chromosome from each parent. The mother will always pass an X chromosome to her offspring, while the father can pass either an X or a Y chromosome. If the child inherits an X chromosome from the father, they will be female (XX). If the child inherits a Y chromosome from the father, they will be male (XY)."
