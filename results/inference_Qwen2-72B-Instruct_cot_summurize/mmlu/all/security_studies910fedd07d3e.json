Resilience refers to the ability of an IT system to identify and defend against a cyber-security threat.\nB. The only way to build a truly resilient IT system is to ensure that it can repel all types of threat and remain and avoid attack.\nC. Resilience in an IT system refers to its ability to function when there are no threats to its security.\nD. Resilience refers to the ability of IT systems to recover from attack.\n"

It is important because even with the best defenses in place, it is impossible to prevent all cyber-attacks. A resilient IT system can quickly detect, respond to, and recover from an attack, minimizing the damage and reducing downtime. This ensures that critical business functions can continue to operate, even in the face of a cyber-security incident."
