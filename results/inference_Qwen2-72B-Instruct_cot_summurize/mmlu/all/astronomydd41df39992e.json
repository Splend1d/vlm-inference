                    "text": "The correct answer is C. Earth has the strongest magnetic field among the terrestrial worlds because it is the only one that has both a partially molten metallic core and reasonably rapid rotation. The motion of molten iron in Earth's outer core generates electric currents, which in turn create the magnetic field. The rotation of the planet amplifies this effect through a process called the dynamo effect. While Earth is not the largest or most volcanically active terrestrial world, nor does it rotate the fastest, its combination of a liquid metallic core and relatively fast rotation make it unique in our solar system for having such a strong magnetic field."
