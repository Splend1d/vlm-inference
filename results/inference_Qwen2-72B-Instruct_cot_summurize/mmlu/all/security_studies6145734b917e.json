No, arms control does not serve any purpose outside the realm of traditional military weapons.\nB. Yes, successful policies of arms control and deterrence have translated well from other security realms, such as nuclear weapons control strategies.\nC. Effective deterrence requires international cooperation which is achievable in theory, but the verification required for traditional arms control strategies is impossible in cyber(ed) warfare.\nD. Only arms control is unproblematic, deterrence has failed because international cooperation cannot be reached and common rules or practices cannot be established.\n"

Effective deterrence requires international cooperation which is achievable in theory, but the verification required for traditional arms control strategies is impossible in cyber(ed) warfare.\n\nArms control and deterrence strategies can indeed be useful in cybersecurity, but they face significant challenges. Traditional arms control measures often rely on verification mechanisms to ensure compliance, which can be difficult or impossible to implement in the cyber domain due to the anonymity and rapidity of cyber operations. However, deterrence through the threat of retaliation or other consequences can still be effective if states can attribute cyberattacks and agree on what constitutes unacceptable behavior in cyberspace. International cooperation is essential for establishing norms and responding to cyber threats, but achieving this cooperation can be challenging given the diverse interests and capabilities of different states."
