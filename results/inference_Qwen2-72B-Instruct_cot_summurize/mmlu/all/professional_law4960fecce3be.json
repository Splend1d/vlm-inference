The causal relationship between the defendant's act and the resulting death (A) and the nature of the act causing the death (C) can also be relevant, but they are not the primary determinants for classifying the degree of homicide. The state of mind (mens rea) and the circumstances under which the act was committed are often given more weight in legal considerations."
