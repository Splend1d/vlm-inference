It was established by Guru Gobind Singh in 1699 to formalize the Sikh community and its code of conduct. Members of the Khalsa are expected to adhere to a strict set of rules and practices, including wearing five articles of faith (Panj Kakke) and following a prescribed daily routine and dietary laws (Rahit). The Khalsa represents the pinnacle of Sikh spirituality and commitment to the faith."
