Wrong, Wrong\n\nIn Scenario 1, returning items that have been intentionally damaged is considered fraud and is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. This action deprives the seller of rightful compensation for their goods and can lead to financial loss.\n\nIn Scenario 2, setting up a feast for the rich in front of the homeless might not be illegal, but it could be seen as morally questionable due to its potential to cause unnecessary distress or humiliation to the homeless individuals. It demonstrates a lack of empathy and consideration for those less fortunate, which is generally viewed as morally wrong. However, the scenario could also be interpreted as an artistic statement or social commentary, which might not necessarily be morally wrong if the intention is to highlight social inequalities. Given the context provided, however, the assumption is made that this is not the case."
