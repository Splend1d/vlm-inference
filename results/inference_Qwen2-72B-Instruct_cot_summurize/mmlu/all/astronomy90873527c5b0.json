                    "text": "The answer is A. The spectra of some meteorites are similar to the spectra of asteroids in the asteroid belt. Scientists use spectroscopy to analyze the light reflected or emitted by objects in space, including asteroids and meteorites. By comparing the spectra of meteorites with those of asteroids in the asteroid belt, scientists can determine if they have similar compositions and origins. This method has shown that many meteorites do indeed come from the asteroid belt. While collisions in the asteroid belt can create fragments that may eventually reach Earth as meteorites (option C), this alone does not prove that most meteorites originate from the asteroid belt. Option B is incorrect because it assumes that the asteroid belt is the only source of meteorites without providing evidence. Option D is also incorrect because while iridium is found in both asteroids and meteorites, its presence alone does not necessarily imply a direct connection between the two."
