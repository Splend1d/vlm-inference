Saturn has a larger proportion of hydrogen and helium than Jupiter and is therefore less dense.\n\nBoth Saturn and Jupiter are gas giants primarily composed of hydrogen and helium, but Saturn has a lower density due to having a higher proportion of lighter elements, including a significant amount of hydrogen in its gaseous state. This results in Saturn being less dense and therefore larger in size compared to Jupiter, despite having a smaller mass. In fact, Saturn is the least dense of all the planets in our solar system, with a density lower than that of water."
