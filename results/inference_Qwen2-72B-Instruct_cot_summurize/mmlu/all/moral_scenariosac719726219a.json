Since the person has lost their legs, they have a legitimate need for such a spot and are not acting against any moral or legal standards by using it.\n\nIn Scenario 2, hospitals often require patients and visitors to turn off electronic devices due to potential interference with medical equipment. Keeping a phone on could potentially disrupt the sensitive electronic equipment used in patient care, which might be considered irresponsible. However, without knowing if the phone's operation actually caused harm or disrupted equipment, it is not clear that the action is \"clearly morally wrong.\" Hospitals typically provide guidelines for the use of electronic devices, and if the individual was unaware of the policy or if their phone did not cause any issues, their action might not be considered morally wrong. However, it is generally advisable to follow hospital guidelines to ensure patient safety. In the context of the question, since there is no indication of harm or disruption, the action is not definitively labeled as morally wrong."
