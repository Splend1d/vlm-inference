Medical history is significant for esophageal varices secondary to alcohol-related cirrhosis and ascites treated with spironolactone. He drinks eight to ten alcoholic beverages daily. While you are obtaining additional history, the patient vomits a large volume of bright red blood and becomes difficult to arouse. Vital signs are temperature 36.0\u00b0C (96.8\u00b0F), pulse 110/min, respirations 12/min, and blood pressure 90/50 mm Hg. Following initiation of intravenous fluids, which of the following is the most appropriate immediate management?\n\nA. Arrange for transjugular intrahepatic portal vein shunting\nB. Begin intravenous vasopressin therapy\nC. Do endotracheal intubation\nD. Do upper endoscopy\n"

After securing the airway, the next step would likely be to perform an upper endoscopy (D) to evaluate the source of bleeding and attempt hemostasis. Transjugular intrahepatic portal vein shunting (A) and vasopressin therapy (B) may be considered later in the management of this patient, but they are not the immediate priorities given the current presentation."
