Realism\n\nRealists in international relations theory often argue against using force abroad for idealistic goals such as human rights protection or promoting democracy. They prioritize state sovereignty and national interest over moral or ideological objectives, viewing the latter as potentially destabilizing and not necessarily in a state's best interest. However, it is important to note that this position can vary among different realist thinkers and depends on specific circumstances."
