                    "text": "It has been argued by Braun and Chyba (2004) that indigenous nuclear programs are making proliferation safeguards obsolete. In what ways, if any, can a case be made to support this argument?\n\nA. WMD may provide the means to offset inferiority in conventional armaments compared to regional or superpower rivals. Possession of WMD may act as a deterrence to stronger opponents against potential threat, or be used to defeat their adversaries if engaged in combat. WMD capabilities may also be developed to gain automatic status and diplomatic influence amongst the international community.\nB. Although there are fears posed by WMD proliferation that terrorists may gain the capacity to develop weapons, it would remain very difficult to construct even a primitive gun-type nuclear weapon. However, whilst nuclear capabilities may be elusive, international or domestic terrorist networks may have the resources to construct and use chemical, biological, and radiological weapons.\nC. WMD vary vastly in terms of their availability, lethality, and destructive potential and the ease with which they can be manufactured. This means that the potential threats posed by each type of weapon are different. High yield, lightweight nuclear weapons use cutting-edge technology, whilst some chemical and biological weapons have been available for a long time. What separates WMD from conventional weapons is the potential to cause high level destruction. Because of the psychological fear possession can generate, WMD will remain highly desirable as a political weapon.\nD. All of these options.\n"

The strategic value of WMD: Nations may pursue nuclear capabilities to offset conventional military disadvantages, acting as a deterrent against stronger adversaries or to gain leverage in international diplomacy.\n\nB. The risk of WMD falling into terrorist hands: While constructing a nuclear weapon remains challenging, terrorist organizations might find it easier to acquire or create chemical, biological, or radiological weapons, which pose significant threats.\n\nC. The varying nature of WMD: The differences in availability, lethality, and ease of manufacture among WMD mean that the threats they pose are diverse. Nuclear weapons represent the highest level of destruction, but chemical and biological weapons can also cause mass casualties and widespread panic.\n\nTogether, these factors contribute to the complexity and persistence of the WMD proliferation challenge, potentially undermining the effectiveness of existing safeguards and treaties designed to prevent the spread of such weapons."
