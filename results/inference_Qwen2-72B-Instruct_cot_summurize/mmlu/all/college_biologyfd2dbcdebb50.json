Occasionally the chromosome number of such a hybrid plant doubles spontaneously. Which of the following best describes the descendants of those plants with the double chromosome number?\n\nA. The plant with the double chromosome number would be genetically defective and have no descendants.\nB. The descendants would be at a selective advantage because of the increased ability to introgress.\nC. The descendants would be reproductively successful because they could backcross with the parental species.\nD. The descendants would regain the ability to reproduce sexually because chromosomes could pair normally.\n"

The descendants would regain the ability to reproduce sexually because chromosomes could pair normally.\n\nWhen the chromosome number in a hybrid plant doubles, it can result in what is known as an autotetraploid (having four sets of chromosomes instead of two). This doubling can restore fertility by allowing chromosomes to pair up correctly during meiosis, which is necessary for sexual reproduction. As a result, these plants can produce viable gametes and potentially have offspring that are also fertile."
