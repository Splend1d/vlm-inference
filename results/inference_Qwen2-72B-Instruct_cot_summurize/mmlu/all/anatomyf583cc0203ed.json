Damage to this nerve can result in a variety of symptoms.\n\nWhen the third cranial nerve is damaged, you would expect:\n- Paralysis of the muscles it innervates leading to an inability to move the eye medially, inferiorly, or superiorly.\n- Dilation of the pupil because the sphincter pupillae muscle is no longer receiving signals to constrict.\n- The eye will deviate outward (laterally) because the lateral rectus muscle, which is not innervated by the third cranial nerve, will pull the eye in that direction unopposed.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Pupillary dilatation and a lateral strabismus."
