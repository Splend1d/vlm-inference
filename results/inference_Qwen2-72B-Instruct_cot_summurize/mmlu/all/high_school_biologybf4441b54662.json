Examples include skin color, eye color, and height in humans.\n\nIt's also worth noting that:\n\nB. Pleiotropic traits can also be affected by more than one gene, but pleiotropy refers to a single gene affecting multiple traits, not multiple genes affecting a single trait. However, complex biological systems often involve interactions between multiple genes, so it could be argued that some pleiotropic effects might indirectly involve multiple genes. \n\nA. Heterozygous traits and D. Blended alleles do not specifically relate to traits being affected by more than one gene. Heterozygous refers to having two different alleles for a gene, and blended inheritance was a theory proposed before Mendelian genetics that suggested traits blend together, which we now know is not how discrete genetic traits work."
