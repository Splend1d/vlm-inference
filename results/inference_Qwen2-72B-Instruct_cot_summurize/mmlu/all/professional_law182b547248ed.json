Shortly thereafter, a girl was strolling in the park when the defendant suddenly jumped from his hiding place and accosted her. Although the defendant intended only to rob his victim, he punched her in the mouth and she fell to the ground. The defendant then grabbed her purse and fled. Unknown to the defendant, the girl suffered a fractured skull when her head struck the pavement. She subsequently died from her head injuries.

Felony murder.\n\nFelony murder is a legal doctrine that holds a person criminally liable for a killing that occurs during the commission or attempted commission of certain felonies, such as robbery, even if the death was unintentional. In this case, the defendant committed a felony (robbery) during which an unintended death occurred. Therefore, under the felony murder rule, the defendant could be charged with felony murder.\n\nIt's important to note that the specific application of felony murder laws can vary by jurisdiction, but generally, they are designed to hold perpetrators accountable for deaths that occur during the course of dangerous felonies, regardless of whether the death was intentional or not."
