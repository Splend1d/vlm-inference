Anaemia is a common finding\n\nRheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disorder that typically affects small joints symmetrically, but it can also affect other organs and systems throughout the body. Anemia, particularly anemia of chronic disease, is a common extra-articular manifestation of RA due to the chronic inflammation and cytokine dysregulation associated with this condition.\n\nRegarding the other options:\n\nA. Rheumatoid factor is present in about 70-80% of patients with established rheumatoid arthritis, not 25%. However, its presence alone does not diagnose RA as it can be found in other conditions as well.\n\nB. Rheumatoid arthritis is not an example of an oligoarthropathy; it is a polyarthropathy, affecting multiple joints simultaneously.\n\nD. Heberden's nodes are bony enlargements at the distal interphalangeal joints of the fingers, typically associated with osteoarthritis rather than rheumatoid arthritis."
