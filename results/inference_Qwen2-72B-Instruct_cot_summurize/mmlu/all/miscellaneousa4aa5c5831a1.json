Which of the following makes the same logical mistake as above?\n\nA. Literature and art are not worthy of attention. Modernization must relies on science and technology, so science and technology are worthy of our attention. But literature and art are not science and technology.\nB. Non-university can also become an outstanding talent. Gorky, Edison, Faraday, Franklin, etc. have not attended college, but they have all become outstanding talents.\nC. The earth is a sphere, which can be proved from the fact that when we stand at a height and watch the sailing boat in the sea, we always see the mast first and then the hull. The reason for this is because the earth is a sphere.\nD. I saw them coming out of this chemical plant several times before I realized that this young man who was eager to help patients was originally a worker in this chemical plant.\n"

In other words, the argument's conclusion is restated in the premise, rather than being supported by independent evidence.\n\nLet's examine each of the options:\n\nA. This argument does not contain circular reasoning. It presents two separate claims: literature and art are not worthy of attention, and modernization relies on science and technology, which are worthy of attention. There is no circularity here.\n\nB. This argument does not contain circular reasoning either. It simply provides examples of people who did not attend university but became outstanding talents, thus supporting the claim that non-university education can lead to success.\n\nC. This argument does not commit the fallacy of circular reasoning. It provides an observation (seeing the mast of a ship before the hull) as evidence for the claim that the Earth is spherical. While the argument may be oversimplified, it does not assume its conclusion in a premise.\n\nD. This argument does not involve circular reasoning. It simply describes a realization that a person seen helping patients is a worker at a particular chemical plant. There is no logical fallacy present in this statement.\n\nNone of the provided options exactly mirrors the circular reasoning fallacy present in the original argument. However, if we must choose the closest option, it would be:\n\nC. Although it is not a perfect example of circular reasoning, it could be argued that assuming the Earth is a sphere to explain why ships' masts are seen before their hulls assumes the conclusion (that the Earth is a sphere). However, this is not a strong example of circular reasoning since the observation itself can be explained by other means, such as the curvature of the Earth, without explicitly stating that the Earth is a sphere. Nonetheless, this option is the least problematic among the four given choices regarding circular reasoning. \n\nBut strictly speaking, none of the options provided perfectly exemplify the same logical mistake as the original argument."
