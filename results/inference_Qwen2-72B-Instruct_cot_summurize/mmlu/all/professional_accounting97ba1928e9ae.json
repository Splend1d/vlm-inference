Since the funds were transferred from the General Fund to the Debt Service Fund, the General Fund would record a decrease (an outflow of resources) but this is not reported as an expenditure in the General Fund. The Permanent Fund is typically used for restricted purposes, such as scholarships or maintenance of a physical asset, and would not be involved in this transaction."
