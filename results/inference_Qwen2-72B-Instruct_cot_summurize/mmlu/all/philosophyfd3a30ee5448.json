This view contrasts with Plato's theory of Forms, which posits that there exists an abstract, eternal realm where the perfect and unchanging forms of things reside.\n\nGiven Aristotle's hylomorphic theory, which states that form and matter are inseparable in concrete reality, we can infer that if all the individual members of a species were destroyed, their essence or form would also cease to exist in the material world. Aristotle does not believe in the existence of abstract entities independent of physical reality. Therefore, the essence of a species does not have an independent existence outside of its individual members.\n\nThus, the answer that best aligns with Aristotle's views would be:\n\nA. would likewise be destroyed.\n\nThis is because, for Aristotle, the essence or form of a thing is realized through its material instantiation in the world. Without any material instances of a species, there would be no form or essence of that species in existence."
