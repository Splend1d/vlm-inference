This step is crucial to maintain confidentiality and adhere to privacy laws such as HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) in the United States. Confirming with the client also helps prevent any potential misunderstandings or breaches of trust. Once the client confirms the release and understands what information will be shared, then you can proceed with sending the requested information to Dr. Brenda Browne."
