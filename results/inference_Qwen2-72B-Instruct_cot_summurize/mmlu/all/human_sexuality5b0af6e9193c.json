The resulting embryos can then be screened for abnormalities before one or more are transferred to the uterus. This can increase the chances of a successful pregnancy and reduce the risk of miscarriage, especially if the cause of the miscarriages is related to chromosomal abnormalities or other issues that can be detected through screening. Other options like artificial insemination, zygote intra-fallopian transfer, and embryo transfer may not address the underlying issues causing the miscarriages as effectively as IVF."
