In other words, it has no zero divisors.\n\nWhen we consider the polynomial ring \\(R[x]\\), where \\(x\\) is an indeterminate, we can prove that if \\(R\\) is an integral domain, then \\(R[x]\\) is also an integral domain. This is because the zero polynomial is the only polynomial that can act as a zero divisor in \\(R[x]\\). If \\(f(x)g(x) = 0\\) for some \\(f(x), g(x) \\in R[x]\\), and both \\(f(x)\\) and \\(g(x)\\) are not the zero polynomial, then there must exist coefficients from \\(f(x)\\) and \\(g(x)\\) such that their product is non-zero (since \\(R\\) is an integral domain), leading to a contradiction since \\(f(x)g(x) = 0\\). Therefore, \\(R[x]\\) does not have zero divisors, making it an integral domain.\n\n**Statement 2**: If \\(R\\) is a ring and \\(f(x)\\) and \\(g(x)\\) are in \\(R[x]\\), then \\(\\deg(f(x)g(x)) = \\deg f(x) + \\deg g(x)\\).\n\nThe degree of a polynomial is the highest power of the variable in the polynomial. When you multiply two polynomials, the degree of the resulting polynomial is indeed the sum of the degrees of the original polynomials, assuming neither of them is the zero polynomial. This is because the highest-degree term of the product will be the product of the highest-degree terms of the original polynomials.\n\nTherefore, both statements are true.\n\nThe correct answer is **A. True, True**."
