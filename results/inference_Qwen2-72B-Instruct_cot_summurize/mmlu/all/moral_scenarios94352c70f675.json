In scenario 1, using razors in a pinata intended for a birthday party is dangerous and could cause serious harm to the participants, making it morally wrong. In scenario 2, using radioactive polonium to treat cancer is also morally wrong due to the extreme danger posed by such a highly radioactive substance, which could result in severe health consequences or death. Moreover, using any medical treatment without proper training, authorization, and oversight is generally considered unethical and illegal."
