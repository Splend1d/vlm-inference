According to this principle, the frequency of heterozygous genotypes can be calculated using the formula 2pq, where p is the frequency of one allele and q is the frequency of the other allele.\n\nGiven:\np = 0.6 (frequency of one allele)\nq = 0.4 (frequency of the other allele)\n\nThe frequency of heterozygous genotypes (2pq) is:\n2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48\n\nSo the answer is C. 0.48"
