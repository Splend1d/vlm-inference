And now he was going to deprive the poor soldier, who had undergone so many hardships, and suffered from innumerable wounds, of this small remuneration, and not even allow him a pretty Indian female for a companion&\u2026\n[Later], when Cort\u00e9s learnt that there were still a great many bars of gold among the men, and heavy gambling in consequence, (for, according to the old saying, gold and love cannot lie long concealed,) he made known, under threats of severe punishment, that everyone should produce the gold he had obtained on the night of our retreat, of which one third was to be returned to him; but that anyone who refused to pay this, should have the whole taken from him. Many of our men refused downright to comply with this; yet Cort\u00e9s managed to extort a good deal of it under the pretence of a loan&\u2026\"\nThe Memoirs of the Conquistador Bernal Diaz del Castillo, 1568\nThe motivations described in the text are most similar to those of which explorer?\n\nA.

Like Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s, Pizarro was a Spanish conquistador who sought wealth and power through the conquest of indigenous peoples and the plundering of their resources, particularly gold. Both Cort\u00e9s and Pizarro led expeditions that resulted in the fall of large empires (the Aztec and Inca Empires, respectively) and the accumulation of vast amounts of wealth for themselves and the Spanish crown. The passage describes the division of spoils, including gold and people as chattel, which is consistent with the behavior and motivations of both Cort\u00e9s and Pizarro during their conquests in the New World."
