However, it is often credited to Norman Borlaug, who developed high-yielding, disease-resistant wheat varieties that significantly increased wheat production in Mexico in the 1940s and later spread to other parts of the world. Therefore, the answer could be considered:\n\nB. Wheat\n\nAlthough rice was also a significant part of the Green Revolution, particularly in Asia, the question asks for the crop that \"began\" the revolution, which is generally attributed to the work on wheat."
