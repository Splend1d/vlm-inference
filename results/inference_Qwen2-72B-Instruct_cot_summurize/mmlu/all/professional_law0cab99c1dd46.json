The girlfriend, who was scared of flying, reluctantly agreed. During the flight, the pilot decided to play a practical joke and shut off the plane's engine. When the plane went into a nosedive, the pilot said, \"Oh my God, we're going to crash. \" The girlfriend became panic- stricken and started screaming hysterically. A few seconds later, the pilot re-started the engine and said, \"Don't worry \u0080\u0094I was only joking. \" The plane landed safely and neither person was injured. If the girlfriend brings suit against the pilot for intentional infliction of emotional distress, she will probably\n\nA. recover, because a reasonable person would have been distressed by the pilot's actions.\nB. recover, because the pilot's conduct was extreme and outrageous.\nC. not recover, because the pilot intended his actions as a practical joke and, therefore, lacked sufficient intent for an intentional tort.\nD. not recover, because the girlfriend did not suffer any physical injury.\n"

The pilot's actions could be considered extreme and outrageous, given that he intentionally put his girlfriend in a situation where she feared for her life, even if he did not intend to cause her actual harm. The lack of physical injury is not necessarily a bar to recovery in such cases, as the focus is on the emotional distress suffered."
