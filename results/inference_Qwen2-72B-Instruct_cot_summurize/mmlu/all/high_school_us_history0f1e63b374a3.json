The crisis in the Persian Gulf, as grave as it is, also offers a rare opportunity to move toward an historic period of cooperation. Out of these troubled times, our fifth objective\u2014a new world order\u2014can emerge; a new era, freer from the threat of terror, stronger in the pursuit of justice, and more secure in the quest for peace.

Both concepts advocate for a more cooperative and peaceful international community with a focus on justice, security, and prosperity for all nations. Woodrow Wilson's Fourteen Points were a statement of principles for peace that he believed would put an end to war by addressing the root causes of World War I. Similarly, President Bush's vision for a \"new world order\" was a call for a new era of cooperation among nations, free from the threat of terror and aggression, in the aftermath of the Cold War."
