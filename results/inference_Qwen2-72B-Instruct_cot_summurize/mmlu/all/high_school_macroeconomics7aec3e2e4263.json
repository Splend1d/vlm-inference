This leads to an increase in imports and a decrease in domestic production, as domestic producers cannot compete with the lower world prices.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. The United States begins to import rice to make up for a domestic shortage.\n\nHowever, this choice implies that there's a shortage, which might not be the case. A more accurate explanation would be that the U.S. begins to import rice because it is cheaper on the global market, leading to a decrease in domestic production but not necessarily due to a domestic shortage. If we're strictly adhering to the options given and aiming for the most accurate one, though, option A is the closest, assuming \"shortage\" refers to a relative shortage at the domestic price compared to the world price.\n\nBut if we want to be precise, the real implication here is that:\n\nThe United States begins to import rice because it is cheaper on the world market than what domestic producers can offer, and this will lead to a decrease in domestic production as the domestic surplus (relative to the demand at the world price) is reduced by imports. This scenario does not match any of the given options perfectly, but A is the closest fit. \n\nSo, considering the options provided, the technically most correct answer is:\n\nC. The United States begins to import rice to eliminate a domestic surplus.\n\nThis choice acknowledges that the domestic price was higher because of a surplus that could not be sold at the domestic price, and the imports help to clear that surplus by providing an alternative supply at a lower price point."
