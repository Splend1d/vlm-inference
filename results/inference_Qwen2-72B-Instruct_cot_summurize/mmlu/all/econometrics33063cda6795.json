The parameters can indeed be validly estimated using separate applications of OLS to each equation because there is no simultaneity problem. In a recursive system, each equation has its own set of exogenous variables that do not appear endogenously in any previous equation.\n\nii) True. The independent variables in one equation may be correlated with the error terms in other equations. This is acceptable in a recursive system since the correlation does not violate the assumptions necessary for OLS estimation in each individual equation.\n\niii) False. An application of 2SLS (Two-Stage Least Squares) would generally lead to consistent and potentially more efficient parameter estimates compared to OLS if there are endogenous regressors. However, in a triangular or recursive system where there are no simultaneous equations, 2SLS might not be necessary and could lead to less efficient estimates than OLS due to the additional variance introduced by the two-stage process.\n\niv) False. In a triangular or recursive system, the independent variables should not be correlated with the error terms in the equations in which they appear as independent variables. If this occurs, it violates one of the key assumptions of OLS estimation and can lead to biased and inconsistent parameter estimates.\n\nGiven these explanations, the correct answer is A. (ii) and (iv) only, except that statement (iv) is not true for a triangular or recursive system. However, based on the options provided and assuming the question intends to identify which statements can be true under certain conditions, (ii) is indeed a correct statement for such systems. Statement (i) is also true, but since (iii) and (iv) are not true, the closest correct option according to the question's structure is A. (ii) only, but considering (i)'s validity, none of the provided options perfectly matches the criteria without some qualification about (iv)."
