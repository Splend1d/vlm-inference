                    "text": "The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) is a fundamental concept in statistics that describes the characteristics of the sampling distribution of means for a large number of random samples drawn from any population. Here's how the options relate to the CLT:\n\nI. The mean of the sampling distribution of \\(\\bar{x}\\) is the same as the mean of the population.\n- This statement is true. According to the CLT, the mean of the sampling distribution of the sample means (\\(\\bar{x}\\)) is equal to the population mean (\\(\\mu\\)).\n\nII. The standard deviation of the sampling distribution of \\(\\bar{x}\\) is the same as the standard deviation of \\(x\\) divided by the square root of the sample size.\n- This statement is also true. The standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the sample means, often referred to as the standard error, is calculated as the population standard deviation (\\(\\sigma\\)) divided by the square root of the sample size (\\(n\\)). So, the formula is \\(\\sigma_{\\bar{x}} = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}\\).\n\nIII. If the sample size is large, the shape of the sampling distribution of \\(\\bar{x}\\) is approximately normal.\n- This statement is true as well. The CLT states that regardless of the shape of the underlying population distribution, the sampling distribution of the sample means will approach a normal distribution as the sample size increases.\n\nTherefore, all three statements correctly describe aspects of the Central Limit Theorem.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nE. I, II, and III\n\nHowever, since the provided options do not include \"I, II, and III,\" it seems there might have been an oversight in listing the possible answers. Based on the given options (A through D), none directly match the correct assessment. However, if we must choose from the provided options, the closest correct answer would be:\n\nB. I & II only\n\nThis is because option B includes the two correct statements (I and II), but it does not include statement III, which is also correct. Ideally, an option including all three statements should have been available."
