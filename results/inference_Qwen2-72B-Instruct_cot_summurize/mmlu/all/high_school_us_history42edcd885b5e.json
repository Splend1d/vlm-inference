There they may be secured in the enjoyment of governments of their own choice, subject to no other control from the United States than such as may be necessary to preserve peace on the frontier and between the several tribes. There the benevolent may endeavor to teach them the arts of civilization. . . .\n\"This emigration would be voluntary, for it would be as cruel and unjust to compel the aborigines to abandon the graves of their fathers and seek a home in a distant land. But they should be distinctly informed that if they remain within the limits of the States they must be subject to their laws. . . .\"\n\u2014President Andrew Jackson, 1829\nWhich of the following Supreme Court decisions was the primary contributor to the system of segregation that Martin Luther King and others were trying to end?\n\nA.

Ferguson (1896).\n\nThis Supreme Court decision upheld the constitutionality of racial segregation under the \"separate but equal\" doctrine, which allowed states to maintain segregated facilities for blacks and whites so long as they were equal in quality. This decision provided the legal basis for the Jim Crow laws in the southern United States and was a major factor in the system of segregation that lasted until the Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nA. Dred Scott v. Sanford (1857) was a case that ruled African Americans could not be citizens and had no standing to sue in federal court. It also declared the Missouri Compromise unconstitutional.\n\nB. Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas (1954) was the landmark case that overturned Plessy v. Ferguson and declared that separate educational facilities are inherently unequal, thus paving the way for the desegregation of schools.\n\nC. Worcester v. Georgia (1831) was a case that ruled that states did not have the authority to impose regulations on Native American lands, which is related to the context of President Andrew Jackson's statement but not directly related to segregation."
