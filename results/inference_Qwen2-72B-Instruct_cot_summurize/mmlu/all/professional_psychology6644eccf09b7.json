This approach can actually increase aggression and fear, teach children to use power and threats to control others, and undermine their moral development by focusing on punishment rather than understanding and empathy. The other options (exposure to nonaggressive models, opportunities for catharsis, and social skills training) are all supported by research as effective methods for reducing aggression in children."
