Equality is impossible because men define women as different.\n\nThis proposition suggests a deterministic view where equality is inherently unattainable due to the way men perceive women. MacKinnon's argument, while acknowledging the power imbalance and the need for significant change, does not necessarily conclude that equality is impossible. Instead, she advocates for legal and social reforms to address and rectify the power disparities between men and women."
