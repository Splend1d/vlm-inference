Expectations of surpluses of goods in the future\n\nExpectations of future surpluses can lead consumers and businesses to delay purchases, anticipating lower prices or fearing economic downturns. This reduction in current spending decreases aggregate demand, shifting the aggregate demand curve to the left.\n\nThe other options (B, C, and D) would typically cause the aggregate demand curve to shift to the right:\n\nB. A decrease in income taxes increases disposable income for households, leading to increased consumption and higher aggregate demand.\nC. An increase in government spending directly increases aggregate demand as it is one of its components.\nD. An increase in foreign income can lead to increased demand for domestic goods (exports), which also shifts the aggregate demand curve to the right."
