This genome contains coding regions for several proteins, including the T antigens (large, middle, and small), which play critical roles in viral replication and transformation of host cells. The genome also includes regulatory regions that control the expression of these genes. Polyomaviruses do not have an RNA genome or a reverse transcriptase enzyme, and their genome is not segmented."
