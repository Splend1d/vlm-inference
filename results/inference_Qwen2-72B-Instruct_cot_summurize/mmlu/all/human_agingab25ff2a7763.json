Tai chi\n\nTai chi, a form of gentle martial arts that involves slow and controlled movements, has been found to be particularly effective in improving balance for older adults. Studies have shown that regular practice of tai chi can help reduce the risk of falls in older individuals by enhancing their balance, flexibility, and muscle strength.\n\nWhile aerobic exercise, weight lifting, and brisk walking can also offer health benefits to older adults, including improved cardiovascular health and increased muscle mass, they may not specifically target balance improvement as effectively as tai chi does."
