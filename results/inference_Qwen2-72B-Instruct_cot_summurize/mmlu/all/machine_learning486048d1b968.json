                    "text": "Increasing the value of the regularization parameter \u03bb in least-squares regression (also known as ridge regression when using L2 regularization) affects both the training and testing errors differently due to its bias-variance trade-off properties. Here's how:\n\n- **Training Error**: Increasing \u03bb adds more penalty on the magnitude of the coefficients, which makes the model simpler and potentially less capable of fitting the training data perfectly. This means that the training error is likely to increase as \u03bb increases. So, option B (\"will never increase the training error\") is incorrect, and option A (\"will never decrease the training error\") is correct in the sense that the training error will not decrease when \u03bb increases; it either remains the same or increases.\n\n- **Testing Error**: The effect of increasing \u03bb on the testing error is more nuanced. Initially, increasing \u03bb can help reduce overfitting by penalizing large coefficients, which might improve generalization and thus decrease the testing error. However, if \u03bb becomes too large, the model becomes overly simplified and underfits the data, leading to an increase in the testing error. Therefore, option C (\"will never decrease the testing error\") is incorrect because there is a range of \u03bb values where the testing error could decrease before it starts increasing again.\n\nGiven the options provided and focusing on the most direct answer regarding the testing error, the completion of your question seems to be cut off after \"increasing the value of the regularisation parameter \u03bb the testing error.\" Assuming you're asking what effect increasing \u03bb has on the testing error, the answer would be that it does not necessarily always increase or decrease it, but rather first decreases it up to an optimal point before potentially increasing it beyond that point.\n\nHowever, since the question seems to ask for an absolute statement and given the provided options, none directly matches this explanation. If we were to choose based on the given options, D. \"will never increase\" is not completed and doesn't form a full statement. But interpreting the spirit of the question and considering the effects on testing error, it's clear that increasing \u03bb can initially help in reducing testing error by controlling overfitting, so neither C nor D fully captures this behavior without additional context or clarification. \n\nIn summary, while increasing \u03bb can help in reducing testing error up to a certain point, it does not guarantee that the testing error will never decrease (making option C incorrect). And since option D is incomplete, we cannot definitively select it as the correct choice based on the standard options provided."
