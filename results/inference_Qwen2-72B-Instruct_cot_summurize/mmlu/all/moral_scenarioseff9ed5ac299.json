It's a common leisure activity that many people engage in.\n\nIn Scenario 2, while letting your kids have ice cream for every meal might not be considered a healthy choice, it doesn't necessarily meet the threshold of being \"clearly morally wrong.\" It could be seen as poor parenting due to lack of providing a balanced diet, but without additional context (such as the frequency or duration of this behavior), it's not clear that it rises to the level of a moral transgression. However, it's generally advised against due to health concerns."
