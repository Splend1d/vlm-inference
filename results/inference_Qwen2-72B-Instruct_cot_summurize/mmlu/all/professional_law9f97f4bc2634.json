                    "text": "On January 31, a supermarket entered into a written contract with a produce company to purchase oranges. The contract contained a provision wherein the supermarket promised to purchase \"as many oranges as required, but at a minimum 100 bushels per month at a price of $20 per bushel for the next year. \" The agreement also provided that any modifications must be in writing. On February 1, the produce company shipped the supermarket 70 bushels of oranges, which were accepted and paid for. On March 1, the produce company tendered 80 bushels of oranges, which the supermarket accepted and paid for. On April 1, the produce company delivered 100 bushels of oranges to the supermarket. This shipment was accepted and also was promptly paid for. On April 2, the manager of the supermarket became concerned because a Florida drought had resulted in a sharp increase in the price of oranges. Consequently, the manager consulted the supermarket's attorney, who advised him to demand adequate assurances that the produce company would perform its obligations under the terms of the contract. Heeding the attorney's advice, the manager sent a letter on April 3 to the produce company, expressing his concern and requesting an adequate assurance of due performance for the balance of the contract. This letter was received by the produce company on April 4. Which of the following best states the supermarket's legal rights against the produce company?\n\nA. Cancel the contract on May 1, cover immediately and then sue for damages.\nB. Wait until the May 1 shipment; if it doesn't comply, demand adequate assurances, and not obtaining them, then sue for damages.\nC. Wait until the end of the contract and then sue for damages.\nD. Wait a reasonable time not to exceed 30 days; if adequate assurances are not received, cancel the contract, cover immediately and then sue for damages.\n"

                    "text": "Under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), when a party to a contract has grounds for insecurity about the other party's performance, they may demand adequate assurances of due performance. If the other party fails to provide such assurances within a reasonable time, generally not exceeding 30 days, the demanding party may treat the failure as an anticipatory repudiation and take appropriate action.\n\nIn this case, the supermarket is entitled to request adequate assurances from the produce company due to the Florida drought and the subsequent increase in the price of oranges, which could impact the produce company's ability to perform under the contract. Since the supermarket requested adequate assurances on April 3 and the produce company received the request on April 4, the produce company has a reasonable time, not exceeding 30 days, to provide these assurances.\n\nIf the produce company does not provide adequate assurances within that time frame, the supermarket can consider the contract breached and take appropriate action. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Wait a reasonable time not to exceed 30 days; if adequate assurances are not received, cancel the contract, cover immediately and then sue for damages.\n\nThis option allows the supermarket to give the produce company a chance to confirm their ability to fulfill the contract while reserving the right to terminate the contract and seek damages if the assurances are not provided."
