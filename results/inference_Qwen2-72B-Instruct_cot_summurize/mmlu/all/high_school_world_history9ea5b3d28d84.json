The passage describes how the speaker, Sanehat, was appointed to a position of power and responsibility due to his demonstrated abilities as a military leader. This suggests that the ruler of Syria valued skill and accomplishment when making appointments, rather than simply relying on familial or tribal connections. Additionally, the fact that Sanehat was able to rise to a position of leadership despite being an outsider (as evidenced by the fact that he was not one of the ruler's sons) further supports the idea that merit was an important factor in appointments during this time period."
