They signed a contract that said that if they purchased new items on the account, they would not own the old purchases until the new ones were paid in full. That provision was in fine print on the reverse side of the papers. When husband lost his job, they had by that time paid for everything purchased on the account except for one chair they bought a few weeks earlier. The store sued, trying to repossess all furniture ever sold to the couple. Will the couple likely prevail on a defense of unconscionability?\n\nA. No, because they might be able to find another store to sell them furniture, which proves that there was no lack of bargaining power.\nB. No, because the store was nice enough to extend credit, and the couple should be expected to pay for everything before they own any of it.\nC. Yes, because any time a seller puts terms in fine print it is proof of bad faith and unconscionability.\nD. Yes, because a combination of factors makes it likely that the court will recognize unconscionability under these circumstances.\n"

Yes, because a combination of factors makes it likely that the court will recognize unconscionability under these circumstances.\n\nUnconscionability is a legal doctrine used to invalidate contracts or clauses within contracts that are grossly unfair or one-sided. In this case, several factors could contribute to a finding of unconscionability:\n\n1. **Fine Print and Lack of Notice**: The clause was in fine print on the reverse side of the papers, suggesting that the couple may not have been adequately informed about its existence or implications. This lack of transparency can be indicative of procedural unconscionability.\n\n2. **Exploitation of Vulnerability**: The couple had less than perfect credit, making them potentially more vulnerable to accepting unfavorable terms due to limited options for financing.\n\n3. **One-Sidedness of the Contract**: The clause allows the store to repossess all previously paid-for items based on non-payment of a single item. This is an extreme measure that could be seen as disproportionately harsh and not reflective of fair business practices.\n\n4. **Lack of Bargaining Power**: The couple's financial situation at the time of signing the contract might indicate that they did not have significant bargaining power to negotiate better terms.\n\n5. **Reasonableness of the Term**: It is reasonable to expect that once an item has been fully paid for, it is owned by the buyer. The term that allows the store to repossess already paid-for items goes against this expectation and could be considered unreasonable.\n\nGiven these factors, it is likely that a court would consider the clause unconscionable and rule in favor of the couple, preventing the store from repossessing the furniture that has already been paid for."
