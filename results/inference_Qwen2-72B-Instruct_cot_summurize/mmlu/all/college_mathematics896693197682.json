The ring of complex numbers does not have any zero divisors. This is because if \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are complex numbers and \\(ab = 0\\), then either \\(a = 0\\) or \\(b = 0\\). This follows from the fact that \\(\\mathbb{C}\\) is a field.\n\nB. The ring of integers modulo 11, denoted by \\(\\mathbb{Z}/11\\mathbb{Z}\\), is also a field (since 11 is prime). In fields, the only element that can multiply with another element to give zero is zero itself. Therefore, this ring does not have any zero divisors.\n\nC. The ring of continuous real-valued functions on \\([0, 1]\\) does indeed have zero divisors. For example, consider the functions \\(f(x) = x\\) and \\(g(x) = 1 - x\\). Both functions are continuous on \\([0, 1]\\), and neither is identically zero. However, their product \\(f(x)g(x) = x(1-x)\\) is zero at \\(x = 0\\) and \\(x = 1\\), and hence it is not true that \\(f(x)g(x) = 0\\) implies \\(f(x) = 0\\) or \\(g(x) = 0\\) for all \\(x\\) in \\([0, 1]\\). So, this ring has zero divisors.\n\nD. The ring \\(\\{a + b\\sqrt{2} : a, b \\in \\mathbb{Q}\\}\\) is an integral domain (a commutative ring with no zero divisors). To see this, suppose we had two elements \\(a + b\\sqrt{2}\\) and \\(c + d\\sqrt{2}\\) in the ring such that \\((a + b\\sqrt{2})(c + d\\sqrt{2}) = 0\\). Expanding the product gives us \\(ac + 2bd + (ad + bc)\\sqrt{2} = 0\\). Since \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) is irrational, this equation holds if and only if \\(ac + 2bd = 0\\) and \\(ad + bc = 0\\). These equations imply that both factors must be zero (consider solving for \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(d\\) or vice versa), showing that this ring has no zero divisors.\n\nThus, the correct answer is C. The ring of continuous real-valued functions on \\([0, 1]\\) is the one where it is possible for the product of two nonzero elements to be zero."
