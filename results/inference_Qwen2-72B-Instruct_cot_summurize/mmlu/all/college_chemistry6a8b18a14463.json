H3O+ / H2O\n\nA conjugate acid-base pair consists of an acid and its corresponding base, where the base is formed by the acid losing a proton (H+). In the case of water (H2O), when it donates a proton, it becomes the hydroxide ion (OH-), but in this context, the pair given is H3O+ (the hydronium ion, which is water with an extra proton) and H2O (water itself). Thus, H3O+ is the conjugate acid of H2O, and H2O is the conjugate base of H3O+. \n\nA. HCl / NaOH is not a conjugate acid-base pair because they do not share a common atom or group; HCl and NaOH react to form NaCl and H2O.\n\nC. O2 / H2O is not a conjugate acid-base pair because oxygen (O2) does not act as an acid or base in the Br\u00f8nsted-Lowry sense, and it does not have a direct relationship with water in terms of proton transfer.\n\nD. H+ / Cl\u2212 is not considered a conjugate acid-base pair in the traditional sense because H+ is simply a proton, and Cl\u2212 is a chloride ion. However, one could argue that H+ and Cl\u2212 are related through the acid HCl, but the pair presented does not show the full relationship (i.e., HCl / Cl\u2212 would be more accurate)."
