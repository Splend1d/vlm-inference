Infants and children need the most protein dense food - Correct. During infancy and childhood, the body is growing and developing rapidly. Proteins are essential for this growth as they help in cell repair and the building of new cells. Hence, infants and children require more protein per unit of body weight than adults.\n\nB. Children are most susceptible to protein deficient diets - This can be true in certain contexts, especially in developing countries where malnutrition is prevalent. However, the statement doesn't necessarily reflect the protein:energy ratio of requirements, which is what the question seems to be asking.\n\nC. Young adults need the most protein dense food - Incorrect. While young adults do need protein for muscle development and maintenance, their requirements aren't typically higher than those of growing children on a per-unit-of-body-weight basis.\n\nD. The elderly need the most protein dense food - Incorrect. Elderly individuals do have specific protein needs to maintain muscle mass and support immune function, but these needs are not generally considered to be the highest among all age groups. In fact, some studies suggest that older adults may need more protein than previously thought, but this does not make them the group with the highest protein requirements. \n\nIt's important to note that individual protein needs can vary based on factors like activity level, health status, and other physiological factors."
