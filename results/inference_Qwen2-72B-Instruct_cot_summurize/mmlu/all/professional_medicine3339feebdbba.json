Her coworkers became concerned when she did not arrive for work. On arrival, she is unable to provide a history. Her pulse is 96/min, respirations are 12/min, and blood pressure is 124/58 mm Hg. Examination shows erythema, warmth, and induration of the upper back, buttocks, and posterior thighs. Her serum creatine kinase activity is 10,300 U/L. Urine toxicology screening is positive for opiates and cocaine. Urine dipstick is strongly positive for blood. Microscopic examination of the urine shows pigmented granular casts and rare erythrocytes. This patient is at increased risk for which of the following conditions over the next 24 hours?\n\nA. Acute respiratory distress syndrome\nB. Acute tubular necrosis\nC. Cerebral edema\nD. Cerebral hemorrhage\n"

Acute tubular necrosis\n\nThe patient's symptoms and lab results suggest rhabdomyolysis, a condition characterized by the breakdown of muscle tissue that releases myoglobin into the bloodstream. The presence of pigmented granular casts in the urine is consistent with this diagnosis, as myoglobin can cause kidney damage and lead to acute tubular necrosis. The high level of creatine kinase also supports this diagnosis. The positive urine toxicology screen for opiates and cocaine suggests that drug use may have contributed to the development of rhabdomyolysis."
