According to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as of 2019, the highest rates of new HIV diagnoses among people who inject drugs were in the states along the East Coast, including New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, and Florida. Therefore, option A (The east coast) would be the correct answer based on available data.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that HIV transmission among drug users can occur anywhere there is intravenous drug use and needle sharing, and efforts to reduce the spread of HIV through needle exchange programs and other harm reduction strategies are important across the country."
