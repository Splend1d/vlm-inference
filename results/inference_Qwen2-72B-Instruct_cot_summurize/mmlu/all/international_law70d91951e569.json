According to the definition of piracy under international law, an act of violence on the high seas qualifies as piracy if it is committed for private ends by the crew or the passengers of a private ship or aircraft and directed against a ship, aircraft, persons, or property in a place outside the jurisdiction of any state. Therefore, an illegal act of violence on the high seas would fall short of qualifying as piracy if it is not committed against another vessel and if it is not committed for 'private ends.' The other options listed either describe acts that could potentially qualify as piracy or are not relevant to the definition of piracy."
