The diagonal VECH model does not ensure a positive-definite variance-covariance matrix\n\nThe main disadvantage of the diagonal VECH approach that is addressed by the BEKK (Baba, Engle, Kraft, and Kroner) formulation is that the diagonal VECH model does not guarantee the positive definiteness of the conditional variance-covariance matrix. This can lead to unrealistic or nonsensical results, such as negative variances or covariance matrices that do not properly reflect the relationships between variables. The BEKK formulation, on the other hand, is designed to ensure that the variance-covariance matrix remains positive definite, which is a crucial property for meaningful financial modeling."
