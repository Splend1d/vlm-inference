Consider the product of three matrices N_1N_2N_3 that have, respectively, w rows and x columns, x rows and y columns, and y rows and z columns. Under what condition will it take less time to compute the product as (N_1N_2)N_3 (i.e., multiply the first two matrices first) than to compute it as N_1(N_2 N_3)?\n\nA. There is no such condition; i.e., they will always take the same time.\nB. 1/x + 1/z < 1/w + 1/y\nC. x > y\nD. 1/w + 1/x < 1/y + 1/z\n"
