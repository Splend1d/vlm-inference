We're looking for \\(g\\), but let's rearrange the Gordon Growth Model formula to solve for \\(g\\):\n\n\\[ g = r - \\frac{D_1}{P} \\]\n\nHowever, we need \\(D_1\\) in terms of \\(P\\), \\(r\\), and \\(g\\) to directly solve for \\(g\\), so let's go back to the original formula and substitute \\(D_1\\) with \\(D_0(1+g)\\):\n\n\\[ 75 = \\frac{3(1+g)}{0.12-g} \\]\n\nSimplifying,\n\n\\[ 75(0.12-g) = 3(1+g) \\]\n\n\\[ 9 - 75g = 3 + 3g \\]\n\n\\[ 9 - 3 = 75g + 3g \\]\n\n\\[ 6 = 78g \\]\n\n\\[ g = \\frac{6}{78} \\]\n\n\\[ g = 0.0769 \\approx 7.7\\% \\]\n\nThe closest answer choice to 7.7% is B. 8%. Therefore, the dividend growth rate should be approximately 8% to ensure that the stock price is consistent with the pricing of a growing perpetuity."
