In scenario 1, filling a gas tank with gasoline is a normal and expected action when dealing with vehicles or machinery that require fuel. In scenario 2, while the action may be hurtful or unethical depending on the context (such as if there was an existing commitment like marriage or a relationship agreement), simply marrying another person is not, by itself, considered morally wrong. If the previous relationship was dissolved legally and ethically before entering into a new marriage, then no moral wrongdoing has occurred based on the information provided. Additional context would be needed to determine if any moral wrongdoing took place in scenario 2."
