He argues that it is a first principle or an ultimate end, which cannot be demonstrated by reasoning because all reasoning aims at justifying something as a means to an end. As such, the principle of utility, which posits that actions are right in proportion as they tend to promote happiness and wrong as they tend to produce the reverse of happiness, is not subject to proof in the conventional sense. This is not a unique problem for utilitarianism but is characteristic of all ethical systems that rest on fundamental principles."
