The ratio of the frequencies of these two signals determines the number of loops in the figure.\n\nGiven that there are 5 horizontal tangencies and 2 vertical tangencies, this implies a frequency ratio of 5:2 between the horizontal and vertical inputs respectively. Since the horizontal input frequency is given as 100 Hz, we can set up a proportion to find the vertical input frequency:\n\n\\[ \\frac{f_{horizontal}}{f_{vertical}} = \\frac{5}{2} \\]\n\nGiven \\( f_{horizontal} = 100 \\) Hz,\n\n\\[ \\frac{100}{f_{vertical}} = \\frac{5}{2} \\]\n\nSolving for \\( f_{vertical} \\),\n\n\\[ f_{vertical} = \\frac{100 \\times 2}{5} = 40 \\times 2 = 400 \\] Hz.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. 400 Hz."
