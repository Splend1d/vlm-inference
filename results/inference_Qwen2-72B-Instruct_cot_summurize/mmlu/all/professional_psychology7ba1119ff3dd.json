This temperament style describes children who are initially cautious or reserved in new situations but can gradually become more comfortable and engaged over time with appropriate support and encouragement.\n\nThe child's behavior of holding tightly to her mother's hand and watching before joining in suggests a cautious approach to unfamiliar environments. However, her willingness to begin helping another child with a puzzle after some coaxing indicates that she is capable of becoming involved and interacting once she feels more secure. This gradual transition into participation is characteristic of children with a slow-to-warm-up temperament."
