A recursive procedure can operate without using any local variables. It could rely solely on parameters and global variables.\n- II. P has an execution path where it does not call itself: This statement must be true for P to be guaranteed to terminate. Without such a base case, P would continue calling itself indefinitely, leading to infinite recursion and non-termination.\n- III. P either refers to a global variable or has at least one parameter: This statement must also be true. A recursive procedure needs to have some way to access data that changes with each recursive call. This can be achieved by referring to a global variable or by passing parameters to the procedure. If neither were true, then each recursive call would operate on the same data, potentially leading to infinite recursion."
