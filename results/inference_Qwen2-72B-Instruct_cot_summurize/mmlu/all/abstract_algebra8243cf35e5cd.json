If a group \\(G\\) has order \\(p^2\\), where \\(p\\) is prime, then by the class equation or using the fact that the center of \\(G\\) cannot be trivial (as its order must divide \\(p^2\\) and cannot be \\(1\\)), we can show that \\(G\\) is either cyclic or a direct product of two cyclic groups of order \\(p\\). In both cases, \\(G\\) is Abelian.\n\nStatement 2: For a fixed prime \\(p\\), a Sylow \\(p\\)-subgroup of a group \\(G\\) is a normal subgroup of \\(G\\) if and only if it is the only Sylow \\(p\\)-subgroup of \\(G\\).\nThis statement is also true. According to Sylow's Theorems, all Sylow \\(p\\)-subgroups of a group \\(G\\) are conjugate to each other. If there is only one Sylow \\(p\\)-subgroup, it must be normal since it is conjugate only to itself. Conversely, if a Sylow \\(p\\)-subgroup is normal, then it is the only Sylow \\(p\\)-subgroup because any other Sylow \\(p\\)-subgroup would be conjugate to it, but conjugation by an element of \\(G\\) would map the normal Sylow \\(p\\)-subgroup to itself, implying there can't be another distinct Sylow \\(p\\)-subgroup."
