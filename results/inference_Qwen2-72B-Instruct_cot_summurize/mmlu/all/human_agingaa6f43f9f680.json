Anger and guilt\n\nNeuroticism is one of the Big Five personality traits, and it refers to the tendency to experience negative emotions such as anxiety, anger, and guilt. People high in neuroticism tend to be more sensitive to stress and have a higher likelihood of developing mental health issues like depression and anxiety disorders. Therefore, option A is the correct answer. \n\nOption B (apathy and indifference) is not typically associated with neuroticism, but rather with other personality traits or conditions such as low conscientiousness or depression.\n\nOption C (deceit and cunning) is more closely associated with the personality trait of Machiavellianism, which is characterized by manipulative behavior and a lack of concern for others.\n\nOption D (mania and hypertension) includes a psychiatric condition (mania) that is not directly related to neuroticism, although there may be some overlap in symptoms between mania and high levels of positive affectivity. Hypertension, on the other hand, is a medical condition that can be influenced by various factors including stress and personality, but it is not specifically linked to neuroticism."
