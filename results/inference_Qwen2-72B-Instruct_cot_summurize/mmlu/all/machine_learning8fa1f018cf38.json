These reviews were annotated with fine-grained sentiment labels.\n\nStatement 2 is also true because the Penn Treebank, a widely used resource in natural language processing, has indeed been employed for various tasks including language modeling. It provides syntactic annotations for text and has been instrumental in training models to understand grammatical structures and predict sequences of words."
