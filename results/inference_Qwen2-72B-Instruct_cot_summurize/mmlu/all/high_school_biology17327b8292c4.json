Water moves from the surrounding water into the potato.\n\nWhen a piece of potato is placed in pure water, the concentration of solutes is higher inside the potato cells than in the surrounding water. This creates an osmotic gradient, and water will move from the area of lower solute concentration (the pure water) to the area of higher solute concentration (inside the potato cells) by osmosis. This can cause the potato cells to swell as they take up water. Option C, plasmolysis, would occur if the potato was placed in a hypertonic solution, causing water to leave the cell and the cell membrane to pull away from the cell wall."
