Lekking behavior is a mating strategy used by some animals, particularly birds, in which males gather in a specific area to display for females. While natural enemies may influence various aspects of an organism's life history and ecology, lekking behavior is primarily driven by sexual selection, not predator avoidance or defense mechanisms against natural enemies. Aposematic coloration (warning coloration), chemical defenses, and masting (synchronous fruiting) are all adaptations that can help organisms avoid predation or parasitism."
