The next door neighbor, Tony, shared a concrete driveway that ran between the two houses but was entirely on Mort's side of the property line. Tony had been using the driveway for the past 25 years, during which time three different owners bought and sold Mort's house. When Mort applied to refinance his loan, his appraiser found an old survey showing the accurate property boundaries. Upset, Mort filed a suit against Tony for trespass. What is the likely result?\n\nA. Mort will prevail in an action for trespass, because Tony's use wasn't \"hostile.\"\nB. Mort will prevail because Tony's use wasn't \"open and notorious,\" since it was not widely known that he was on Mort's property.\nC. Tony will prevail if he used the driveway for the statutory period.\nD. Tony will prevail because the easement was due to necessity.\n"

Tony will prevail if he used the driveway for the statutory period.\n\nIn this scenario, Tony has been using the driveway for 25 years, during which time there have been multiple transfers of ownership of Mort's property. This suggests that Tony's use of the driveway has been continuous, open, and notorious, even if not necessarily hostile. The fact that the driveway is entirely on Mort's side of the property line does not automatically mean that Tony cannot claim an easement by prescription if he meets the statutory requirements, which typically include a certain period of continuous, open, and notorious use.\n\nIt's important to note that the specific laws regarding easements by prescription can vary by jurisdiction, so the exact statutory period and other requirements might differ. However, given the information provided, option C is the most likely outcome based on common legal principles related to easements by prescription. Options A and B are incorrect because they suggest that Tony's use of the driveway was not hostile or open and notorious, when in fact his long-term, uninterrupted use could satisfy those criteria. Option D is not applicable unless there is evidence that the easement was originally created out of necessity, which is not suggested in the scenario provided."
