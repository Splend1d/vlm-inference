Arthur may argue that the poor do not have a right to aid from the affluent because such a right would require a contract or agreement between the two parties, which has not been established. In other words, the affluent have not agreed to provide aid to the poor, and therefore, the poor cannot claim a right to it. However, this is a hypothetical scenario, and without further context, it is impossible to know for sure what Arthur's reasoning might be."
