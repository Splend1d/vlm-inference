However, for an MA process, we typically deal with the characteristic polynomial directly, which is derived from the MA operator.\n\nGiven the MA(2) process:\n\n\\[y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t\\]\n\nThis can be written in terms of the backshift operator \\(B\\) as:\n\n\\[y_t = (1 - 3B + B^2)u_t\\]\n\nThe characteristic polynomial associated with this MA process is given by:\n\n\\[1 - 3B + B^2 = 0\\]\n\nLet's solve this quadratic equation for \\(B\\):\n\n\\[B^2 - 3B + 1 = 0\\]\n\nUsing the quadratic formula where \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = -3\\), and \\(c = 1\\):\n\n\\[B = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\]\n\n\\[B = \\frac{3 \\pm \\sqrt{(-3)^2 - 4*1*1}}{2*1}\\]\n\n\\[B = \\frac{3 \\pm \\sqrt{9 - 4}}{2}\\]\n\n\\[B = \\frac{3 \\pm \\sqrt{5}}{2}\\]\n\nSo, the roots of the characteristic equation are:\n\n\\[B_1 = \\frac{3 + \\sqrt{5}}{2}\\]\n\n\\[B_2 = \\frac{3 - \\sqrt{5}}{2}\\]\n\nApproximating these values gives:\n\n\\[B_1 \\approx 2.618\\]\n\n\\[B_2 \\approx 0.382\\]\n\nNone of these exact values match the options provided directly. However, looking at the options and comparing them with our calculated roots, option C: 2 and -0.5 is not correct because we have positive roots. Option A: 1 and 2 has one value close to one of our roots (\\(2.618\\) is close to 2), but the other root does not match any of the options closely. \n\nIt's important to note that the characteristic roots of an MA process are typically presented in terms of their reciprocals since the roots are often defined as solutions to the equation in terms of \\(z^{-1}\\) rather than \\(B\\). The reciprocal of our roots would be:\n\n\\[z_1 = \\frac{1}{B_1} = \\frac{2}{3 + \\sqrt{5}}\\]\n\n\\[z_2 = \\frac{1}{B_2} = \\frac{2}{3 - \\sqrt{5}}\\]\n\n\\[z_1 \\approx 0.382\\]\n\n\\[z_2 \\approx 2.618\\]\n\nUnfortunately, neither of these sets of roots matches the options exactly. If we were to select the closest match based on the given options, option A (1 and 2) would be the closest, but it's important to clarify that the exact roots calculated do not precisely match any of the provided options. The closest approximation given the options would be A: 1 and 2, recognizing that there's no perfect match."
