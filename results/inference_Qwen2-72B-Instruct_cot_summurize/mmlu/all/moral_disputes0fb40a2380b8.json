By choosing not to take the lives of those who have committed heinous crimes, society demonstrates its commitment to the inherent worth of every individual, even those who have caused great harm. This perspective aligns with the idea that taking a life, even as punishment for a crime, diminishes the moral standing of the community that administers it."
