The United States has comparative advantage in salmon production, and Peru has comparative advantage in anchovy production.\n\nWhen countries trade based on comparative advantage, it means they specialize in producing and exporting goods that they can produce more efficiently than other goods relative to their trading partners. In this scenario, if the U.S. is trading salmon for anchovies, it implies that the U.S. can produce salmon more efficiently (relative to its opportunity cost of producing anchovies) than Peru can. Conversely, Peru can produce anchovies more efficiently (relative to its opportunity cost of producing salmon) than the U.S. can. This allows both countries to benefit from trade by consuming more of both goods than they could produce individually."
