If no such n exists, the characteristic is said to be 0.\n\nIn the case of the ring \\(\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\math{Z}\\), we consider the elements \\((1, 0)\\) and \\((0, 1)\\) as the generators corresponding to the multiplicative identities of each copy of \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\). To find the characteristic of this ring, we need to determine if there exists a smallest positive integer \\(n\\) such that \\(n \\cdot (1, 0) = (0, 0)\\) and \\(n \\cdot (0, 1) = (0, 0)\\).\n\nLet's consider multiplying any element in \\(\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}\\) by an integer \\(n\\):\n\\[n \\cdot (a, b) = (na, nb)\\]\n\nFor this product to equal the additive identity \\((0, 0)\\), both components must individually be zero:\n\\[na = 0\\]\n\\[nb = 0\\]\n\nSince \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\) is the ring of integers, the only way for \\(na = 0\\) and \\(nb = 0\\) for some non-zero \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) is if \\(n = 0\\). This means there is no positive integer \\(n\\) such that \\(n \\cdot (a, b) = (0, 0)\\) for all \\((a, b) \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}\\), except when \\(n = 0\\).\n\nTherefore, the characteristic of the ring \\(\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}\\) is:\n\nA. 0"
