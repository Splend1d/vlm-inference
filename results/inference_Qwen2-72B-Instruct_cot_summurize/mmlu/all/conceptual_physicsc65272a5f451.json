Gamma\n\nHowever, it's important to note that passengers and crew are exposed primarily to neutrons and muons, which are secondary particles produced by the interaction of primary cosmic rays (which include protons, alpha particles, and heavier nuclei) with the Earth's atmosphere. These interactions produce a shower of secondary particles, including gamma rays. But when we talk about the radiation dose received at airplane altitudes, it's mostly due to these secondary particles rather than the primary cosmic rays themselves or direct gamma radiation. So, while the answer \"Gamma\" might be technically correct in terms of the types of radiation present, the more accurate description would be that the exposure is to a mix of secondary particles resulting from cosmic ray interactions with the atmosphere."
