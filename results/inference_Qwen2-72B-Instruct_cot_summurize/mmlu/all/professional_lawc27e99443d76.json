In accordance with the supplier's customary business practice, the sales agent then mailed the following confirmation letter, which he signed and dated:\"As per your telephone order, this letter serves to confirm the purchase of 36 dozen cashmere socks, color purple, size 10 \u0080\u009413, at the agreed price of $250 per dozen. Total sales price: $9,000. \"This letter was received by the man, who briefly glanced at it but failed to notice the \"36 dozen\" wording or the total price. The man placed the letter in his files and did not respond to it. Three weeks later, the supplier tendered 36 dozen purple cashmere socks, which the man rejected on the grounds that he had ordered only three dozen. The supplier resold the same purple cashmere socks to another buyer for a total price of $8,000. The supplier sued the man for the $1,000 difference. If the man pleads the statute of frauds as a defense, will such a defense be successful?\n\nA. Yes, because the statute was not satisfied by the supplier's tender of the goods, which were rejected by the man, and the supplier did not rely on the oral agreement other than by attempting delivery.\nB. Yes, because the agreed price for three dozen socks was over $500, and the supplier's written memo incorrectly stated the quantity of goods ordered.\nC. No, because the supplier's written memo was sufficient to satisf' the statute as against the supplier, and the man, having reason to know of the memo's contents, failed to give notice of objection within 10 days of receipt.\nD. No, because the supplier's written memo operated as an acceptance, with proposals for additional terms that became part of the contract after the man failed to object to such additional terms within a reasonable time.\n"

No, because the supplier's written memo was sufficient to satisfy the statute as against the supplier, and the man, having reason to know of the memo's contents, failed to give notice of objection within 10 days of receipt. Under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), a written confirmation of an oral contract for the sale of goods is enforceable if it is sent by one party to the other within a reasonable time and the recipient fails to object in writing within 10 days of receipt. In this case, the man received the confirmation letter, but he did not object to the quantity stated in the letter within the required time frame. Therefore, the man cannot use the statute of frauds as a defense.\n\nAdditionally, the UCC states that when a written confirmation is used to confirm an oral contract, any additional terms included in the confirmation become part of the contract unless they materially alter the original agreement or the recipient objects to them within a reasonable time. In this case, the additional term regarding the quantity of goods did not materially alter the original agreement since both parties had agreed on the price per dozen. Since the man did not object to the additional term within a reasonable time, it became part of the contract."
