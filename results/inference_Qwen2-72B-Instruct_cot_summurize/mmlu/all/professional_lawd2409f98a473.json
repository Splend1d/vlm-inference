At trial, the plaintiff is prepared to testify that a janitor at the company told her that he had heard her supervisor say to other male coworkers about her, \"Make it hard for her. Maybe she'll go home where she belongs.\" Is the plaintiff's proposed testimony admissible?\n\nA. No, because the janitor's statement is hearsay not within any exception.\nB. No, because the statements of both the janitor and the supervisor are hearsay not within any exception.\nC. Yes, because the janitor's statement is a present sense impression, and the supervisor's statement is a statement of his then-existing state of mind.\nD. Yes, because the statements of both the janitor and the supervisor are statements janitor and the supervisor are statements concerning a matter within the scope of their employment.\n"

                    "text": "The plaintiff's proposed testimony is likely admissible under Federal Rules of Evidence Rule 801(d)(2)(D), which allows for the admission of statements by an opposing party's employee on a matter within the scope of employment made during the period of employment. The supervisor's statement would fall under this rule as it pertains to his decision-making process regarding the plaintiff's employment, which is directly relevant to the case.\n\nHowever, the janitor's statement is hearsay since it is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted (that the supervisor said those words). But it may be admissible under the hearsay exception for a statement of then-existing state of mind, emotion, sensation, or physical condition, including a statement of intent, plan, motive, design, mental feeling, pain, and bodily health if:\n\n- It relates to the declarant's state of mind, emotion, sensation, or physical condition (e.g., intent, plan, motive, emotion, pain, and bodily health) when made;\n- It was made reasonably contemporaneously with the state of mind, emotion, sensation, or physical condition; and\n- It is established that the statement was made in good faith and not in contemplation of litigation.\n\nIn this context, the janitor's statement could be considered admissible as evidence of the supervisor's state of mind, as it reflects the supervisor's attitude toward the plaintiff, which is relevant to the issue of discrimination. Therefore, the correct answer would be D. Yes, because the statements of both the janitor and the supervisor are statements concerning a matter within the scope of their employment. However, it should be noted that the specific rules of evidence applicable in the jurisdiction where the case is being tried may vary, and the judge will ultimately decide on the admissibility of the evidence based on these rules."
