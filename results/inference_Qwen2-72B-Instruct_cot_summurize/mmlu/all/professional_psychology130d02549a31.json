This theory posits that a neutral stimulus (the benign object or event) becomes associated with a stimulus that naturally produces a fear response (an unconditioned stimulus). After several pairings, the neutral stimulus can elicit a fear response on its own, becoming a conditioned stimulus. This learned association between the neutral stimulus and the fear response is what characterizes a phobia."
