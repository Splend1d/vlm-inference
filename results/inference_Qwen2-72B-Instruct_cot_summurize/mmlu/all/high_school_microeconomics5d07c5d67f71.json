This is why the production possibilities frontier (PPF) typically curves outward rather than being a straight line. It does not imply that prices will always rise when the cost of making a good rises (option C), although higher production costs can lead to higher prices. Options A and D are incorrect because the law of increasing costs applies to all goods, including guns and butter, and does not cause the PPF to be a straight line but rather bowed outwards."
