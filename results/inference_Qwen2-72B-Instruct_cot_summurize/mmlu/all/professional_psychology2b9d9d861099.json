This means that age is reasonably necessary to the normal operation of the business or the performance of the job. For example, certain jobs may have age restrictions due to legal requirements, such as a minimum age for driving a commercial vehicle or serving alcohol. However, it is important to note that age discrimination is illegal under federal law, except in cases where age is a BFOQ.\n\nTherefore, option B is the correct answer. Options A, C, and D are not appropriate reasons to ask a person's age during personnel selection, as they may be considered discriminatory and violate anti-discrimination laws."
