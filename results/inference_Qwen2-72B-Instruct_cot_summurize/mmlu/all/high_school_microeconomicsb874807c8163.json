Marginal Product of Labor begins to fall.\n\nDiminishing marginal returns occur in the short run when an increase in the number of variable factors, such as labor, causes the marginal product (the output produced by the last unit of labor) to decrease. This happens after a certain point where the additional workers have less productive equipment or resources to work with, leading to a lower increase in total output per additional worker hired. It does not necessarily mean that the total product is falling (option B), nor that the average product is falling (option A), although these can occur later as more units of the variable input are added. The marginal product becoming negative (option C) would indicate that adding another unit of the variable input actually decreases the total output, which is a more extreme case that occurs after diminishing marginal returns have set in."
