Codeine Phosphate, Morphine, and Fentanyl are all opioids that are subject to control under international drug control conventions and national laws due to their potential for abuse and dependence. Therefore, none of the listed items is not a controlled drug. However, if I must choose one, I would say that the question might be aiming at a scenario where the dosage or formulation might be less strictly controlled than others, but in reality, all of these substances are controlled.\n\nFor instance, some countries may have different schedules or levels of control based on the formulation or dosage, but generally speaking, all of these substances require a prescription and are regulated to prevent misuse. It's important to note that the specific regulations can vary by country, so it's always best to consult local laws and guidelines regarding controlled substances."
