A change in attitude is a common example of an outcome evaluation. This could be measuring shifts in public opinion, changes in employee attitudes toward workplace policies, or alterations in consumer perceptions of a brand after a marketing campaign.\n\nD. Size of attentive audience\nWhile not as direct a measure of impact as a change in attitude, the size of an attentive audience can also be considered an outcome in certain contexts. For instance, in evaluating the success of a public event, seminar, or webinar, the number of people who actively engaged with the content can be seen as a positive outcome. This metric can indicate the reach and interest generated by the event or campaign. However, it's important to note that while a large attentive audience might suggest initial interest, it doesn't necessarily translate into lasting impact or behavior change."
