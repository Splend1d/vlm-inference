The percent correct P can be calculated as:\n\n\\[ P = \\left( \\frac{C}{N} \\right) \\times 100\\% = \\left( \\frac{N - E}{N} \\right) \\times 100\\% \\]\n\nThis is a linear relationship between E (the number of errors) and P (the percent correct). As E increases by a constant amount, P decreases by a constant amount, and vice versa. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Linear"
