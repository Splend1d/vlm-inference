This is because, according to Bem, people have limited access to their internal states and may rely on external information, such as their observed behavior, to make inferences about their attitudes and emotions. This contrasts with cognitive dissonance theory (option A), which posits that people experience psychological discomfort when their behaviors contradict their attitudes, leading them to adjust one or the other to reduce the dissonance. Options B and C refer to social comparison theory and the fundamental attribution error, respectively, neither of which are directly related to Bem's self-perception theory."
