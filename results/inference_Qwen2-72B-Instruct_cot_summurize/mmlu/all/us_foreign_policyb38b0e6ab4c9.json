Specifically, Krauthammer meant:\n\nB. An opportunity to use the collapse of the Soviet Union to extend US power.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that Krauthammer used this term somewhat critically, suggesting that the unipolar moment was fleeting and not necessarily a stable or desirable long-term state of affairs. He argued that while the U.S. enjoyed unmatched military and economic power following the fall of the Soviet Union, this situation would not last indefinitely and that other powers would eventually rise to challenge American dominance."
