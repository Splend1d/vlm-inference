They serve American interests\n\nLiberal internationalists argue that international institutions are crucial to US grand strategy because they help promote and protect American interests on the global stage. These institutions provide a platform for the US to shape the rules and norms of international relations, facilitate cooperation with other countries, and address transnational challenges like climate change, terrorism, and economic stability. By participating in these institutions, the US can project its power and influence more effectively and legitimize its actions through multilateralism."
