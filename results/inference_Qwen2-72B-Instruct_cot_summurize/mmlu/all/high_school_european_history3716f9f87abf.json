Your Committee object to the words Household Suffrage since under any honest definition of the words\u2014they would exclude a large majority of the men of these kingdoms\u2014and because they have become reasonably obnoxious to the political portion of the working people.\n\u2014Excerpt of a letter from British social reformer Francis Place, written in 1842\nThe primary goal of the Chartist movement was which of the following?\n\nA.

The passage mentions \"Household Suffrage,\" which was a term used by the Chartists to describe their demand for universal male suffrage, meaning the right to vote for all adult men regardless of property ownership. However, as noted in the passage, even this term excluded women from the franchise, and thus it did not represent true universal suffrage."
