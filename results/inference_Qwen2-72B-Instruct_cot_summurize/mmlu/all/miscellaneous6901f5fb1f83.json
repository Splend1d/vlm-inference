Pete Rose, although he has been declared permanently ineligible from baseball due to gambling allegations and thus has not been elected to the Hall of Fame, he leads in career hits among these options provided. However, it should be noted that technically Pete Rose is not \"among players never elected to Baseball's Hall of Fame\" because he has been ineligible for induction due to his lifetime ban from baseball. But based on the options given and interpreting the question as asking about players who have not been inducted into the Hall of Fame for whatever reason, then Pete Rose would indeed be the correct answer with 4,256 career hits. \n\nSteve Garvey (A) has 2,509 hits, Jim Rice (B) has 2,452 hits and Ken Griffey Jr (D) has 2,781 hits, all of which are less than Pete Rose's total. Also, Ken Griffey Jr. is actually in the Hall of Fame."
