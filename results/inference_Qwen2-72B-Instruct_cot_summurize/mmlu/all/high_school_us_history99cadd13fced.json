But about the 16th of March, a certain Indian came boldly amongst them and spoke to them in broken English, which they could well understand but marveled at it. At length they understood by discourse with him, that he was not of these parts, but belonged to the eastern parts where some English ships came to fish, with whom he was acquainted and could name sundry of them by their names, amongst whom he had got his language. He became profitable to them in acquainting them with many things concerning the state of the country in the east parts where he lived, which was afterwards profitable unto them; as also of the people here, of their names, number and strength, of their situation and distance from the place, and who was chief amongst them. His name was Samoset. He told them also of another Indian whose name was Squanto, a native of this place, who had been in England and could speak better English than himself.\n\u2014William Bradford, History of Plymouth Plantation\nThe Pilgrims traveled to America and settled at Plymouth because\n\nA. they were hoping to escape crushing debts in England.\nB. they hoped to find gold or establish a lucrative trade in furs.\nC. they were religious Separatists looking for a place to freely practice their faith.\nD. they were ordered to establish an outpost to watch the French in Canada.\n"

They were a group of English Dissenters, also known as Separatists, who sought to break away from the Church of England due to their dissatisfaction with its practices and doctrines. They believed in a simpler form of worship and wanted to practice their religion without interference from the Crown or the established church. After initially seeking refuge in the Netherlands, they eventually decided to move to America in search of a new home where they could live according to their beliefs."
