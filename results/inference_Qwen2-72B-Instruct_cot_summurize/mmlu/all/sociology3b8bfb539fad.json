They view patriarchy as intertwined with capitalism, where women's domestic labor is exploited by the capitalist economy (option C), and they see it as part of the dual systems of oppression consisting of capitalism and male domination (option D). Marxist feminists argue that these systems work together to maintain social, economic, and political inequalities between men and women.\n\nOption A is generally true but does not capture the essence of Marxist feminist theory. Option B is also partially correct as it touches on the concept of class oppression but does not specifically address the Marxist feminist perspective on how this relates to capitalism."
