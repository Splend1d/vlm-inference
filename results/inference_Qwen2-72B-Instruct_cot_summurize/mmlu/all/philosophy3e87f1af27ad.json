Moore's ethical philosophy, presented in his book \"Principia Ethica,\" the concept of \"good\" is not synonymous with pleasure, nor is it reducible to any natural property or descriptive feature. Instead, \"good\" is a non-natural, indefinable quality that can be perceived through intuition. When we think about good, we are thinking about something that has intrinsic value, meaning value in and of itself, not merely as a means to an end."
