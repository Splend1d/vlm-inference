This means that the polynomial should not have any roots in \\(\\mathbb{Z}_3\\), and it should not factor into polynomials of lower degree with coefficients in \\(\\mathbb{Z}_3\\).\n\nLet's examine each option for \\(c\\):\n\n### A. \\(c = 0\\)\n\nThe polynomial becomes \\(x^3 + x^2\\). This can be factored as \\(x^2(x+1)\\), which means it is reducible, and thus \\(\\mathbb{Z}_3[x]/(x^3 + x^2)\\) is not a field.\n\n### B. \\(c = 2\\)\n\nThe polynomial is \\(x^3 + x^2 + 2\\). Let's check if it has roots in \\(\\mathbb{Z}_3\\):\n- For \\(x = 0\\), we have \\(0^3 + 0^2 + 2 = 2\\).\n- For \\(x = 1\\), we have \\(1^3 + 1^2 + 2 = 4 \\equiv 1\\).\n- For \\(x = 2\\), we have \\(2^3 + 2^2 + 2 = 8 + 4 + 2 = 14 \\equiv 2\\).\n\nNone of these are zero in \\(\\mathbb{Z}_3\\), so the polynomial has no roots in \\(\\mathbb{Z}_3\\). We also need to check if it factors into lower-degree polynomials. The only possible factors (up to multiplication by a constant) are linear terms, since a quadratic term would imply a root exists. Since there are no roots, the polynomial does not factor, and hence is irreducible. Therefore, \\(\\mathbb{Z}_3[x]/(x^3 + x^2 + 2)\\) is a field.\n\n### C. \\(c = 1\\)\n\nThe polynomial is \\(x^3 + x^2 + 1\\). Checking for roots:\n- For \\(x = 0\\), we have \\(0^3 + 0^2 + 1 = 1\\).\n- For \\(x = 1\\), we have \\(1^3 + 1^2 + 1 = 3 \\equiv 0\\).\n\nThus, \\(x=1\\) is a root, meaning the polynomial is reducible, and \\(\\mathbb{Z}_3[x]/(x^3 + x^2 + 1)\\) is not a field.\n\n### D. \\(c = 3\\)\n\nSince we are working in \\(\\mathbb{Z}_3\\), \\(c = 3\\) is equivalent to \\(c = 0\\), which we've already determined does not yield a field.\n\n**Answer:**\nOnly when \\(c = 2\\) does \\(\\mathbb{Z}_3[x]/(x^3 + x^2 + c)\\) form a field.\n\n**Correct choice:**\nB. 2"
