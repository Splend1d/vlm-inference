Moral values are both independent and objective.\n\nIn \"Justice for Hedgehogs,\" Ronald Dworkin argues that there are objective moral truths that exist independently of human beliefs or social constructs. He posits that these moral truths have a real existence and can be discovered through rational inquiry, much like scientific facts. This view stands in contrast to moral relativism or subjectivism, which suggest that moral values are culturally determined or based on individual preferences."
