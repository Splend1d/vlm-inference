It did not even grudge us the spectacle of the conflict. More than sixty thousand fell, not beneath the Roman arms and weapons, but, grander far, before our delighted eyes. May the tribes, I pray, ever retain if not love for us, at least hatred for each other; for while the destinies of empire hurry us on, fortune can give no greater boon than discord among our foes.\"\nGermania, Publius Cornelius Tacitus, ca. 98 C.E.\nWhich of the following contributed LEAST to the decline of the Roman Empire?\n\nA. Civil wars between rivals for the throne\nB. Incursions of barbarian peoples into the empire\nC. The persistence of the senate as a body of government in the empire\nD.

However, based on historical knowledge, we can infer that:\n\nA. Civil wars between rivals for the throne: This was a significant factor in the decline of the Roman Empire, as it weakened the central authority and diverted resources away from defense and administration.\n\nB. Incursions of barbarian peoples into the empire: As mentioned in the passage, this was a major challenge for the Roman Empire, leading to the loss of territories and weakening its military power.\n\nC. The persistence of the senate as a body of government in the empire: While the role of the Senate diminished over time, especially during the later stages of the Empire when the emperors held more power, its existence did not significantly contribute to the decline of the Roman Empire. In fact, the Senate could sometimes serve as a stabilizing force, although its influence was limited.\n\nD. Demographic weakness on account of diseases and epidemics: Diseases such as the Antonine Plague and the Plague of Cyprian had devastating effects on the population and economy of the Roman Empire, contributing to its decline.\n\nGiven these points, option C (the persistence of the senate as a body of government in the empire) contributed the least to the decline of the Roman Empire."
