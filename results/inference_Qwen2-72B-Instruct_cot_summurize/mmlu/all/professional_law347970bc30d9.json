Subsequent to the statute a resident alien enters into a contract to buy 50 acres of land located in the state. Assume that the statute empowers the state to bring an ejectment action against any alien who owns more than 10 acres of land. If the resident alien brings an action in federal court to enjoin the state from enforcing the statute against him, his best argument is\n\nA. the statute violates the privileges or immunities clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nB. the statute violates the contract clause.\nC. the statute violates the commerce clause in that it interferes with land ownership.\nD. the statute violates the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n"

This means that states cannot discriminate against individuals based on certain characteristics, including alienage, without a compelling state interest and without using the least restrictive means to achieve that interest. In this case, the statute appears to discriminate against aliens by placing a restriction on the amount of land they can own that does not apply to citizens. The resident alien could argue that there is no compelling state interest that justifies this discrimination and that the statute therefore violates the Equal Protection Clause.\n\nWhile the other arguments may have some merit, they are less likely to succeed. The Privileges or Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment protects fundamental rights, but the right to own land is not necessarily considered a fundamental right. The Contract Clause prohibits states from impairing the obligation of contracts, but it does not prevent states from passing laws that affect future contracts. The Commerce Clause argument is also unlikely to succeed because the statute does not appear to regulate interstate commerce directly."
