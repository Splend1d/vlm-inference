We'll start by taking the logarithm of both sides with base 10 (or any other positive base for that matter, since the choice of base will not affect the validity of the steps).\n\nGiven: \\(x^{\\log(y)} = y^{\\log(x)}\\)\n\nTaking \\(\\log\\) on both sides:\n\n\\[\n\\log\\left(x^{\\log(y)}\\right) = \\log\\left(y^{\\log(x)}\\right)\n\\]\n\nUsing the property of logarithms \\(\\log(a^b) = b\\log(a)\\), we get:\n\n\\[\n\\log(y) \\cdot \\log(x) = \\log(x) \\cdot \\log(y)\n\\]\n\nThis shows that the equation holds true for all positive values of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) because the left-hand side equals the right-hand side for any positive \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). This means that every point in the open first quadrant (\\(x > 0\\), \\(y > 0\\)) satisfies the given equation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. the open first quadrant."
