He randomly selected 100 female customers and 120 male customers, and asked them, \"Are you interested in shopping at this store on Sundays?\" He counted the number of customers answering \"yes\" and constructed a 95 percent confidence interval for the difference by subtracting the proportions of female from the proportion of male customers in favor of shopping on Sundays. The resulting interval was (\u20130.23, \u20130.18). Which of the following is a correct interpretation of the interval?\n\nA. We are 95 percent confident that the proportion of women interested in shopping on Sundays exceeds the proportion of men interested in shopping on Sundays.\nB. We are 95 percent confident that the proportion of men interested in shopping on Sundays exceeds the proportion of women interested in shopping on Sundays.\nC. We are 95 percent confident that the proportion of women interested in shopping on Sundays is equal to the proportion of men interested in shopping on Sundays.\nD. Because the interval contains negative values, it is invalid and should not be interpreted.\n"

We are 95 percent confident that the proportion of men interested in shopping on Sundays exceeds the proportion of women interested in shopping on Sundays.\n\nThis is because the confidence interval represents the difference between the proportions of male and female customers who are interested in shopping on Sundays, with males' proportion being subtracted from females'. Since all values in the interval are negative, this indicates that the proportion of males interested in Sunday shopping is higher than that of females. The absolute values indicate the magnitude of this difference. Therefore, option B is the correct interpretation. However, note that the way the question is phrased suggests a potential misunderstanding since the subtraction direction mentioned (female from male) would actually make the interval positive if calculated correctly based on the interpretation given. Given the standard convention and the provided answer choices, option B reflects the understanding that more males than females want to shop on Sundays, but the phrasing about how the interval was calculated might be a point of confusion. The key takeaway is that the confidence interval indicates a statistically significant difference favoring male interest in Sunday shopping."
