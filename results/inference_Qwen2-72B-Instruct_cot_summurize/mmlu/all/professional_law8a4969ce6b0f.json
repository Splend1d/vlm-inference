The proposed statute's preamble recites that its provisions will ensure: \u0080\u0094 responsible insurance coverage for all those who do business with the state;an increased standard of living for the citizens who comprise the state's labor force; \u0080\u0094 the lowest possible expenditures by the state government; and \u0080\u0094 a beautiful, uniform aesthetic decor for all new state buildings. If the state statute is attacked as violating the commerce clause, which of the following statements is most accurate?\n\nA. The statute is a valid exercise of the state's police power to legislate to protect the health, safety, morals, and welfare of its citizens.\nB. The statute falls within the reserved powers under the Tenth Amendment.\nC. The statute should be invalidated if there are nondiscriminatory reasonable alternatives available to serve legitimate local interests.\nD. The statute is a valid exercise of state action only if the federal government has not previously \"occupied the field\" in this area.\n"

The statute should be invalidated if there are nondiscriminatory reasonable alternatives available to serve legitimate local interests.\n\nThe Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution reserves the power to regulate interstate commerce to Congress and prohibits states from passing legislation that discriminates against or excessively burdens interstate commerce. The statute in question appears to discriminate against out-of-state entities in several ways, including requiring the use of in-state insurance companies, giving hiring preference to state citizens, prohibiting nonresident aliens from engaging in state-related business activities, and mandating the use of a material found only within the state. These provisions may be seen as protectionist measures that unduly burden interstate commerce. Under the Supreme Court's balancing test in cases involving the Commerce Clause, a state law that discriminates against interstate commerce can be upheld only if it serves a legitimate local interest and there are no reasonable nondiscriminatory alternatives available to achieve the same objective."
