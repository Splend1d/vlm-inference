It offers significant improvements over its predecessors, such as WPA2 and WPA, in terms of encryption and authentication methods. WPA3 uses Simultaneous Authentication of Equals (SAE) for more secure password-based authentication, replacing the Pre-Shared Key (PSK) mechanism used by WPA2. Additionally, it provides enhanced encryption using 192-bit security for networks that require higher security, such as government, defense, and industrial networks."
