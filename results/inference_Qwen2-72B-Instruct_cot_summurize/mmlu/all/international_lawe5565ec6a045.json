When the coastal State cannot harvest the 'total allowable catch', the coastal State is to give other State access to that surplus with priority to be given to developing and land-locked States\n\nThis statement aligns with the provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), which stipulates that if a coastal state does not have the capacity to harvest the entire allowable catch of living resources in its Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), it should make available the surplus to other states, giving particular consideration to developing states and land-locked states. This reflects the principle of cooperation and sharing of resources under international law."
