Prejudice refers to preconceived opinions or feelings, often negative and based on stereotypes, that are not grounded in actual experience or knowledge about the group being judged. In this case, the spectator is making a blanket statement about welfare recipients, assuming they are all lazy without any evidence to support such a claim. This is a form of prejudice because it involves a negative stereotype applied to an entire group of people."
