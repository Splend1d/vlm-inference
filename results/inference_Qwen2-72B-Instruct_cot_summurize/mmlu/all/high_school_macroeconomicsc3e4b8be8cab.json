I and II are true.\n\nThe GDP deflator is indeed used to calculate inflation rates, and it can be considered an alternative to the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for measuring inflation. However, it is not necessarily more accurate than the CPI; both have their own strengths and weaknesses and measure slightly different things. The GDP deflator reflects price changes in all goods and services produced domestically, including investment goods and government services, which are not included in the CPI. On the other hand, the CPI measures price changes from the perspective of consumers and includes only goods and services they purchase."
