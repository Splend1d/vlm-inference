These artifacts typically date from the Paleolithic and Mesolithic periods, around 40,000 to 10,000 years ago. They have been discovered at various archaeological sites across Europe, with notable concentrations in regions such as the Willendorf area in Austria and the Swabian Jura in Germany. However, similar figurines have also been found in other parts of the world, including Siberia and Africa, but not in the same quantity or frequency as in Europe."
