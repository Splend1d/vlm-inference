Although the homeowner and his family lived in the beach house during the summer months, the house was left unoccupied for the remainder of the year. In order to protect the beach house from vandalism while it was vacant, the homeowner installed an automatic spring-gun device. The spring-gun was connected to the front door and calculated to automatically fire at chest level when the door was opened. No warnings were placed on the premises. A local man, knowing that the homeowner's beach house was unoccupied, decided to burglarize the home one evening. When the local man forced open the front door and was about to enter the premises, the spring-gun automatically discharged, killing him instantly. If the homeowner is subsequently prosecuted and charged with the local man's death, the most serious crime for which the homeowner will be found guilty is\n\nA. voluntary manslaughter.\nB. involuntary manslaughter.\nC. murder.\nD. assault with a deadly weapon.\n"

This is because the homeowner intentionally set up a device that he knew would cause death or great bodily harm without any warning, which could be seen as an intentional act demonstrating a reckless disregard for human life. However, the specific charge could vary depending on the jurisdiction and the circumstances surrounding the case, such as self-defense laws or castle doctrine laws. It's also possible that the homeowner could argue that the device was a form of property protection, but the use of a lethal device without warning would likely not meet legal standards for reasonable force in most jurisdictions."
