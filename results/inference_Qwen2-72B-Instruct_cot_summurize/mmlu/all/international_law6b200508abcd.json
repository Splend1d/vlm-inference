This allows the attacked state to exercise its inherent right to self-defense, subject to the conditions and limitations established by international law.\n\nTo clarify the options you provided:\n\nA. Armed attack does include various types of armed force, but not all uses of force qualify as an armed attack under international law. The force must be significant and reach a certain threshold of intensity and scale.\n\nB. High-intensity instances of armed force can indeed constitute an armed attack, but it's not limited to only high-intensity scenarios. The key factor is whether the use of force meets the legal threshold for an armed attack.\n\nC. Terrorist attacks can potentially be considered armed attacks if they meet the required threshold of intensity and scale. However, attributing such attacks to a specific state (which would trigger the right to self-defense against that state) can be complex due to issues of state responsibility and non-state actors.\n\nD. An \"armed attack\" does give a state the right to take measures necessary to repel the attack and defend itself, but it does not automatically grant the right to invade the aggressor state or engage in acts of aggression beyond what is necessary for self-defense. Any response must be proportionate and comply with international law.\n\nIn summary, the concept of \"armed attack\" in Article 51 of the UN Charter is nuanced and requires careful analysis based on the specific circumstances of each case."
