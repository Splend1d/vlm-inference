Perceptual constancy refers to the ability of the visual system to maintain a stable perception of an object despite changes in the retinal image caused by changes in viewing angle, distance, or lighting conditions. In this case, as you walk around the statue, the retinal image changes due to the changing viewpoint, but your perception of the statue remains constant due to perceptual constancy."
