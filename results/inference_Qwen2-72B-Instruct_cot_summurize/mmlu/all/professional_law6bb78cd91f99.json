Yes, as an admission by a party opponent.\nB. Yes, as a statement against the interests of the other defendants.\nC. No, because it was made while in custody and therefore is unreliable.\nD. No, because the statement was not made in the course of or in furtherance of the conspiracy and thus it is hearsay.\n"

However, based on common legal principles in many jurisdictions, the most likely answer is:\n\nB. Yes, as a statement against the interests of the other defendants.\n\nUnder the Federal Rules of Evidence (FRE) in the United States, for example, a statement made by a co-conspirator during the course of and in furtherance of the conspiracy is admissible against the other conspirators under Rule 801(d)(2)(E). This rule allows for the admission of such statements as non-hearsay if they meet the criteria of being made during the conspiracy and in furtherance of its objectives.\n\nHowever, the driver's statement here does not appear to be made in furtherance of the conspiracy itself. Instead, it could be considered a statement against his own penal interest, which might make it admissible under an exception to the hearsay rule. A statement against interest is one that so far tends to subject the declarant to civil or criminal liability, or to render invalid a claim by the declarant, that a reasonable person in the declarant\u2019s position would not have made the statement unless believing it to be true. Under FRE Rule 804(b)(3), such statements may be admissible if the declarant is unavailable and corroborating circumstances clearly indicate the trustworthiness of the statement.\n\nIn this case, since the driver is available and has made a statement that is against his own interest (by implicating himself in the conspiracy), the statement might be admissible against the other defendants under a theory that it is reliable because it is against the declarant's own interest. However, whether it is actually admitted would depend on the judge's discretion and the specific rules of evidence in the jurisdiction.\n\nA is incorrect because the driver's statement is not an admission by a party opponent; it is an out-of-court statement by a co-conspirator.\nC is incorrect because the reliability of the statement is not automatically negated just because it was made while in custody. The voluntariness and reliability of the statement would need to be assessed based on the circumstances under which it was made.\nD is partially correct regarding the hearsay nature of the statement but incorrect in assuming that it cannot be admissible because it was not made in the course of or in furtherance of the conspiracy. As explained above, it could potentially be admissible under the statement against interest exception."
