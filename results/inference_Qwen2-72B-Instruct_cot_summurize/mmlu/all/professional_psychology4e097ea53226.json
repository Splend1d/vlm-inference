As the result of a head injury he received in a car accident, a man cannot remember where he was going before the accident occurred.\n\nHowever, this choice actually describes retrograde amnesia, not anterograde amnesia. Anterograde amnesia refers to the inability to form new memories after the onset of the amnesia, typically due to brain damage. The correct example for anterograde amnesia would be if the man could not remember new information or experiences that happened after the accident. Since none of the provided options accurately describe anterograde amnesia, it's important to note that option A is actually describing retrograde amnesia (loss of memory for events prior to the onset of amnesia)."
