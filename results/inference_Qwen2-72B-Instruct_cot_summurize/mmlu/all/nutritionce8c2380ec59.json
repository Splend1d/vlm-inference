Affect bone mineral content later in life\n\nDuring pregnancy and lactation, the body's demand for calcium increases significantly as it is crucial for the development of the fetal skeleton and the production of breast milk. This increased demand can lead to bone mineral loss from the mother's skeleton if her diet does not provide enough calcium to meet both her needs and those of her growing child. The body compensates by mobilizing calcium from the bones to maintain normal serum calcium levels. This bone mineral loss can potentially affect bone mineral content later in life, increasing the risk of osteoporosis if proper dietary intake and supplementation are not maintained. However, with adequate calcium intake during these periods, bone mineral density can often be restored post-lactation."
