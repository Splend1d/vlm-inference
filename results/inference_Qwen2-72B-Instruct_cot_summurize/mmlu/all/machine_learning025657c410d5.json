In the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, the log-likelihood of the data given the model parameters increases or remains the same at each iteration until convergence. This property ensures that the EM algorithm does not move away from a local maximum.\n\nStatement 2 is false. Q-learning is a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm, which means it does not require any prior knowledge of the environment dynamics. It learns the optimal policy by exploring the state-action space and updating the Q-values based on observed rewards. Therefore, Q-learning can be used even when the learner does not have prior knowledge of how its actions affect the environment."
