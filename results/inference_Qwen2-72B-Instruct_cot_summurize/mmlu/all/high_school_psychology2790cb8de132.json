It often happens that the word or name comes back to mind unexpectedly later on, as in the case of Tonya remembering her schoolmate's name \"out of the blue.\" This phenomenon is related to memory retrieval processes and is distinct from chunking (which involves organizing information into larger units for easier processing), deductive reasoning (which involves drawing specific conclusions from general principles), and inductive reasoning (which involves drawing general conclusions from specific observations)."
