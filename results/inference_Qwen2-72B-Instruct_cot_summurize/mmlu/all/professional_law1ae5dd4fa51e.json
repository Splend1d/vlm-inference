The suspect was later arrested for murder; he filed for suppression of the gun. Will the suppression court throw out the gun?\n\nA. No, the entry was authorized by exigent circumstances and the gun was in plain view.\nB. No, the entry did not require an arrest warrant because the authorities already had established probable cause.\nC. Yes, the entry was a violation of the knock and announce rule.\nD.

No, the entry was authorized by exigent circumstances and the gun was in plain view.\n\nThe \"knock and announce\" rule requires law enforcement officers to announce their presence and purpose before entering a dwelling, but there are exceptions, such as when officers have reason to believe that knocking and announcing would be dangerous or futile, or would result in the destruction of evidence. In this case, the officers had probable cause to believe that the suspect committed a violent crime and that he might pose a danger to them or others. They also heard no response after knocking and announcing, which could justify the forced entry under the exigent circumstances exception. Once inside, they saw the handgun in plain view, which allowed them to seize it without a search warrant under the plain view doctrine. Therefore, the gun is admissible as evidence unless the defendant can show that the officers acted unreasonably or violated his Fourth Amendment rights in some other way. However, based on the information provided, it appears that the officers acted within the bounds of the law."
