However, if all the concentrations are 1.00 Molar, and assuming an ideal gas behavior where \\(PV = nRT\\), you could consider the situation where the partial pressures correspond to these concentrations at a specific volume and temperature. This doesn't necessarily make \\(K_p\\) and \\(K_c\\) equal for all reactions, but it does bring us closer to understanding how they might be numerically equivalent under certain conditions\u2014specifically, when the reaction quotient Q (which is similar to K but calculated from current conditions rather than equilibrium conditions) based on concentrations and pressures would yield the same value.\n\nTo ensure that \\(K_p\\) and \\(K_c\\) are exactly the same, you'd need the condition that makes \\((RT)^{\\Delta n} = 1\\) true. This could happen under certain conditions (like when \\(\\Delta n = 0\\), which corresponds to D. When the reaction exhibits no change in pressure at constant volume), but the direct answer to the question as posed, considering the options, leans towards understanding the role of concentration in relation to \\(K_c\\) and how it might conceptually align with \\(K_p\\) under controlled conditions.\n\nThus, **C** is the closest correct choice among the options given, understanding that it's more about setting up a scenario where the numerical values might coincide due to the specific concentrations and implied conditions, rather than stating it as an absolute rule for all reactions."
