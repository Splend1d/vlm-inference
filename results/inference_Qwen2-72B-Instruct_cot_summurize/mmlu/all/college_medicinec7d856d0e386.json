This allows them to pass through the lipid bilayer of the cell membrane, which is also hydrophobic.\n\nLooking at the list of amino acids given:\n\nA. Glycine - While glycine is small and can fit into tight spaces, it does not have a strong hydrophobic character.\nB. Tyrosine - Tyrosine has a hydroxyl (OH) group making it slightly polar, but its large aromatic ring can be hydrophobic.\nC. Arginine - Arginine is positively charged and highly hydrophilic (water-loving), so it would not be favored in a transmembrane region.\nD. Isoleucine - Isoleucine is one of the most hydrophobic amino acids, making it an excellent candidate for inclusion in a transmembrane domain.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **D. Isoleucine**."
