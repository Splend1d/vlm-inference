Statistical nonsignificance under low power.\n\nExplanation: When you have statistical nonsignificance and low power, it's difficult to draw any strong conclusions. Low power means that the experiment may not have had enough sensitivity to detect an effect if there was one. So, you can't confidently say that there is no effect; you can only say that the experiment didn't find evidence for an effect. This outcome doesn't provide much information about whether an effect truly exists or not.\n\nIn contrast:\n\n- B. Statistical significance under low power still suggests that there might be an effect, even if the experiment wasn't optimally designed to detect it.\n- C. Statistical nonsignificance under high power is more informative because high power means the experiment was well-designed to detect an effect if it existed. If you don't find one under these conditions, you can be more confident that there isn't a meaningful effect.\n- D. Statistical significance under high power is the most informative result because it combines strong evidence for an effect with a well-designed experiment that had a good chance of detecting the effect if it was present."
