Type I error: This is the error of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true. The probability of making a Type I error is determined by the chosen significance level (alpha), which in this case is 0.05. Increasing the sample size does not affect the probability of a Type I error since alpha is set before the experiment begins and is independent of sample size.\n\n2. Power of the test: The power of a statistical test is the probability that the test will correctly reject the null hypothesis when the alternative hypothesis is true. Increasing the sample size generally increases the power of the test because it allows for a more precise estimate of the population parameters. As a result, if the null hypothesis is false, increasing the sample size makes it more likely that the test will detect this and reject the null hypothesis, thus reducing the probability of a Type II error (failing to reject the null hypothesis when it is false).\n\nTherefore, increasing the number of experimental units for each treatment will not change the probability of a Type I error but will increase the power of the test, thereby decreasing the probability of a Type II error."
