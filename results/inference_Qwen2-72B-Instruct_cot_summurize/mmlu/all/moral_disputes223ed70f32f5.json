Carruthers argues that we have moral duties to animals, but these are derived not from the intrinsic value or interests of the animals themselves, but rather from the effects that our treatment of animals has on our own character and on our attitudes towards other human beings. Thus, according to Carruthers, our moral duties to animals are instrumental, rather than direct or intrinsic."
