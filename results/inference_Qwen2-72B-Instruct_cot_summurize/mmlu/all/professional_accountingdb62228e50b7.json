There have been substantial inventory write-offs just before the year-end in each of the past four years.\n\nRecurring, substantial inventory write-offs could indicate potential issues with inventory management or, more concerning, possible manipulation of inventory levels for financial reporting purposes. This pattern might suggest that there are underlying problems with the company's inventory control systems, or it could be a red flag for potential fraud or misrepresentation by management to manipulate earnings or other financial metrics. Therefore, this condition would most likely raise questions about the integrity of management."
