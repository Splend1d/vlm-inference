In these experiments, participants were instructed to administer what they believed were painful electric shocks to another person (who was actually an actor) as part of a learning experiment. Despite the protests and apparent distress of the \"learner,\" a high percentage of participants continued to obey the experimenter's orders to increase the shock level.\n\nThis demonstrated that people can be highly obedient to authority figures, even when asked to perform actions that conflict with their personal conscience or cause harm to others. Thus, the Milgram effect is most closely associated with the type of social influence known as obedience."
