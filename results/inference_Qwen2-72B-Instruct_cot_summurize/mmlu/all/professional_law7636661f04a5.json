Therefore, they do not qualify as subsequent purchasers who paid value, and thus they are not protected by the recording statute against prior unrecorded interests like the brother's.\n\nAdditionally, although the brother did not record his deed promptly, he did so before the grantor's sons took possession or attempted to enforce their rights to the property. This recording would put subsequent parties on notice of the brother's interest, potentially making it more difficult for the grantor's sons to claim they had no knowledge of the brother's prior interest when they attempted to take possession. However, the primary reason the brother might prevail is that the grantor's sons do not meet the criteria of being protected subsequent purchasers under the recording statute because they did not pay value for the property."
