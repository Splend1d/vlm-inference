                    "text": "The equipment was sold in the current year, but we need to calculate how much depreciation can be claimed for the period it was in service.\n\nSince the equipment was bought on May 1 of the prior year and sold on March 1 of the current year, it was in service for 20 months (from May 1 to December 31 of the prior year = 8 months + from January 1 to March 1 of the current year = 2 months).\n\nTo find out how many months of the first year's depreciation can be claimed, we have to prorate the first year's depreciation based on the number of months the asset was in service during that first year. Since the equipment was in service for 8 months out of the first 12 months, we will use 8/12 of the first year's depreciation rate.\n\nFirst year depreciation: $10,000 * 20% * (8/12) = $1,333.33\n\nFor the second year, we have to consider only 2 months out of the 12 possible months. So, we will use 2/12 of the second year's depreciation rate.\n\nSecond year depreciation: $10,000 * 32% * (2/12) = $533.33\n\nTotal depreciation for the current year: $1,333.33 + $533.33 = $1,866.66\n\nHowever, since none of the options exactly matches this calculated amount and assuming we're rounding to the nearest dollar, the closest answer would be:\n\nA. $533\n\nBut this is not correct as it doesn't represent the total depreciation for the current year. The question might have some rounding or approximation expectations that aren't clear. Given the options and the typical rounding rules, the best choice that reflects the calculation would be:\n\nA. $533\n\nIf we had to pick one option that closely represents the portion of the second year's depreciation, it would be A. But the total depreciation for the current year would actually be closer to $1,867 if we were to round to the nearest dollar, which isn't an option provided. \n\nThus, the most accurate response based on the provided options would be:\n\nA. $533\n\nHowever, this does not account for the full amount of depreciation for the current year according to the calculations."
