However, based on some research findings:\n\n(1) The statement that \"In every country, people think other individuals in their country are less happy than they actually are\" is a generalization that might not hold true for every country. There have been studies suggesting that people tend to underestimate others' happiness, but this might not be universal across all countries. Therefore, this statement could be considered false due to its sweeping nature.\n\n(2) The statement that \"In the United States, women's happiness has increased both absolutely and relative to men\" has been supported by some research. For instance, a study published in the Journal of Happiness Studies found that women's happiness levels had indeed risen relative to men's over time in the U.S. However, this is also subject to change depending on the time period and specific data analyzed.\n\nGiven these considerations, the closest answer would be:\n\nC. False, True\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the truth of these statements can shift based on new data or different interpretations of existing data."
