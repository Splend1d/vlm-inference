It causes pain and tingling in the medial three and a half digits\n\nCarpal Tunnel Syndrome is indeed often associated with rheumatoid arthritis, as well as other conditions that cause swelling in the wrist. The symptoms typically affect the thumb, index finger, middle finger, and the thumb side of the ring finger (medial three and a half digits). However, option B is incorrect because Carpal Tunnel Syndrome is caused by compression of the median nerve, not the ulnar nerve. Option D is also incorrect because paraesthesia (numbness or tingling sensations) is usually worse at night rather than during the day."
