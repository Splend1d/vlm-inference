The statute does not, however, restrict the sale of red meat products. Producers of red meat have challenged the statute as a violation of their free speech rights protected by the First Amendment. Is the court likely to find the statute constitutional?\n\nA. No, because it does not serve a substantial government interest.\nB. No, because it is more extensive than necessary to serve the government interest in preventing certain cancers.\nC. Yes, because it does not affect speech protected by the First Amendment.\nD. Yes, because it serves a legitimate government interest in protecting public health.\n"

Under this test, the court will consider whether the government interest is substantial, whether the regulation directly advances that interest, and whether it is more extensive than necessary.\n\nIn this case, the statute aims to prevent certain cancers, which is a substantial government interest related to public health. However, the court may find that the prohibition on advertising red meat products is more extensive than necessary to achieve this goal, especially since the sale of red meat is not restricted. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nB. No, because it is more extensive than necessary to serve the government interest in preventing certain cancers. \n\nHowever, it's worth noting that the specific facts of the case and the court's interpretation of the Central Hudson test could lead to a different outcome."
