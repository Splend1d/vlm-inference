Xerophthalmia (dryness of the conjunctiva and cornea leading to blindness)\n2. Increased susceptibility to infections\n3. Poor growth\n4. Delayed cognitive development (though this is not as directly linked to vitamin A as the other effects)\n\nGoitre (option A) is associated with iodine deficiency, and poor bone growth (option C) is more commonly related to deficiencies in calcium, vitamin D, or phosphorus."
