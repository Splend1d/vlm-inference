Upon the death of the assistant, his interest in the property passed to his heirs because he died intestate (without a will). In this case, the assistant's daughter is the sole surviving heir.\n\nThe friend, who also has an interest in the apartment building, can convey his interest to the assistant's daughter. This would mean that the daughter would own both her father's share and the friend's share, making her the sole owner of the apartment building. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. to the daughter and her heirs and assigns.\n\nThis conveys the friend's interest in the property directly to the daughter, and she would hold it both for herself and potentially for any future heirs or assigns she may choose to pass it on to."
