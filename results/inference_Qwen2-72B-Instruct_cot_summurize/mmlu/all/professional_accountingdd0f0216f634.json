Failure to notify a taxpayer about an inadvertent error on a tax return filed 10 years ago.\n\nThe Internal Revenue Code and Regulations do not require tax return preparers to inform clients about errors discovered long after the original filing, especially if the statute of limitations has expired. However, professional ethics might still encourage or require a preparer to inform their client about any discovered errors, regardless of whether there is a legal penalty for not doing so. For the other options, the IRS does impose penalties for failure to sign a prepared tax return (A), failure to provide a copy of a prepared tax return to the taxpayer (B), and failure to retain copies of prepared tax returns or a list of taxpayers for whom such returns were prepared for at least three years (D)."
