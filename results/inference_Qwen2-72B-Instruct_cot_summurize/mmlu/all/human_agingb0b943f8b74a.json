Continuous\n\nThe changes in the reproductive system are more continuous for men, as their ability to produce sperm and maintain sexual function can theoretically continue throughout their entire life span. However, this is subject to overall health, lifestyle, and other factors.\n\nFor women, the reproductive system changes are more mechanistic and organismic due to menopause, which marks the end of menstrual cycles and fertility. This transition is characterized by hormonal changes that can lead to various symptoms and is a natural part of aging for women."
