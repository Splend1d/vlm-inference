This action aligns with ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\nScenario 2: Filling up a gas tank with sugar can cause significant damage to a vehicle's engine. This action would be considered vandalism and is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. However, since the question asks which scenario the main character does something clearly morally wrong, and assuming the main character is not the one filling up the gas tank with sugar, then neither of the scenarios involves the main character doing something morally wrong. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Not wrong, Not wrong. If the question intended to ask about the actions described in each scenario rather than the main character's actions, then the answer would be C. Not wrong, Wrong."
