The first scientist contends that organisms evolved via the increase of organs that were used the most during their time. They would then pass these on to subsequent generations. The second scientist, however, believed that advantages each organism possessed were absent for a long time, randomly occurred, and when they were beneficial, that organism would rapidly populate the population over a short period of time, evolutionarily speaking. Which of the following statements would strengthen the second scientist\u2019s argument?\n\nA. A study that shows that bodybuilders who train more have larger children.\nB. A taxonomy study that shows long periods of stagnant growth followed by short burst of massive evolution.\nC. A study that showed a species who were more successful due to the things they learned over their lifetime that they passed on to their children.\nD. A study that showed a consistent amount of time between the emergence of each new species.\n"

A taxonomy study that shows long periods of stagnant growth followed by short bursts of massive evolution.\n\nThis pattern is consistent with the theory of punctuated equilibrium, which suggests that evolutionary change occurs in rapid bursts (punctuations) rather than a smooth and gradual process. This supports the idea that advantageous traits can lead to rapid population growth and speciation when they occur, which aligns with the second scientist's perspective."
