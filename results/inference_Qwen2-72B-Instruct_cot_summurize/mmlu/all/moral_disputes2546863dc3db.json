This means that a policy of exclusion could be based on a desire to preserve one's own culture and way of life, rather than a belief in its superiority over others. It is possible to value and protect one's own culture without necessarily believing it to be better than others. Option A is incorrect because it presents a false dichotomy between inferiority and exclusion. Option C is also relevant but does not directly address the question. Option D is incorrect because it presents a false premise that only superior cultures have freedom of movement."
