Here we had not only a servile war, but we had a war of religion, a war of race, and a war of revenge, of hope, of national promptings to shake off the yoke of a stranger, and to re-establish the full power of native chiefs, and the full sway of native religions. Whatever the causes of the mutiny and the revolt, it is clear enough that one of the modes by which the leaders, as if by common instinct, determined to effect their end was, the destruction of every white man, woman or child who fell into their hands.\nBritish journalist William Howard Russell, My Indian Mutlny Diary, 1860\nViolence, it must be emphasized, was an essential component of the British presence in India. A dominant power is always uneasy with violence directed against it. The right to violence is, therefore, everywhere a privilege that authority enjoys and refuses to share with those under it: power always insists on violence as its exclusive monopoly. British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin. This was the condition of their domination, of their superiority: rulers and ruled were arranged hierarchically as superior and inferior races, as civilized and uncivilized. And this superiority manifested itself by denying to the Indians a \"humanness\"; by treating them and conceiving of them as animals.\nRudrangshu Mukherjee, \"The Kanpur [Cawnpore] Massacres in India in the Revolt of 1857,\" 1990\nIn the short term, the events discussed in both passages led to which of the following outcomes?\n\nA. The expulsion of the British East India Company and partial home rule for India\nB. British victory over Indian rebels and the strengthening of the British East India Company\nC. Indian military success and the attainment of full independence from British authority\nD. The defeat of Indian rebels and the imposition of direct rule by the British government\n"

The defeat of Indian rebels and the imposition of direct rule by the British government.\n\nAfter the Indian Rebellion of 1857, also known as the Sepoy Mutiny, the British East India Company was dissolved, and control of India was transferred to the British Crown. This led to the establishment of the British Raj, where India was directly governed by British officials rather than the East India Company. The rebellion did not result in any form of independence or self-rule for India at that time. Instead, it led to stricter colonial control and the implementation of policies aimed at preventing further uprisings."
