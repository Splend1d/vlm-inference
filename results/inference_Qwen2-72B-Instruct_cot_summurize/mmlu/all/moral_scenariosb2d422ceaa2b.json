They did not throw eggs at a car, so there is no wrongdoing.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the use of mace against a violent individual can be seen as self-defense or defense of others, which is generally not considered morally wrong if it is used to prevent harm to oneself or others. However, the context matters greatly here; if the violence was not immediate or if the response was disproportionate, it could potentially be seen as wrong. Given the information provided, assuming the violence was imminent and the use of mace was necessary to prevent harm, this scenario also does not depict a clear moral wrongdoing."
