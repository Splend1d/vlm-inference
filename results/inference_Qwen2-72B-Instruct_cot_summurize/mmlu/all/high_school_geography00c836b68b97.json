This type of society relies on clearing land for agriculture by cutting down forests and burning them. As the population grows, more land needs to be cleared, leading to deforestation, soil degradation, and loss of biodiversity. Over time, the land becomes less productive, and the society may face food shortages and other resource constraints, resulting in population pressure."
