It could be seen as a thoughtful and inclusive gift that allows him to enjoy an activity he might not otherwise be able to participate in physically.\n\nIn scenario 2, putting sugar in random cars' gas tanks is considered morally wrong because it can cause significant damage to the vehicles' engines, leading to costly repairs and potential harm to the drivers if the damage causes the car to malfunction while being driven. This action is also illegal and unethical."
