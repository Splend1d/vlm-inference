Lacking infrastructural capacity and wider social legitimacy, weak state elites are often forced to rely on coercive power. However, a key dilemma is that the instruments of violence can be a threat to the regime requiring the deliberate undermining of armed forces.\nC. Elites attempt to foster a new politics of identity in which ethnic consciousness is superseded by ideologies orientated around the myth of the regime.\nD. Weak states have cultivated international sponsorship and have initiated processes of democratic reform so as to gain popular legitimacy internally whilst bolstering its international legitimacy externally.\n"

Here's a breakdown of the options you've listed:\n\nA. **Negative Inducements and Elite Disenfranchisement:**\n   - This strategy involves creating disincentives for elites who might oppose the regime. It can include economic measures such as the diversion of resources away from potential opponents or the denial of access to lucrative markets or trade routes. Additionally, it might involve disarmament or other forms of restriction on military capabilities or access to power structures.\n\nB. **Coercive Power and the Dilemma of Armed Forces:**\n   - In weak states where elites lack broad-based support, reliance on force becomes a common tactic. However, this creates a paradox where the very tools used for coercion (e.g., military and police) could potentially turn against the regime if not managed carefully. To mitigate this risk, elites may deliberately weaken these institutions through factionalism, competing command structures, or limiting access to advanced weaponry.\n\nC. **Fostering a New Politics of Identity:**\n   - Elites might seek to transcend divisive ethnic identities by promoting a unifying ideology or narrative that legitimizes their rule. This could involve the creation of a national mythology that emphasizes shared values, history, or goals over ethnic divisions. By doing so, they aim to build a broader base of support that extends beyond traditional ethnic lines.\n\nD. **International Sponsorship and Democratic Reform:**\n   - In an effort to gain both internal and external legitimacy, some elites initiate reforms that align with democratic principles. These reforms might be genuine efforts at democratization or superficial changes designed primarily to appease international sponsors and improve the regime\u2019s image abroad. By cultivating alliances with powerful external actors, elites can bolster their position at home while also securing economic aid, military assistance, and diplomatic support.\n\nEach of these strategies carries its own risks and benefits, and the effectiveness of each can vary widely depending on the specific context of the state in question. For instance, reliance on coercive power can lead to instability and rebellion, while democratic reforms might backfire if perceived as insincere by the population. Similarly, fostering a new politics of identity can unify the country but may also suppress minority groups, leading to long-term tensions."
