Here's why:\n\n- The paper appears blue in sunlight because it absorbs all colors except for blue, which it reflects.\n- When illuminated by red light, the paper would absorb the red light and not reflect any color since it only reflects blue, which isn't being shone on it.\n- Passing the red light through a green filter removes the red wavelengths, as the filter absorbs red and only allows green light to pass through.\n- Since the paper doesn't reflect green light (it only reflects blue), and no red light is reaching the paper due to the filter, there is no light being reflected off the paper for us to see.\n- Therefore, the paper appears black because it is absorbing all the light that hits it and not reflecting any visible light back to our eyes.\n\nSo the answer is D. Black."
