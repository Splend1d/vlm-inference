This is given by the formula \\( U = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2 \\), where \\( k \\) is the spring constant and \\( x \\) is the displacement from the equilibrium position.\n\nFor a charged object, the potential energy is due to the work done in moving the charge against an electric field. The potential energy of a charge \\( q \\) at a distance \\( r \\) from another charge \\( Q \\) is given by \\( U = \\frac{k_e qQ}{r} \\), where \\( k_e \\) is Coulomb's constant.\n\nIn both cases, the potential energy is a result of work done to create or alter the system's configuration. Therefore, the correct answer is A. the work done on them."
