Transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules bring specific amino acids to the ribosome based on the codons read from the mRNA. Ribosomes are the cellular structures responsible for linking amino acids together in the order specified by the mRNA sequence. Therefore, the correct answer is A. mRNA, tRNA, and ribosomes."
