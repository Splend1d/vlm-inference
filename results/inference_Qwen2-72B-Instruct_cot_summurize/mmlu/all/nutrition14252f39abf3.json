Hemoglobin A1c\n\nHemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) is a test that measures the average blood glucose level over the past 2 to 3 months, which includes the 8-10 week period mentioned in your question. It does this by measuring the amount of glucose attached to hemoglobin, the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen. The higher the blood glucose levels, the more glucose will attach to the hemoglobin, and the higher the HbA1c level will be.\n\nHere's a brief explanation of the other options:\n\nB. Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT): This test involves drinking a sugary solution and then measuring blood glucose levels two hours later. It's used to diagnose diabetes and prediabetes, but it doesn't measure long-term glucose control like HbA1c does.\n\nC. Fructosamine test: This test measures the average blood glucose level over the past 2 to 3 weeks. It does this by measuring the amount of glucose bound to serum proteins like albumin. While it can give an idea of recent glucose control, it doesn't cover as long a period as HbA1c.\n\nD. Fasting plasma glucose concentration: This test measures blood glucose levels after fasting for at least 8 hours. It's used to diagnose diabetes and prediabetes, but it only gives a snapshot of glucose levels at one point in time, not over a longer period like HbA1c does."
