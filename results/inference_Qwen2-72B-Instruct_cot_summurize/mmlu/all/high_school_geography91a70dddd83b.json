Perceptual or vernacular regions are often based on people's perceptions and feelings about a place, which can vary widely from person to person and over time. As a result, there may not be clear or universally accepted criteria for defining the boundaries of these regions, making them difficult to identify and map consistently. While the other options may also play a role in some cases, they are not the primary reason why perceptual regions are difficult to identify."
