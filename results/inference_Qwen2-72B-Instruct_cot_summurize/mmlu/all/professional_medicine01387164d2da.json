Some influenza vaccines are produced in eggs and can contain small amounts of egg proteins, which may trigger an allergic reaction in individuals with a known egg allergy. Inquiring about an egg allergy before administering the vaccine could have potentially prevented this reaction. The physician could then choose an egg-free vaccine or take other precautions if the patient had a history of egg allergy.\n\nIt's important to note that the other options (B, C, D) are not directly related to preventing an allergic reaction to the influenza vaccine:\n\nB. A heterophile agglutination test is used to diagnose infectious mononucleosis and would not be relevant in this context.\nC. A skin test with a histamine reagent would not be specific for detecting an allergy to components of the influenza vaccine.\nD. \u03b2-Adrenergic blocking agents are used to treat hypertension and other conditions but would not prevent an allergic reaction to the vaccine."
