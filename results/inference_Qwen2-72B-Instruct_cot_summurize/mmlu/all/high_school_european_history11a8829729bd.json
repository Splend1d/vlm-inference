By 1920 that fear was beginning to recede and Addison's policy was being regarded as extravagant. An immediate victim of the new attitude was the Borough's Kingfield Street scheme, provisional plans for which were approved in September 1920. Much to the Council's surprise, the Government's Housing Board deferred the scheme, \"having regard to the Council's present commitments and the money available at the present time, and in May 1921 the Government announced a drastic curtailment of the housing programme, cutting the housing target by half.\n\u2014Excerpt from a work by English historian Hermione Hobhouse Public Housing in Poplar: The Inter-war Years, 1994\nWhich of the following is the best description of the plans being changed above?\n\nA. Welfare programs were questioned after the First World War.\nB. Housing was a large part of the British budget.\nC. Workers were threatening communist revolution.\nD. The government Housing Board wanted to build more houses.\n"

Housing was a large part of the British budget.\n\nThe passage discusses how the Borough's Kingfield Street housing scheme was deferred and later drastically curtailed due to concerns over the council's commitments and the available funds. This indicates that housing projects represented a significant financial commitment for the government, and with the receding fear of a revolution, the policy was seen as too expensive. Therefore, the government decided to cut the housing target by half. Option B accurately reflects this situation. However, it should be noted that option A also touches on a relevant point\u2014the questioning of welfare programs post-World War I\u2014but option B more directly addresses the specific changes to the housing plans mentioned in the passage."
