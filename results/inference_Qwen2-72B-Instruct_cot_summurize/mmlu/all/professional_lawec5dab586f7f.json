In this case, the defendant used a threat of force (the stick and the threat to shoot) to take the man's wallet. This constitutes robbery.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that depending on the jurisdiction and the specific details of the case, additional charges might also be applicable, such as assault if the defendant made physical contact with the victim before or during the robbery. But based on the information provided, the primary charge would be robbery."
