The defendant had allegedly fired three shots at the victim, a physical education teacher, in the schoolyard of an elementary school. Immediately after the arrest, the arresting officer advised the defendant of his Miranda rights. The defendant responded that he would not make any statement until he consulted his attorney. Within minutes, a patrol car arrived and the defendant was taken into the car to be transported to the police station. The arresting officer sat in the front, next to the driver, and the defendant sat alone in the back seat, with his hands cuffed. On the way to the station, the driver stated to the arresting officer, \"I hope that the gun involved in this crime doesn't get into the hands of those small children, because one of them could be seriously injured, to say the least. \" The defendant interrupted the officers and told them where to look in the schoolyard for the abandoned gun. As a result of this information, the police found the gun where the defendant said it was. What is the state's best rebuttal to the defendant's argument that the gun was illegally seized?\n\nA. The defendant was not entitled to be re-warned of his Miranda rights in the patrol car.\nB. The defendant was not interrogated in the patrol car.\nC. The defendant waived his right to consult counsel.\nD. The seizure of the gun was not the fruit of the defendant's statement.\n"

The seizure of the gun was not the fruit of the defendant's statement.\n\nIn this case, the defendant initially invoked his Miranda rights by stating that he would not make any statement until he consulted his attorney. However, when the defendant voluntarily chose to speak up and provide information about the location of the gun without any further questioning or pressure from the police, the statement and the subsequent seizure of the gun were not considered the product of an illegal interrogation.\n\nUnder the doctrine of \"volunteered statements,\" if a suspect speaks voluntarily after invoking their Miranda rights, without any prompting or interrogation by law enforcement, the statements and any evidence obtained as a result can still be admissible in court. This is because the defendant's decision to speak was not coerced or the result of police-initiated questioning, but rather a spontaneous choice made by the defendant himself.\n\nTherefore, since the defendant's statement about the gun's location was unsolicited and voluntary, the gun was not illegally seized, and the state can argue that its discovery was not the fruit of any illegal activity."
