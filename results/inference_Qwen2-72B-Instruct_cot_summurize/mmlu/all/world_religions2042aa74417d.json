Buddhism\n\nBuddhism began as a world-renouncing movement in ancient India around the 6th century BCE when Siddhartha Gautama, the founder of Buddhism, left his royal life to seek enlightenment and understanding of the nature of suffering. This act marked the beginning of Buddhism as a tradition that emphasized renunciation, meditation, and the pursuit of liberation from the cycle of rebirth (samsara). Like Jainism, Buddhism also originated as a critique of the prevailing Brahmanical order and offered an alternative path to spiritual fulfillment."
