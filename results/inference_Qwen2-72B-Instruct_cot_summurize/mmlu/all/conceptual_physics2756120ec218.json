When a person walks through the detector, the device sends out a changing magnetic field. If there is a piece of metal on the person, it will disrupt this magnetic field and induce an eddy current in the metal object. This, in turn, creates its own magnetic field that interacts with the detector's magnetic field, triggering an alarm."
