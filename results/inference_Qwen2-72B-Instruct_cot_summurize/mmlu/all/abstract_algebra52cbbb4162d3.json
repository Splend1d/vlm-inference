Given that \\(g(f(a)) = a\\) for all \\(a \\in A\\), we can show that \\(f\\) is indeed injective. Let's assume there exist \\(a_1, a_2 \\in A\\) such that \\(f(a_1) = f(a_2)\\). Applying \\(g\\) to both sides gives us:\n\\[g(f(a_1)) = g(f(a_2))\\]\nBy the given property, this simplifies to:\n\\[a_1 = a_2\\]\n\nThus, \\(f\\) being injective is proven. So, Statement 1 is true.\n\nStatement 2: The function \\(f\\) must necessarily be surjective.\n\nFor \\(f\\) to be surjective (or onto), every element in set \\(B\\) must be the image of at least one element in set \\(A\\). However, the condition \\(g(f(a)) = a\\) does not directly imply that \\(f\\) is surjective. It only tells us about the relationship between elements of \\(A\\) and their images under \\(f\\) and \\(g\\). To prove \\(f\\) is surjective, we would need to show that for every \\(b \\in B\\), there exists an \\(a \\in A\\) such that \\(f(a) = b\\). This cannot be concluded from the given information alone.\n\nTherefore, Statement 2 is false.\n\nThe correct answer is C. True, False."
