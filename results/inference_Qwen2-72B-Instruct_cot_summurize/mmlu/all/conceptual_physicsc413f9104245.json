The two main forces acting on the flying squirrel in this scenario are the force of gravity (its weight) and the force of air resistance (drag). At terminal velocity, these forces are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction.\n\nGiven that the weight of the flying squirrel is 0.8 N, the force of air resistance must also be 0.8 N to balance out the gravitational force and maintain a constant velocity.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. 0.8 N"
