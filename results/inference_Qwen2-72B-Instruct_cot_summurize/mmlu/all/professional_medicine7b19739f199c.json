He has not had any change in bowel movements or urination. He had one similar episode 3 years ago that resolved spontaneously. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination of the back shows bilateral paravertebral muscle spasm. Range of motion is limited by pain. Straight-leg raising is negative. In addition to analgesia, which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?\n\nA. Bed rest\nB. Regular activity\nC. X-rays of the spine\nD. MRI of the spine\n"

Encouraging regular activity and gentle stretching exercises can help alleviate muscle spasms and prevent stiffness. Bed rest is no longer recommended as it can prolong recovery and lead to deconditioning. X-rays and MRI may be indicated if there are red flags such as neurological deficits, but in this case, the examination is unremarkable except for muscle spasm and limited range of motion. Analgesia is also appropriate to manage pain, but encouraging activity is an important part of treatment for acute low back pain without red flags."
