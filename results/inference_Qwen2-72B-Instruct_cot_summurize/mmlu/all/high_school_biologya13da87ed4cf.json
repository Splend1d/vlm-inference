The offspring produced in subsequent generations have a higher percentage of birds with large beaks.\n\nThis scenario illustrates how natural selection works. During the drought, small, easily eaten seeds become scarce, making it difficult for birds with smaller beaks to find food. Birds with larger beaks, which can crack open the larger, hard-cased seeds, have an advantage and are more likely to survive and reproduce. As a result, over time, the frequency of the genes for larger beaks increases in the population, leading to more birds with large beaks in subsequent generations. This is not due to individual birds changing their beak size or anticipating environmental changes but rather to differential survival and reproduction based on existing genetic variation within the population."
