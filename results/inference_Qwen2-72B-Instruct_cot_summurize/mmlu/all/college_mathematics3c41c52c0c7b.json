For n = 4, there are two abelian groups up to isomorphism: Z_4 and Z_2 x Z_2. However, since we are looking for exactly two abelian groups, we need to check the other options as well.\n\nB. For n = 7, there is only one abelian group up to isomorphism: Z_7, because 7 is a prime number.\n\nC. For n = 8, there are exactly two abelian groups up to isomorphism: Z_8 and Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_2. This is because 8 = 2^3, and by the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups, we can have either one cyclic group of order 8 (Z_8) or three cyclic groups of order 2 (Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_2).\n\nD. For n = 12, there are three abelian groups up to isomorphism: Z_12, Z_6 x Z_2, and Z_4 x Z_3. This is because 12 = 2^2 * 3, and by the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups, we can have either one cyclic group of order 12 (Z_12), one cyclic group of order 6 and one of order 2 (Z_6 x Z_2), or one cyclic group of order 4 and one of order 3 (Z_4 x Z_3).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. 8."
