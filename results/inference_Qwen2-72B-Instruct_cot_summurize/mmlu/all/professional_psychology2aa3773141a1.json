For visual stimuli, this is known as iconic memory, which lasts for about a quarter of a second to a few seconds. For auditory stimuli, it's called echoic memory, which can last up to four seconds. In both cases, the information is not maintained for more than a few seconds unless it is attended to and transferred to short-term memory."
