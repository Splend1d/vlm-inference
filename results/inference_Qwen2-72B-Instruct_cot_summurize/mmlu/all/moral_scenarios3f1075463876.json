In Scenario 1, the main character is simply showing their children a painting they found terrifying, which could be seen as exposing them to art or sharing personal reactions, not necessarily doing something morally wrong. In Scenario 2, opening a vial of chemicals in a science lab might be part of an experiment or learning process and would not be considered morally wrong if done safely and with proper authorization. Without additional context suggesting harm or wrongdoing, neither scenario involves clear moral transgressions."
