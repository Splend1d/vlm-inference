It stands for a hundred like her own. She averages three dollars a week. Pay is $1.50 for her room; for breakfast she has a cup of coffee; lunch she cannot afford. One meal a day is her allowance. This woman is young, she is pretty. She has \"the world before her.\" Is it anything less than a miracle if she is guilty of nothing less than the \"early and improvident marriage,\" against which moralists exclaim as one of the prolific causes of the distresses of the poor? Almost any door might seem to offer a welcome escape from such slavery as this. \"I feel so much healthier since I got three square meals a day,\" said a lodger in one of the Girls' Homes. Two young sewing-girls came in seeking domestic service, so that they might get enough to eat. They had been only half-fed for some time, and starvation had driven them to the one door at which the pride of the American-born girl will not permit her to knock, though poverty be the price of her independence.\n\u2014Jacob Riis, How the Other Half Lives, 1890\nRiis's work as an investigator of the lives of the poor can most directly be associated with which of the following?\n\nA. Yellow Journalism\nB. Abolitionism\nC. The muckrakers\nD. Socialism\n"

Riis was a pioneering social reformer and journalist who exposed the living conditions of the urban poor in New York City during the late 19th century. His work can most directly be associated with the movement known as the Muckrakers.\n\nMuckrakers were investigative journalists and authors who exposed corruption and social injustices in the early 20th century. They aimed to raise public awareness about issues such as poverty, child labor, political corruption, and unsafe working conditions. Their efforts contributed to various reforms and legislation aimed at improving the lives of the underprivileged and regulating industries.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\nC. The muckrakers"
