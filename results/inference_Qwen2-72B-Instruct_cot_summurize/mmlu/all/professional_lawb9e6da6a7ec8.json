I'll pay you $275 if you will change the oil, replace the oil filter, and adjust the carburetors by February 10. \"The mechanic received the man's letter on February 3. That same day, he telephoned an auto supply company and ordered the necessary materials to perform the repair work. Two days later, the mechanic met the man at a party and this conversation took place:The man: \"Disregard the letter I sent you last week. \"The mechanic: \"No way, man, I already ordered the materials on from the auto supply company. \"The man: \"Sorry, but I sold my car yesterday, so forget the repair work. \"If the mechanic initiates suit for breach of contract, which of the following is the man's strongest argument that no enforceable contract was formed between the parties?\n\nA. The mechanic had not completed performance before the man revoked his offer.\nB. The man's offer could only be accepted by a return promise.\nC. Because the man made his offer by letter, the mechanic could accept only in the same manner.\nD. Although the mechanic was preparing to perform the repair work, he had not begun the requested acts of acceptance when the man revoked his offer.\n"

Although the mechanic was preparing to perform the repair work, he had not begun the requested acts of acceptance when the man revoked his offer.\n\nThis is because under the law of contracts, an offer can generally be revoked at any time before it is accepted. In this case, the man revoked his offer before the mechanic had begun performing the requested acts, which would have constituted acceptance of the offer. Therefore, there was no binding contract between the parties. However, the mechanic may still have a claim against the man for reliance damages if he can show that he incurred costs in preparation for performing the work based on the man's offer."
