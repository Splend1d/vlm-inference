Among the options you've provided, the answer could be interpreted in different ways depending on the specific studies being referenced, but generally, the paradox of well-being is often observed in:\n\nB. Older adults - Despite potential health issues and loss of loved ones, many older adults report high levels of life satisfaction and happiness.\nC. People with very low SES (Socioeconomic Status) - Some studies suggest that people with lower SES can have high levels of happiness due to factors like strong social relationships and cultural values that prioritize well-being over material wealth.\n\nHowever, the most commonly cited example of the paradox of well-being is likely B. Older adults, as this phenomenon has been more consistently documented across various cultures and contexts. The other options may also exhibit the paradox of well-being under certain conditions, but they are not as universally associated with it as older adults are. \n\nD. Terminally ill people - While some terminally ill individuals do find peace and happiness despite their prognosis, this is not universally observed and is not as commonly cited as an example of the paradox of well-being as older adults. \n\nA. Unhappy people - This option does not fit the definition of the paradox of well-being since by definition, unhappy people are not experiencing high levels of happiness."
