The principal sources of immunity for IOs are headquarters agreements and multilateral treaties providing specific immunities\n\nImmunities and privileges of international organizations are typically established by the founding treaties of these organizations, by headquarters agreements between the organization and the host country, or by other international agreements. These documents outline the extent and limitations of the immunities granted to the organization and its officials. While customary international law may also play a role, it is not the principal source of such immunities. The UN Charter does grant certain immunities to the United Nations itself, but other IOs derive their immunities from their own constitutive instruments and agreements. The Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations applies to diplomatic agents and missions, not directly to IOs, although some principles may be analogous."
