CB and fuse.\n\nCircuit breakers (CB) and fuses are typically used to protect Solid State Relays (SSR), including Silicon Controlled Rectifiers (SCR), from overcurrent conditions that could cause damage. These protective devices interrupt the circuit when the current exceeds a safe level, preventing potential harm to the SCR. While heat sinks help manage the temperature, snubber circuits protect against voltage spikes, and voltage clamping devices limit voltage levels, it is the circuit breakers and fuses that specifically address overcurrent protection."
