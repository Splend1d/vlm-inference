Carbon 3 has less hydrogen atoms\n\nThis description explains why 2-butene is the major product because it relates to the stability of the carbocation intermediates formed during the elimination reaction. In the case of 2-bromobutane undergoing an E1 mechanism, the formation of a tertiary carbocation (from the second carbon) is more stable than a secondary carbocation (from the third carbon). This is due to the fact that the tertiary carbocation has more hyperconjugative structures and can better delocalize the positive charge, making it more stable. As a result, the reaction prefers to form 2-butene as the major product because it results from the more stable carbocation intermediate."
