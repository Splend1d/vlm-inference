Like the Sugar Act of 1764, increasing federal income tax rates after World War I was aimed at raising revenue to defray the expenses of war and government operations. The excerpt mentions \"defraying the expenses of defending, protecting, and securing\" the American colonies, while the post-WWI tax increases were used to pay off war debts and fund government programs."
