It stimulated the development of a market revolution.\n\nThe expansion of the transportation network in the early 19th century facilitated the movement of goods and people across the country, which in turn helped to stimulate economic growth and the transformation of the U.S. economy into a more integrated national market. This period is often referred to as the \"Market Revolution,\" characterized by the shift from an agrarian-based economy to one increasingly driven by commerce and industry. The improved transportation infrastructure allowed for faster and cheaper transport of goods, which encouraged the growth of markets and trade, leading to increased specialization and interdependence among different regions of the country."
