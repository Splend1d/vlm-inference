Among the options given, option C involves a preliminary question of fact that the judge would decide: \"Whether a conspiracy existed and defendant and declarant were members of the conspiracy before admitting an alleged declaration by a co-conspirator.\" This is because the existence of a conspiracy and the membership in it are foundational facts necessary for the admission of statements made by co-conspirators under the hearsay exception rules.\n\nWhile the other options involve factual determinations that might ultimately be considered by the jury, the decision to admit or exclude evidence based on these preliminary questions falls to the judge. However, the specific circumstances under which each type of evidence may be admitted can vary depending on jurisdiction and the applicable rules of evidence. In practice, the judge will often make a ruling on the admissibility of evidence in all of these situations, but the nature of option C makes it particularly clear that it is a question for the judge regarding the application of an exception to the hearsay rule."
