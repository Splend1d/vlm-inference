The prosecution alleges that he murdered his wife by giving her a massive injection of succinylcholine while she was asleep. Succinylcholine is a drug used in small quantities by anesthesiologists as a muscle relaxant. The prosecution claims that the fatal dose given to the wife so totally relaxed her lung muscles that she suffocated. During the trial, a toxicologist, who had no previous knowledge of the case, sat in court and heard all of the evidence about the wife's death and autopsy. As part of the doctor's defense, his attorney calls the toxicologist to give his opinion on the cause of the wife's death. May the toxicologist so testify?\n\nA. Yes, because he can identify the data upon which his opinion is based.\nB. Yes, because an expert may base his opinion on facts made known to him at the trial.\nC. No, because he has no personal knowledge of the wife's death.\nD. No, because the cause of death is an issue to be decided by the jury.\n"

Yes, because an expert may base his opinion on facts made known to him at the trial.\n\nIn legal proceedings, experts can provide testimony based on information presented during the trial even if they did not have prior knowledge of the case or were not present when the events occurred. The rationale behind this rule is that experts can offer specialized knowledge that may assist the jury in understanding complex issues related to the case. In this scenario, the toxicologist can analyze the evidence and provide an opinion on whether the wife's death could have been caused by a massive injection of succinylcholine, based on the facts provided during the trial."
