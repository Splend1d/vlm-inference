                    "text": "The correct answer is B. The hydrogen atom undergoes rapid intermolecular exchange.\n\nIn the context of NMR spectroscopy, if a hydrogen atom undergoes rapid exchange with other hydrogen atoms in the solvent or with other molecules, it will appear as a singlet because the averaging effect of the exchange results in a single resonance line. This is due to the fact that the chemical shifts of the exchanging hydrogens average out over time, leading to a single signal rather than a split signal that would be observed if the hydrogen was bonded to a nucleus with spin (like 35Cl and 37Cl which both have nuclear spins).\n\nOptions A and D are incorrect because neither 35Cl nor 37Cl have zero nuclear spin; 35Cl has a nuclear spin of 3/2 and 37Cl has a nuclear spin of 3/2 as well. Option C is not directly relevant to the question since molecular rigidity does not necessarily determine whether a signal will be a singlet in an NMR spectrum."
