The neighbor's plan conformed to all local building ordinances and land use regulations. The owner had been in the house for 10 years and the neighbor recently bought the adjoining lot. The owner showed that a different placement of the house would not interfere with her use and enjoyment of her residence. The trial judge ruled in favor of the defendant on the basis that the defendant had a right to build his house anywhere as long as he followed the building/zoning laws. The owner appealed. Will the appellate court likely reverse the trial court's decision?\n\nA. Yes, because blocking a neighbor's sunlight is a constitutional deprivation of substantive due process.\nB. Yes, because the proposed use is a private nuisance that unreasonably interferes with the owner's use and enjoyment of her property.\nC. No, because the trial court was correct in ruling that there had to be some violation of building regulations before the construction could be enjoined.\nD. No, because a comparative evaluation of the benefits and detriments of each position favor the neighbor's position.\n"

Yes, because the proposed use is a private nuisance that unreasonably interferes with the owner's use and enjoyment of her property.\n\nThe appellate court may consider that the owner has demonstrated an unreasonable interference with the use and enjoyment of her property due to the neighbor's planned construction. This situation could be seen as a private nuisance, which is a legal concept that addresses interference with one's use and enjoyment of their land. If the appellate court agrees that the planned construction constitutes a private nuisance, it may reverse the trial court's decision and potentially grant an injunction against the neighbor's construction plans. However, the court will also weigh the interests of both parties and consider whether the interference is substantial enough to warrant such a remedy."
