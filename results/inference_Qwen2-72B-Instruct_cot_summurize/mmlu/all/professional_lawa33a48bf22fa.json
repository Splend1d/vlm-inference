The contract had a liquidated damages clause that provided for a deduction from the contract price for each day of delay in completing the bridge. The formula for the deductions from the contract price was based on how much traffic flow was turned away. The city tried to deduct the damages from the contract price. The contractor, however, pointed out that the city had not yet connected a road to the bridge so that there was no traffic flow and hence no damage to the city. Will the court uphold the liquidated damages clause in favor of the city?\n\nA. No, because the city's failure to perform has frustrated the purpose of the liquidated damages clause, making liquidated damages in this case unnecessary due to no damages suffered.\nB. Yes, because the contract provision for liquidated damages has been breached and the city had no obligation to connect a road.\nC. Yes, because the bridge delays caused the city to delay finishing the road, thereby creating the need to enforce the provision for liquidated damages.\nD. No, because the city breached the contract by not connecting a road to the bridge.\n"

No, because the city's failure to perform has frustrated the purpose of the liquidated damages clause, making liquidated damages in this case unnecessary due to no damages suffered.\n\nThe purpose of a liquidated damages clause is to provide compensation for losses or damages that may be difficult to quantify when the breach occurs. In this case, the damages were supposed to be based on how much traffic flow was turned away due to the delayed completion of the bridge. However, since the city did not connect a road to the bridge, there was no traffic flow, and thus no quantifiable damages occurred as a result of the delay. Therefore, the court would likely rule that the liquidated damages clause cannot be enforced because the city did not suffer any actual damages due to its own failure to complete the necessary infrastructure."
