Therefore, options A, B, and D are all correct in describing aspects of collective rights. Option C is not necessarily true, as minority rights can be either individual or collective, depending on the context. \n\nIn general, collective rights recognize that certain groups may have unique interests or needs that require special protection or recognition. Examples of collective rights might include indigenous peoples' rights to land and resources, workers' rights to organize and bargain collectively, or the right of ethnic or linguistic minorities to maintain their cultural heritage. These rights may be recognized by international law, national constitutions, or other legal frameworks."
