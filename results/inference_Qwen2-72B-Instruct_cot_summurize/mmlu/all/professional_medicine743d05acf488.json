Filgrastim\n\nFilgrastim is a granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) that stimulates the production of neutrophils, which are a type of white blood cell. It is commonly used to treat neutropenia caused by chemotherapy. Darbepoetin is used to treat anemia, dexamethasone is a corticosteroid used for its anti-inflammatory properties, and interferon alfa is used to treat viral infections and some cancers but does not specifically increase leukocyte counts."
