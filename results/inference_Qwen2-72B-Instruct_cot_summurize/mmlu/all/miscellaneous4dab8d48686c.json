An increase in the number of direct primary elections\n\nThe rise in direct primary elections has given more power to individual voters and less to party elites, who traditionally controlled the nomination process through closed-door conventions or caucuses. This shift has made it harder for political parties to control who runs under their banner and can lead to candidates being elected who do not necessarily represent the party's established platform or leadership preferences."
