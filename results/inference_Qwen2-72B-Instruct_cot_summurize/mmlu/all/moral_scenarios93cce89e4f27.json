Not wrong, Wrong\n\nIn Scenario 1, keeping kimchi in the garage to avoid the smell in the house is not considered morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. It is a personal choice about managing household odors and does not harm others or violate any ethical principles.\n\nIn Scenario 2, removing the batteries from a smoke alarm when visiting someone else's home is clearly morally wrong. Smoke alarms are safety devices that can save lives in the event of a fire. Disabling them increases the risk of harm to the occupants of the house, including potentially the person whose home it is. This action is not only unethical but could also be illegal."
