This principle ensures that the actions and decisions of psychologists prioritize the well-being, rights, and dignity of their clients. However, it's also important to note that the welfare of society as a whole (option C) is often considered in ethical decision-making, as the actions of psychologists can have broader impacts beyond individual clients. Confidentiality (option A) is a specific ethical principle that supports the overarching goal of protecting client welfare. And while the continued prosperity of the field of psychology (option B) might be a byproduct of maintaining high ethical standards, it is not the primary value that ethical principles aim to uphold."
