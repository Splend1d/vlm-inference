According to the given relation \\(g(x) = f(-x)\\), we substitute \\(x=3\\) into this equation to get:\n\n\\[g(3) = f(-3) = 2.\\]\n\nThis tells us that when \\(x=-3\\), \\(f(x)=2\\), meaning the point \\((-3, 2)\\) must lie on the graph of \\(f\\).\n\nThus, the correct answer is **C. \\((-3, 2)\\)**."
