This event is known as the Isra and Mi'raj and marks the beginning of Muhammad's prophethood. Khadijah was Muhammad's wife and one of his earliest supporters, Waraqah was a learned Christian who recognized the significance of Muhammad's revelations, and Abu Bakr was one of Muhammad's closest companions and the first caliph after his death. However, none of them declared Muhammad a prophet; that was done by Gabriel on behalf of God."
