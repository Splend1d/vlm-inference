They argued that behavior should be studied in its natural context rather than in artificial laboratory settings. This criticism is based on the ethological perspective that animals' behaviors are influenced by their evolutionary history and ecological niches, which cannot be adequately represented or understood within the constraints of a lab.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that ethologists might also take issue with some aspects of B. the use of humans in laboratory experiments, particularly if those experiments do not consider the full range of human behaviors and experiences that occur outside of controlled settings. But the primary point of contention between ethologists and behaviorists was often the former's emphasis on studying animals in their natural habitats versus the latter's focus on controlled laboratory conditions.\n\nRegarding C. the use of the trial-and-error system and D. the use of the operant conditioning principle, while these are key concepts in behaviorism, ethologists do not necessarily disagree with these principles per se. Instead, their disagreement stems from the context in which these principles are applied\u2014namely, the artificiality of laboratory experiments and the potential neglect of innate behaviors shaped by evolution."
