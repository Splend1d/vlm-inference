This type of memory is not tied to personal experiences or specific events, as episodic memory would be, nor does it involve skills or procedures, which would be covered by procedural memory. Eidetic memory, often confused with photographic memory, is a term used to describe the ability to recall images, sounds, or objects in memory with high precision for a few seconds after the stimulus has been removed, and is not a widely accepted category of long-term memory."
