Yes, because of the rule in Shelly's case.\nB. No, because when property is put in a trust through a donee's special power of appointment, creditors cannot reach the funds.\nC. Yes, because the will is invalidated by the rule of sequential appointments, and the grandchild does not take at all.\nD. No, because the will as written violates the rule against perpetuities, and reconstructed, the funds revert to the original owner or her heirs.v\n"

No, because when property is put in a trust through a donee's special power of appointment, creditors cannot reach the funds.\n\nIn this scenario, the lady has created a trust for her grandchild's benefit, with a special power of appointment to dispose of the property after her death. The creditors of the grandchild typically cannot attach the trust property because it remains under the control of the trustee until the grandchild's death. At that point, the property is distributed according to the terms of the trust, which in this case goes to the grandchild's children (if any) or reverts to other beneficiaries if no appointment is made by the grandchild's will. The rule in Shelley's Case is not applicable here because it deals with reversionary interests in estates, not trusts or powers of appointment. The rule against perpetuities might be relevant if the trust violated the rule, but since the trust appears to vest within a life in being plus 21 years (the grandchild's life plus any children born within 21 years of the grandchild's death), it likely complies with the rule against perpetuities."
