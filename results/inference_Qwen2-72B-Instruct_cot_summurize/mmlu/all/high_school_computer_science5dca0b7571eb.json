We add the carried 1 to it, resulting in 2 again, so we carry over 1 and set the current position to 0.\n- The next digit is 0, and we add the carried 1 to it, resulting in 1, with no carryover.\n\nSo the addition looks like this:\n\n```\n1001 0011\n+        1\n---------\n1001 0100\n```\n\nTherefore, the next student's ID number will be 1001 0100, which corresponds to choice A."
