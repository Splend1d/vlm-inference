This can lead to the evolution of traits that enhance an individual's ability to win such competitions, such as larger body size, weaponry (like antlers or horns), and aggressive behaviors.\n\nIntersexual selection, also known as sexual choice, involves one sex (usually females) choosing mates based on certain desirable traits. These traits may be indicators of good health, genetic quality, or the ability to provide resources, leading to the evolution of features like bright plumage, elaborate courtship displays, or songs.\n\nBoth processes contribute to sexual dimorphism in different ways, but they are not mutually exclusive and often work together to shape the characteristics we see in sexually dimorphic species. Therefore, while both C and D are correct answers, the question seems to ask for a single primary cause, which makes it somewhat ambiguous. In many cases, sexual dimorphism is the result of a combination of both intrasexual and intersexual selection pressures."
