I'll sell them to you for $60 per ticket, which is $10 above face value. Since the concert has been sold out for months, I think that is a good deal. You have 15 days from the above date to decide whether to accept this offer. \"The man received the letter on May 4, but did not read it until May 6. On May 18, the man went to the woman's home and attempted to accept the offer. The woman replied:\"Too late! I sold the tickets last week for $75 each. \"Assume that the woman's letter created in the man a valid power of acceptance. Was that power terminated by lapse of time before the man went to the woman's home on May 17?\n\nA. Yes, because the letter was mailed on May 2.\nB. Yes, because the letter was dated May 1.\nC. No, because the man received the letter on May 4.\nD. No, because the man did not read the letter until May 6.\n"

No, because the man received the letter on May 4.\n\nThe power of acceptance in a firm offer typically does not terminate due to the passage of time if the offeree receives the offer within the time frame specified by the offeror. In this case, the woman gave the man 15 days from May 1 (the date mentioned in the letter) to accept her offer. The man received the letter on May 4, which means he had until May 16 to accept the offer (May 1 + 15 days = May 16). Since the man attempted to accept the offer on May 18, he was outside the original timeframe, but the termination of the power of acceptance due to lapse of time would not have occurred before May 17, as stated in the question. However, the key point here is that the offer was still open for acceptance until May 16, so options A, B, and D are incorrect. Option C correctly states that the power of acceptance was not terminated by the lapse of time before May 17 because the man received the letter on May 4 and thus had until May 16 to accept."
