It began around 10,000 BCE and continued through to about 2,000 BCE in various parts of the world at different times. This period saw the development of farming techniques, animal domestication, and the establishment of permanent settlements, which eventually led to complex societies and civilizations. The process was not instantaneous but rather evolved gradually as humans learned to cultivate crops and raise animals systematically."
