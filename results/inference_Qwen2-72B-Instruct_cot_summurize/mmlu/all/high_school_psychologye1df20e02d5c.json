However, it's important to clarify that the direct conversion of mechanical energy into electrochemical energy typically occurs in specialized cells called piezoelectric crystals or in biological systems such as the hair cells in the inner ear, which contain mechanoreceptors sensitive to mechanical vibrations. These mechanoreceptors (a type of pressure receptor) can be found in various parts of the body, including the ears, where they convert sound wave vibrations (mechanical energy) into electrochemical signals that the brain can interpret as sound.\n\nGlandular effectors (A) release hormones or other substances in response to neural stimulation, not mechanical energy. Muscular effectors (B) contract in response to neural signals, converting electrochemical energy into mechanical work. Rods and cones (D) are photoreceptor cells in the retina that convert light energy into electrochemical signals, not mechanical energy."
