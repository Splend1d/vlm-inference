Higher frequency sounds cause the greatest vibration at the base (stapes) end of the basilar membrane, while lower frequencies cause the greatest vibration closer to the apex (oval window). This allows the brain to determine the pitch of a sound based on the location of the maximum vibration along the basilar membrane."
