Among the options given:\n\nA. Will hinder global trade: This could be a concern for some countries due to differing regulations and consumer acceptance of GMOs, potentially leading to trade barriers.\n\nB. Make plants more resistant to disease: This is actually seen as a benefit by proponents of GMOs, as it could reduce crop losses and the need for pesticides.\n\nC. May cause irreversible changes in humans: There is no scientific evidence to support the claim that consuming GMOs leads to genetic changes in humans. The fear is based on the idea that foreign genes from GMO crops could somehow integrate into human DNA, which is not supported by current scientific understanding.\n\nD. Make plants more resistant to drought: This is another potential benefit of GMOs, aimed at improving agricultural productivity under water-stressed conditions.\n\nThe primary fear opponents of GMOs have is usually related to option C, though it's important to note that there is no credible scientific evidence that GMOs cause harm to human health. However, the concerns about environmental impacts, such as gene flow to wild relatives or impacts on non-target species, are areas of active research and debate."
