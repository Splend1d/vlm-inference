Its pH of 6.0 indicates that it is slightly acidic, as it is below the neutral pH of 7.\nB. This statement is incorrect because Lake B's pH is lower than Lake A's, indicating that Lake B is less alkaline (or more acidic) than Lake A.\nC. The hydrogen ion concentration of Lake B cannot be determined to be 10^4 M based on the given information. However, knowing the pH allows us to calculate the hydrogen ion concentration. For Lake B with a pH of 6.0, the hydrogen ion concentration is 10^-6 M, not 10^4 M.\nD. Acid rain would introduce more hydrogen ions into the lakes, which would decrease their pH and make them more acidic. This statement is correct, as the addition of acid would reduce the pH of both lakes."
