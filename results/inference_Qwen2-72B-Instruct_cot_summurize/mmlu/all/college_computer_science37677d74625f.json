We can simulate the Turing machine M for n steps on a blank tape and see if it halts before n steps or not. If it does halt before n steps, then the answer is no; otherwise, the answer is yes. Since the simulation will take finite time (at most n steps), this is a decidable problem.\n\n**Problem II:**\nThe computation C lasts for at least n steps, and M prints a 1 at some point after the nth step.\n\nThis problem is not decidable. This is because determining whether a Turing machine will ever print a 1 at any point in its computation is equivalent to solving the halting problem, which is undecidable. Even if we know the computation lasts for at least n steps, we cannot predict what will happen after the nth step, including whether a 1 will be printed.\n\n**Problem III:**\nM scans at least n distinct tape squares during the computation C.\n\nThis problem is decidable. We can simulate the Turing machine M and keep track of all the tape squares it visits. If, during the simulation, we find that M has visited at least n distinct tape squares, we can stop and say yes. If the machine halts before visiting n distinct tape squares, we can also say no. Since the number of steps taken during the simulation is finite (even if the computation itself might not halt), this problem is decidable.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\n**D. I and III only**"
