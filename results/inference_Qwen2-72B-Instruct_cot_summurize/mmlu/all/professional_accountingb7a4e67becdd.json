This will give us the weighted average cost per unit.\n\nInitial inventory:\n- 200 units at a total cost of $1250\n\nPurchases:\n- May 4: 20 units at $5.80 each = $116\n- May 17: 80 units at $5.50 each = $440\n\nTotal units before sales = 200 (initial) + 20 (May 4 purchase) + 80 (May 17 purchase) = 300 units\n\nTotal cost before sales = $1250 (initial) + $116 (May 4 purchase) + $440 (May 17 purchase) = $1806\n\nWeighted average cost per unit = Total cost / Total units\n= $1806 / 300 units\n= $6.02 per unit\n\nOn May 14, Cobb sold 10 units. The cost of goods sold (COGS) for these units would be calculated using the weighted average cost per unit:\n\nCost of goods sold for May = 10 units * $6.02 per unit = $60.20\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. $60.20."
