Predatory pricing is a strategy in which a company reduces prices to a level where it is unprofitable for smaller competitors to compete. This can lead to the elimination of competition and the creation of a monopoly. The numbers you've listed could potentially refer to steps or factors related to predatory pricing, but without further information, I can't provide a specific answer. If you provide more details or rephrase your question, I'd be happy to help!"
