                    "text": "When an excise tax is imposed on the production of good X in a competitive market, the answer that best describes the effect of this tax on consumers depends on the elasticity of demand for the good. Here's how each option holds up:\n\nA. If the demand curve is perfectly elastic, the price rises by the amount of the tax.\n- This statement is incorrect. With perfectly elastic demand, any increase in price would cause quantity demanded to drop to zero. Thus, if the tax is imposed on the producer, they cannot pass any part of the tax onto the consumer through price increases. Instead, the entire tax burden falls on the producer, and the supply curve shifts downward (to the left), leading to a lower equilibrium quantity but no change in price.\n\nB. The consumer's burden of the tax rises as the demand curve is more elastic.\n- This statement is incorrect. Actually, the opposite is true. As the demand becomes more elastic, the consumer's burden of the tax decreases because they can more easily switch to alternative goods in response to price increases. This means producers bear a larger portion of the tax.\n\nC. Consumer surplus rises as a result of the tax.\n- This statement is incorrect. Imposing a tax typically reduces consumer surplus because it raises the price paid by consumers and decreases the quantity of goods sold. Both effects decrease consumer surplus.\n\nD. The consumer's burden of the tax rises as the demand curve is less elastic.\n- This statement is correct. When the demand for a good is inelastic, consumers are less responsive to changes in price. This means that when a tax is imposed, consumers will continue to buy similar quantities of the good despite the higher price. Therefore, they bear a greater portion of the tax burden because they pay higher prices without significantly changing their consumption habits.\n\nSo, the correct answer is D: The consumer's burden of the tax rises as the demand curve is less elastic."
