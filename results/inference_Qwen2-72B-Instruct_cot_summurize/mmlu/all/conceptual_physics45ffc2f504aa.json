When a neutron strikes the nucleus of a fissile atom, it can cause the nucleus to split into two smaller nuclei, releasing a significant amount of energy and typically one or more additional neutrons. These newly released neutrons can then collide with other fissile nuclei, causing them to undergo fission and release more neutrons, thus sustaining the chain reaction."
