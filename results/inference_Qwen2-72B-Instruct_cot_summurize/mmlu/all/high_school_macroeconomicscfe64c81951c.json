                    "text": "The correct answer is A. Money supply increases by $10 million lowering the interest rate and increasing AD.\n\nWhen the reserve ratio is 10 percent, for every dollar that a bank receives as a deposit, it must hold 10 cents in reserve and can lend out the remaining 90 cents. When the Fed buys Treasury securities from commercial banks, it injects liquidity into the banking system, allowing banks to increase their lending activities. This process is called the money multiplier effect.\n\nIn this case, if the Fed buys $1 million in Treasury securities, the initial amount of new reserves created in the banking system is $1 million. With a reserve ratio of 10 percent, the money multiplier is equal to 1 / reserve ratio = 1 / 0.10 = 10. Therefore, the potential increase in the money supply is $1 million * 10 = $10 million.\n\nIf money demand is perfectly elastic, it means that people will hold any additional money supplied at the current interest rate. Thus, the increase in the money supply will lead to a decrease in the interest rate, as there is more money available for borrowing at the same interest rate. Lower interest rates make borrowing cheaper, which can stimulate investment and consumption, leading to an increase in aggregate demand (AD).\n\nTherefore, when the reserve ratio is 10 percent and the Fed buys $1 million in Treasury securities from commercial banks, with money demand being perfectly elastic, the money supply is likely to increase by $10 million, lowering the interest rate and increasing AD."
