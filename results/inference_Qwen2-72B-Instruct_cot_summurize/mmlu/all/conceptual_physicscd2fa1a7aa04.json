Momentum (p) is given by the formula \\( p = mv \\).\n\nIf the speed (velocity) of the body is doubled, then:\n\n- The new kinetic energy will be \\( KE_{\\text{new}} = \\frac{1}{2}m(2v)^2 = 4(\\frac{1}{2}mv^2) = 4KE \\). So, the kinetic energy quadruples.\n- The new momentum will be \\( p_{\\text{new}} = m(2v) = 2mv = 2p \\). So, the momentum doubles.\n\nTherefore, when the speed is doubled, the kinetic energy quadruples (more than doubles), but the momentum doubles.\n\nThe correct answer to the question is B. doubles."
