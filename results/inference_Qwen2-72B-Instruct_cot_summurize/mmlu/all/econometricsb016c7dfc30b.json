The roots of the characteristic equation must all lie inside the unit circle.\n\nThis condition ensures that the AR process is stable and exhibits long-run behavior that does not diverge over time, which is a key property of stationarity. Specifically, for an AR(p) process given by:\n\n\\[ y_t = \\phi_1 y_{t-1} + \\phi_2 y_{t-2} + ... + \\phi_p y_{t-p} + \\epsilon_t \\]\n\nwhere \\(y_t\\) is the time series at time t, \\(\\phi_i\\) are the parameters, and \\(\\epsilon_t\\) is white noise, the characteristic equation is:\n\n\\[ 1 - \\phi_1 z - \\phi_2 z^2 - ... - \\phi_p z^p = 0 \\]\n\nThe process is stationary if all roots of this equation lie inside the unit circle in the complex plane. This implies that the absolute values of all roots are less than one, which corresponds to option D as well. However, option A is more specific to the concept of the unit circle in the complex plane, which is the standard way of expressing this condition in time series analysis."
