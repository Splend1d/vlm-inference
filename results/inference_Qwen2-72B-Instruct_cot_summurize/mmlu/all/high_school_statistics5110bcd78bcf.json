Stratified sample, because the population is divided into five strata\u2014namely, five offices in five different countries\nB.

Stratified sample, because the population is divided into five strata\u2014namely, five offices in five different countries\n\nStratified sampling is the most appropriate technique in this scenario because it allows the company to account for the potential differences in opinions across the five countries. By dividing the population into strata (in this case, based on country/office), the company can ensure that each subgroup is represented in the sample in proportion to its size in the overall population. This increases the likelihood that the sample will be representative of the entire population and reduces sampling error.\n\nCluster sampling could also potentially be used if the company treated each office as a cluster, but stratified sampling is more appropriate when there are known differences between groups (strata) that need to be accounted for in the sampling process. Simple random sampling does not take into account any differences between subgroups within the population, which could lead to biased results if one or more subgroups are underrepresented in the sample."
