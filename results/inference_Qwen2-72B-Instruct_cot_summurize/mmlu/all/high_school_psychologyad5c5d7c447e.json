The experiment involved leaving the baby alone with a stranger for a short period of time, and then observing the baby's reaction when the parent returned. Based on the baby's behavior during this process, Ainsworth identified three main attachment styles: secure, anxious-avoidant, and anxious-resistant. Later research added a fourth category called disorganized/disoriented. This research has been instrumental in understanding how early relationships between caregivers and children can impact later social and emotional development."
