Chino\n\nChino, who is Maria's boyfriend and a member of the Sharks gang, shoots Tony in a fit of rage after Tony has killed Bernardo, Maria's brother and the leader of the Sharks, earlier in the story. This tragic event occurs during the climax of the film, reinforcing the theme of senseless violence and its devastating consequences."
