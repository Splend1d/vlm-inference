I, II, III, and IV\n\nIn all of these market structures, firms will typically aim to maximize profits by setting production where marginal cost (MC) equals marginal revenue (MR). This is because producing one more unit will add no additional profit when MC=MR. Producing less than this point would mean foregoing potential profit, while producing more would result in losses on those extra units.\n\nHere's how it works for each structure:\n\n1. **Perfect Competition**: Firms take prices as given and produce up to the point where MC=MR=P (where P is the market price), maximizing profits.\n\n2. **Oligopoly**: Firms may not have a well-defined demand curve due to interdependence, but they still seek to maximize profits where MC=MR, possibly through strategic behavior like collusion or game theory.\n\n3. **Monopoly**: A single seller faces a downward-sloping demand curve and sets output where MC=MR to maximize profits, leading to higher prices and lower output than in perfect competition.\n\n4. **Monopolistic Competition**: Firms have some pricing power due to product differentiation but still seek to maximize profits where MC=MR, balancing the need to cover costs and attract customers.\n\nThus, the principle of equating marginal cost to marginal revenue applies across different market structures as a general rule for profit maximization."
