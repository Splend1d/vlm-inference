Plugging the values into the formula:\n\n0.6 = 1 * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nSquaring both sides:\n\n0.36 = 1 - v^2/c^2\n\nRearranging for v^2/c^2:\n\nv^2/c^2 = 0.64\n\nTaking the square root:\n\nv/c = 0.8\n\nTherefore, the speed of each spaceship, as measured by the observer on Earth, is 0.8c. However, this option is not available in the given choices. It seems there might have been a misunderstanding in the question or the answer choices provided. The correct answer based on the calculation would be 0.8c, but since it's not an option, none of the provided choices (A-D) are correct."
