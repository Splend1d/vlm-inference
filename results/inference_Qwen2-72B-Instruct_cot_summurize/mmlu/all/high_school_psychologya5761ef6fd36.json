Their bloodstream continues to contain elevated levels of adrenaline.\n\nAfter a crisis, the body may still have higher levels of stress hormones like adrenaline (also known as epinephrine) circulating in the bloodstream. These hormones were released by the adrenal glands in response to the perceived threat or danger and can take some time to return to normal levels. The lingering effects of these hormones can contribute to feelings of heightened alertness or anxiety even after the immediate danger has passed."
