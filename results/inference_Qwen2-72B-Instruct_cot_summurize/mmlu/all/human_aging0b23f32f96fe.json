Smaller inner circles.\n\nResearch has shown that as people age, they tend to have smaller social networks but closer relationships with those in their inner circle. This may be due to factors such as retirement, health issues, and the loss of friends and family members over time. Younger adults, on the other hand, often have larger social networks that include more acquaintances and peripheral connections. However, it's important to note that there can be significant individual variation in social network size and structure across different age groups."
