A high school student was driving in his car and listening to punk music on his car stereo system, which included a set of 12-inch subwoofers mounted in the rear. As the student drove past the high school, he turned up the volume to its highest level. A police car drove alongside the student and, hearing the loud and raucous music; the police officers arrested the student and charged him with violating the anti- noise statute. Before the student was brought to trial, the highest court in the state ruled the statute unconstitutional as vague and overbroad. As a result, the charges against the student were dropped, and his case was dismissed. Thereafter, the district attorney's office decided to prosecute the student for violating a state attempt statute. The attempt statute provided that legal impossibility was no defense. Thereupon, the student was charged with attempting to violate the anti-noise statute. At trial, the student took the stand to testifi on his own behalf. He testified that when he was arrested, he had purposely turned up the stereo to its highest level because his favorite song was playing. Will the student be found guilty of violating the attempt statute?\n\nA. Yes, because he possessed the requisite intent.\nB. Yes, because dismissal of the initial charge was not a final judgment and, therefore, double jeopardy does not attach.\nC. No, because double jeopardy precludes prosecution for attempt after the initial prosecution was dismissed.\nD. No, because a defendant cannot be retried for attempted commission of a crime that has been ruled unconstitutional by a state's highest court.\n"

No, because a defendant cannot be retried for attempted commission of a crime that has been ruled unconstitutional by a state's highest court.\n\nThe rationale behind this answer is based on the principles of double jeopardy and the rule that one cannot be punished for attempting to commit an act that is not a crime. Since the anti-noise statute was declared unconstitutional, it follows that there could be no valid conviction under that statute. Attempting to violate an unconstitutional statute cannot be a crime because there is no underlying criminal act to attempt. Therefore, prosecuting the student for attempting to violate the now-unconstitutional statute would be improper. Additionally, the double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution protects individuals from being tried again for the same offense after acquittal or conviction, and while the initial charge was not technically an acquittal or conviction, the principle applies in spirit given the statute's invalidation."
