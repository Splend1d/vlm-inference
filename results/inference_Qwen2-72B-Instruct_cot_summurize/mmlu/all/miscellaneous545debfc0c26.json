The correct answer, in the context of the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale, should be 74 mph, which is the minimum sustained wind speed for a storm to be classified as a hurricane. This equates to Category 1 on the scale. Note that the options provided seem to mix metric and non-metric units incorrectly, and typically wind speeds for hurricanes are discussed in miles per hour in the United States."
