The lowest level corresponds to mere images and shadows, which represent mere imagination. The next level up is that of belief, where one begins to recognize objects directly rather than just their shadows. However, this is still not true knowledge because it does not grasp the underlying Forms or Ideas.\n\nTrue knowledge comes when one moves beyond the sensible world to understand the eternal and unchanging Forms. These Forms are the ultimate reality for Plato, and they are grasped not through the senses but through reason and intellectual insight. Therefore, option D best captures Plato's view of how knowledge is attained: it involves understanding things in terms of the rational order provided by the Forms, which are perceived by the mind, not the senses."
