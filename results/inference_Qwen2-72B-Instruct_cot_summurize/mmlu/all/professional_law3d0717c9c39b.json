This is known as the \"opening the door\" doctrine. In this case, since the defendant presented character witnesses to testify about his good character, the prosecution can now introduce evidence of the defendant's bad character to rebut the defense's claims. However, the scope of such evidence is limited to the same character traits that the defense raised."
