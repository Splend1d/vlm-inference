However, it is about 207 times more massive than an electron. Despite this difference in mass, the muon behaves very similarly to the electron in terms of its interactions and properties, making option A the best choice among those provided.\n\nMuons belong to the second generation of leptons, whereas electrons are part of the first generation. Both particles participate in the weak interaction and have a spin of 1/2, classifying them as fermions. Muons can decay into an electron, an electron antineutrino, and a muon neutrino via the weak interaction.\n\nIn contrast, mesons are composite particles made up of a quark and an antiquark, photons are massless gauge bosons that mediate the electromagnetic force, and bosons are force-carrying particles that mediate fundamental forces and have integer spins according to the spin-statistics theorem."
