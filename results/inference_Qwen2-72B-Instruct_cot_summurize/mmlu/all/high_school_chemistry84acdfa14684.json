We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pKa:\n\npH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])\n\nwhere [A-] is the concentration of the conjugate base and [HA] is the concentration of the acid.\n\nWe know that at equilibrium, the amount of acid that has dissociated equals the amount of conjugate base that has formed. Let x be the amount of acid that has dissociated. Then, [A-] = x and [HA] = 0.01 - x.\n\nSince the acid is weak, only a small fraction of it will dissociate, so we can assume that 0.01 - x \u2248 0.01. This allows us to simplify the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to:\n\npH = pKa + log(x/0.01)\n\nNow we can solve for pKa:\n\n4.26 = pKa + log(x/0.01)\npKa = 4.26 - log(x/0.01)\n\nTo find x, we can use the expression for the hydrogen ion concentration:\n\n[H+] = 10^-pH = 10^-4.26 = 5.48 x 10^-5 M\n\nThis is equal to x, because each molecule of acid that dissociates produces one H+ ion and one A- ion. Substituting this into the equation for pKa, we get:\n\npKa = 4.26 - log(5.48 x 10^-5/0.01) = 4.26 - (-4.26) = 8.52\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. 8.52."
