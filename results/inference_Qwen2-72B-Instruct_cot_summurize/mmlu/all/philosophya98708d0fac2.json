It examines the nature of reality and the meaning and justification of beliefs. While it may consider how people with different beliefs or backgrounds disagree, this is not its primary focus. Philosophy also does not limit itself to questions answerable only through scientific experiments, nor does it claim that philosophical questions never have better or worse answers. Instead, it seeks to understand and evaluate arguments and concepts that may transcend empirical investigation."
