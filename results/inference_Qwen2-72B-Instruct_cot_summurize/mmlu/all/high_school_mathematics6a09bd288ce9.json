The equation given for the circle can be rewritten in standard form by completing the square.\n\nGiven:\n\\[2x^2 = -2y^2 + 12x - 4y + 20\\]\n\nRearrange it as:\n\\[2x^2 + 2y^2 - 12x + 4y - 20 = 0\\]\n\nDivide the entire equation by 2 to simplify:\n\\[x^2 + y^2 - 6x + 2y - 10 = 0\\]\n\nNow, complete the square for \\(x\\) and \\(y\\):\n\\[x^2 - 6x + 9 + y^2 + 2y + 1 = 10 + 9 + 1\\]\n\nSimplify:\n\\[(x - 3)^2 + (y + 1)^2 = 20\\]\n\nThis is the equation of a circle with center at \\((3, -1)\\) and radius \\(\\sqrt{20}\\).\n\nSince the circle is inscribed inside the square, the diameter of the circle is equal to the side length of the square. Therefore, the side length of the square is twice the radius of the circle, i.e., \\(2\\sqrt{20}\\). \n\nHowever, what we want is the area of the square. The area of a square is given by the square of its side length. So, if the side length is \\(2\\sqrt{20}\\), the area is:\n\n\\[\n(2\\sqrt{20})^2 = 4 \\cdot 20 = 80\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **A. 80**."
