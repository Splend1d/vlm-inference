This perspective focuses on individual experience, free will, and self-actualization, which is the process of realizing one's full potential. The humanistic approach was developed in reaction to the more deterministic and mechanistic views of behaviorism and psychoanalysis. Notable figures in this field include Abraham Maslow and Carl Rogers."
