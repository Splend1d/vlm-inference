This iconic image is often interpreted as a representation of Pacal's journey into the underworld and his eventual ascension to the heavens, where he would join his ancestors and deities. The scene has also been the subject of speculation in some fringe theories, but the scholarly consensus interprets it within the context of Maya religious beliefs and iconography."
