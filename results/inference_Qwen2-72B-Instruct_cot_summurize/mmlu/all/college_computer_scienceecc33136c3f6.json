For instance, the addition function on reals has a signature of\nadd : real x real -> real\nsince it takes two real numbers and returns a real number. But, for a language that allows functions as return values, addition could be considered to have the signature\nadd : real -> (real -> real)\nwhich means that add takes a single real (the first operand) and returns a new function that itself takes a single real (the second operand) and returns a real (the result). This process of reducing a function with multiple arguments to a function with fewer arguments is called currying. Which of the following is correct?\n\nA. Currying can be applied to any function to the point where it has exactly one input argument.\nB. Currying cannot be applied to functions of more than two arguments.\nC. Currying cannot be applied to functions that return functions as arguments.\nD. Currying cannot be applied w functions that haw arguments that are functions.\n"

Currying can be applied to any function to the point where it has exactly one input argument.\n\nCurrying is the process of transforming a function that takes multiple arguments into a sequence of functions that each take a single argument. It can indeed be applied to functions with any number of arguments, not just those with two arguments. The end result will be a series of functions, each taking exactly one argument. Therefore, option A is correct. Options B, C, and D are incorrect because they either limit the application of currying in ways that are not true or inaccurately describe what currying can be applied to."
