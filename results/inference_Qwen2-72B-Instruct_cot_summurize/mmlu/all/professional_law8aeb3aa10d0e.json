This includes documents or information shared in confidence. The privilege belongs to the client, and it cannot be waived by the attorney without the client's consent. In this case, the private bank records provided by the mayor to his attorney are protected by the attorney-client privilege, and the court should not compel their production unless an exception to the privilege applies (which is not indicated in the scenario)."
