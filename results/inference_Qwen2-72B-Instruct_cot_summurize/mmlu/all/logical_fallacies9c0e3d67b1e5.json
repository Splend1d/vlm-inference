This fallacy involves making an argument based on the premise that one action will inevitably lead to a chain of related events resulting in an undesirable outcome, without providing sufficient evidence for such a causal connection.\n\nHere's a brief explanation of each of the other options for clarity:\n\nA. Ad nauseam: This fallacy occurs when a statement is repeated so often that people accept it as true, regardless of its actual validity.\n\nB. Self-evident truths: This is not typically considered a formal logical fallacy, but rather a type of argument where something is claimed to be obviously true and therefore does not require further proof or evidence.\n\nD. Suppressed evidence: This fallacy involves deliberately withholding information or evidence that would weaken one's own argument or strengthen the opposing side's argument."
