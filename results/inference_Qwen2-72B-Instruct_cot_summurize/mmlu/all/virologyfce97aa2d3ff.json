The virion RNA is translated into a single large polyprotein\nC. The virion RNA acting as mRNA\n\nPositive-strand RNA viruses like picornaviruses have an RNA genome that is directly infectious and can act as messenger RNA (mRNA) within the host cell. Upon infection, the viral RNA is immediately recognized by the host's ribosomes and translated into a large polyprotein, which is then cleaved by viral proteases into functional proteins necessary for viral replication.\n\nOption A is not correct because although some RNA viruses do carry RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (transcriptase) with them, picornaviruses do not. Instead, they use the host cell's machinery to synthesize new RNA strands once their polyproteins are processed.\n\nOption D is not correct because picornaviruses typically exit the cell by causing lysis, which is a more direct form of cell death than apoptosis. Apoptosis is a programmed cell death mechanism that is often used by cells to eliminate themselves without causing inflammation or damage to surrounding tissues, whereas lysis is a more abrupt and destructive process."
