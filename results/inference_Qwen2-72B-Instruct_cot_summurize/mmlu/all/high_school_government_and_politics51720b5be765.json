The court helps set the public agenda by deciding which appeals to hear.\n\nThis statement is true because the Supreme Court has discretion over which cases it chooses to hear. It does not automatically hear every case appealed to it (option A is false). Instead, it typically selects cases that have significant legal questions or where there are conflicting decisions in lower courts. For a case to be heard, at least four of the nine justices must agree to grant a writ of certiorari (option C is false since it requires four justices, not two or more). Option D is also false; each justice's vote counts equally, and the chief justice does not have any additional voting power."
