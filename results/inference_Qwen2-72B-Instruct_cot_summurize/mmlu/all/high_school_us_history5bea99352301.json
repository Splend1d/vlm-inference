Moreover, I am cognizant of the interrelatedness of all communities and states. I cannot sit idly by in Atlanta and not be concerned about what happens in Birmingham. Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly affects all indirectly. Never again can we afford to live with the narrow, provincial 'outside agitator' idea. Anyone who lives inside the United States can never be considered an outsider anywhere in this country. . . .\"\n\u2014Martin Luther King, Jr., \"Letter from a Birmingham Jail,\" April 16, 1963\nSusan B.

Anthony and other leaders in the women's rights movement played a significant role in advocating for women's suffrage, which led to the ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment in 1920. This amendment granted women the right to vote in the United States. The Equal Rights Amendment (ERA), which aimed to guarantee equal legal rights for all American citizens regardless of sex, was first introduced in Congress in 1923 but has not been ratified into the Constitution as of now. The Fifteenth Amendment prohibited the denial of the right to vote based on race, color, or previous condition of servitude, and the Twenty-sixth Amendment lowered the voting age to 18, neither of which were directly influenced by Susan B. Anthony's work in the women's rights movement."
