The Pythagorean theorem gives us:\n\\[x^2 + y^2 = 9^2 = 81\\]\n\nWe are given that \\(\\frac{dx}{dt} = 2\\) m/s, and we want to find \\(\\frac{dy}{dt}\\) when \\(y = 3\\) m.\n\nDifferentiating both sides of the equation with respect to time \\(t\\), we get:\n\\[2x\\frac{dx}{dt} + 2y\\frac{dy}{dt} = 0\\]\n\nGiven \\(\\frac{dx}{dt} = 2\\) m/s, and substituting \\(y = 3\\) m into the original equation to solve for \\(x\\):\n\\[x^2 + 3^2 = 81\\]\n\\[x^2 = 72\\]\n\\[x = \\sqrt{72} = 6\\sqrt{2}\\]\n\nSubstituting \\(x = 6\\sqrt{2}\\) m, \\(y = 3\\) m, and \\(\\frac{dx}{dt} = 2\\) m/s into the differentiated equation:\n\\[2(6\\sqrt{2})(2) + 2(3)\\frac{dy}{dt} = 0\\]\n\\[24\\sqrt{2} + 6\\frac{dy}{dt} = 0\\]\n\\[6\\frac{dy}{dt} = -24\\sqrt{2}\\]\n\\[\\frac{dy}{dt} = -4\\sqrt{2}\\]\n\nThus, the speed at which the top end of the ladder is sliding down the wall when it is 3 meters above the ground is \\(4\\sqrt{2}\\) m/s.
