Without vitamin K, blood clotting would be severely impaired. The vitamin plays a crucial role in modifying these proteins so they can bind to calcium ions, which is necessary for their function in the clotting process. This is why vitamin K is often given to patients who have undergone surgery or have bleeding disorders to help promote proper blood clotting."
