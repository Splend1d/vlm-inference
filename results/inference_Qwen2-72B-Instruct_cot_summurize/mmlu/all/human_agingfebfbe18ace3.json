Studies suggest that approximately 40-50% of people who experience a significant loss may benefit from professional help during the grieving process. This can include counseling, therapy, support groups, or other forms of mental health care. However, it's important to note that everyone grieves differently and there is no \"one size fits all\" approach to grief support. Some people may find comfort in talking to friends and family, while others may need more structured support from a mental health professional."
