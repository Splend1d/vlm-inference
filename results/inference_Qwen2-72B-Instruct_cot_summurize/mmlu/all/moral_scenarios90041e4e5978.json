Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation:\nScenario 1: Throwing a flat stone toward a lake is not generally considered morally wrong, especially if it's done in a safe and legal manner, such as skipping stones on the water.\nScenario 2: Stirring someone's meal with one's hand might be considered unsanitary or impolite, but it does not necessarily constitute a clear moral wrongdoing unless there were circumstances that would make this action harmful, such as having an illness that could be transmitted or doing so with the intent to cause harm or disgust. Without additional context, it cannot be definitively labeled as morally wrong."
