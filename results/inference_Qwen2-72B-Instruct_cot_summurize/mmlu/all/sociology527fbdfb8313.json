These measures were intended to create a competitive environment among schools, where performance could be measured and compared, thus driving up standards. However, it's important to note that other aspects of market principles, such as parental choice (which might suggest option C is correct), were also promoted during this time. Parental choice was actually expanded, allowing parents to select schools based on performance data, which further fueled the competitive nature of the educational system.\n\nOptions A and B are not the primary outcomes of introducing market principles in education during the 1980s. While there were changes in how budgets were allocated and managed, these changes were often linked to performance metrics rather than simply increasing funding or delegating more power to Local Education Authorities (LEAs) without conditions."
