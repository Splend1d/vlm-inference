This EMF can drive a current in the loop if the circuit is complete (option A). The induced EMF is also known as an induced voltage (option B). Additionally, the changing magnetic field creates an electric field within the wire that drives the charges and contributes to the current flow (option C). Therefore, all three options are correct."
