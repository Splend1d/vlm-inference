Pernicious anemia\n\nPernicious anemia is a condition in which the body cannot absorb enough vitamin B-12 due to a lack of intrinsic factor, a protein produced by the stomach lining that helps absorb vitamin B-12. This can lead to low red blood cell counts and neurological problems. Treatment for pernicious anemia typically involves regular injections of vitamin B-12 to bypass the need for intrinsic factor and ensure adequate absorption of the vitamin."
