The boss directly suggested that if the defendant did not go out on a date with him, she would be fired in one week. Every day during the remainder of the week, the boss approached the defendant with his demand, and the defendant refused to cooperate. At the end of the week, when the boss called the defendant into his office and again tried to pressure her to go out on a date with him, the defendant knocked him unconscious with a giant stapler and choked him to death. The defendant is tried for murder. In accordance with the following statute, the state relies at trial on the presumption of malice:\"When the act of killing another is proved, malice aforethought shall be presumed, and the burden shall rest upon the party who committed the killing to show that malice did not exist. \"If the defendant is convicted of first-degree murder and challenges her conviction on the grounds of the above statute, on appeal she will\n\nA. win, because the statute is unconstitutional.\nB. win, because the statute violates due process.\nC. lose, because she failed to overcome the presumption.\nD. lose, because the presumption may be rebutted.\n"

                    "text": "The defendant's challenge to her conviction based on the statute's presumption of malice would likely fail, as such a presumption is generally considered constitutional if it is rebuttable. Therefore, the correct answer would be D: \"lose, because the presumption may be rebutted.\"\n\nPresumptions in law can shift the burden of proof onto the defendant to disprove certain elements of the crime, but they must allow for the possibility of rebuttal to avoid violating due process rights. In this case, the defendant had the opportunity to present evidence to show that she lacked the requisite malice aforethought. If she was unable to do so, or if the jury found the prosecution's case more convincing, she would be found guilty.\n\nIt's important to note that self-defense could potentially be a valid defense in this scenario, depending on the jurisdiction's laws and the specific circumstances of the incident. However, the question focuses on the challenge to the conviction based on the statute's presumption of malice, which does not directly address whether the defendant's actions were justified under the circumstances."
