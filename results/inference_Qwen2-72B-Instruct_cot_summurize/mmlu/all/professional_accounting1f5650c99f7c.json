The equation for this regression can be written as:\n\nY = \u03b1 + \u03b2X + \u03b5\n\nWhere:\n- Y is the stock return,\n- X is the market return,\n- \u03b1 (alpha) is the intercept which represents the expected return of the stock when the market return is zero; it also measures the stock's performance relative to the market,\n- \u03b2 (beta) is the slope which measures the responsiveness of the stock's return to changes in the market return,\n- \u03b5 (epsilon) is the error term representing the variability in stock returns that is not explained by market returns.\n\nTherefore, option C accurately describes what a simple linear regression between stock and market returns does: it estimates the alpha (the stock's performance independent of the market) and the beta (the stock's sensitivity to market movements)."
