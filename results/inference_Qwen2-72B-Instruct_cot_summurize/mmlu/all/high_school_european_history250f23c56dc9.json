Already at the Council of Ferrera (1438), which nominally reunited the Eastern and Western churches, there was a debate in which the Byzantines maintained the superiority of Plato to Aristotle. Cosimo and Lorenzo de Medici were both addicted to Plato; Cosimo founded and Lorenzo continued the Florentine Academy, which was largely devoted to the study of Plato&\u2026The humanists of the time, however, were too busy acquiring knowledge of antiquity to be able to produce anything of value.\"\nBertrand Russell, British philosopher, History of Western Philosophy, 1946\nThe cultural diffusion described by Bertrand Russell most directly influenced the composition of which text?\n\nA.

This movement had a significant impact on humanist thinkers of the time, who were eager to explore and revive ancient philosophical ideas.\n\nThe text that was most directly influenced by this cultural diffusion is:\n\nA. Oration on the Dignity of Man\n\nThis work, also known as \"De hominis dignitate,\" was written by Giovanni Pico della Mirandola, an Italian Renaissance philosopher, scholar, and diplomat. Pico was deeply influenced by the revival of Platonism and the works of the Greek philosopher Plotinus, which were studied at the Florentine Academy founded by Cosimo de Medici. In his \"Oration on the Dignity of Man,\" Pico discusses the unique position of humans in the universe and their potential for self-determination, themes that resonate with Neoplatonic philosophy."
