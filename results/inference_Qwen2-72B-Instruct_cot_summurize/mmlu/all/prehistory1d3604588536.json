This technique, known as \"ashlar,\" showcases the Incas' advanced engineering skills and their ability to construct durable buildings capable of withstanding earthquakes in the region. The structures were typically built using local materials, primarily stone, and featured complex terracing, temples, palaces, and fortresses. While Inca architecture did involve the use of other materials like wood and earth, it is most notably recognized for its stone work. Additionally, they did not use the vaulted arch or true arches in their construction techniques."
