The water level of a large lake lowered. A beach then formed where previously there had been lake bottom.\n\nThis scenario describes an environment where sediments can accumulate in layers, with the type of sediment changing as environmental conditions change. As the water level of a lake or sea drops, the shoreline can retreat, exposing new areas to wind and wave action. Over time, this can lead to the formation of a beach, which is often composed of sand. This sand can eventually become compacted and cemented together to form sandstone. Below this layer of sandstone would be the older sediments that were deposited when the water level was higher, such as shale, which typically forms from fine-grained sediments like mud and clay."
