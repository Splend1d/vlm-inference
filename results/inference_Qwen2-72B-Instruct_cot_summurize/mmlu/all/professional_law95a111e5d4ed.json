The nephew has a life estate, the niece also has a life estate, and the gardener has a vested remainder.\n\nIn this case, the property is granted to the nephew and niece for the life of the nephew. This means that both the nephew and niece have a life estate, which is an estate that lasts for the duration of a person's life. In this case, it will last for the lifetime of the nephew. After the nephew's death, the property will pass to the gardener. Since the interest of the gardener is not dependent on any condition precedent or uncertain event other than the death of the nephew, the gardener has a vested remainder."
