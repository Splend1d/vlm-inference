It opens the door to authoritarianism.\n\nDworkin's concept of law as integrity emphasizes that legal principles should be interpreted in light of moral principles, and that the law should aim for coherence and consistency with underlying moral values. This approach is unlikely to lead directly to authoritarianism, as it stresses the importance of individual rights and the moral justification for the exercise of political power, which are typically antithetical to authoritarian rule. However, it is important to note that any legal or political theory can be misinterpreted or misapplied in ways that could potentially lead to authoritarian outcomes."
