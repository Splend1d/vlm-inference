There is insufficient information given in the question to draw a conclusion about market efficiency.\n\nWhile finding that 3 fund managers significantly beat the market might seem like evidence of market inefficiency at first glance, it's not enough information on its own to make that determination. The results could be due to skill, but they could also be due to chance or survivorship bias (i.e., only considering funds that have survived to the present, ignoring those that have failed). Additionally, the statistical significance of the results needs to be considered in light of multiple testing issues. If 100 tests are conducted, some number of managers might be expected to show significant outperformance simply by chance, even if the market is perfectly efficient. Without knowing more about the methodology and statistical adjustments made for multiple comparisons, it's impossible to conclude whether these results indicate inefficiency."
