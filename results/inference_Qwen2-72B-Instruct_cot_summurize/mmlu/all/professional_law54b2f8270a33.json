The accusation was demonstrably false, and the senator was negligent in making it. The purchasing officer has sued the senator for defamation, alleging only that the accusation was false and that the senator was negligent. What is the most appropriate ground for the court to dismiss the purchasing officer's complaint?\n\nA. The federal government is constitutionally immune from suit without its consent, and it has not consented to suits of this kind.\nB. The First Amendment guarantees members of Congress an unqualified right to speak on matters of public concern at any place and time without having to fear adverse legal consequences.\nC. The First Amendment protects public officials from defamation liability for statements made in their official capacity, unless the plaintiff alleges and proves that the statement was false and uttered with actual malice.\nD. The speech and debate clause of Article I, Section 6 of the Constitution wholly insulates members of Congress from tort liability for statements made on the floor of Congress.\n"

The speech and debate clause of Article I, Section 6 of the Constitution wholly insulates members of Congress from tort liability for statements made on the floor of Congress.\n\nThis clause provides broad immunity to members of Congress for actions taken as part of their legislative duties, including speeches made on the floor of Congress. This protection is intended to ensure that members of Congress can freely and openly discuss matters of public importance without fear of legal repercussions. Therefore, even if the senator's statement was false and negligently made, the senator is protected under the speech and debate clause from being sued for defamation based on that statement."
