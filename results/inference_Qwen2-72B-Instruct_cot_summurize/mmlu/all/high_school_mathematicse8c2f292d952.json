However, we only want the odd ones. Remember, an odd number squared results in an odd number, while an even number squared results in an even number. Therefore, we only need to consider the squares of odd numbers:\n\n- \\(3^2 = 9\\)\n- \\(5^2 = 25\\)\n- \\(7^2 = 49\\)\n- \\(9^2 = 81\\)\n- \\(11^2 = 121\\)\n- \\(13^2 = 169\\)\n\nThis gives us a total of 6 odd perfect squares between 5 and 211.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. 6."
