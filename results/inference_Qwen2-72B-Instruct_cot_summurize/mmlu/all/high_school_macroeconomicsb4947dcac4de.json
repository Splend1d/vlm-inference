However, it does not fully account for improvements in product quality. If the quality of products improves over time, consumers are getting more value for their money, which should effectively lower the price per unit of utility. Since the CPI doesn't fully adjust for this increased quality, it may show higher prices year over year even if the increase in cost is offset by the increase in quality. Thus, the CPI can overstate the true inflation rate when quality improvements are significant."
