                    "text": "The answer to this question requires an understanding of the relationship between chemical shift, pH, and pKa in NMR spectroscopy. When the pH of the solution equals the pKa of the species, the population of the two forms (H2PO4- and HPO4^2-) will be equal. This means that the observed chemical shift will be the average of the two possible chemical shifts.\n\nGiven the chemical shifts for H2PO4- (3.42 ppm) and HPO4^2- (5.82 ppm), you can calculate the average chemical shift as follows:\n\n\\[ \\text{Average Chemical Shift} = \\frac{\\text{Chemical Shift of H2PO4-} + \\text{Chemical Shift of HPO4^2-}}{2} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Average Chemical Shift} = \\frac{3.42\\,ppm + 5.82\\,ppm}{2} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Average Chemical Shift} = \\frac{9.24\\,ppm}{2} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Average Chemical Shift} = 4.62\\,ppm \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. 4.62 ppm."
