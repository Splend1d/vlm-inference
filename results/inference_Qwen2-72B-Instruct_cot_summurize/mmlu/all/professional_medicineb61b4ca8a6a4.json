Gait analysis reveals a lack of fluid motion. Standing flexion test results are negative. Cruciate and collateral knee ligaments appear intact. Foot drop on the right is noted. The most likely diagnosis is\n\nA. anteriorly deviated distal femur\nB. plantar flexed cuboid\nC. posteriorly deviated fibular head\nD. unilateral sacral shear\n"

The common peroneal nerve runs around the fibular head in the lower leg and can be injured by direct trauma or stretching, such as might occur when someone is hit from behind below the knee.\n\nOption C, \"posteriorly deviated fibular head,\" is the most likely answer because it directly implicates an injury that could affect the common peroneal nerve. This type of deviation could stretch or compress the nerve, leading to foot drop.\n\nIt's important to note that further diagnostic tests, such as MRI or nerve conduction studies, would be necessary to confirm this diagnosis. Treatment may include physical therapy, braces, or possibly surgery, depending on the severity and specifics of the injury."
