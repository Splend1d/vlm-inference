Insufficient, because it is too vague.\n\nThe description of the land to be conveyed must be specific enough to identify the exact portion of the property being transferred. In this case, the description \"one-thirtieth of my ownership interest in Grapeview County, the eastern one tenth of the western corner of the property\" is not sufficiently precise to identify a specific parcel of land. The description does not provide any reference points or boundaries that would allow the property to be accurately located on a map or surveyed. Therefore, the conveyance instrument is likely to be considered insufficient due to its vagueness.\n\nAdditionally, option D is incorrect because consideration is not required for a gift to be valid. A gift can be made without consideration, as long as there is an intention to give the gift and delivery of the gift to the recipient."
