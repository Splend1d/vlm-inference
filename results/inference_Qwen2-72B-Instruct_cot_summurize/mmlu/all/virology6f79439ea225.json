However, it's important to note that while some parts of the world may be free of terrestrial rabies (the type found in land animals), they may still have cases of rabies in bats. As of my last update, the following regions or countries had managed to eliminate terrestrial rabies:\n\n- The United Kingdom (since 1922)\n- New Zealand (has never had terrestrial rabies)\n- Australia (has never had terrestrial rabies, but bat lyssavirus, similar to rabies, is present)\n\nOther areas that have been considered rabies-free include some Northern European countries like Norway, Finland, Sweden, and Iceland.\n\nHowever, the status can change due to various factors, including the introduction of the disease by infected animals or humans. Therefore, it's always best to check the most recent data from health authorities when planning travel or considering rabies risk. \n\nFor example, while the continental United States has not been considered rabies-free, the type of rabies virus transmitted by dogs has been eliminated there since 2007 thanks to successful vaccination programs. But other types of rabies, mainly those carried by wild animals such as raccoons, skunks, bats, and foxes, are still present.\n\nAs for the European Union (EU), many member states have managed to control or eliminate terrestrial rabies, but the situation can vary between countries, and some eastern European countries still report cases."
