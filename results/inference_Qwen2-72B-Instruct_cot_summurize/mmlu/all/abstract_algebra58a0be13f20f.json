The set \\(aH\\) (known as the left coset of \\(H\\) by \\(a\\)) is not necessarily a subgroup of \\(G\\) unless \\(a \\in H\\) and \\(H\\) is a normal subgroup of \\(G\\). However, even when \\(a \\in H\\), \\(aH\\) being a subgroup does not solely depend on \\(a\\) being an element of \\(H\\); it depends on whether \\(H\\) is a normal subgroup (\\(gH = Hg\\) for all \\(g \\in G\\)). Therefore, the condition that \\(aH\\) is a subgroup of \\(G\\) if and only if \\(a\\) is in \\(H\\) is not correct. Thus, this part of the statement is false.\n\n**Statement 2**: \"If \\(H\\) is a subgroup of \\(G\\) and \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) belong to \\(G\\), then \\(aH = bH\\) if and only if \\(ab\\) is in \\(H\\).\"\n\nThis statement is also false. Two left cosets \\(aH\\) and \\(bH\\) are equal if and only if \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) belong to the same coset of \\(H\\), which happens if and only if \\(a^{-1}b\\) is in \\(H\\), not \\(ab\\). This is because the equality of two cosets means they have the same elements, which implies that any element from one can be reached from an element of the other by multiplying by an element of \\(H\\). Specifically, \\(aH = bH\\) if and only if there exists an \\(h \\in H\\) such that \\(ah = b\\), or equivalently, \\(a^{-1}b = h \\in H\\).\n\nThus, both statements are false.\n\nThe correct answer is **B. False, False**."
