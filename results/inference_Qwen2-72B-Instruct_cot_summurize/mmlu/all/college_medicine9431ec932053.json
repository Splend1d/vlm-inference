When muscle contraction is triggered, the SR releases calcium ions into the cytoplasm, which facilitates the interaction between actin and myosin filaments, leading to muscle contraction. After the signal for contraction ends, the SR pumps the calcium ions back into its lumen, helping the muscle to relax."
