This relationship is often described by a hysteresis loop, which shows that the magnetization does not change proportionally with the applied field. Instead, there is a lag between changes in the field and the resulting changes in magnetization. This behavior is due to the unique properties of ferromagnetism, including domain wall motion and anisotropy effects."
