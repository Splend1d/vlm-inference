However, the Constitution does establish the framework within which political parties operate, including the electoral process and the organization of the government. \n\nA. The Electoral College is established in Article II, Section 1 of the Constitution.\n\nC. The principle of separation of powers is evident throughout the Constitution, particularly in Articles I, II, and III, which define the powers of the legislative, executive, and judicial branches, respectively.\n\nD. The term lengths for members of Congress are specified in Article I, Section 2 (for Representatives) and Section 3 (for Senators). Representatives serve two-year terms, while Senators serve six-year terms."
