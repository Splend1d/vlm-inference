The taxpayer retained an attorney to represent her in contesting the assessment. During the preparation of his client's case, the attorney suggested that it might be a good idea if the taxpayer hired an accountant to organize her records and prepare a financial statement for the year in question. Following the attorney's advice, the taxpayer consulted an accountant, an old family friend, who prepared a financial statement, which the attorney referred to at trial. During the trial, the attorney representing the government called the accountant to testif' about statements that the taxpayer made to him. The accountant's proposed testimony is\n\nA. inadmissible, because it would violate the attorney-client privilege.\nB. inadmissible, because it would violate the taxpayer's privilege against self-incrimination.\nC. inadmissible as violative of the work-product rule.\nD. admissible as an admission.\n"

This means that the information is protected from disclosure to the opposing party unless certain exceptions apply. The work-product doctrine protects materials prepared in anticipation of litigation or for trial by or for another party or by or for that other party's representative. In this case, since the accountant was hired specifically to prepare a financial statement for use in the legal dispute over the tax assessment, the communications and work product are likely protected under the work-product rule.\n\nIt's important to note that while attorney-client privilege may also apply here, the work-product rule is more relevant in this context because the accountant was brought in by the attorney specifically for the purpose of assisting with the legal matter. Attorney-client privilege generally covers confidential communications between a client and their attorney, whereas the work-product rule protects materials prepared by attorneys or their agents for litigation purposes. Since the accountant was acting on behalf of the attorney, the work-product rule would typically take precedence in protecting the accountant's work and any related communications from the taxpayer."
