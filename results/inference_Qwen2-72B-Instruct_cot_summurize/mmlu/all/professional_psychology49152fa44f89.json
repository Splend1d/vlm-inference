Empathy refers to the therapist's ability to understand and share the feelings of the client, which helps to build a strong therapeutic alliance and create a safe and supportive environment for the client to explore their issues. While personal therapy, self-esteem, and emotional detachment can also be important factors, research consistently shows that empathy is the most critical factor in determining therapy success."
