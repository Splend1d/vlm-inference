In order for a case to be removed to federal court on the basis of diversity jurisdiction, there must be complete diversity of citizenship between the parties and the amount in controversy must exceed $75,000. Here, the woman is a citizen of State A, while the retailer is a citizen of State B (because it has its principal place of business there) and State C (because it is incorporated there). Therefore, there is complete diversity of citizenship. Additionally, the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000. Finally, the notice of removal was timely filed within 30 days of service. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Yes, because the parties are citizens of different states and more than $75,000 is in controversy."
