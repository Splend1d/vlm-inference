This is often formalized through international organizations like the United Nations (UN). In this context, the most accurate answer would be:\n\nC. The authorization of armed force by the UN Security Council\n\nThis is because the UN Security Council has the primary responsibility for maintaining international peace and security under the UN Charter. It can authorize collective measures, including the use of armed force, if it determines the existence of a threat to the peace, breach of the peace, or act of aggression. This mechanism is designed to deter aggression by making potential aggressors aware that they will face not just the military power of their immediate target but also that of other states acting together."
