The son's transition from being the child of a bricklayer to becoming a teacher at a medical school represents intergenerational mobility, as he has moved to a higher socioeconomic status than his father.\n2. The promotion to a tenured professor signifies upward mobility within the same generation (intragenerational), as it indicates an advancement in his career and social standing.\n3. Moving across the country for a new tenured professor position at a different school is considered horizontal mobility since there is no change in his occupational status or social class; he is simply changing locations while maintaining the same professional role."
