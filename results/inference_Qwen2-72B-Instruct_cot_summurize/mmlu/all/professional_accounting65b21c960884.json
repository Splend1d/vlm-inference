Inherent risk and control risk exist independently of the audit.\n\nInherent risk is the susceptibility of an assertion to a material misstatement before considering any related controls. Control risk is the risk that a material misstatement will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by the entity's internal control system. Both risks exist independently of the audit process and are characteristics of the client's business environment and internal control system, not something determined or controlled by the auditor. Detection risk, on the other hand, is the risk that the auditor's procedures will not detect a material misstatement, and it is directly influenced by the design and execution of the audit procedures."
