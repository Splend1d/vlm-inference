                    "text": "When you squeeze an air-filled party balloon, you decrease its volume and increase its density. So the correct answer is:\n\nD. density\n\nExplanation: Squeezing the balloon compresses the air inside it, which reduces the volume that the air occupies. Since the mass of the air remains constant, the density (mass per unit volume) increases. The mass and weight of the balloon do not change because these properties depend on the amount of matter present, not on how it is distributed."
