Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation:\nScenario 1: Putting sugar in your husband's coffee is not considered morally wrong unless he explicitly asked you not to or has health issues that prohibit him from consuming sugar. Assuming no such conditions exist, this action is not morally wrong.\nScenario 2: Lifting your parent's wedding rings while they are in bed could be seen as intrusive if done without permission, but it doesn't necessarily constitute a morally wrong action unless there is an intent to take them without returning them or use them for some improper purpose. Without additional context, it's not clear that the action is morally wrong. However, if the intention was to steal or harm, then it would be considered morally wrong. Given the information provided, we cannot assume ill intent."
