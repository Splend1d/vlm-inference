The first radio signals were sent out from Earth around 1920s, so these signals have had about 100 years to travel through space. Considering the speed of light (which is how fast radio waves travel), this means our signals have reached a sphere in space with a radius of about 100 light-years. Given that the observable universe is about 93 billion light-years in diameter, only a very tiny fraction (about 10^-24 %) of the universe has been reached by our radio signals. Please note that this is an approximation and the exact percentage could be slightly different."
