Within this timeframe, the two events that bracketed the peak of Minoan civilization were:\n\nB. an earthquake and a volcanic eruption\n\nThe earthquake is believed to have occurred around 1628 BCE, which caused significant damage to the Minoan palaces and cities. This event is often associated with the decline of Minoan power and influence.\n\nThe volcanic eruption refers to the catastrophic explosion of the Thera (Santorini) volcano around 1613-1627 BCE, which had a profound impact on the Minoan civilization. The eruption caused a massive tsunami that devastated coastal areas of Crete and disrupted trade routes, contributing to the decline of the Minoan civilization. The exact date of the eruption is still debated among scholars, but it is generally accepted that it occurred during the Late Bronze Age, around the time when the Minoan civilization was at its peak."
