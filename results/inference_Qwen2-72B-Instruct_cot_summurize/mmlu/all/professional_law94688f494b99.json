The police were looking for evidence of the husband's suspected activities in a major drug trafficking plot. The wife gave her voluntary consent to the search. The police found a kilo of cocaine in a dresser drawer and various written notes that contained the names and phone numbers of co-conspirators. After the husband was arrested, he moved for suppression of all of the evidence seized in his bedroom. Will the court likely deny the motion due to the voluntary consent given by the wife?\n\nA. No, the search was unconstitutional because a wife cannot give consent for her husband.\nB. No, the search was unconstitutional because the items were under the husband's control and the wife therefore had no authority to give consent.\nC. Yes, the search was proper because one who possesses joint authority over property can validly consent on behalf of the absent occupant.\nD. The search was unconstitutional because the police did not have a search warrant.\n"

Yes, the search was proper because one who possesses joint authority over property can validly consent on behalf of the absent occupant.\n\nIn cases where two people share authority over a space, such as a married couple sharing a bedroom, either party may generally give consent for a search without the other's presence or consent. This is known as \"apparent authority\" or \"third-party consent.\" The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that if an individual with apparent authority consents to a search, the search is valid even if the other individual later objects. In this case, since the wife voluntarily gave her consent to the search of their mutual bedroom, the court is likely to deny the husband's motion to suppress the evidence."
