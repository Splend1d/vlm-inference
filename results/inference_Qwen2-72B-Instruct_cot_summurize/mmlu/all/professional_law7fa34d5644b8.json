Under the doctrine of respondeat superior, the furniture store was held liable for the actions of its employee because the accident occurred during the course of employment. However, since the employee was negligent, the store may have a right to seek indemnification from the employee for the full amount of damages paid to the injured party. This assumes that the jurisdiction allows for such claims and that there are no other factors that would limit or negate the store's ability to recover from the employee."
