The margin of error in a poll indicates the range within which the true value in the population is expected to fall with a certain level of confidence. In this case, a margin of error of 5% means that if the poll were repeated many times, we would expect the results to be within 5 percentage points of the actual value 95% of the time. This gives us a confidence interval of 43% \u00b1 5%, or from 38% to 48%."
