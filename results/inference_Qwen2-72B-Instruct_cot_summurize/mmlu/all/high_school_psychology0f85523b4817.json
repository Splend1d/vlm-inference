A score between 70 and 130 would therefore encompass approximately two standard deviations below the mean (70 = 100 - 2*15) to two standard deviations above the mean (130 = 100 + 2*15).\n\nAccording to the empirical rule (also known as the 68-95-99.7 rule), about 68% of values fall within one standard deviation of the mean, about 95% fall within two standard deviations, and about 99.7% fall within three standard deviations.\n\nGiven this information, the percentage of the population scoring between 70 and 130 on the WISC would be approximately 95%.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\nD. 95"
