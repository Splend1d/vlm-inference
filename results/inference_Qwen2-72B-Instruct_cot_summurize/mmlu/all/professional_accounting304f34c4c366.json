                    "text": "None of these statements is entirely accurate when comparing investment projects. Here's why:\n\nA. The ranking of projects by NPV is not invariant to changes in the market rate. The NPV (Net Present Value) is sensitive to the discount rate used for calculating the present value of future cash flows. If the market rate changes, the discount rate may need to be adjusted, which can alter the NPV and potentially change the ranking of projects.\n\nB. The IRR (Internal Rate of Return) does not always agree with the NPV metric. There can be situations where the two metrics give conflicting signals about which project is better. For instance, if you're comparing two projects with different scales or timing of cash flows, the project with the higher IRR might not necessarily have the higher NPV.\n\nC. The IRR can change the ranking of the projects under certain conditions. When comparing projects with different sizes or timing of cash flows, the IRR might rank them differently than the NPV. This is because the IRR is a measure of return on investment, while the NPV takes into account the actual dollar value of the cash flows.\n\nD. Using a single metric like the NPV or the IRR might not provide a coherent comparison in all cases. Each metric has its strengths and weaknesses. The NPV is generally considered superior because it provides an absolute measure of value creation, taking into account the time value of money and the cost of capital. However, the IRR can be useful for comparing projects of similar size and timing of cash flows. It's often recommended to use multiple metrics to evaluate investments comprehensively.\n\nIn summary, none of the provided options is correct as they stand. A more accurate statement would be that when comparing investment projects, it's important to consider both NPV and IRR, recognizing their respective limitations and potential conflicts."
