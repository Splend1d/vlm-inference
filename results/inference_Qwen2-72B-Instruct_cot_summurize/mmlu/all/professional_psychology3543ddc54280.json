Job analysis is primarily used for understanding the duties, responsibilities, qualifications, and skills required for a specific job. It can help in matching the right person to the right job (A), setting wages and salaries based on the value of the job (B), and establishing safety standards by identifying potential hazards associated with the job (C). However, determining underutilization in the workforce labor market involves analyzing broader labor market data and employment patterns, which goes beyond the scope of a single job analysis."
