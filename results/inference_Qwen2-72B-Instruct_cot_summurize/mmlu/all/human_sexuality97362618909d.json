Among the options given, option D, gonorrhea, is known for causing symptoms such as painful urination and a yellowish discharge from the penis. Gonorrhea is a bacterial STI that can indeed cause these symptoms in men.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that only a medical professional can diagnose a condition based on symptoms. If you or anyone experiences these symptoms, they should seek medical attention promptly. The treatment for conditions like gonorrhea typically involves antibiotics prescribed by a doctor. It's also crucial for sexual partners to be informed and tested, as STIs can often be asymptomatic in some individuals but still contagious."
