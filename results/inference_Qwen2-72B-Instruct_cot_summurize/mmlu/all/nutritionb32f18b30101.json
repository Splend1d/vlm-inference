Some studies have reported deficiencies in up to 80-90% of untreated vegans. Therefore, options A, B, C, and D are all incorrect. However, among the given options, option B (32%) is closest to some reported figures, but it's important to note that this can vary greatly depending on individual diet and supplementation habits."
