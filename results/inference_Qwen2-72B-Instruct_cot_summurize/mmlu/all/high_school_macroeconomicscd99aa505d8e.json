This means the country is spending more foreign currency than it is earning, which can lead to a decrease in its foreign exchange reserves.\n\nThe balance of payments (which includes both the current account and the capital/financial account) must always balance out over time. If there is a deficit in the current account, this imbalance is typically offset by a surplus in the capital or financial account, meaning the country is attracting foreign investment or selling assets abroad to finance its excess imports.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer from your options would be:\n\nB. have a positive value of equal magnitude on its capital account.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the positive value does not necessarily have to be of equal magnitude. It could be larger if the country is also financing its deficit through changes in reserves or official financing. Additionally, the depreciation of the currency (option C) might occur as a market response to the current account deficit, but it is not an automatic consequence mandated by any rule or requirement."
