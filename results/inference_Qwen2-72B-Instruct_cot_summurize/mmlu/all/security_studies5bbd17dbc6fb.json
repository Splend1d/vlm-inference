Sovereignty: The ability of a state to govern itself without external interference is crucial for societal security. It allows a society to maintain its own laws, policies, and institutions that protect its citizens.\n\nB. Identity: A shared sense of identity among members of a society can foster social cohesion and stability. This can be based on culture, language, religion, or other factors that contribute to a common understanding of who they are as a group.\n\nD. Hegemonic ethnicity: While not always positive, a dominant ethnic group within a society can sometimes provide a sense of stability and unity. However, this can also lead to marginalization of minority groups and is not necessarily essential for societal security.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that societal security is complex and multifaceted, involving economic, environmental, political, and social dimensions. Therefore, while all of the above options can play a role, they are not exhaustive, and other factors such as economic stability, access to resources, and effective governance are also critical."
