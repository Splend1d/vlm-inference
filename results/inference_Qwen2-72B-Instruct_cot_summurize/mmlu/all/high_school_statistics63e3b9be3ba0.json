The formula for calculating a z-score is:\n\n\\[z = \\frac{(X - \\mu)}{\\sigma}\\]\n\nwhere \\(X\\) is the individual score, \\(\\mu\\) is the mean, and \\(\\sigma\\) is the standard deviation.\n\nFor the midterm score:\n- \\(X = 58\\)\n- \\(\\mu = 52\\)\n- \\(\\sigma = 4\\)\n\nPlugging these values into the formula gives us:\n\n\\[z_{midterm} = \\frac{(58 - 52)}{4} = \\frac{6}{4} = 1.5\\]\n\nThis means the student's score was 1.5 standard deviations above the mean for the midterm.\n\nNow, we want to find the score on the final exam (\\(X_{final}\\)) that has the same z-score. We'll use the z-score formula again, but this time we're solving for \\(X\\):\n\n\\[1.5 = \\frac{(X_{final} - 112)}{10}\\]\n\nSolving for \\(X_{final}\\) gives:\n\n\\[1.5 * 10 = X_{final} - 112\\]\n\n\\[15 = X_{final} - 112\\]\n\n\\[X_{final} = 112 + 15 = 127\\]\n\nSo, the student's score on the final exam must have been 127 points in order to have the same standardized score as her midterm score.\n\nThe correct answer is D. 127 points."
