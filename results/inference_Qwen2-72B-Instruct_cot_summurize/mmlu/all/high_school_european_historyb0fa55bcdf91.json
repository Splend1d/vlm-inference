Today, the negative view is predominant. Germany did not, according to the now prevailing opinion, differ from the great European nations to an extent that would justify speaking of a \"unique German path.\" And, in any case, no country on earth ever took what can be described as the \"normal path.\"\nHeinrich August Winkler, Germany: The Long Road West, Volume 1, 2006\nFrom this passage, one may infer that the belief that Germany had a unique mission in history\n\nA. resulted from Germany's defeat in World War II\nB. was unaffected by Germany's defeat in World War II\nC. was proven correct by Germany's defeat in World War II\nD. was discredited by Germany's defeat in World War II\n"
