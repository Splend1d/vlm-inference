The shopper brought suit against the owner of the entire building. The owner claimed that since he leased the cafeteria, he no longer retained any control over the connecting hallway. If the shopper offers into evidence the fact that two days after the accident, the owner had the hallway carpet re-laid, the court should rule that the evidence is\n\nA. admissible, because it is relevant to the issue of the owner's knowledge of the unsafe condition.\nB. admissible, because it shows that the owner retained ownership and control.\nC. inadmissible, because it shows subsequent repair, which is against public policy.\nD. inadmissible, because the evidence is irrelevant to the accident.\n"

In this case, the evidence could be used to show that the owner had knowledge of the unsafe condition and took action to correct it, which may imply that they were aware of the problem before the accident occurred. However, it's worth noting that the Federal Rules of Evidence (Rule 407) generally exclude evidence of subsequent measures taken to improve safety from being admitted to prove negligence or culpable conduct. But there are exceptions to this rule, such as when the evidence is offered for another purpose, like proving ownership, control, or the feasibility of precautionary measures."
