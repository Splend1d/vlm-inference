Over the year, she has become fluent in social English. After a few months in a monolingual English second grade, her teacher refers her for evaluation because she has great difficulty with the basal reader used in the class. Two English proficiency tests administered to the student show that she performs above the mean for monolingual English grade peers in speaking and listening but well below the mean in reading and writing. She also performs well above the mean for grade peers on reading tests in her native language. Based on this information alone, which of the following is the most accurate interpretation?\n\nA. Continued use of the student's native language in her home environment is interfering with her development of English.\nB. The student's reading difficulty is an early indicator that she will have increased academic problems as her coursework requires more reading.\nC. The discrepancy between the student's English social language skills and reading skills is expected given the richer context in which social skills are acquired.\nD.  The discrepancy between the student's native language reading skills and English reading skills is related to the greater complexity of English.\n"

The discrepancy between the student's English social language skills and reading skills is expected given the richer context in which social skills are acquired.\n\nThis interpretation acknowledges that learning a new language involves different aspects of language proficiency, such as speaking, listening, reading, and writing. Social language skills, often referred to as \"Basic Interpersonal Communicative Skills\" (BICS), can be acquired relatively quickly as they are used in everyday, informal settings where context and gestures provide additional support. In contrast, academic language skills, including reading and writing, which are part of \"Cognitive Academic Language Proficiency\" (CALP), require more complex cognitive processes and are typically learned in formal educational settings where the context may not always be as supportive.\n\nThe student's ability to perform well above the mean for grade peers on reading tests in her native language suggests that her reading difficulties in English are not due to an inherent inability to read but rather to the challenges associated with acquiring academic language proficiency in a second language. It does not necessarily indicate that continued use of her native language at home is interfering with her English language development (option A) or that she will inevitably face increased academic problems due to her reading difficulty (option B). Option D could be partially true, as English reading and writing do present their own unique challenges, but it does not fully explain the discrepancy between her social language skills and reading skills."
