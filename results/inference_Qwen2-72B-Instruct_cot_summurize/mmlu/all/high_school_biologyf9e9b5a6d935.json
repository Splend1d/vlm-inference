Mitochondria and chloroplasts have ribosomes that more closely resemble those of bacteria than of eukaryotic cells.\nC.

Mitochondria and chloroplasts function independently from the eukaryotic host cell.\n\nWhile it is true that mitochondria and chloroplasts have some autonomy, they do not function completely independently from the eukaryotic host cell. They rely on the host cell for many resources and components necessary for their function, such as certain proteins and lipids that are imported from the cytosol. This interdependence is a key aspect of their relationship with the host cell and does not support the idea that they were once entirely independent organisms. The other options (A, B, and D) all provide evidence in support of the endosymbiotic theory."
