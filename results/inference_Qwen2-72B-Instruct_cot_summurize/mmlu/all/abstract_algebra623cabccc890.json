In this case, we want to find the degree of the field extension \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3})\\) over \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\).\n\nFirst, consider \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})\\) over \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\). The minimal polynomial of \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) over \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) is \\(x^2 - 2\\), which is of degree 2. Hence, \\([\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}):\\mathbb{Q}] = 2\\).\n\nNext, consider \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3})\\) over \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})\\). We need to determine the degree of \\(\\sqrt{3}\\) over \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})\\). The minimal polynomial of \\(\\sqrt{3}\\) over \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) is \\(x^2 - 3\\). However, we need to check if it's still irreducible over \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})\\). Note that \\(\\sqrt{3}\\) cannot be written as a linear combination of elements in \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})\\), and neither can \\(\\sqrt{3}\\sqrt{2}\\) since both \\(\\sqrt{3}\\) and \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) are irrational and their product is not in \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\). Thus, \\(x^2 - 3\\) remains irreducible over \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})\\), and so \\([\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3}):\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})] = 2\\).\n\nUsing the tower law for field extensions, we have:\n\\[\n[\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3}):\\mathbb{Q}] = [\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3}):\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})]\\cdot[\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}):\\mathbb{Q}] = 2\\cdot2 = 4.\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the degree of the field extension \\(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3})\\) over \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) is \\(\\boxed{4}\\)."
