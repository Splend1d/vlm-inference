This relationship is given by:\n\n\\[ \\text{GCD}(a, b) \\times \\text{LCM}(a, b) = a \\times b \\]\n\nGiven that the LCM of the two numbers is 60 and their GCD is 2, we can write:\n\n\\[ 2 \\times 60 = a \\times b \\]\n\\[ 120 = a \\times b \\]\n\nSince \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both less than or equal to 12, we need to find two factors of 120 that are each less than or equal to 12 and whose GCD is 2.\n\nLet's check the options:\n\nA. 6 and 10\n\n- Their product is \\(6 \\times 10 = 60\\), which does not match our requirement of \\(120\\).\n- However, this might be a typo in the explanation since the LCM is given as 60, and for the numbers to satisfy the relationship, their product should be equal to \\(2 \\times 60 = 120\\). So, let's proceed with the correct understanding that their product needs to be 120.\n\nB. 5 and 12\n\n- Their product is \\(5 \\times 12 = 60\\), which again does not match the requirement.\n- Their GCD is 1, not 2.\n\nC. 10 and 12\n\n- Their product is \\(10 \\times 12 = 120\\), which matches the requirement.\n- Their GCD is 2, which also matches the requirement.\n\nD. 12 and 15\n\n- Their product is \\(12 \\times 15 = 180\\), which does not match the requirement.\n- Their GCD is 3, not 2.\n\nThus, the correct answer is **C. 10 and 12**. These two numbers satisfy all the given conditions: they have an LCM of 60, each number is less than or equal to 12, and their GCD is 2."
