This occurs when the pace of urban population growth outstrips the ability of cities to provide adequate infrastructure and services, leading to slums, pollution, and other urban problems. It often results from internal migration from rural to urban areas in search of better economic opportunities, leaving the countryside with insufficient labor and investment."
