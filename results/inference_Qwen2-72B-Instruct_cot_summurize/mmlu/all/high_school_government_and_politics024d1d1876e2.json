The Senate allows unlimited debate, while the House does not.\n\nIn the Senate, there is no limit on debate unless cloture (a procedure to end debate) is invoked by a supermajority vote. In contrast, the House of Representatives has strict rules limiting the amount of time that can be spent debating a bill. \n\nAdditionally, it's worth noting that option C is incorrect because it reverses the actual representation: states are equally represented in the Senate (with each state having two senators), while representation in the House is proportional to population. Options A and B are also incorrect as both chambers have the power to issue subpoenas, and only the House may introduce revenue bills, respectively."
