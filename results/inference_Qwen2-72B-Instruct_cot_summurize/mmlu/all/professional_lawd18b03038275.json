H. when he lost control of the car and jumped a curb, striking a woman who was walking along the sidewalk. As a result of the collision, the woman suffered severe internal injuries and fractured both legs. She was hospitalized for 11 months and became permanently disabled. If the defendant is charged with attempted murder, he should be found\n\nA. guilty, because a person is presumed to intend the natural and probable consequences of his acts.\nB. guilty, because criminal liability is predicated upon the defendant's willful and wanton disregard for the safety of others.\nC. not guilty, because the defendant did not intend to kill the woman.\nD. not guilty, because he lost control of the vehicle.\n"

Guilty, because a person is presumed to intend the natural and probable consequences of his acts. This is a strong argument as the defendant's actions were reckless and could foreseeably result in serious harm or death.\n\nB. Guilty, because criminal liability is predicated upon the defendant's willful and wanton disregard for the safety of others. This is also a strong argument as the defendant was driving at an extremely high speed in a residential area, showing a clear disregard for the safety of others.\n\nC. Not guilty, because the defendant did not intend to kill the woman. Intention to kill is not necessary for a charge of attempted murder. The key factor is whether the defendant's actions showed a reckless disregard for human life that could result in death.\n\nD. Not guilty, because he lost control of the vehicle. Losing control of the vehicle does not absolve the defendant from responsibility for his reckless actions leading up to the accident.\n\nGiven these options, A and B seem most likely to be argued by a prosecutor. However, the final determination would depend on the specific laws and legal interpretations in the jurisdiction where the case is being heard, as well as the evidence presented at trial. It's important to note that while attempted murder might be one charge considered, other charges such as vehicular assault, reckless endangerment, or manslaughter might also be applicable depending on the circumstances and local law."
