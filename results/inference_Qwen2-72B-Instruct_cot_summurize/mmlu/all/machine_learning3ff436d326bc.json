Lasso\n\nLasso (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) is more appropriate for feature selection because it can shrink some coefficients to zero, effectively eliminating those features from the model. Ridge regression, on the other hand, tends to shrink coefficients close to zero but does not set them exactly to zero, thus not performing feature selection in the same way."
