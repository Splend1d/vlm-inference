The one-year residence requirement is valid because it does not affect any fundamental right or suspect class.\nB. State durational residence requirements that are estab-lished for publicly funded services are constitutional because they relate to government operations reserved exclusively to the states by the Tenth Amendment.\nC. Because publicly funded education is a fundamental constitutional right, a state may not deny it to any class of persons who reside in that state.\nD. State durational residence requirements established for this kind of publicly funded service solely for the purpose of reducing state expenditures violate the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n"

State durational residence requirements established for this kind of publicly funded service solely for the purpose of reducing state expenditures violate the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nThis statement is the most accurate given the constitutional principles involved. The Supreme Court has held that state laws imposing durational residency requirements on the receipt of certain benefits, such as public education, must serve a compelling state interest and be narrowly tailored to achieve that interest. A one-year residency requirement for attending public schools would likely be seen as an arbitrary barrier that discriminates against new residents without serving a compelling state interest. This could violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, which requires that states treat similarly situated individuals equally under the law.\n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\nA. The one-year residence requirement does affect a fundamental right (access to public education) and does discriminate against a particular class (new residents).\nB. While the Tenth Amendment reserves powers not delegated to the federal government to the states, it does not permit states to violate the Equal Protection Clause or other provisions of the Constitution.\nC. Publicly funded education is not considered a fundamental constitutional right in the sense that the Constitution does not explicitly guarantee it; however, access to public education has been recognized as a significant interest that cannot be arbitrarily denied. This option goes too far in stating that it is a \"fundamental constitutional right\" in the same sense as, for example, freedom of speech or religion."
