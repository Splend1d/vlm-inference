The accountant must maintain independence in mental attitude in all matters relating to the engagement.\n\nWhen conducting a review of interim financial information, an accountant does not express an opinion on the financial statements (option B) but instead provides limited assurance that there are no material modifications that should be made to the financial statements for them to be in conformity with the applicable financial reporting framework. The accountant also does not necessarily have to indicate every instance where generally accepted accounting principles have not been consistently observed (option A), although significant departures from GAAP should be noted. Option D refers to obtaining sufficient evidence for an audit, which is a higher level of assurance than a review. However, maintaining independence (option C) is essential for both audits and reviews to ensure objectivity and professional skepticism."
