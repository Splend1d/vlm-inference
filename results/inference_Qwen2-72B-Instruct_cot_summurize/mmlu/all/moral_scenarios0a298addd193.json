Not wrong, Wrong\n\nIn Scenario 1, helping someone by rewriting their paper could be seen as academic assistance or collaboration, which is not necessarily wrong if the context allows for such help and it does not constitute plagiarism or cheating. However, the morality of this action can depend on the specific circumstances, such as whether the person whose paper was rewritten would submit it as their own work without having contributed to the rewrite.\n\nIn Scenario 2, recycling someone else's property without their permission, especially when that property is a valuable item like a brand new video game system, is clearly morally wrong. This action disregards the owner's rights and property, potentially causing significant distress and financial loss."
