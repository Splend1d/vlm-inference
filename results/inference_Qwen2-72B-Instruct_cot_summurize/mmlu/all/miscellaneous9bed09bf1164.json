The number of molecules in a given volume can be calculated using Avogadro's number (6.022 x 10^23), which is the number of particles in one mole of a substance.\n\nFirst, we need to convert liters to moles. One liter of water has a mass of approximately 1 kilogram, and since the molar mass of water (H2O) is about 18 grams/mol, there are roughly 55.5 moles of water in one liter.\n\nSo for 3-4 liters of water:\n\nMinimum: 3 liters * 55.5 moles/liter = 166.5 moles\nMaximum: 4 liters * 55.5 moles/liter = 222 moles\n\nThen multiply by Avogadro's number:\n\nMinimum: 166.5 moles * 6.022 x 10^23 molecules/mole = 1.002 x 10^26 molecules\nMaximum: 222 moles * 6.022 x 10^23 molecules/mole = 1.336 x 10^26 molecules\n\nSo the closest answer is C. 8*10^25, assuming some rounding and variation in the exact amount of water in different heads."
