While genetics, evolution, and brain size were all invoked in attempts to provide a \"natural\" explanation for perceived racial differences, height was not typically used as a criterion for defining or explaining race during that period. The other three options were indeed part of the discourse, albeit often in highly problematic and scientifically unfounded ways. It's important to note that modern science rejects these past misapplications of biology to justify social constructs like race."
