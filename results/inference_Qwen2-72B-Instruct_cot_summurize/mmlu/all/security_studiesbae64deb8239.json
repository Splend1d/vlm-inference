There is no specific referent point (this option could be misleading as most theories within Critical Security Studies do identify specific referent objects).\nB. The state and state apparatus (this is a traditional view in security studies, but not necessarily the only one in Critical Security Studies).\nC. The environment (ecological security focuses on this referent object).\nD. The people and their collectives (human security and emancipatory approaches often prioritize individuals and communities).\n\nCritical Security Studies tends to emphasize D. The people and their collectives, as well as C. The environment, and other non-traditional referent objects, challenging the state-centric view of security. However, it's important to note that the field is diverse, and different scholars may have varying focuses."
