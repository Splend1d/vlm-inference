Rigorous exercise\n\nWhile exercise can be beneficial for mental health, including depression, in older adults, it is important to note that rigorous or high-intensity exercise may not be appropriate or safe for all older individuals due to potential physical limitations or health conditions. Moderate-intensity exercise, on the other hand, has been shown to have positive effects on depression in older adults. Therefore, \"rigorous exercise\" is the answer that has NOT been shown to be universally effective as a treatment for depression in this age group due to safety and health considerations."
