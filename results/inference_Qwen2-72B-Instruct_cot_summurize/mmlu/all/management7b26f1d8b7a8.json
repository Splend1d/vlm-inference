Wright Mills, although he is not listed among your options. However, among the options you've provided, the one who discussed the impact of bureaucracy on individuals and society is:\n\nB. Weber (Max Weber)\n\nMax Weber, a German sociologist, political economist, and jurist, is known for his critical analysis of the modern bureaucratic state and its impact on individuals. He described the \"iron cage\" of rationalization and bureaucratization, which can lead to a sense of alienation and disempowerment among workers.\n\nHowever, if we look specifically at the reactions of workers within bureaucracies, then:\n\nD. Mayo (Elton Mayo) \n\nis also relevant. Elton Mayo's work, particularly the Hawthorne Studies, focused on the human relations movement and how worker productivity and satisfaction were influenced by social factors and management practices. This research highlighted the importance of worker attitudes and group dynamics in industrial settings, which can be seen as a reaction to the impersonal nature of bureaucracies."
