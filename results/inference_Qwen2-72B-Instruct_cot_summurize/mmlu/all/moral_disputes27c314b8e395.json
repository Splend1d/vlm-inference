According to this principle, it would be wrong to cause unnecessary suffering to animals for our own pleasure or convenience.\n\nBased on this principle, Norcross argues that if we believe it is wrong to torture puppies for the sake of enhancing our own eating pleasure, then we should also extend this same moral consideration to other animals used in factory farming. Therefore, the answer to the question would be:\n\nC. we not support factory farming. \n\nThis is because factory farming often involves subjecting animals to cruel and inhumane conditions for the sake of maximizing profits and producing cheap meat, dairy, and eggs. By supporting factory farming through our consumption choices, we contribute to the demand for these products and thus indirectly support the cruel treatment of animals."
