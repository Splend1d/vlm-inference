Plato's response to this paradox involves the idea of anamnesis, which suggests that all knowledge is innate and merely needs to be \"recalled\" through the process of dialectic or philosophical inquiry. This idea supports the notion that the soul possesses knowledge before birth and that learning is a process of remembering what the soul already knows."
