The roles that women played in violence, be it as victims, perpetrators or otherwise, was framed in terms of what effect their roles had on the state, rather than as individuals or as women.\nC. The role of women was given appropriate consideration; women have fulfilled many vital roles in the support of the dominant security system.\nD.

Women did not actively engage in warfare as combatants and so questions of gender or the role of women were not important in considerations of security. However, this perspective has been challenged by feminist scholars who argue that the traditional focus on state-centric and military aspects of security has overlooked the experiences and contributions of women in conflict and post-conflict situations. Women have been involved in various roles in war, including as combatants, nurses, spies, and support staff, but their contributions have often been marginalized or ignored in historical accounts and security policies. Feminist scholars advocate for a more inclusive approach to security that recognizes the gendered dimensions of violence and conflict and the importance of women's perspectives and participation in peacebuilding efforts. Option B is also relevant as it highlights the tendency to view women's roles through the lens of their impact on the state rather than as individuals with agency and diverse experiences. Option C is not entirely accurate as while women have indeed played vital roles in supporting the dominant security system, their contributions have often been undervalued or unrecognized. Option D is not supported by evidence and ignores the fact that some women have actively participated in warfare and that gender cannot be reduced to a binary distinction between supportive and unsupportive of war."
