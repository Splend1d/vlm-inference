Its main purpose was to determine the criteria for recognizing the independence of the republics that sought to secede from Yugoslavia. Here are the criteria imposed by the Badinter Commission:\n\nA. The Commission required a commitment to submit disputes to the International Court of Justice (ICJ). This criterion was aimed at ensuring that any disputes between the newly independent states would be resolved peacefully through legal means.\n\nC. The Commission required a commitment to human rights and democracy. This criterion emphasized the importance of upholding fundamental human rights and democratic principles in the new states. It was essential for the international community to ensure that the emerging states would respect individual liberties and establish democratic governance.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the Badinter Commission did not impose the following:\n\nB. The Commission did not require a change in boundaries. The Badinter Commission recognized the existing borders of the Yugoslav republics as they stood on the day of independence, based on the principle of uti possidetis juris (you hold what you possess under law). This meant that the borders of the new states would be those of the former republics, with no territorial adjustments allowed.\n\nD. The Commission did not require an exchange of ethnic populations. The Badinter Commission did not advocate for or enforce population exchanges or forced migrations. Instead, it emphasized the need for the protection of minority rights within each new state.\n\nIn summary, the Badinter Commission required commitments to submit disputes to the ICJ (A) and to uphold human rights and democracy (C), but it did not require changes in boundaries (B) or an exchange of ethnic populations (D)."
