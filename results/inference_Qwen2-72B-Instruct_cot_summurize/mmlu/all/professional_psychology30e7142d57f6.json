It does not directly measure the impact of increasing a test's reliability on its validity, but rather adjusts the estimate of validity (correlation) for the influence of unreliability in the measures. The formula is based on the assumption that the reliability of a test affects the observed correlation between the test and another variable, such as a criterion measure. By correcting for attenuation, researchers can get a more accurate estimate of the true correlation, which can be considered an index of validity. Increasing the reliability of a test will generally lead to a higher corrected correlation, indicating a stronger relationship with the criterion measure, which could imply greater validity."
