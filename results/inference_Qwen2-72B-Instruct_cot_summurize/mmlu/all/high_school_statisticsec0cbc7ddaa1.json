The smaller the df, the better the 68-95-99.7 Rule works for t-models.\n\nThis statement is false because the 68-95-99.7 rule (also known as the empirical rule) applies very closely to data that follow a normal distribution. As the degrees of freedom (df) decrease, the t-distribution becomes more spread out with fatter tails compared to the normal distribution, making the 68-95-99.7 rule less accurate. In fact, it's the opposite: the larger the df, the closer the t-distribution is to the normal distribution, and thus the better the 68-95-99.7 rule works for t-models."
