Hallucinations are sensory experiences that occur without any external stimuli and are experienced as real perceptions by the individual. They can affect any of the senses, but auditory hallucinations (hearing things that aren't there) are one of the most common types. Options A, B, and C describe delusions, which are false beliefs or interpretations of reality that are firmly held despite evidence to the contrary."
