The force of the man on the scale\n\nAccording to Newton's third law, for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. When the man is standing on the scale, he exerts a downward force on the scale due to his weight (which is the gravitational force acting on him). This is the action. The reaction is the force that the scale exerts back on the man, which is upward and equal in magnitude to the force the man applies on the scale.\n\nAs the elevator accelerates upwards, the apparent weight of the man increases because the scale must push harder against the man to maintain contact with him and accelerate him upwards along with the elevator. This increased force from the scale on the man is the reaction to the increased force (action) that the man applies on the scale due to the acceleration."
