According to the \"Out of Africa\" theory, which is widely accepted by paleoanthropologists, anatomically modern humans (Homo sapiens) first evolved in Africa and then migrated out of the continent into Southwest Asia between 150,000 and 100,000 years ago. From there, they spread into other parts of the world including Europe, Asia, Australia, and eventually the Americas. This theory is supported by genetic evidence which shows that all non-African populations share a common ancestor who lived in Africa around 200,000 years ago."
