Sympatric speciation.\n\nThis is because both populations (the original and the new variant) exist in the same geographic area but have become reproductively isolated from each other. Allopatric speciation involves geographic separation, which is not mentioned in the scenario. Isolated isn't a recognized mode of speciation; it's more of a condition that can lead to allopatric speciation. Polyploidy refers specifically to an increase in chromosome number, which while it can lead to reproductive isolation, isn't specified in the scenario as the cause of the observed reproductive barriers."
