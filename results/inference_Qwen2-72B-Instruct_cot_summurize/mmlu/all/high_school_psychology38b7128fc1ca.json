Therefore, the words that are in the middle of the list are the ones that are most likely to be forgotten.\n\nThe list is: house, flower, dog, table, license, water, computer, salad.\n\nHere, \"flower\" and \"license\" are in the middle of the list. However, since the question asks for the word that is MOST likely to be forgotten, we should choose the word that is furthest from both ends of the list. Between \"flower\" and \"license,\" \"license\" is slightly closer to the center.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nC. License"
