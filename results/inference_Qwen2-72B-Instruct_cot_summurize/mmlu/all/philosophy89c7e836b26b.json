This view supports the idea of fairness and equality in the application of moral rules, acknowledging that there may be circumstances where differences among individuals or situations can justify different applications of those rules.\n\nKarl Baier was an Austrian philosopher known for his work on ethics, particularly his development of a version of Kantian ethics that emphasizes the importance of treating people as ends in themselves and not merely as means to an end. His views on moral rules reflect a commitment to impartiality and justice, which aligns with the principle that moral rules should be applied consistently to all individuals unless there are morally significant reasons for differentiation."
