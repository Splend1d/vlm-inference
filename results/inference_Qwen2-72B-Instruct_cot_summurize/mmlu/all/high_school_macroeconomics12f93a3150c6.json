This increase in lending can help offset the potential rise in interest rates that often accompanies expansionary fiscal policy, thereby reducing the crowding-out effect. Crowding out occurs when increased government borrowing leads to higher interest rates, which can discourage private investment.\n\nHowever, lowering the discount rate also carries the risk of exacerbating inflation. With cheaper borrowing costs, there could be an increase in aggregate demand that outpaces the economy's productive capacity, leading to price increases. This is because lower interest rates make it cheaper for both consumers and businesses to borrow money, potentially leading to increased spending and investment that can push up prices if not met with a corresponding increase in production.\n\nIt's important to note that the choice of monetary policy tools should take into account the current state of the economy, including inflation levels, the output gap, and other relevant indicators. If inflation is already high or expected to rise, then lowering the discount rate might not be the best course of action, as it could further fuel inflationary pressures. In such cases, other measures like increasing the reserve ratio (option A) or selling government securities (option B) might be more appropriate, despite their own potential drawbacks."
