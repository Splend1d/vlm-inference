They are primarily mediated by the spinal cord.\n\nAmong the options given:\n\nA. Ejaculation - This can be considered as a reflex action because it is an involuntary response to sexual stimulation, primarily controlled by the spinal cord.\n\nB. Erection - This is also a reflex action triggered by sensory input or psychological stimuli, and its mechanism involves the spinal cord.\n\nC. Orgasm - While the experience of an orgasm has a significant mental component, the physical release associated with it can be considered a reflex action as well, involving involuntary muscle contractions.\n\nHowever, when comparing the options provided, the most accurate answer would be:\n\nD. Both A and B\n\nThis is because both ejaculation and erection can be classified as reflex actions, whereas the classification of orgasm as purely a reflex might be more nuanced due to its psychological aspects."
