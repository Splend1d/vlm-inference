It is often diagnosed after other conditions have been excluded based on symptoms, physical examination, and the presence of tender points at specific locations on the body, as mentioned in the question.\n\nAnkylosing spondylitis (A) typically presents with inflammatory back pain that is worse at night and improves with exercise. Myofascial pain syndrome (C) involves localized pain in muscle tissue but does not usually present with systemic symptoms like fatigue. Osteoarthritis (D) primarily affects joints, causing pain and stiffness, but it does not typically involve the presence of tender points in muscles."
