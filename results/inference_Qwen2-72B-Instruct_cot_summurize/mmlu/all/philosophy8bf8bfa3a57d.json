In his work \"Leviathan,\" Hobbes writes: \"Nature hath given to every man the same right to every thing; but the possession of any thing as his own, is founded only on compact and agreement.\" He then goes on to say that the law of nature commands us to seek peace when it can be had and to follow the terms of agreements we've made, which includes not harming others when they are not harming us.\n\nSo, while option C captures the essence of Hobbes' view on the laws of nature, his exact formulation is more nuanced and tied to the concept of social contracts and agreements among individuals."
