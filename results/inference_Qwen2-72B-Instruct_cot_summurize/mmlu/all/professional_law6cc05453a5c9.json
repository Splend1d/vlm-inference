Both vehicles entered the intersection simultaneously and collided. In the accident, one of the drivers suffered a broken pelvis and internal injuries. Although the other driver's truck was slightly damaged, he did not suffer any physical injuries. Thereafter, the injured driver sued the city for negligence, claiming that the city failed to provide adequate warning at the intersection, which she contended was particularly dangerous and heavily traveled. At trial, the city attorney offers evidence that the intersection has been the same for 14 years, and no other accidents have occurred during that time. Upon objection by the injured driver's attorney, this evidence should be\n\nA. admitted as relevant evidence of a fact of consequence to the action.\nB. admitted, provided that the jury is instructed about the danger of inferential negative evidence.\nC. excluded, because it is improper negative evidence.\nD. excluded, because the dangers of unfair prejudice and confusion of the issues may tend to mislead the jury.\n"

However, such evidence can also be problematic because it might lead to an inference that the intersection is safe simply because no accidents have been reported before, which is a form of negative evidence.\n\nNegative evidence is generally considered unreliable because it does not necessarily prove the absence of something (in this case, danger) just because there is no record of it occurring. For example, just because no accidents were reported does not mean that the intersection was not dangerous; it could be that previous drivers managed to avoid accidents through skillful driving or luck.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most appropriate answer would be:\n\nB. admitted, provided that the jury is instructed about the danger of inferential negative evidence.\n\nThis answer acknowledges the relevance of the evidence while also addressing the potential for misinterpretation by the jury. By instructing the jury on the limitations of negative evidence, the court aims to prevent the jurors from making unwarranted inferences about the safety of the intersection based solely on the lack of prior accidents."
