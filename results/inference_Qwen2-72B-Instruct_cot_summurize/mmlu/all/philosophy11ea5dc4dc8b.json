Acting virtuously means acting in a way that is informed about what one is doing and why. According to Socrates, true virtue can only be achieved through knowledge and understanding of what is good, just, and moral. This understanding allows individuals to make wise choices and act in accordance with reason, rather than simply following societal norms or personal desires.\n\nD. Not only is virtue knowledge, but also the unexamined life is not worth living. Socrates famously stated that \"the unexamined life is not worth living.\" He believed that self-reflection and philosophical inquiry were essential components of a meaningful life. By examining our beliefs, values, and actions, we can gain a deeper understanding of ourselves and the world around us, leading to a more fulfilling and virtuous existence."
