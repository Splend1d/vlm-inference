He began to question the meaning and purpose of life, as well as his own privileged existence. This period of intense self-examination led him to reject his previous lifestyle and embrace a more ascetic, Christian philosophy. He became deeply religious, adopting a form of Christianity that emphasized nonviolence, pacifism, and the importance of living a simple, moral life. This new worldview is reflected in his later works, such as \"The Kingdom of God Is Within You\" and \"What I Believe.\""
