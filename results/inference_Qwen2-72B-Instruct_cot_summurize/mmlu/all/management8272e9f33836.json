It emphasizes stability, predictability, and efficiency through the definition of clear roles, responsibilities, and procedures. In such an environment, employees know exactly what is expected of them and how they should perform their tasks, which can lead to higher efficiency and stability in operations.\n\nIn contrast:\n- Task culture focuses on teamwork and problem-solving, which might not always prioritize efficiency over innovation or flexibility.\n- Power culture relies heavily on the decisions of a few individuals, which can lead to unpredictability and instability if those leaders leave or make poor choices.\n- People culture prioritizes employee well-being and satisfaction, which may sometimes come at the expense of efficiency or stability."
