This pairing occurs due to an attractive interaction between electrons, which is mediated by lattice vibrations (phonons) in the ionic lattice of the superconductor. The phonon-mediated interaction effectively causes an attraction between two electrons despite their natural repulsion due to like charges. These electron pairs, known as Cooper pairs, then condense into a single quantum state, leading to the formation of a superconducting phase."
