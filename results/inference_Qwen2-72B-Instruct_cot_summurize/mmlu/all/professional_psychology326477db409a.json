Case studies are used for attitude measurement, preferences, & satisfaction\nB. Case studies are based on the assumption that the case can be generalized\nC. Case studies are most useful as pilot study to identify variables that can be studies in other ways\nD. Case studies are the a detailed examination of a single case\n"

Case studies are based on the assumption that the case can be generalized.\n\nCase studies are typically not used to make broad generalizations because they focus on an in-depth analysis of a single case or a small number of cases. The insights gained from a case study may inform further research or theory development, but they do not necessarily apply to larger populations or different contexts. Generalizability is more commonly associated with quantitative research methods."
