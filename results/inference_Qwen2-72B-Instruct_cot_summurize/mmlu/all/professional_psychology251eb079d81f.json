Therefore, the standard rules of confidentiality that apply in a therapeutic context do not necessarily apply in this legal setting. It is important for the psychologist to inform the defendant at the outset that the information shared during the evaluation can potentially become part of the court record and be discussed in open court. This ensures that there is no misunderstanding about the limits of confidentiality and helps to protect both the defendant's rights and the integrity of the legal process."
