It can be calculated as the difference between the value of the levered firm (the firm with debt) and the value of the unlevered firm (the firm without debt). However, in this question, we also have to account for the present value of bankruptcy and agency costs.\n\nGiven:\n- Value of the firm (levered) = $5 million\n- Value of the firm if unlevered = $4.78 million\n- Present value of bankruptcy and agency costs = $360,000\n\nFirst, calculate the tax shield before considering bankruptcy and agency costs:\nTax shield = Value of the firm (levered) - Value of the firm if unlevered\nTax shield = $5 million - $4.78 million = $220,000\n\nHowever, since the question asks for the net value of the tax shield after accounting for the present value of bankruptcy and agency costs, we need to subtract these costs from the tax shield:\n\nNet tax shield = Tax shield - Present value of bankruptcy and agency costs\nNet tax shield = $220,000 - $360,000\n\nThis subtraction does not make sense because you cannot have a negative tax shield, which suggests that the way the question is framed might not align with how one would typically calculate or interpret a tax shield in finance. In the context of the question, it seems they are asking for the gross tax shield (without considering the costs), which would be:\n\nGross tax shield = $220,000\n\nSo, the correct answer based on the provided options and the standard interpretation of the term \"tax shield\" would be:\n\nB. $220,000"
