Rounding to the nearest tenth, it remains 18.0 seconds since the hundredth place is less than 5.\n2. The second time is 21.39 seconds. Rounding to the nearest tenth, it becomes 21.4 seconds since the hundredth place (9) is greater than or equal to 5.\n3. The third time is 12.99 seconds. Rounding to the nearest tenth, it becomes 13.0 seconds since the hundredth place (9) is greater than or equal to 5.\n4. The fourth time is 14.14 seconds. Rounding to the nearest tenth, it remains 14.1 seconds since the hundredth place (1) is less than 5.\n\nNow we add these rounded times together:\n\n18.0 + 21.4 + 13.0 + 14.1 = 66.5 seconds\n\nThus, the estimated total time for all four races when rounded to the nearest one-tenth of a second is 66.5 seconds.\n\nThe correct answer is **B. 66.5 seconds**."
