H \u2261 (~I \u2228 J) (Premise 1)\n2. H \u2228 ~J (Premise 2)\n\nAnd the conclusion is:\n~I\n\nLet's construct the truth table considering all possible truth values for H, I, and J.\n\n| H | I | J | ~I | ~J | ~I \u2228 J | H \u2261 (~I \u2228 J) | H \u2228 ~J |\n|---|---|---|----|----|--------|-------------|--------|\n| T | T | T | F  | F  | T      | T           | T      |\n| T | T | F | F  | T  | F      | F           | T      |\n| T | F | T | T  | F  | T      | T           | T      |\n| T | F | F | T  | T  | T      | T           | T      |\n| F | T | T | F  | F  | T      | F           | F      |\n| F | T | F | F  | T  | T      | T           | T      |\n| F | F | T | T  | F  | T      | T           | T      |\n| F | F | F | T  | T  | T      | T           | T      |\n\nNow let's analyze the rows in the truth table:\n\n- In row 1, both premises are true, and the conclusion ~I is false.\n- In row 2, premise 1 is false, so we don't have to consider this row for the validity of the argument.\n- In row 3, both premises are true, and the conclusion ~I is true.\n- In row 4, both premises are true, and the conclusion ~I is true.\n- In row 5, premise 2 is false, so we don't have to consider this row for the validity of the argument.\n- In row 6, premise 1 is true, but premise 2 is true, and the conclusion ~I is true.\n- In row 7, both premises are true, and the conclusion ~I is true.\n- In row 8, both premises are true, and the conclusion ~I is true.\n\nRow 1 shows that when H, I, and J are all true, the premises are true, but the conclusion ~I is false. This means the argument is invalid.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Invalid. Counterexample when H, I, and J are true. However, since this option is not provided, we can select the closest one, which is:\n\nB. Invalid. Counterexample when H, I, and J are false\n\nBut note that the actual counterexample based on the truth table analysis should be when H, I, and J are all true. The provided options do not exactly match this scenario, but option B is the closest to what the truth table analysis indicates."
