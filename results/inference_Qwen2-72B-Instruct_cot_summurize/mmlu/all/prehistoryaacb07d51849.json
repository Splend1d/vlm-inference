The most common estimates range from around 100,000 to 200,000 people, with some higher estimates reaching up to 300,000. Given these estimates, the closest answer would be:\n\nB. 200,000 people.\n\nHowever, some scholars suggest that the population could have been even larger, possibly exceeding 200,000, but the exact figure remains uncertain due to the challenges in accurately estimating ancient populations."
