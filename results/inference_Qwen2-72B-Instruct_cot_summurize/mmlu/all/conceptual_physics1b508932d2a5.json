It depends on the mass of the object and how that mass is distributed relative to the axis of rotation. The further the mass is from the axis of rotation, the greater the rotational inertia. This is why, for example, a hollow cylinder has a higher moment of inertia than a solid cylinder of the same mass and radius, because more of the mass is located at a greater distance from the axis."
