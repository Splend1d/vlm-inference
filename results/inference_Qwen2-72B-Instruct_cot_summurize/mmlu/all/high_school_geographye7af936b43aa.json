Elongated states are those that stretch out over a long distance in one direction, which often means they cover a wide range of latitudes or altitudes. This can result in a variety of climates and ecosystems within the same country. For example, Chile is an elongated state that includes arid deserts, temperate forests, and alpine tundra due to its length from north to south. However, it's important to note that the size and location of a country also play significant roles in the diversity of its climates and resources."
