                    "text": "The correct answer is:\n\nC. Eight percent of those who took the test scored between Pam and Mary.\n\nExplanation:\n\n- A percentile rank indicates the percentage of scores that fall below a particular score. Therefore, if Mary scored at the 64th percentile and Pam at the 56th percentile, it means that 8% of the test takers scored between Pam and Mary (i.e., scored higher than Pam but lower than Mary). This makes option C correct.\n\n- Option A is incorrect because the difference in percentile ranks does not necessarily equate to an actual point difference on the test. The scale of the test might be nonlinear, or there could be ties among scores, so we cannot conclude that Mary scored exactly eight more points than Pam just from their percentile ranks.\n\n- Option B is also incorrect for the same reason as A; the percentile rank doesn't directly translate into a percentage increase in score. An 8% difference in percentile ranks does not mean Mary's score is 8% higher than Pam's.\n\n- Option D is incorrect because it makes a specific numerical claim about the number of people who scored higher than both Mary and Pam without providing any information about the total number of test takers. The percentile ranks only tell us the proportion of test takers who scored below each person, not the exact number of people above or below them."
