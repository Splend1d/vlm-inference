The heavy rains also cause a high rate of leaching, where nutrients are washed out of the soil. However, because of the dense vegetation and quick recycling of nutrients through the ecosystem, these soils can still support lush plant growth despite the high leaching rates. In contrast, other biomes like tundra, taiga, and deserts generally have slower rates of nutrient cycling due to colder temperatures, less precipitation, or both."
