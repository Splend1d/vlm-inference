The average annual growth rate of real GDP per capita in less developed countries between 1960 and 1995 was about 2.8%, according to data from the World Bank. This is close to option D's estimate of 3.0% per year. However, it's worth noting that this growth was not evenly distributed across all less developed countries, and some regions experienced much higher or lower rates of growth than others. Additionally, while this growth rate is impressive, it did not necessarily translate into widespread improvements in living standards due to issues such as income inequality and political instability in some countries. Option B is incorrect because the growth rate of high-income countries during this period was also quite high, averaging around 2.2% per year. Option C is difficult to evaluate without more specific information about the time period being referred to for Britain's industrial revolution, but it is generally true that economic growth rates were much lower prior to the 20th century than they have been in recent decades. Option A is clearly incorrect given the actual growth rates observed during this time period."
