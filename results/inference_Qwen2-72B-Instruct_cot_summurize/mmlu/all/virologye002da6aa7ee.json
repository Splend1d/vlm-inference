A pandemic refers to the worldwide spread of a new disease or infection, often caused by a virus, that affects many people across multiple countries or continents. Pandemics can start from a single location (focus) and then rapidly spread globally due to factors like high transmissibility, population density, travel patterns, and lack of immunity in the population. Examples include the COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the 1918 influenza pandemic (Spanish flu). Options A, B, and D describe aspects related to outbreaks or specific viruses but do not fully capture the definition of a pandemic."
