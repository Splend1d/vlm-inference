At the stationhouse, the man told a police officer that he was prepared to make a confession. The police officer then turned on a video recorder and videotaped the man's confession. At trial, the prosecution called the police officer to testify to the incriminating statements that the man made in his confession. Upon objection by the man's attorney, the police officer's proposed testimony is\n\nA. inadmissible, because the videotape is the best evidence of the man's confession.\nB. inadmissible, because it is hearsay not within any recognized exception.\nC. admissible, because the police officer had firsthand knowledge of the confession.\nD. admissible, because the man was given his Miranda rights before the confession was elicited.\n"

However, this does not fully address the situation since there is also a videotaped confession. The police officer's testimony about the confession could potentially be redundant if the videotape itself is shown to the jury, which would be considered the best evidence of what was said. Nevertheless, the officer's testimony might still be relevant to establish the circumstances under which the confession was made, such as confirming that the Miranda rights were read and that the confession was voluntary.\n\nHowever, the most accurate response based on the options provided is:\n\nA. inadmissible, because the videotape is the best evidence of the man's confession.\n\nThis is because the \"best evidence rule\" generally requires that original documents or recordings (like the videotape) be presented when the contents are at issue, rather than secondary evidence like someone's recollection of what was said. This ensures the integrity and accuracy of the evidence presented to the court."
