However, spontaneity also depends on the change in enthalpy (\u0394H) and temperature (T). The criterion for spontaneity under standard conditions is given by the Gibbs free energy change (\u0394G\u00b0), where a negative \u0394G\u00b0 indicates a spontaneous process.\n\nAnswer A does not necessarily indicate spontaneity because the position of equilibrium does not directly tell us about the direction of spontaneity; it only tells us the ratio of product to reactant concentrations at equilibrium.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because a positive \u0394G\u00b0 indicates a non-spontaneous process.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because the value of the equilibrium constant (Keq) being less than one simply means that at equilibrium there are more reactants than products, but it does not necessarily indicate whether the forward or reverse reaction is spontaneous. Spontaneity can be determined from the sign of \u0394G\u00b0."
