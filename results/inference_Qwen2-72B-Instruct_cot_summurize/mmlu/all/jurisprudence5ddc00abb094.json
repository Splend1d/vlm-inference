Because it attempts to give effect to personal choice over individual luck.\n\nDworkin supports liberal egalitarianism because he believes that society should be structured in a way that separates what individuals have control over (personal choices) from what they don't (individual luck or circumstances beyond their control). He argues for a system where people are rewarded based on their choices rather than their innate characteristics or circumstances of birth. This aligns with his concept of \"equality of resources,\" which aims to ensure that everyone has an equal starting point from which to make choices."
