However, based on the information provided and assuming Smith is an individual taxpayer, we can apply the passive activity loss rules.\n\nSince Smith actively participates in the rental real estate activities, he can potentially deduct up to $25,000 of rental losses against his non-passive income under the passive activity loss rules, as long as his AGI does not exceed certain limits. The $25,000 deduction begins to phase out when AGI reaches $100,000 and is completely eliminated at $150,000 for single taxpayers.\n\nIn this case, Smith's AGI is $120,000 before considering the rental losses. Since his AGI is between $100,000 and $150,000, the $25,000 deduction will be reduced by 50% of the amount that his AGI exceeds $100,000. \n\nThe reduction calculation is:\n\n$25,000 - ($20,000 x 50%) = $25,000 - $10,000 = $15,000\n\nThus, Smith can deduct up to $15,000 of his rental losses against his non-passive income. Any excess loss over the $15,000 limit would be carried forward to future years until used or until the passive activity generates sufficient income to absorb it.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nB. $15,000"
