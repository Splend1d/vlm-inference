However, the primary focus of his theory is that moral disagreements often involve differences in attitudes or emotional responses rather than just cognitive beliefs. Stevenson was an ethical emotivist, which means he believed that moral statements express feelings about how one ought to behave, rather than stating facts that can be true or false.\n\nSo, according to Stevenson, when people disagree morally, they might not only have different beliefs about what is right or wrong but also have different attitudes or emotions about the situation at hand. This makes options A and B the closest answers, with A being particularly emphasized in Stevenson's view. However, it's important to note that Stevenson's theory doesn't neatly fit into these categories because of its unique emphasis on the role of emotions and attitudes in moral discourse."
