The estimates will converge upon the true values as the sample size increases.\n\nConsistency of an estimator means that as the sample size grows indefinitely, the estimator converges in probability to the true parameter value. In other words, with a sufficiently large sample size, the estimator will get arbitrarily close to the true value of the parameter. This does not necessarily mean that the estimator is unbiased (option A) or efficient (option B), nor does it guarantee that the estimates will be close to the true values for small samples (option D). However, consistency is an asymptotic property, meaning it holds as the sample size approaches infinity."
