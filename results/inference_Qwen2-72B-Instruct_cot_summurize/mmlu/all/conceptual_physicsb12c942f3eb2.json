The beat frequency is equal to the absolute value of the difference between the two frequencies.\n\nGiven that the tuning fork has a frequency of 1134 Hz and that you hear three beats per second (3 Hz), we can set up the following equation where \\(f_p\\) is the frequency of the piano note:\n\n\\[\n|1134 - f_p| = 3\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\(f_p\\), we get two possible solutions:\n\n\\[\n1134 - f_p = 3 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad 1134 - f_p = -3\n\\]\n\n\\[\nf_p = 1134 - 3 = 1131 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad f_p = 1134 + 3 = 1137\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the frequency of the piano string could be either 1131 Hz or 1137 Hz. Both options A and C are correct given the information provided.\n\nHowever, since multiple-choice questions typically require selecting one answer, this question might be considered poorly designed for not acknowledging the dual possibility inherent in the beat frequency concept. In an ideal scenario, both A and C would be marked correct if this were an allowed format. Given the standard format, though, the question does not allow for selecting multiple answers, so it's important to understand that both A and C satisfy the conditions described."
