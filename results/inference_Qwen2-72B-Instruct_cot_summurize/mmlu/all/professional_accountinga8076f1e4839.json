The pricing policies of the activity establish fees and charges designed to recover its cost.\n\nThis characteristic is fundamental because it indicates that the fund operates on a user-fee basis, which is typical for enterprise funds. Enterprise funds are used to account for activities that provide goods or services to the public for a fee, where the intent is to cover the costs of operations through these fees rather than through general taxation. This distinguishes enterprise funds from governmental funds, which are often supported by tax revenues."
