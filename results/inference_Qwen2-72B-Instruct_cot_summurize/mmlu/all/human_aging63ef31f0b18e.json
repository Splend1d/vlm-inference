Research has shown that older adults can improve their memory and reduce anxiety about memory decline by learning about the normal changes in memory that occur with aging, as well as by learning specific memory improvement techniques. This can help them to understand what types of memory changes are normal and what they can do to maintain or improve their memory abilities. It is also important for older adults to know that many aspects of memory do not decline with age and some may even improve, which can help to reduce anxiety about memory loss."
