This behavior is exhibited by Lady Macbeth in William Shakespeare's play \"Macbeth.\" After the murder of King Duncan, Lady Macbeth is plagued by guilt and begins to compulsively wash her hands in an attempt to rid herself of the imaginary bloodstains. This behavior is an example of a compulsion, which is a repetitive act that a person feels driven to perform in response to an obsessive thought or anxiety. In this case, Lady Macbeth's compulsion is driven by her obsession with the guilt she feels over the murder."
