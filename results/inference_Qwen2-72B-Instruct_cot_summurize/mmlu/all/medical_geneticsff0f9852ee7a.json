This is because each male has only one X chromosome, and if it carries the mutant allele, the male will express the disorder.\n\nGiven that the frequency of affected males (q) is 0.10, we can find the frequency of the mutant allele (p) as follows:\n\nq = \u221a(frequency of mutant allele)\n0.10 = \u221ap\np = 0.10^2 = 0.01\n\nThe frequency of the mutant allele (p) is 0.01.\n\nFemales have two X chromosomes, so for them to be affected by an X-linked recessive disorder, they must inherit the mutant allele from both their mother and their father. The probability of this happening is the product of the frequencies of the mutant allele in the population (p):\n\nprobability of female being affected = p * p = p^2 = 0.01 * 0.01 = 0.0001\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. 0.0001."
