A subjective component of lack of control and an objective component of large consumption of food in a discrete period of time.\n\nBinge eating disorder is characterized by recurrent episodes of eating significantly more food in a short period of time than most people would eat under similar circumstances, with feelings of loss of control during the binge. The person feels unable to stop eating or control what or how much they are eating. This is not simply overeating at occasional social events or holidays; it is a regular occurrence often accompanied by shame, distress, and negative emotional states."
