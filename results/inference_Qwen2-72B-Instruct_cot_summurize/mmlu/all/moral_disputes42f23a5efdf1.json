Fine might argue that while individuals can make such decisions based on personal intimacy and expression, the state, being a political entity with broader responsibilities and obligations, cannot use the same rationale. The state has a duty to uphold certain principles of justice and fairness that go beyond the personal considerations that might inform an individual's decision in matters of marriage."
