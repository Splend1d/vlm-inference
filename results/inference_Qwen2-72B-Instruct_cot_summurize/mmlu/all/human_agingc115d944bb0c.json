Increase irritability\n\nSleep deprivation, even in small amounts, has been linked to an increase in appetite and weight gain due to hormonal changes that affect hunger and satiety. It also disrupts attention and cognitive functions the following day, making it harder to concentrate and process information. Additionally, lack of sleep can lead to increased irritability and mood swings. Contrary to option B, sleep deprivation does not improve sleep quality; rather, it leads to fragmented sleep and daytime sleepiness."
