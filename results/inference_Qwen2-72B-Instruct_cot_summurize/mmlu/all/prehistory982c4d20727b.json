It is estimated that at the time of Columbus' arrival, the Americas were home to between 50 and 100 million people, depending on the source. This number is much higher than the populations of Europe or Africa at the time. However, due to diseases brought over by Europeans, it is estimated that within a century of Columbus' arrival, the population of indigenous peoples in the Americas had been reduced by up to 90%."
