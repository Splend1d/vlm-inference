The cashier told him that the passes were invalid unless the holder's name was entered on the pass. The defendant wrote his name on the pass, gave it to the cashier, and was admitted to the theater.

In this case, the defendant claimed that he received the free movie pass as a birthday present from a friend, which was a false statement, and used it to obtain free admission to the movie theater. By writing his name on the pass, he also misrepresented that he was the intended recipient of the pass, which allowed him to fraudulently obtain the benefit of free admission. Therefore, the defendant committed the crime of false pretenses."
