Victories against outsiders granted legitimacy to leaders of states.\n\nIn the context of early civilizations, military victories often served to bolster the authority and prestige of a state's ruler. The passage from The Tale of Sanehat highlights this concept, with the protagonist emphasizing his military prowess and the favor it earned him from his ruler. Such narratives were likely used to reinforce the image of the ruler as a powerful and capable leader, thus legitimizing their rule in the eyes of both their subjects and neighboring states."
