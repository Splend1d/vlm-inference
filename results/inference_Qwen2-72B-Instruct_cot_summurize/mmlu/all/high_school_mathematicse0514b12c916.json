Since multiplication has a higher precedence than addition or subtraction, it's logical to maximize its impact on the final result. Thus, we should aim to multiply the largest numbers available.\n\nGiven the sequence of numbers, $2, 4, 6, 8$, we have:\n\n- Multiplying the two largest numbers will yield the largest product.\n- Adding the smallest number to the result of the multiplication will increase the total.\n- Subtracting the remaining number from the total will decrease it, but if done strategically, might still result in a larger final number.\n\nConsidering these points, let's analyze the options for placement:\n\n1. $2 + 4 \\times 6 - 8$: Here, $4 \\times 6 = 24$, then $24 + 2 = 26$, and finally $26 - 8 = 18$. This is not the maximum possible value.\n\n2. $2 - 4 \\times 6 + 8$: The multiplication gives us $4 \\times 6 = 24$, then subtracting $24$ from $2$ results in $-22$, and adding $8$ gives us $-14$. This is also not the maximum possible value.\n\n3. $2 \\times 4 + 6 - 8$: Multiplication first gives us $2 \\times 4 = 8$, then $8 + 6 = 14$, and finally $14 - 8 = 6$. Again, this isn't the maximum possible value.\n\n4. $2 \\times 4 - 6 + 8$: Here, $2 \\times 4 = 8$, then $8 - 6 = 2$, and finally $2 + 8 = 10$. Still not the maximum possible value.\n\n5. $2 + 4 \\times 8 - 6$: Multiplication gives us $4 \\times 8 = 32$, then $32 + 2 = 34$, and finally $34 - 6 = 28$. This is better but not the best yet.\n\n6. $2 - 4 + 6 \\times 8$: Multiplication gives us $6 \\times 8 = 48$, then $48 - 4 = 44$, and finally $44 + 2 = 46$. This is looking good, but let's check the last option.\n\n7. $2 \\times 6 + 4 - 8$: Multiplication gives us $2 \\times 6 = 12$, then $12 + 4 = 16$, and finally $16 - 8 = 8$. This is not the maximum possible value.\n\nComparing all the possibilities, the arrangement that yields the highest number is: $2 - 4 + 6 \\times 8 = 46$.\n\nThus, the answer is B. 46."
