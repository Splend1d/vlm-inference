In his view, the least serious problem among the options you've provided would be A. loss of human diversity. However, it's important to note that he doesn't consider this issue trivial; rather, he believes that it might not be as severe as the other problems because there are ways to maintain genetic diversity even in a world where people can choose certain traits for their children.\n\nSinger argues that the more pressing concerns are related to issues of justice and equity, such as B. the effects of engineering children to have positional goods, C. loss of equality of opportunity, and D. increased disparity between the rich and the poor. These issues pose significant challenges to social cohesion and fairness, particularly if genetic enhancements become available only to those who can afford them, exacerbating existing inequalities."
