The fee shall be $10 per hour, with a maximum fee of $50;Section 3: Permits shall be issued on a first come basis; provided that the chief of police shall deny any application if, after hearing the applicant, it is his considered judgment that the meeting would create serious traffic congestion. \"An anarchist planned to hold an antigovernment protest demonstration at a city square. Although his previous antigovernment protest rallies attracted fewer than 15 demonstrators, he decided to apply for a permit pursuant to the city ordinance. After meeting with the anarchist, the chief of police denied his permit application because he believed that the demonstration would incite the protestors and threaten imminent violence or serious disorder. On October 4, the anarchist and his fellow demonstrators staged their antigovemment protest at a city park. The rally attracted only about 17 protestors and was conducted peacefully. As the anarchist was making his final remarks to the gathering, the city police arrived at the park and arrested him and his fellow demonstrators, charging them with violating the city ordinance. In a subsequent action by the anarchist in state court challenging the constitutionality of Sections 1 and 2 of the city ordinance, the court will most likely rule these sections\n\nA. constitutional, because a state may regulate the communicative impact of speech related conduct.\nB. constitutional, because the aforementioned sections are within the ambit of the state's police power.\nC. unconstitutional, because the statute is vague and overbroad.\nD. unconstitutional, because the statute is a content based regulation ofspeech.\n"

Such regulations are generally upheld as long as they serve a significant government interest, are narrowly tailored, and leave open ample alternative channels for communication. The ordinance requires permits for large gatherings to manage traffic congestion and maintain public order, which are legitimate interests. The fee structure also appears to be related to the administrative costs of managing such events. The fact that the chief of police has discretion to deny permits based on potential traffic congestion could potentially be challenged as being too broad or vague, but this does not necessarily make the entire ordinance unconstitutional. However, the question focuses on Sections 1 and 2, which seem to be reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions that fall under the state's police power. The denial of the permit in this case due to concerns about incitement to violence or disorder would be evaluated under separate legal standards not directly related to the constitutionality of the ordinance itself."
