However, the father actually owned 95 acres of the tract. The other five acres were owned by a farmer. After taking possession of the tract, the daughter executed and delivered a warranty deed to a buyer, purporting to convey all 100 acres of the tract. The agreed purchase price was $100,000. According to the terms of the sale, the buyer paid the daughter a down payment of $25,000, with the unpaid portion of the purchase price (i. e. , $75,000) secured by a mortgage. The mortgage instrument described the property interest as covering all 100 acres of the tract. After the daughter \u0080\u0094buyer transaction was completed, the farmer came forward and informed the parties that she was the true record owner of five acres of the 100-acre tract. Upon the farmer's threat to sue to quiet title, the daughter negotiated a deal whereby she paid the farmer $5,000 for the five-acre tract. As part of their agreement, the farmer executed and delivered a quitclaim deed quitclaiming to the buyer all of her interest in the five-acre parcel. Thereafter, the buyer defaulted on the mortgage debt, and the daughter properly consummated foreclosure proceedings, becoming the purchaser of the tract at her own foreclosure sale. The description of the deed in the foreclosure sale referred to the tract as consisting of all 100 acres. After the foreclosure sale was finalized, the buyer brought suit claiming title in fee simple to the five-acre tract, formerly owned by the farmer. In an appropriate action to determine the title to the said five-acre tract, the buyer will\n\nA. lose, because the daughter did not have good and marketable title at the time she purported to convey the 100-acre tract to the buyer.\nB. lose, because the doctrine of after-acquired title controls.\nC. win, because the deed from the farmer to the buyer was a quitclaim deed.\nD. win, because the quitclaim deed from the farmer to the buyer was subsequent to the deed from the daughter to the buyer and to the mortgage.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is B. The buyer will lose because the doctrine of after-acquired title controls. This legal principle allows a grantor who does not have full ownership at the time of conveyance but later acquires the missing title to pass the complete title to the grantee retroactively. In this case, the daughter did not have good and marketable title to the entire 100-acre tract when she conveyed it to the buyer. However, when she later acquired the missing five acres from the farmer and then foreclosed on the mortgage, she effectively had the full title. Since the daughter became the owner of the entire tract before the foreclosure sale, the buyer would not be able to claim title in fee simple to the five-acre tract because the daughter's title was perfected before the foreclosure sale.\n\nIt's important to note that the quitclaim deed from the farmer to the buyer does not affect the outcome since the daughter's title was already perfected by the time of the foreclosure sale. A quitclaim deed only transfers whatever interest the grantor has in the property, if any, without any warranty of title. In this case, the farmer's quitclaim deed simply confirmed the buyer's ownership of the five acres that the daughter had already acquired and included in the foreclosure sale."
