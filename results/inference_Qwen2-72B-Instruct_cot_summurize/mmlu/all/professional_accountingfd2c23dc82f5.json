Inquiry and other procedures such as observation.\n\nWhen written documentation is not available to provide evidence of the operating effectiveness of a control, an auditor can use alternative methods such as making inquiries of management and employees who have knowledge of the controls, observing the operation of the controls, or using other audit procedures that may be appropriate under the circumstances. Observation can be particularly useful when testing controls that leave no documentary evidence, such as supervisory review or physical security measures."
