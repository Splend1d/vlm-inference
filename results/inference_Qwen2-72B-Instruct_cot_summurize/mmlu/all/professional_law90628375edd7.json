Rent was payable on the first day of each month, and the landlord retained the right to terminate the lease if the tenant defaulted. The lease term ended 18 months ago. However, the tenant has stayed in possession of the building and has continued to pay the rent on time. The landlord has continued to accept the rent. The fair rental value of the building is now substantially more than what the tenant has been paying, and the landlord recently found a third party who will pay the higher rent. When the tenant paid the rent six weeks ago, the landlord accepted paid the rent six weeks ago, the landlord accepted the rent but told the tenant in writing that she had to vacate at the end of the month. The tenant, who is still in possession of the building, has informed the landlord that she does not want to move and is willing to pay the current fair rental value. The landlord has asked his lawyer for advice regarding the right to possession. Who should the lawyer say is entitled to possession?\n\nA. The landlord, because he gave proper notice to terminate the tenancy.\nB. The landlord, because he retained the right to reenter.\nC. The tenant, because she has stated that she is willing to pay the current fair rental value.\nD. The tenant, because the landlord has not shown good cause to terminate the tenancy.\n"

The tenant, because she has stated that she is willing to pay the current fair rental value.\n\nWhen the original lease expired, a periodic tenancy (most likely a month-to-month tenancy) was created by the fact that the tenant remained in possession and continued to pay rent, and the landlord continued to accept it. Under such a tenancy, either party can terminate the arrangement by giving proper notice. However, since the tenant has expressed a willingness to pay the current fair rental value, which addresses any economic concerns the landlord might have, the basis for termination is undermined. Unless there are other grounds for eviction (such as violation of lease terms unrelated to rent), the tenant's offer to pay fair market rent strengthens her position to remain in possession.\n\nIt's important to note that specific laws regarding tenancy and eviction can vary significantly by jurisdiction, so the lawyer would need to consider local laws and regulations when providing advice. In some places, a landlord may be required to provide a reason for eviction, and simply wanting to charge more rent might not be considered sufficient \"good cause\" for eviction under those laws."
