The defendant is alleged to have masterminded a scheme wherein he set up a nonexistent corporation that never conducted business. The victims were sent prospectuses containing false financial data, which induced them to purchase stock in the phony corporation. At trial, the prosecution seeks to introduce into evidence proof that the defendant had set up 10 other so-called dummy corporations that never existed. This evidence is\n\nA. admissible, to show defendant's character trait for dishonesty.\nB. admissible, to show his intent to defraud.\nC. inadmissible, because character cannot be proved by specific instances of misconduct.\nD. inadmissible, because the evidence is not relevant.\n"

This is often referred to as \"modus operandi\" or \"MO\" evidence. In this case, the prosecution could argue that the defendant's establishment of 10 other dummy corporations is relevant to show a pattern of behavior consistent with an intent to defraud, rather than simply to demonstrate bad character or propensity to commit crimes. However, the judge will need to weigh the probative value of this evidence against its potential to unfairly prejudice the jury against the defendant."
