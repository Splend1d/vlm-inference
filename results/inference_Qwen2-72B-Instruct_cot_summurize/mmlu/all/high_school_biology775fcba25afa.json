This leads to an increase in the frequency of the heterozygotes relative to the homozygotes over time, as the homozygotes are less fit and therefore leave fewer offspring.\n\nThus, if you see answer choices that suggest that the proportion of heterozygotes increases or that the proportions of the homozygotes decrease, those are correct. Therefore, the correct answer here would be:\n\nD. Both A and C\n\n- A. The proportions of both types of homozygote should decrease (as they are less fit under stabilizing selection).\n- C. The population's average heterozygosity should increase (as heterozygotes have higher fitness under stabilizing selection)."
