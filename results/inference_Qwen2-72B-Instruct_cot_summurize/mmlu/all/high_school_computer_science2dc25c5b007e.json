                    "text": "The most efficient searching algorithm for a sorted list is binary search. Binary search works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. At each step, the algorithm compares the middle element of the interval with the target value. If the middle element is equal to the target, the search is successful. If the middle element is less than the target, the search continues on the upper half of the interval. If the middle element is greater than the target, the search continues on the lower half of the interval.\n\nTo find the maximum number of elements that must be examined using binary search, we need to calculate how many times we can halve the list until we have narrowed down the search to one element. This corresponds to finding the smallest \\( n \\) such that:\n\n\\[ 2^n \\geq 120 \\]\n\nWe know that:\n\n\\[ 2^6 = 64 \\]\n\\[ 2^7 = 128 \\]\n\nSince \\( 128 \\geq 120 \\), but \\( 64 < 120 \\), we need at least 7 steps to guarantee that we've found or determined the absence of our target value in the list. However, since binary search includes checking the middle element at each step, and the question asks for the maximum number of elements that must be examined, we consider the worst-case scenario where the target is not found until the last possible check. In this case, the algorithm would examine up to 7 elements (one per iteration of the binary search).\n\nHowever, the correct interpretation of the question might actually be asking for the number of comparisons needed, which would be 7 in the worst case, as described above. But if you're looking for the number of elements that could potentially be examined, the answer would include the elements checked at each step of the binary search process. Since the list is divided into halves at each step, it's not necessarily true that 7 elements would be examined, because the \"examination\" is actually comparing the target to the middle element of the current subarray. \n\nGiven the options provided, the correct answer considering the number of comparisons needed is:\n\nA. 7\n\nThis means the algorithm will make at most 7 comparisons to either find the target value or determine it's not in the list."
