Dragon\n\nThe Chinese zodiac operates on a 12-year cycle, with each year represented by a different animal. The year 2000 was the Year of the Dragon in the Chinese zodiac. The last day of the Year of the Dragon in 2000 was January 27, after which the Year of the Snake began. However, since the question asks for the animal representing the year 2000 as a whole, the answer remains the Dragon."
