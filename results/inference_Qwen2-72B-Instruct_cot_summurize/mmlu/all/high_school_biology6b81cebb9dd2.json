They are less common than negative feedback mechanisms but play important roles in certain processes, such as childbirth and lactation.\n\nIn this case, option A is an example of positive feedback. The infant's suckling at the breast stimulates the release of oxytocin from the mother's brain, which then stimulates milk production. As more milk is produced, there is more for the infant to suckle, further stimulating the release of oxytocin and additional milk production. This cycle continues until the infant stops suckling.\n\nHere is why the other options are examples of negative feedback:\n\nB. An enzyme being allosterically inhibited by the product of the reaction it catalyzes is a classic example of negative feedback, where the end product of a pathway inhibits its own synthesis or production.\n\nC. When ATP is abundant, the rate of glycolysis decreases. This is also a negative feedback mechanism, where the presence of the end product (ATP) inhibits the process that produces it (glycolysis).\n\nD. When blood sugar levels decrease to normal after a meal, insulin is no longer secreted. This is another example of negative feedback, where the body adjusts the secretion of insulin based on the level of glucose in the blood to maintain homeostasis."
