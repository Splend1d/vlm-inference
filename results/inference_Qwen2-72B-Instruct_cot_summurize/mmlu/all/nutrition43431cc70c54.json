                    "text": "The correct answer is:\n\nD. Absorption efficiency is inversely related to calcium intake, so that a higher proportion is absorbed when calcium intake is low\n\nThis statement is true. The body has mechanisms to maintain a stable level of calcium in the blood, and one of these is to adjust the efficiency of calcium absorption in the intestines based on the amount of calcium ingested. When dietary calcium intake is low, the body increases the absorption efficiency to maintain adequate levels. Conversely, when calcium intake is high, the absorption efficiency decreases.\n\nLet's review the other options:\n\nA. Typical calcium intake in most adults is between 0.5mg and 2.0mg per day - This is incorrect. The recommended daily intake of calcium for adults is much higher, typically around 1000-1300 mg per day.\n\nB. Activated Vitamin D decreases absorption of dietary calcium - This is incorrect. In fact, activated Vitamin D (calcitriol) increases the absorption of dietary calcium by promoting the synthesis of calcium-binding proteins in the intestines.\n\nC. There is clear evidence that people who consume more than the average amount of calcium have a lower risk of bone fractures. - While it is true that adequate calcium intake is important for maintaining bone health, the relationship between high calcium intake and fracture risk is not as straightforward. Some studies suggest that very high calcium intake might not provide additional benefits and could even be associated with increased risks of certain health issues. The evidence is complex and can depend on factors such as age, sex, and individual health status."
