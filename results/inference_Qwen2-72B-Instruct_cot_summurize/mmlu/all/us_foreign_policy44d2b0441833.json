Realists believe that states should prioritize their national interests and security in an anarchic international system where there is no overarching authority. They argue that exceptionalism, which often promotes the idea that the United States has a unique role or mission in the world, can lead to overreach and interventionism that may not align with U.S. strategic interests.\n\nRealists also believe that the pursuit of exceptionalism can undermine the balance of power and create instability, as other states may feel threatened by U.S. actions or seek to counterbalance its influence. Additionally, realists may view the promotion of values such as democracy and human rights as secondary to the pursuit of national interests, and may therefore see exceptionalism as a distraction from more pressing security concerns. \n\nIn summary, realists object to the influence of exceptionalism on American foreign policy because they believe it can lead to a focus on abstract ideals at the expense of practical considerations of security, power, and interests."
