The binomial theorem states that:\n\n\\[\n(m + n)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{k} m^{6-k}n^k\n\\]\n\nWhere \\(\\binom{6}{k}\\) is the binomial coefficient representing the number of ways to choose \\(k\\) items from 6.\n\nWe want to find out for which values of \\(k\\), the term \\(\\binom{6}{k} m^{6-k}n^k\\) is odd.\n\nSince \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) are both odd, \\(m^{6-k}\\) and \\(n^k\\) will also be odd for all values of \\(k\\) (because any power of an odd number remains odd).\n\nThus, the oddness or evenness of each term in the expansion depends solely on the binomial coefficient \\(\\binom{6}{k}\\).\n\nLet's look at these coefficients:\n\n- \\(\\binom{6}{0} = 1\\) (odd)\n- \\(\\binom{6}{1} = 6\\) (even)\n- \\(\\binom{6}{2} = 15\\) (odd)\n- \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\) (even)\n- \\(\\binom{6}{4} = 15\\) (odd)\n- \\(\\binom{6}{5} = 6\\) (even)\n- \\(\\binom{6}{6} = 1\\) (odd)\n\nSo, there are 4 odd coefficients: \\(\\binom{6}{0}\\), \\(\\binom{6}{2}\\), \\(\\binom{6}{4}\\), and \\(\\binom{6}{6}\\). Therefore, since each term's oddness/evenness is determined by its coefficient (and \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) are odd), there are 4 terms in the expansion of \\((m + n)^6\\) that are odd.\n\nThe answer is A. 4."
