HM agrees with the idea that security can be viewed using a sectoral framework, and recognises the depth of analysis that is enabled by such an approach.\nB. HM rejects Buzan et al.'s theory of sectoral security analysis, on the grounds that securitization is a product of a state-centric approach.\nC. HM rejects the assertion by Buzan et al. that there are distinct and separate sectors of security, instead adopting a holistic view of security within which national and transnational class is an important factor.\nD. HM favours the sectoral approach to security analysis, in particular prioritising the state as a referent object and drawing much of its theoretical foundations from the realist principles that underpin the sectoral approach.\n"

HM rejects the assertion by Buzan et al. that there are distinct and separate sectors of security, instead adopting a holistic view of security within which national and transnational class is an important factor.\n\nHumanist Marxism tends to critique traditional security studies that focus on the state as the primary referent object and instead emphasizes the role of class relations and social structures in understanding security. This perspective aligns with a rejection of the idea that security can be neatly divided into distinct sectors, advocating instead for a more comprehensive and interconnected analysis that includes economic, political, and social dimensions."
