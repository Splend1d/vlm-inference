                    "text": "During spring break, a private boarding school was deserted while students and teachers were away on vacation. A guidance counselor remained on campus because he was working on a research project. After working late one night, the counselor decided to enter the room of a student from a very wealthy family. The counselor was rummaging through the student's room looking for something valuable to steal. Under the bed, he noticed an expensive suitcase. The counselor opened the suitcase and found an express mail envelope. The counselor knew that the student's father often sent money to his son in express mail envelopes. The counselor opened the envelope and saw that it contained a large quantity of white powder, which he suspected to be heroin. The counselor telephoned the police, and an officer was dispatched to the school. The counselor handed the officer the envelope, which he transported to the police station. At the station house, the officer opened the envelope and sent a sampling of the substance to the police lab. Tests confirmed the substance to be heroin. The police did not secure a search warrant before confiscating and opening the envelope. The student was thereafter arrested and charged with unlawful possession of a controlled dangerous substance. The student's attorney has filed a motion to suppress the heroin from evidence. The motion will most likely be\n\nA. granted, because the police should have secured a warrant before seizing the envelope.\nB. granted, because the police should have secured a warrant before opening the envelope.\nC. denied, because the search was conducted by a private party.\nD. denied, because the counselor, as a school employee, was in loco parentis.\n"

                    "text": "The motion to suppress the heroin from evidence will most likely be:\n\nD. denied, because the counselor, as a school employee, was acting in loco parentis.\n\nIn this scenario, the counselor is considered to be acting in loco parentis, which means \"in the place of a parent.\" School officials, including counselors, can act in this capacity when parents are not present to make decisions about their children. This allows school officials to take actions they deem necessary for the welfare of the students, including conducting searches under certain circumstances. The fact that the counselor found the envelope during a search of the student's room, albeit initially motivated by personal gain, does not necessarily invalidate the search if it can be argued that the counselor was acting within the scope of his duties as a school official.\n\nAdditionally, the counselor's discovery of the envelope could be seen as an exigent circumstance, which might allow law enforcement to seize and open the envelope without a warrant. Exigent circumstances are situations where immediate action is required to prevent the destruction of evidence, protect public safety, or other similar urgent situations. In this case, the discovery of what appeared to be a large quantity of illegal drugs would likely meet the criteria for exigency, allowing the police to act without first obtaining a warrant.\n\nIt is important to note that the specific outcome may depend on the jurisdiction and interpretation of relevant laws regarding searches and seizures by school officials and law enforcement. However, based on the information provided, option D seems the most likely outcome given the counselor's role as a school employee and the potential application of the in loco parentis doctrine and exigent circumstances exception to the warrant requirement."
