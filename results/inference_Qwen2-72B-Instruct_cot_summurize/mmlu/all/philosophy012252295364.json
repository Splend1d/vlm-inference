Moore, in his book \"Principia Ethica,\" argues against what he calls the \"naturalistic fallacy,\" which he defines as the error of attempting to define the term 'good' in terms of some natural property or properties. According to Moore, 'good' is a simple, indefinable quality that cannot be reduced to any natural characteristics. This position is known as ethical non-naturalism or moral realism. Options A and B represent different views about nature and goodness but are not how Moore specifically defined the naturalistic fallacy."
