To balance this reaction, we need to balance the number of electrons transferred in the half-reactions for oxidation and reduction.\n\nFirst, let's balance the half-reactions:\n\nReduction half-reaction:\n\\[ \\text{MnO}_4^- + 8\\text{H}^+ + 5e^- \\rightarrow \\text{Mn}^{2+} + 4\\text{H}_2\\text{O} \\]\n\nOxidation half-reaction:\n\\[ \\text{I}^- \\rightarrow \\text{IO}_3^- + 6e^- \\]\n\nHowever, the oxidation half-reaction needs to be multiplied by 5 to balance the number of electrons with the reduction half-reaction:\n\n\\[ 5\\text{I}^- \\rightarrow 5\\text{IO}_3^- + 30e^- \\]\n\nSo, combining the two half-reactions while balancing electrons and charges, we get:\n\n\\[ \\text{MnO}_4^- + 8\\text{H}^+ + 5\\text{I}^- \\rightarrow \\text{Mn}^{2+} + 4\\text{H}_2\\text{O} + 5\\text{IO}_3^- \\]\n\nNow, let's check the options:\n\nA. The I\u2212 : IO3\u2212 ratio is 3:1. - This is not correct. The balanced equation shows that the ratio is actually 5:5 or simplified 1:1.\n\nB. The MnO4- : I- ratio is 6:5. - This is not correct. The balanced equation shows that the ratio is 1:5.\n\nC. The MnO4- : Mn2+ ratio is 3:1. - This is not correct. The balanced equation shows that the ratio is actually 1:1.\n\nD. The H+ : I\u2212 ratio is 2:1. - This is not correct. The balanced equation shows that the ratio is 8:5.\n\nNone of the provided options is true based on the balanced equation. However, if there was an option that stated \"The MnO4- : I- ratio is 1:5,\" that would be correct based on the balanced equation provided."
