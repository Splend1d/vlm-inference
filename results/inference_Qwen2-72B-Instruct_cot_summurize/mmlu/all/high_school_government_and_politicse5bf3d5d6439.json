                    "text": "The opinions of congressional committees often fail to accurately mirror public opinion for several reasons, but the two primary reasons from the options given would be:\n\nA. the membership of committees often overrepresents constituencies with the greatest stake in the committee's business: Committees tend to be populated by members who have a strong interest or expertise in the committee's subject area. This can lead to an overrepresentation of views that align with the interests of certain groups that have a high stake in the committee's work, such as industry insiders or advocacy groups. As a result, the committee's perspective may not fully reflect the broader range of public opinion.\n\nD. committee members often lose track of their constituents' priorities because of their frequent contact with special-interest lobbyists: Committee members often interact extensively with lobbyists and interest groups that have a vested interest in the outcomes of legislation. This close contact can sometimes lead to committee members prioritizing the interests of these groups over those of their broader constituency, especially if the lobbyists are successful in influencing the members' perspectives on policy issues.\n\nWhile B (most committees are too small to include representatives of all popular opinions) is true, it does not necessarily mean that they fail to represent public opinion; smaller committees can still be representative if their members are chosen to reflect diverse viewpoints. Option C (the minority party controls nearly half of all committees) is not accurate, as the majority party typically holds more leadership positions and control over committees in Congress."
