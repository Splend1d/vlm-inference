Technological developments do not affect the majority of the world's population and so the advancement of telecommunications and digital media are not of concern to peace studies.\nB. Digital information, media, and communications technology is likely to inspire greater harmony in the international system as the global population learns more about the world in which they live, and the lives of others around them.\nC. With access to digital information, such as media and the internet, disempowered populations will become aware of their own exclusion and the inequalities of the global system. This could lead to widespread frustration and revolution.\nD. Technological change and development is likely to strengthen the power of already dominant international players, and to reinforce the status quo of international relations.\n"

While some argue that technological advancements can inspire greater harmony in the international system by increasing access to information and facilitating communication, others suggest that it can also exacerbate existing inequalities and lead to social unrest.\n\nOption B suggests that digital information, media, and communications technology is likely to inspire greater harmony in the international system as the global population learns more about the world in which they live and the lives of others around them. However, this view may be overly optimistic and fails to consider the potential negative consequences of increased access to information.\n\nOption C argues that with access to digital information, such as media and the internet, disempowered populations will become aware of their own exclusion and the inequalities of the global system. This could lead to widespread frustration and revolution. This perspective highlights the potential for technological change to expose and exacerbate existing social and economic inequalities.\n\nOption D suggests that technological change and development is likely to strengthen the power of already dominant international players, and to reinforce the status quo of international relations. This view emphasizes the potential for technological advancements to perpetuate existing power dynamics and inequalities.\n\nOverall, peace studies suggest that technological change and development have significant implications for global peace and security. While there is potential for positive outcomes, such as increased communication and understanding, there is also the risk of exacerbating existing inequalities and tensions. Therefore, it is essential to consider the potential impacts of technological change on marginalized communities and to work towards creating more equitable and just systems. \n\nTherefore, options B, C, and D all have valid points, but option A is incorrect as technological developments do affect the majority of the world's population, especially in terms of access to information and communication."
