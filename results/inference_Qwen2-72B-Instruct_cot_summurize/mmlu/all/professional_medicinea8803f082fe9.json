Unless there is a significant degree of genu varum (bowing of the legs), or there are other concerning signs such as pain, limping, or asymmetry, no specific treatment is required. It's important to monitor the condition and ensure that it is resolving appropriately with growth. Vitamin D and calcium intake should be adequate for bone health, but specifically increasing vitamin D intake without evidence of deficiency or rickets is not necessary. Similarly, a special exercise program or surgical correction would not be indicated in this scenario unless there were additional factors suggesting a more serious underlying condition."
