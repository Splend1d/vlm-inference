A group of immigrant farm workers were continually refused employment contracts by the labor contractors in the state. Instead, the labor contractors had employed many alien workers since they would toil longer hours for less wages. The immigrant farm workers now bring suit in state court pursuant to the above-mentioned statutory provision. Which of the following determinations would most likely result as a consequence of the immigrant farm workers' lawsuit?\n\nA. The court would declare the statute unconstitutional as violative of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nB. The court would declare the statute constitutional as within the realm of rights reserved to the states by the Eleventh Amendment.\nC. The court would declare the statute unconstitutional since the regulation of immigration is preempted.\nD. The court would declare the statute constitutional since the states are not preempted in the area of economic regulation of illegal aliens.\n"

The court would declare the statute unconstitutional since the regulation of immigration is preempted.\n\nThe federal government has the exclusive power to regulate immigration under the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution. This means that state laws which attempt to regulate immigration are generally preempted by federal law. In this case, the state labor code attempts to regulate the employment of aliens, which is closely tied to the federal government's power over immigration. Therefore, it is likely that the court would find the statute unconstitutional due to federal preemption."
