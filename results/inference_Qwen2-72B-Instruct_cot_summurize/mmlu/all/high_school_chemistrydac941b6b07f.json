                    "text": "The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation can be used to find the \\(pK_a\\) of a weak acid given its concentration and the pH of its solution. The equation is:\n\n\\[\npH = pK_a + \\log\\left(\\frac{[A^-]}{[HA]}\\right)\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\(pH\\) is the pH of the solution,\n- \\(pK_a\\) is the negative logarithm of the acid dissociation constant (\\(K_a\\)),\n- \\([A^-]\\) is the molar concentration of the conjugate base (in this case, the anion formed when the acid donates a proton),\n- \\([HA]\\) is the molar concentration of the undissociated acid.\n\nGiven that 0.25 mol of a weak acid is dissolved in 0.25 L of distilled water, the initial concentration of the acid (\\([HA]\\)) before any dissociation occurs is:\n\n\\[\n[HA] = \\frac{0.25\\,mol}{0.25\\,L} = 1\\,M\n\\]\n\nSince the acid is monoprotic and weak, we assume it only partially dissociates, forming equal concentrations of its conjugate base (\\(A^-\\)) and hydrogen ions (\\(H^+\\)). The pH of the solution is given as 4.26, so the concentration of hydrogen ions, \\([H^+]\\), can be calculated as:\n\n\\[\n[H^+] = 10^{-pH} = 10^{-4.26}\n\\]\n\nHowever, for the purpose of calculating the \\(pK_a\\), we need to find the ratio \\(\\frac{[A^-]}{[HA]}\\). At equilibrium, the amount of acid that has dissociated equals the concentration of hydrogen ions since each molecule of acid that dissociates produces one hydrogen ion. Therefore, the concentration of the conjugate base \\([A^-]\\) is also approximately equal to \\([H^+]\\):\n\n\\[\n[A^-] = [H^+] = 10^{-4.26}\n\\]\n\nNow, let's plug these values into the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n\n\\[\n4.26 = pK_a + \\log\\left(\\frac{10^{-4.26}}{1}\\right)\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\(pK_a\\):\n\n\\[\npK_a = 4.26 - \\log\\left(10^{-4.26}\\right) = 4.26 + 4.26 = 8.52\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. 8.52"
