Freedom and equality for each individual, government of, by, and for the people\u2014these American values we found good, principles by which we could live as men. Many of us began maturing in complacency.\n\"As we grew, however, our comfort was penetrated by events too troubling to dismiss. First, the permeating and victimizing fact of human degradation, symbolized by the Southern struggle against racial bigotry, compelled most of us from silence to activism. Second, the enclosing fact of the Cold War, symbolized by the presence of the Bomb, brought awareness that we ourselves, and our friends, and millions of abstract 'others' we knew more directly because of our common peril, might die at any time. . . .\"\n\u2014Port Huron Statement, 1962\nThe Port Huron Statement, excerpted above, can most clearly be seen as an important document in which of the following movements?\n\nA.

The New Left.\n\nThe Port Huron Statement is a manifesto written by the Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) in 1962, which became the founding document of the New Left movement. It reflects the disillusionment of young Americans with the status quo and their desire for social change, addressing issues such as racial inequality, the arms race, and the threat of nuclear war. The statement calls for a new kind of politics based on participatory democracy and social justice, aligning it with the principles of the New Left."
