Shapiro's experiments demonstrate that expectations can play a significant role in the experience of drug use, and that the placebo effect (the phenomenon where a person experiences a perceived improvement in condition due to their belief in the treatment) can be powerful enough to mimic the effects of actual drugs. This suggests that psychological factors, including expectations, can influence the biological effects of drugs."
