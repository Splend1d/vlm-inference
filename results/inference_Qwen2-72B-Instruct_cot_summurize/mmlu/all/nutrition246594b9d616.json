                    "text": "The correct answer is B. Intake only of locally grown food in central Africa. Iodine is a mineral that is primarily found in seafood, seaweed, dairy products, and iodized salt. If someone is only eating locally grown food in an area where the soil is low in iodine, they may not be getting enough iodine in their diet. This can lead to iodine deficiency, which can cause a range of health problems including goiter (enlarged thyroid gland), hypothyroidism, and mental retardation in children. \n\nOptions A, C, and D are not directly related to iodine deficiency. While low intake of fruits and vegetables can lead to deficiencies in other vitamins and minerals, it does not necessarily lead to iodine deficiency. Insufficient caloric intake can lead to malnutrition, but again, this does not specifically relate to iodine deficiency. Inadequate sunlight exposure can lead to vitamin D deficiency, but it does not affect iodine levels in the body."
