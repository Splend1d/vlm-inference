However, if we round off to three significant figures, option B is the closest to the calculated values:\n\nB. 500 MHz = 16.850 mT = 0.01667 cm-1\n\nBut it's important to note that this is not an exact match. The correct conversions would be approximately 1.78 mT and 0.00167 cm^-1.\n\nPlease let me know if you need further clarification or assistance!"
