The MVT states that if a function \\(f\\) is continuous on the closed interval \\([a, b]\\) and differentiable on the open interval \\((a, b)\\), then there exists at least one point \\(c\\) in \\((a, b)\\) such that\n\n\\[\nf'(c) = \\frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b-a}.\n\\]\n\nGiven that \\(f\\) is continuously differentiable on \\((-1, 4)\\), it satisfies the conditions of the MVT on any subinterval of \\((-1, 4)\\). We are interested in finding the greatest possible value of \\(f(0)\\) given that \\(f(3) = 5\\) and \\(f'(x) \\geq -1\\) for all \\(x\\).\n\nLet's consider the interval \\([0, 3]\\). By the MVT, there exists a point \\(c\\) in \\((0, 3)\\) such that\n\n\\[\nf'(c) = \\frac{f(3) - f(0)}{3-0} = \\frac{5 - f(0)}{3}.\n\\]\n\nSince \\(f'(x) \\geq -1\\) for all \\(x\\), this implies\n\n\\[\n\\frac{5 - f(0)}{3} \\geq -1.\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\(f(0)\\),\n\n\\[\n5 - f(0) \\geq -3,\n\\]\n\n\\[\nf(0) \\leq 8.\n\\]\n\nThis shows that the greatest possible value of \\(f(0)\\) is \\(8\\), as long as there exists a function that meets these conditions.\n\nTo show that such a function exists, consider the function\n\n\\[\nf(x) = 8 - x.\n\\]\n\nClearly, \\(f(3) = 5\\), and \\(f'(x) = -1 \\geq -1\\) for all \\(x\\), so this function meets the given conditions. Therefore, the greatest possible value of \\(f(0)\\) is indeed \\(8\\).\n\nThe answer is D. 8."
