                    "text": "To determine which reaction will have the greatest decrease in entropy, we need to consider the change in the number of moles of gas and the physical states of the reactants and products.\n\nEntropy generally increases when:\n- The number of moles of gas increases.\n- A substance changes from solid or liquid to gas.\n- There is an increase in complexity or randomness.\n\nConversely, entropy decreases when:\n- The number of moles of gas decreases.\n- A substance changes from gas to solid or liquid.\n\nLet's analyze each reaction:\n\nA. \\(HCl(aq) + NaOH(aq) \\rightarrow NaCl(aq) + H_2O(l)\\)\n\nThis reaction involves aqueous solutions and water formation, with no change in the number of moles of gases involved. Since all reactants and products are either in aqueous solution or liquid state, there isn't a significant change in entropy due to phase changes. However, the formation of an ordered product (water) from two aqueous solutions might contribute slightly to a decrease in entropy.\n\nB. \\(CH_4(g) + 2 O_2(g) \\rightarrow CO_2(g) + 2 H_2O(l)\\)\n\nHere, three moles of gas react to produce one mole of gas and two moles of liquid. This is a significant decrease in the number of moles of gas, resulting in a large decrease in entropy due to fewer possible arrangements of gas molecules.\n\nC. \\(C(s) + O_2(g) \\rightarrow CO_2(g)\\)\n\nOne mole of gas reacts with a solid to form one mole of gas. While the reaction goes from a solid to a gas, which could imply an increase in entropy, the overall change in the number of moles of gas is zero. Thus, the decrease in entropy due to the solid-to-gas conversion is not as significant as in option B.\n\nD. \\(2 SO_2(g) + O_2(g) \\rightarrow 2 SO_3(g)\\)\n\nThree moles of gas react to form two moles of gas. This results in a decrease in the number of moles of gas, leading to a decrease in entropy, but it is less dramatic than in option B because only one mole of gas is removed from the system.\n\nBased on these considerations, **reaction B** (\\(CH_4(g) + 2 O_2(g) \\rightarrow CO_2(g) + 2 H_2O(l)\\)) is expected to have the greatest decrease in entropy due to the significant reduction in the number of moles of gas and the transition from gas to liquid."
