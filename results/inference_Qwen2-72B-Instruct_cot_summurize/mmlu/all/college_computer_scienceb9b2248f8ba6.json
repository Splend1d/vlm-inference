TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is responsible for reliable delivery of large (multi-packet) messages between machines that are not necessarily directly connected. It ensures that all packets of a message are delivered in the correct order and without errors, even if some packets are lost or arrive out of order during transmission. While TCP does interact with the routing process, it does not itself route packets through the network, which is the responsibility of IP (Internet Protocol). TCP also does not deal with differences among operating system architectures; this is typically handled by higher-level protocols or application software."
