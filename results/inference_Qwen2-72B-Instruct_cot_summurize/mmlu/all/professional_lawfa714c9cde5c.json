They retained a reverter back to themselves, however, as follows: \"RESERVATION in favor of the Grantors, their heirs and assigns, an automatic reverter, should the property conveyed herein ever be mortgaged or encumbered within the life time of either Grantor.\" After husband died, the niece mortgaged the property. Can the surviving wife enforce the automatic reverter putting title back in herself?\n\nA. No, this is an unreasonable restraint on alienation.\nB. No, an automatic reverter is unenforceable.\nC. Yes, the provision can be enforced because the grantors and the grantee were blood relatives in pari mutual.\nD. Yes, the provision is enforceable because it is generally considered to be a reasonable restraint on alienation.\n"

Yes, the provision is enforceable because it is generally considered to be a reasonable restraint on alienation.\n\nThe clause in the deed creating the automatic reverter is a restraint on alienation, which limits the grantee's ability to mortgage or encumber the property during the lifetime of either grantor. However, such restraints are not necessarily void if they are reasonable. The reasonableness of a restraint on alienation is often determined by its duration and the interests being protected. In this case, the restraint lasts only during the lifetimes of the grantors, which is a limited period, making it more likely to be considered reasonable. Additionally, the grantors' interest in preserving the family farm may be seen as a legitimate concern that justifies the restraint. Therefore, the surviving wife may be able to enforce the automatic reverter and regain title to the property."
