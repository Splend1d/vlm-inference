One night, he was working backstage security for one of his favorite bands when he noticed a groupie sneak in the back door, pick up a guitar, and begin to walk out with it. He drew his service revolver and exclaimed, \"Stop or I'll shoot!\" The groupie looked at him and then fled. The defendant fired at the fleeing groupie, fatally wounding her. Use of force was not authorized by the concert promotion company that employed him. On these facts, if the defendant is charged with murder, he should be found\n\nA. guilty.\nB. not guilty, because the killing constituted justifiable homicide.\nC. not guilty, because the killing constituted excusable homicide.\nD. not guilty, because the defendant warned the groupie before he fired his gun.\n"

Under most jurisdictions, using deadly force to prevent the theft of property is not justified, especially when there is no immediate threat to the life or safety of the officer or others. The fact that the defendant warned the groupie before firing does not necessarily justify the use of deadly force in this situation. Additionally, since the use of force was not authorized by the concert promotion company, the defendant was acting outside the scope of his employment as a security guard. Therefore, the defendant's actions do not fall under any recognized exceptions for justifiable or excusable homicide, and he should be found guilty of murder. However, it is possible that the specific laws and circumstances of the case could lead to a different charge or conviction, such as manslaughter or justifiable homicide under extreme emotional disturbance."
