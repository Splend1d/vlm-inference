                    "text": "To find how many times in twenty-four hours the two computers back up data simultaneously, we need to determine when their backup cycles align.\n\nThe first computer backs up data at the turn of the minute every five minutes. This means its backup cycle can be represented by multiples of 5: 5, 10, 15, 20, etc.\n\nThe second computer backs up data at the turn of the minute every two minutes. This means its backup cycle can be represented by multiples of 2: 2, 4, 6, 8, etc.\n\nFor the two computers to back up data at the same time, their cycles must coincide, which occurs at the least common multiple (LCM) of their individual cycles. The LCM of 2 and 5 is 10, meaning they will back up data together every 10 minutes.\n\nGiven there are 1440 minutes in a day (24 hours), we divide this by the 10-minute interval to find out how many times the two computers back up data simultaneously:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1440}{10} = 144 \\]\n\nHowever, since the question specifies that the computers do not back up at the start of the 24-hour period, we exclude the initial coincidence at the 0th minute. Therefore, the correct answer is one less than our calculation, which would be 143. However, this option is not provided in your choices, indicating an oversight or misinterpretation in the question's phrasing or answer choices provided. Given the options you've listed, it seems the intention was to include the initial coincidence, making the answer:\n\nA. 144\n\nThis conclusion assumes that the \"turn of the minute\" refers to the beginning of each minute, and that the exclusion only applies to the very first minute of the 24-hour period, which is not explicitly stated but implied by the answer choices given."
