This dual relationship could compromise professional judgment and objectivity, which is generally considered unethical in psychological practice.\n\nAdditionally, the arrangement may also violate A, as it could be seen as a form of fee splitting, which is typically discouraged or prohibited unless it is part of a group practice or partnership agreement where all parties involved are licensed and share responsibility for the work done.\n\nOption C suggests that it could be ethical if the higher fee reflects the actual costs associated with the referrals, but this does not address the potential conflict of interest or the issue of fee splitting. \n\nOption D implies that referral fees are allowed as long as they are not exploitative, but the key issue here is the differential rate charged for referred clients versus those seen directly by Dr. Vasquez, which goes beyond a simple referral fee and into the territory of influencing clinical decision-making."
