This suggests that he denies the principle that \"ought implies can,\" which is option C. According to this principle, if an agent has a moral obligation to do something, then it must be possible for the agent to do it. However, in cases of genuine moral dilemmas, an agent may have conflicting obligations that cannot both be fulfilled, and so it is not possible to fulfill them all. Therefore, Nagel would deny that \"ought implies can\" because it does not allow for the possibility of genuine moral dilemmas."
