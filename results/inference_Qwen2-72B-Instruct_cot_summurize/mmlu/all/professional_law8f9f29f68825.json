                    "text": "The owner and operator of a pizza restaurant entered into a written contract with an employee that provided that the employee would be employed as manager of the restaurant for a period of three years. The contract provided that the owner was to pay the employee a salary of $2,000 per month, payable one-half to the employee and one-half to the employee's elderly mother. The contract further stipulated that \"the monies due hereunder shall not be assignable. \"When the mother learned of this contract, she wrote a letter to the owner stating, \"Kindly pay the amounts due me under your contract with my son directly to the nursing home, where I am presently a patient. \" During the first year of the contract, the owner paid $1,000 per month to the employee and $1,000 per month to the nursing home. After one year, another pizza restaurant opened across the street, creating competition. During the next few months, business steadily declined. As a result of the loss in business, the owner informed the employee that unless he agreed to take a cut in his salary, the employee would be fired. Reluctantly, the employee orally consented to a salary reduction of $500 per month. By the terms of their oral agreement, the owner promised to continue to pay $1,000 to the employee, but to pay only $500 per month to the nursing home. If the nursing home brings suit against the owner for breach of contract, who is most likely to prevail?\n\nA. The owner, because the mother's assignment to the nursing home was void as violative of the anti-assignment clause.\nB. The owner, because the agreement between the owner and the employee reduced the owner's obligations to the nursing home.\nC. The nursing home, because the mother's assignment would be enforceable despite the agreement between the owner and the employee.\nD. The nursing home, because the mother's gratuitous assignment was irrevocable.\n"

                    "text": "The answer is C. The nursing home, because the mother's assignment would be enforceable despite the agreement between the owner and the employee.\n\nThe anti-assignment clause in the original contract between the owner and the employee does not prevent the mother from assigning her rights to receive payments to a third party, such as the nursing home. While the clause may have prevented the employee from assigning his rights to receive payment, it would not necessarily prevent the mother from assigning her rights to receive payment.\n\nAdditionally, the oral agreement between the owner and the employee to reduce the salary and adjust the payment to the nursing home does not affect the enforceability of the original contract or the mother's assignment to the nursing home. The nursing home could still bring a claim against the owner for breach of contract based on the original contract and the mother's assignment of her rights to receive payment.\n\nFurthermore, the gratuitous assignment made by the mother to the nursing home is generally considered irrevocable once the nursing home has relied on it to its detriment, which appears to be the case here. Therefore, the nursing home is likely to prevail in any lawsuit against the owner for breach of contract."
