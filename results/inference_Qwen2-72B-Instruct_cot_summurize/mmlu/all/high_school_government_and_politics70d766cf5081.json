Failing to sign a bill after Congress has adjourned\n\nA pocket veto occurs when the President of the United States does not return a bill to Congress with objections (a regular veto) within 10 days while Congress is still in session. If Congress adjourns sine die (ends the session) within that 10-day period and the President has not signed the bill, it will not become law. This is known as a pocket veto."
