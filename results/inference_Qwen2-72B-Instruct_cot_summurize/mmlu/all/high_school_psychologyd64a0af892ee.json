Intrinsic motivation refers to engaging in an activity for the sake of enjoyment, interest, or satisfaction derived from the activity itself rather than for some external reward. When people are intrinsically motivated, they are more likely to engage in the behavior consistently and with enthusiasm, which can lead to long-term persistence.\n\nWhile primary drives (such as hunger, thirst, and sex) and secondary drives (such as money, power, and status) can motivate behavior, they are often extrinsic in nature and may not sustain motivation over extended periods if the rewards are not continuously present or become less appealing. Achievement motivation, which involves the desire to accomplish goals and receive recognition for one's accomplishments, can also be a powerful motivator but may not be as sustainable as intrinsic motivation if it relies too heavily on external validation.\n\nIntrinsic motivation is often associated with greater well-being, higher-quality performance, and more creativity. It is fostered by environments that support autonomy, competence, and relatedness, according to Self-Determination Theory."
