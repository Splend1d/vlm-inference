This is particularly beneficial during intense exercise when lactic acid accumulates in the muscles, leading to a decrease in pH (acidosis). By improving the buffering capacity, sodium bicarbonate can help maintain optimal pH levels, allowing for a better removal of hydrogen ions that contribute to muscle fatigue. This effect can lead to improved performance in middle-distance running by delaying the onset of fatigue."
