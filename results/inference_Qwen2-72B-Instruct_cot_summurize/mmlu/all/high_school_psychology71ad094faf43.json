According to this theory, first proposed by Stanley Schachter and Jerome Singer in 1962, physiological arousal is necessary for an emotional experience but not sufficient on its own. The second factor is the cognitive interpretation of the situation that gives meaning to the arousal.\n\nIn Antoinette's case, when she is startled, her heart races due to the initial physiological response to what her brain interprets as a potential threat (people jumping out at her). Once she realizes that the situation is actually a surprise party, her cognitive appraisal of the event changes from fear to joy, even though her heart is still racing. This re-interpretation of the arousal leads to a different emotional experience.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Schachter-Singer"
