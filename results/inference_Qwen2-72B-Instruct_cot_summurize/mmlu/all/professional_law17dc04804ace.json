The policy contains a clause providing that double indemnity is payable in the event that death of the insured \"results directly, and independently of all other causes, from bodily injury effected solely through external violent and accidental means. \"The plaintiff's wife met her death in the silage shed of her farm. The death resulted from wounds caused by the discharge of a double-barreled shotgun. The plaintiff was arrested and prosecuted for the murder of his wife. After a lengthy trial, the plaintiff was acquitted of the charge. After the insurance company refused to pay the plaintiff's insurance claim, the plaintiff instituted this civil action. The complaint sets forth the policy, alleges the facts surrounding the death of the insured, avers that the death was within the policy provisions for double indemnity payment, and demands judgment accordingly. At trial, the insurance company's attorney proposes to introduce excerpts from the plaintiff's murder trial. The plaintiff's attorney objects to the introduction of such evidence. The trial judge should rule the proffered evidence\n\nA. admissible as a declaration against interest.\nB. admissible as former testimony.\nC. inadmissible, because of collateral estoppel.\nD. inadmissible, because of double jeopardy.\n"

The rationale for admitting such testimony is that it was given under oath in a prior legal proceeding, and the witness (in this case, potentially the plaintiff) had the opportunity for cross-examination, making it reliable and admissible under the hearsay exception for former testimony.\n\nA. is incorrect because a declaration against interest refers to a statement made by someone who is unavailable as a witness that goes against their own interests, which does not apply here since the testimony was given in open court.\nC. is incorrect because collateral estoppel prevents the re-litigation of issues that have already been decided in a previous case between the same parties, but it does not apply to the admissibility of evidence.\nD. is incorrect because double jeopardy protects a person from being tried twice for the same crime, which is not relevant to the admissibility of evidence in a civil case."
