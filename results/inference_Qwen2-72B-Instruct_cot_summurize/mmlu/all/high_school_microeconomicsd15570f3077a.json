Firms produce a homogeneous product.\n\nIn a perfectly competitive market, one of the key characteristics is that all firms produce a product that is identical or virtually indistinguishable from the products of other firms. This means that consumers view all products in the market as substitutes for each other, and they will buy from any seller based on price alone. \n\nHere's why the other options are not correct:\n\nB. Barriers to entry exist: This is not a characteristic of perfect competition. In fact, it's quite the opposite. Perfect competition assumes that there are no barriers to entry or exit, which allows free movement of resources into and out of the industry.\n\nC. Firms are price-setting profit maximizers: In perfect competition, firms are price takers, not price setters. This means that individual firms have no control over the market price; they can only decide how much output to produce at the given market price. They maximize profits by producing where marginal cost equals marginal revenue (which is also equal to the market price).\n\nD. The government regulates the price so that deadweight loss is eliminated: In perfect competition, prices are determined by the interaction of supply and demand, not by government regulation. While perfect competition theoretically leads to an efficient allocation of resources with minimal deadweight loss, this outcome is due to market forces, not government intervention."
