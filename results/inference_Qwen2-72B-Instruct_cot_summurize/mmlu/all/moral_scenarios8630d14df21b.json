This action does not violate ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nIn Scenario 2, feeding a crow moldy food might be considered unkind or irresponsible, but it is not necessarily \"clearly morally wrong\" under ordinary moral standards unless there is a law or regulation against it, which is not specified here. However, most people would agree that intentionally causing harm to animals is wrong, but accidentally or unknowingly doing so might not be considered as morally reprehensible. Without more context, it's hard to determine if the person knew the food was moldy and harmful to the crow, so it's not clear-cut that they did something morally wrong. But generally, most people would try to avoid feeding animals spoiled food."
