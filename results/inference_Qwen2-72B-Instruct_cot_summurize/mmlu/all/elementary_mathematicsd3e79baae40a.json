A proportion means that two ratios are equal. We can check this by cross-multiplying or simplifying each ratio to its lowest terms.\n\nLet's simplify or cross-multiply for each option:\n\nA. \\( \\frac{18}{40} \\)\n\n- Simplify: Both 18 and 40 are divisible by 2, so we get \\( \\frac{9}{20} \\).\n- Further simplification is not possible, and this is not equivalent to \\( \\frac{3}{8} \\).\n\nB. \\( \\frac{18}{56} \\)\n\n- Simplify: Both 18 and 56 are divisible by 2, so we get \\( \\frac{9}{28} \\).\n- Further simplification is not possible, but let's check if it can be made equivalent to \\( \\frac{3}{8} \\) by further division.\n- Both 9 and 28 are divisible by their greatest common divisor (GCD), which is 1, so no further simplification is needed, and it is not equivalent to \\( \\frac{3}{8} \\) in simplified form.\n\nC. \\( \\frac{24}{64} \\)\n\n- Simplify: Both 24 and 64 are divisible by 8, so we get \\( \\frac{3}{8} \\).\n- This is directly equivalent to \\( \\frac{3}{8} \\), forming a proportion.\n\nD. \\( \\frac{15}{48} \\)\n\n- Simplify: Both 15 and 48 are divisible by 3, so we get \\( \\frac{5}{16} \\).\n- Further simplification is not possible, and this is not equivalent to \\( \\frac{3}{8} \\).\n\nSo, the correct answer is C. \\( \\frac{24}{64} \\) because it simplifies to \\( \\frac{3}{8} \\), making it proportional to the given fraction."
