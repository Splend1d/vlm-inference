It has vertices at $(0,0)$, $(3,0)$, $(3,2)$, and $(0,2)$. This means it extends 3 units along the x-axis and 2 units along the y-axis.\n\nThe condition $x < y$ defines a region in the plane. To see what this looks like, consider that when $x = y$, you have a line that passes through the origin (0,0). In our context, since we're only considering points inside the rectangle, we'll focus on the part of the line $y = x$ that falls within the rectangle. This line will intersect the rectangle at the points $(0,0)$ and $(2,2)$.\n\nNow, let's identify the region where $x < y$:\n\n- For any point $(x, y)$ in the rectangle, if $x < y$, it must lie above the line $y = x$.\n- Since the rectangle extends up to $y = 2$, the relevant part of the line $y = x$ is from $(0,0)$ to $(2,2)$.\n- The region where $x < y$ is therefore the triangle with vertices at $(0,0)$, $(2,2)$, and $(0,2)$.\n\nTo find the area of this triangle, we can use the formula for the area of a triangle, $\\frac{1}{2}bh$, where $b$ is the base and $h$ is the height. Here, both the base and the height are equal to 2 (since the triangle extends from $y = 0$ to $y = 2$ and from $x = 0$ to $x = 2$).\n\nSo, the area of the triangle is:\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 2 \\times 2 = 2\n\\]\n\nNext, let's find the total area of the rectangle. The rectangle extends 3 units along the x-axis and 2 units along the y-axis, so its area is:\n\\[\n\\text{Total Area} = 3 \\times 2 = 6\n\\]\n\nFinally, the probability that a randomly chosen point $(x, y)$ satisfies $x < y$ is the ratio of the area of the triangle to the area of the rectangle:\n\\[\nP(x < y) = \\frac{\\text{Area of the triangle}}{\\text{Total Area}} = \\frac{2}{6} = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. $\\frac{1}{3}$."
