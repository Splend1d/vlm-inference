During the past 3 days, she also has noticed a change in her voice and has had increased pain with swallowing. She has been taking acetaminophen since her symptoms began. Medical history is unremarkable and she takes no routine medications. Vital signs are temperature 40.0\u00b0C (104.0\u00b0F), pulse 130/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 102/66 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 97%. Examination of the oropharynx shows erythema, edema, and anterior displacement of the right side of the soft palate. The uvula is deviated to the left. There is a white exudate on the right tonsil. Trismus is noted. Palpation of the neck discloses enlarged, tender, mobile anterior cervical lymph nodes. In addition to antibiotic therapy, which of the following is the most appropriate management?\n\nA. Incision and drainage\nB. Intravenous methylprednisolone therapy\nC. Oral nystatin therapy\nD. Salt water gargle\n"

The patient's high fever, elevated heart rate, and localized symptoms all point towards this diagnosis.\n\nGiven the severity of the symptoms and the presence of a peritonsillar abscess, the most appropriate management would be:\n\nA. Incision and drainage\n\nThis procedure involves surgically draining the abscess to relieve symptoms and prevent complications. It is typically performed under local anesthesia in the emergency department or otolaryngology clinic. Antibiotic therapy should also be initiated to treat the underlying infection, but it alone may not be sufficient for managing a peritonsillar abscess without drainage.\n\nIntravenous methylprednisolone therapy (option B) might be used in cases of significant inflammation or to help reduce swelling before incision and drainage, but it is not the primary treatment for a peritonsillar abscess.\n\nOral nystatin therapy (option C) is used to treat fungal infections and would not be appropriate for treating a bacterial infection like a peritonsillar abscess.\n\nSalt water gargle (option D) can provide symptomatic relief but does not address the underlying infection or abscess and is therefore not sufficient as the sole treatment."
