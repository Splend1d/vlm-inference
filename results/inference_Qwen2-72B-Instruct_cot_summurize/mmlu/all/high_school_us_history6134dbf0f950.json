He made a sharp distinction between his frequently reiterated personal wish that 'all men everywhere could be free' and his official duties as a legislator, congressman, and president in a legal and constitutional system that recognized the South's right to property in slaves. Even after issuing the Emancipation Proclamation he continued to declare his preference for gradual abolition. While his racial views changed during the Civil War, he never became a principled egalitarian in the manner of abolitionists such as Frederick Douglass or Wendell Phillips or Radical Republicans like Charles Sumner.\"\n\u2014Eric Foner, The Fiery Trial, 2010\nHow did President Lincoln's issuance of the Emancipation Proclamation alter the course of the Civil War?\n\nA. The war came to a swift conclusion because the Proclamation made the Confederacy realize the futility of their cause.\nB. The war grew in scope because the Proclamation caused Great Britain to join the fight on the side of the Union.\nC. President Jefferson Davis of the Confederacy vowed massive resistance to any Union effort to free the slaves.\nD. The war aims of the United States were no longer exclusively focused on the preservation of the Union.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is D. The war aims of the United States were no longer exclusively focused on the preservation of the Union.\n\nWhen Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation on January 1, 1863, it fundamentally altered the nature of the Civil War. Initially, Lincoln had framed the conflict primarily as a struggle to preserve the Union, not to end slavery. However, the Proclamation declared that all slaves in Confederate territory \"shall be then, thenceforward, and forever free.\" This action transformed the war into a fight against slavery as well as secession. It also made it more difficult for European powers, which had abolished slavery, to recognize or support the Confederacy. Thus, the Emancipation Proclamation broadened the goals of the war beyond mere reunification to include the abolition of slavery as a moral imperative."
