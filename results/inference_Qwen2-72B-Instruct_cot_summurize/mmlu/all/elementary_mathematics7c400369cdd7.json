Therefore, Bus A and Bus B will depart at the same time after 75 minutes from the first departure.\n\nSince both buses start at 6:00 a.m., we just need to add 75 minutes to this time to find when they'll next leave together.\n\n6:00 a.m. + 75 minutes = 7:15 a.m.\n\nTherefore, the next time Bus A and Bus B will leave the bus station at the same time is at **7:15 a.m.**, which is option **B**."
