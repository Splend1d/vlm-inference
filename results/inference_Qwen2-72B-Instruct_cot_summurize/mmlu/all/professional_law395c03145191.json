She has a fee simple.\n\nThe first conveyance to the wife's cousin created a fee tail, which is an estate that passes only to the grantee's heirs of his body (i.e., his biological descendants). However, fee tails have been abolished in most jurisdictions in the United States, and such conveyances are typically converted into a fee simple absolute, which is the most complete ownership interest one can have in real property.\n\nTherefore, when the man subsequently conveyed the same property to his niece in fee simple, this later conveyance would supersede the prior conveyance, and the niece would take title to the property in fee simple, subject to any intervening rights that may have arisen under the first conveyance during the period between the two conveyances. However, since fee tails are generally not recognized in modern law, the first conveyance would likely not create any valid intervening rights that would prevent the niece from taking a fee simple interest.\n\nIt's worth noting that the exact outcome could vary depending on the specific laws and legal history of the jurisdiction in question, but in general, the niece would have a fee simple interest in the property."
