This is an extreme act of violence and harm that is universally condemned.\n\nIn Scenario 2, spending a small amount of money on oneself while still fulfilling the primary goal of buying a present for one's mother is not morally wrong. It is a personal choice about how to allocate funds, and as long as the intention to buy a gift for the mother is fulfilled, there is no clear moral violation."
