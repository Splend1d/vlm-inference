It holds that authentic knowledge (knowledge of truth) is necessarily derived from or informed by sensory experience, and that the only valid knowledge is scientific knowledge based on probability, statistics, and mathematics. This philosophy asserts that the methods of science should be applied to all areas of inquiry, including sociology and the other social sciences."
