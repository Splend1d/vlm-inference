Already at the Council of Ferrera (1438), which nominally reunited the Eastern and Western churches, there was a debate in which the Byzantines maintained the superiority of Plato to Aristotle. Cosimo and Lorenzo de Medici were both addicted to Plato; Cosimo founded and Lorenzo continued the Florentine Academy, which was largely devoted to the study of Plato&\u2026The humanists of the time, however, were too busy acquiring knowledge of antiquity to be able to produce anything of value.\"\nBertrand Russell, British philosopher, History of Western Philosophy, 1946\nIn what way does this passage best exemplify the view of twentieth-century philosophers and thinkers?\n\nA. Faced with an unprecedented number of social and technological changes, the twentieth century embraced innovation as one of the most valued characteristics of life.\nB. Overwhelmed by the unprecedented number of social and technological changes, the twentieth century sought refuge in the longstanding traditions of the past.\nC. After the devastation of World Wars I and II erased the possibility of finding a unified meaning to life, philosophers occupied themselves with finding small differences between the philosophies of past thinkers.\nD. Nihilists typically find ways to doubt the postulations of those who came before them.\n"

The passage is discussing events that took place during the Renaissance, specifically focusing on the revival of interest in Plato's philosophy due to the influence of Byzantine scholars and the patronage of the Medici family. However, if we must choose the option that comes closest to being reflected indirectly in the passage, it would be:\n\nB. Overwhelmed by the unprecedented number of social and technological changes, the twentieth century sought refuge in the longstanding traditions of the past.\n\nAlthough this statement does not accurately describe the passage's content, it can be argued that the passage implies a return to the study of classical thought (Plato) as a response to the intellectual challenges of the time. This could be seen as analogous to the twentieth-century tendency to seek solace or guidance in traditional wisdom during times of rapid change. However, it's important to note that the passage itself does not discuss the twentieth century but rather historical events from the Renaissance period."
