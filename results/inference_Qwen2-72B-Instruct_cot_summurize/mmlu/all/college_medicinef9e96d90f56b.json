However, not all cells enter G0, which is a quiescent state that some cells enter when they have exited the active cell cycle. Cells in G0 are not actively preparing to divide, so this phase is not common to cells undergoing meiosis or mitosis. Therefore, the correct answer is C, as both G2 and S phases are common to cells undergoing meiosis and mitosis. \n\nHowever, it's worth noting that during meiosis, there are two rounds of cell division (meiosis I and meiosis II), and each round includes its own prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase stages. The interphase stages (G1, S, and G2) occur before meiosis I, but not between meiosis I and meiosis II. In contrast, during mitosis, there is only one round of cell division, and the interphase stages occur before and after mitosis."
