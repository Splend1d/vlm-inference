Can impact genetic predispositions to developmental disorders\n\nThe body's stress response system, also known as the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, can indeed impact genetic predispositions to developmental disorders. Stress experienced during critical periods of development, particularly in utero and during early childhood, can lead to alterations in gene expression that may increase the risk for various developmental disorders. This is due to the effects of stress hormones like cortisol on the developing brain and other systems in the body. While SSRIs can affect mood and anxiety by regulating serotonin levels, they do not primarily regulate the body's overall stress response system. The stress response system can be influenced both before birth and during childhood, making option A partially correct but less comprehensive than D. Option B is incorrect because the stress response system is highly susceptible to environmental influences."
