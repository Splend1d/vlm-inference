Voluntary manslaughter because it was an intentional killing done while acting recklessly or impulsively.\nC.

This is because the deaths were a result of reckless behavior (driving under the influence and at high speed) but there was no intent to kill. Involuntary manslaughter typically involves a killing that occurs during the commission of an unlawful act that is not a felony or during the commission of a lawful act in an unlawful manner. Driving under the influence can be considered such an act."
