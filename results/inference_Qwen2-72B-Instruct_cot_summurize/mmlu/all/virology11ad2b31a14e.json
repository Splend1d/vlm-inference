DNA contains the genetic instructions used in the growth, development, functioning, and reproduction of all known living organisms and many viruses. RNA is responsible for carrying the genetic code from DNA to the ribosomes where proteins are synthesized. Proteins perform most of the functions in living cells and are involved in nearly every process within cells. Therefore, the correct answer is C. From DNA to RNA to protein."
