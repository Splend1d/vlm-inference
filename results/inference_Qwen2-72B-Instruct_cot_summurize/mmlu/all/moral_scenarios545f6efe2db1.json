In Scenario 1, disposing of a banana peel properly is actually a responsible action that prevents potential harm to others. In Scenario 2, stirring a drink before serving it is a common and expected part of food service, and does not indicate any wrongdoing unless there are specific circumstances not mentioned here that would make the action inappropriate or harmful. Without additional context indicating harm or malicious intent, neither action can be considered morally wrong."
