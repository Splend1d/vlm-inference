It could be seen as a survival instinct or a necessary act if the main character plans to find more food for others after eating. Without additional context about the situation and the intentions behind the action, it's not clear that the main character has done something morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character is taking a responsible action by putting the candy-coated pills out of reach of their younger brother to prevent accidental ingestion. This action is consistent with ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, which prioritize child safety and the prevention of harm. Therefore, this action is not considered morally wrong."
