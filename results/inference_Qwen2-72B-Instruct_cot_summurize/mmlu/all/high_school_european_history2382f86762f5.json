And now he was going to deprive the poor soldier, who had undergone so many hardships, and suffered from innumerable wounds, of this small remuneration, and not even allow him a pretty Indian female for a companion&\u2026\n[Later], when Cort\u00e9s learnt that there were still a great many bars of gold among the men, and heavy gambling in consequence, (for, according to the old saying, gold and love cannot lie long concealed,) he made known, under threats of severe punishment, that everyone should produce the gold he had obtained on the night of our retreat, of which one third was to be returned to him; but that anyone who refused to pay this, should have the whole taken from him. Many of our men refused downright to comply with this; yet Cort\u00e9s managed to extort a good deal of it under the pretence of a loan&\u2026\"\nThe Memoirs of the Conquistador Bernal Diaz del Castillo, 1568\nUpon the return of Cort\u00e9s's expedition, which of the following was a consequence of the actions described in the memoir?\n\nA.

                    "text": "The passage describes the actions of Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s and his men during the conquest of Mexico, specifically regarding the distribution of gold and slaves among the soldiers. The consequences of these actions are not explicitly stated in the passage, but we can infer some likely outcomes based on historical context.\n\nA. A decentralized political state - This is unlikely to be a direct consequence of the actions described. The Spanish conquest actually led to the establishment of a centralized colonial government under Spanish rule.\n\nB. A strengthened agricultural sector - There is no evidence in the passage to suggest that the agricultural sector was strengthened as a result of Cort\u00e9s's actions. In fact, the conquest disrupted indigenous societies and economies, which could have weakened the agricultural sector.\n\nC. An increased rate of inflation - This is a plausible consequence. The influx of large amounts of gold from the New World into Spain and other European countries contributed to what is known as the \"Price Revolution,\" characterized by a significant increase in prices and inflation across Europe during the 16th century.\n\nD. Less tolerance for Jews and Muslims - The passage does not provide any information about religious tolerance or intolerance towards Jews and Muslims. However, it is important to note that Spain had already expelled or forced the conversion of Jews and Muslims during the late 15th century through the Alhambra Decree and the Spanish Inquisition.\n\nBased on the information provided in the passage and historical context, the most likely answer is:\n\nC. An increased rate of inflation"
