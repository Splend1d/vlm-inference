This can lead to a stabilization of genetic variation within a population, as both alleles are maintained at intermediate frequencies because they contribute to the fitness of the heterozygotes.\n\nStabilizing selection acts to maintain the status quo in a population by selecting against extreme phenotypes and favoring average or intermediate ones. When heterozygote advantage occurs, it often results in stabilizing selection because the heterozygous state, which is an intermediate phenotype, has higher fitness than either homozygous state. As a result, the frequency of both alleles is kept relatively stable over time, rather than one allele becoming fixed or lost from the population."
