However, the second part is incorrect because a positive charge does not necessarily move perpendicular to a magnetic field. The direction of the force on a charge due to a magnetic field is indeed perpendicular to both the velocity of the charge and the magnetic field, according to the right-hand rule. But this does not mean the charge itself moves perpendicular to the magnetic field; it means the force acting on the charge is perpendicular to both the velocity vector and the magnetic field vector. The path of the charge may be deflected or curved by this force, depending on its initial velocity and the strength and orientation of the magnetic field.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C."
