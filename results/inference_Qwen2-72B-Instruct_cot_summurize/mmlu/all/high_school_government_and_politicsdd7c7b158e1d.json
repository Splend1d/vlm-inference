Development of a two-party system\n\nSingle-member district systems, such as the one used in the United States, tend to favor a two-party system due to the \"winner-takes-all\" nature of the electoral process. This system often discourages the growth of smaller parties because they have little chance of winning seats in the legislature, leading to a dominance by two major parties."
