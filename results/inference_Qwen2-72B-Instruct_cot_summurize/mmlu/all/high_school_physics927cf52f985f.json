                    "text": "The original equilibrium condition means that the magnitude of the gravitational force (Fg) equals the magnitude of the electrostatic force (Fe). We can write this as:\n\nFg = Fe\n\nThe gravitational force between two masses m1 and m2 separated by distance r is given by Newton's law of universal gravitation:\n\nFg = G * m1 * m2 / r^2\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant.\n\nThe electrostatic force between two charges q1 and q2 separated by distance r is given by Coulomb's law:\n\nFe = k * q1 * q2 / r^2\n\nwhere k is Coulomb's constant.\n\nSince the initial conditions state that Fg = Fe and both objects have equal mass (m) and equal charge (q), we can equate the formulas for the forces:\n\nG * m * m / r^2 = k * q * q / r^2\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\nG * m^2 = k * q^2\n\nNow, if the mass of Object A is halved, we need to find a way to maintain equilibrium. Let's denote the new mass of Object A as m' and the new charge on either Object A or Object B as q'. The new equilibrium condition would be:\n\nG * m' * m / r^2 = k * q' * q / r^2\n\nSubstituting m' = m/2 into the equation gives us:\n\nG * (m/2) * m / r^2 = k * q' * q / r^2\n\nSimplifying:\n\nG * m^2 / 2 = k * q' * q\n\nTo maintain equilibrium, the right side of the equation must also be halved compared to the initial condition. Since we know that G * m^2 = k * q^2 from the initial equilibrium condition, we can substitute that in:\n\nk * q^2 / 2 = k * q' * q\n\nDividing both sides by k*q gives:\n\nq / 2 = q'\n\nThus, to maintain equilibrium when the mass of Object A is halved, the charge on one of the objects must also be halved. Since the question asks what needs to be done to maintain equilibrium when the mass of Object A is halved, the correct answer is:\n\nB. the charge on Object B were halved\n\nThis is the only option that directly addresses halving a quantity to compensate for the halving of Object A's mass while maintaining equilibrium. Doubling the charge on either object (Options A and C) would increase the electrostatic force, disrupting the balance, and halving the mass of Object B (Option D) would not necessarily restore equilibrium since the question specifies that it's the change in mass of Object A that requires adjustment."
