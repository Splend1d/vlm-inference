This lactate can either be cleared by the body (converted back to glucose in the liver or used as fuel by other muscles) or it can accumulate in the blood if the production rate outpaces the clearance rate. Therefore, the balance between lactate production and lactate clearance determines the rate of blood lactate accumulation."
