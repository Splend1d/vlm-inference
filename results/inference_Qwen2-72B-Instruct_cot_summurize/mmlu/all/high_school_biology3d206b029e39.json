Water is split apart, providing hydrogen ions and electrons to NADP for temporary storage.\n\nDuring the light-dependent reactions, water molecules are split through a process called photolysis, which releases oxygen as a byproduct. The hydrogen ions (protons) and electrons from the water are used to create energy carriers ATP (adenosine triphosphate) and NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate), which are then used in the light-independent reactions (Calvin cycle) for carbon fixation. \n\nOptions A and B are incorrect because the incorporation of carbon into sugars and the conversion of PGA (1,3-bisphosphoglycerate) to glucose occur during the Calvin cycle, not during the light-dependent reactions. Option D is incorrect because the light-dependent reactions take place in the thylakoid membranes of the chloroplasts, not in the stroma."
