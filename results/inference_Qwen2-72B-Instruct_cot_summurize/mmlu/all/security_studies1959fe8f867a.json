Scholars critiquing orthodox security discourse (Option A) helped to broaden the understanding of what constitutes a security threat to include environmental concerns. The recognition that environmental changes impact human well-being (Option B) underscored the need for addressing environmental issues within security frameworks. The development of a shared environmental consciousness (Option C), particularly among developing countries, fostered international cooperation on environmental issues, which is crucial for addressing global environmental challenges. Thus, all three factors played a role in the evolution of environmental security as a field of study and policy concern."
