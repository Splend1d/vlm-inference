True, False\n\nExplanation:\nStatement 1 is true because when the training dataset is small, a model can easily learn the noise and outliers in the data instead of the underlying pattern. This leads to overfitting, where the model performs well on the training data but poorly on unseen data.\n\nStatement 2 is false because overfitting is actually more likely when the hypothesis space (the set of all possible models that the learning algorithm can choose from) is large. A large hypothesis space allows for more complex models, which can fit the training data very closely, including its noise, leading to overfitting. Conversely, a smaller hypothesis space would limit the complexity of the model, making overfitting less likely."
