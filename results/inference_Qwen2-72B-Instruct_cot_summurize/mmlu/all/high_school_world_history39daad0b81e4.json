It did not even grudge us the spectacle of the conflict. More than sixty thousand fell, not beneath the Roman arms and weapons, but, grander far, before our delighted eyes. May the tribes, I pray, ever retain if not love for us, at least hatred for each other; for while the destinies of empire hurry us on, fortune can give no greater boon than discord among our foes.\"\nGermania, Publius Cornelius Tacitus, ca. 98 C.E.\nWhich of the following conclusions about imperial treatment of \"barbarian\" (foreign) peoples in the period 600 B.C.E. to 600 C.E. is most directly supported by the passage?\n\nA. Empires encouraged rival tribes to destroy one another to reduce threats to the state.\nB. Empires welcomed migrations of barbarian peoples as sources of military manpower or economic productivity.\nC. Empires used military force against all neighboring barbarian peoples as a means of expanding their influence.\nD. Empires used religion to convert barbarian peoples so that they might become friendlier to the state.\n"

The text specifically states, \"May the tribes, I pray, ever retain if not love for us, at least hatred for each other,\" which suggests that the author (Tacitus) hopes that the tribes will continue to fight among themselves rather than uniting against the Roman Empire. Additionally, the passage describes how the Chamavi and Angrivarii attacked and exterminated the Bructeri, which reduced a potential threat to Rome without the need for direct Roman military action. This implies that the empire may have benefited from or even encouraged such conflicts among neighboring tribes."
