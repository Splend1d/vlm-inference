However, it was further developed and systematized by Roman jurists and philosophers, most notably by Cicero. Therefore, while the concept has roots in both D. Greek Thinking and C. Roman Law, if you must choose one as the point where it first appeared in a more structured form relevant to legal and political theory, C. Roman Law would be the most accurate answer, given that the question seems to be framed within a legal context.\n\nHowever, for the sake of precision:\n\nD. Greek Thinking - This is where the philosophical foundations of natural law were laid, with thinkers like Aristotle discussing the idea of an inherent moral order in the universe.\nC. Roman Law - Here, the concept of natural law was integrated into legal theory and practice, influencing Western legal traditions profoundly.\n\nSo, while 'natural law' as a concept was discussed in Greek philosophy, its articulation as a principle of jurisprudence was more fully realized in Roman legal thought."
