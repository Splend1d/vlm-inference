Just as a car approached on the street, the girl lost her balance and fell off the sidewalk and into the street. The driver of the car tried to swerve to avoid her, but ran over her leg.

Negligence requires proving that the driver had a duty to act reasonably under the circumstances, breached that duty, and caused harm as a result of that breach. If the driver was not driving negligently (i.e., was obeying traffic laws, driving at a safe speed, and paying attention to the road), then the driver may not be held liable for the girl's injuries.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the fact that the driver was driving within the posted speed limit does not necessarily mean that the driver was not negligent. Option B is incorrect because the cause of the girl falling into the street is not relevant to whether the driver was negligent. Option D is also incorrect because \"last clear chance\" is a doctrine that applies when one party has the last opportunity to avoid an accident and fails to do so, but it does not automatically mean that the party who had the last clear chance is liable for the accident."
