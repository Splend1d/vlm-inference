The pain was initially on the right but now has become generalized. His temperature is 38.8\u00b0C (101.8\u00b0F), pulse is 100/min, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 143/83 mm Hg. Abdominal examination shows guarding with diffuse rebound tenderness. There are no palpable masses. A CT scan of the abdomen shows a perforated appendix. Examination of peritoneal fluid from this patient will most likely show which of the following organisms?\n\nA. Candida albicans\nB. Citrobacter freundii\nC. Escherichia coli\nD. Staphylococcus aureus\n"

While other organisms may also be present, E. coli is the most common gram-negative rod isolated from these types of infections.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Escherichia coli"
