However, it cannot be used to directly prove the defendant's guilt for the crime of robbery he is currently being tried for, as it pertains to a separate, albeit related, offense. The fact that the defendant was granted immunity for his testimony does not make the evidence inadmissible; rather, it may affect how the jury weighs the testimony in terms of credibility."
