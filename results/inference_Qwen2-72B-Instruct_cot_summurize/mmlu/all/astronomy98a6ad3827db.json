Ability to measure the angular separation of objects\n\nResolution in telescopes refers to the ability to distinguish between two close objects as separate entities rather than one. It's determined by the diffraction limit and the diameter of the telescope's aperture. The larger the aperture, the higher the resolution, meaning it can see finer details or closer separations between objects."
