Duty to the client\n\nThis principle emphasizes that the practitioner should act in the best interest of the client and prioritize their well-being. However, it's important to note that all of the options listed (confidentiality, duty to the profession, and legal defensibility) are also critical components of ethical practice and often interrelated with the duty to the client. For instance, maintaining confidentiality is a way to uphold the duty to the client by protecting their privacy and trust. Duty to the profession ensures that the practitioner maintains high standards and integrity, which ultimately benefits the client. Legal defensibility is also crucial as it helps ensure that the practitioner's actions are lawful and do not harm the client. Yet, when considering the primary ethical principle, the duty to the client often takes precedence."
