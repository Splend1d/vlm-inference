Earth is a few thousand years old, and populations are unchanging.\n\nThis perspective, often associated with catastrophism and a literal interpretation of the Bible, held that Earth's history could be traced back only a few thousand years (as calculated from Biblical genealogies) and that species were fixed and unchanging since their creation. This view began to change in the late 18th and early 19th centuries due to the work of scientists like James Hutton and Charles Lyell, who proposed the concept of uniformitarianism and an Earth with a much longer history. Charles Darwin later built upon these ideas to propose the theory of evolution by natural selection."
