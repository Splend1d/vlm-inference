The command multiplies the standard normal distribution by the standard deviation and adds the mean to shift the distribution.\n\nTo create a $10\\times 10$ uniform matrix with each entry i.i.d. sampled from $U[-1,1)$, you can use the command:\n\n\\texttt{2 * torch.rand(10,10) - 1}\n\nThis command generates a matrix of random numbers between 0 and 1 using \\texttt{torch.rand}, then scales it by 2 and shifts it by -1 to get a matrix of random numbers between -1 and 1.\nTherefore, the correct answer is C."
