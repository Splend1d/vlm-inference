Divergent thinking is the process of exploring multiple possible solutions and is essential in the early stages of problem-solving when you want to open up the possibility space.\n\nConvergent thinking (option B) involves narrowing down options to find the single best solution, which typically occurs after the brainstorming phase when evaluating and selecting among generated ideas.\n\nDeductive reasoning (option C) is a form of logical thinking that goes from the general to the specific, concluding with a certain outcome based on established premises. It's not directly related to brainstorming, which aims at generating new ideas rather than applying logic to existing information.\n\nGroupthink (option D) is a phenomenon where the desire for harmony or conformity results in an irrational decision-making outcome. Brainstorming, if not managed properly, can sometimes lead to groupthink, but its primary goal is to encourage diverse and creative ideas, not suppress them."
