Standardization allows for comparison of scores across different individuals. Achievement (A) refers to tests that measure learned skills and knowledge, such as academic performance. Projective (C) tests are used in psychology to identify underlying thought disorders by asking subjects to interpret ambiguous stimuli, like inkblots. Triarchic (D) is a theory of intelligence proposed by Robert J. Sternberg, which includes analytical, creative, and practical abilities; it does not specifically apply to IQ tests but rather offers a broader view of human intelligence."
