The plaintiff alleged that a tire manufactured by the subsidiary in Europe had caused his wife's death in an automobile accident in Europe. The parent corporation does significant business throughout the United States, including in State A. The subsidiary conducts no business and has no employees or bank accounts in State A. The no employees or bank accounts in State A. The subsidiary manufactures its tires for the European market, but 2% of its tires are distributed in State A by the parent corporation. The subsidiary has moved to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. Should the court grant the subsidiary's motion?\n\nA. No, because 2% of the subsidiary's tires entered State A through the stream of commerce.\nB. No, because of the general personal jurisdiction established over the parent corporation.\nC. Yes, because the accident did not occur in the United States.\nD. Yes, because the subsidiary lacks continuous, systematic, and substantial contacts with State A.\n"

Yes, because the subsidiary lacks continuous, systematic, and substantial contacts with State A.\n\nFor a court to have personal jurisdiction over a defendant in a civil lawsuit, there must be sufficient minimum contacts between the defendant and the forum state such that the exercise of jurisdiction does not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice. In this case, the foreign subsidiary has no direct contacts with State A (no employees or bank accounts), and the mere fact that 2% of its tires are distributed in State A by the parent corporation does not establish the necessary continuous, systematic, and substantial contacts required for specific personal jurisdiction.\n\nThe \"stream of commerce\" doctrine may allow for jurisdiction if the defendant purposefully avails itself of the market in the forum state and reasonably anticipates being haled into court there. However, since the subsidiary specifically manufactures its tires for the European market and does not directly engage in activities in State A, it is unlikely that this doctrine would apply.\n\nGeneral personal jurisdiction, as mentioned in option B, requires even more extensive contacts with the forum state, typically akin to being \"at home\" in the state. Since the subsidiary is domiciled outside of State A and has no significant connections to the state, general jurisdiction does not apply either.\n\nTherefore, the court should grant the subsidiary's motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction."
