The study enrolled 4000 subjects, aged 20 to 65 years. Of these subjects, 2100 were men and 1900 were women; 2500 were white, 1000 were African American, 300 were Hispanic, and 200 were Asian/Pacific Islanders. Results of the trial showed no overall benefit of the vaccine. However, post hoc analysis disclosed a small but statistically significant vaccine protection among African American subjects. Which of the following is the most accurate rationale for questioning the validity of efficacy analysis of the HIV vaccine among the African American study subjects?\n\nA. HIV infection is more prevalent among African American populations\nB. The study was not blinded\nC. There was a Type II error\nD. Vaccine response among African American subjects was not the primary outcome measure\n"

Vaccine response among African American subjects was not the primary outcome measure\n\nThe primary concern here is that the vaccine's effect on African American subjects was discovered through a post hoc analysis, which was not part of the original study design. This can lead to issues with statistical inference and may increase the likelihood of false positive results (Type I errors). Since the vaccine response in this subgroup was not the primary outcome measure, the analysis might not have been adequately powered to detect such an effect, and the observed difference could be due to chance rather than a true biological effect. This does not necessarily mean that the finding is invalid, but it should be interpreted with caution and ideally confirmed in a larger, appropriately designed study."
