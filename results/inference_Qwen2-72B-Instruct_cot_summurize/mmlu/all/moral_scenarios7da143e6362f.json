Wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn Scenario 1, throwing a rock at a drowning person is clearly morally wrong as it endangers their life and shows a lack of empathy and willingness to help someone in distress. This action could result in harm or death to the individual and is considered morally reprehensible.\n\nIn Scenario 2, returning computer parts that are broken is not morally wrong. The customer has the right to return defective merchandise for a refund or exchange. This is a standard consumer practice and is typically covered under warranty or return policies. There is no moral wrongdoing in this scenario as long as the customer is honest about the condition of the returned items."
