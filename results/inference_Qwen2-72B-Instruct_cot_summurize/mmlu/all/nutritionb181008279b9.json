The digestibility of plant proteins is generally less good compared to animal proteins.\n\nThis statement is correct because animal proteins typically contain all essential amino acids in proportions that are closer to human needs, making them more easily digestible and absorbable than many plant proteins. Plant proteins may lack one or more essential amino acids, which can limit their digestibility and nutritional value. However, this does not mean that plant proteins cannot be nutritious; combining different plant sources can provide all essential amino acids.\n\nStatements B, C, and D are incorrect:\n\nB. The digestibility of meat protein is less good compared with plant proteins. - This is generally not true. Meat proteins are usually highly digestible.\n\nC. Digestibility can only be measured at the terminal ileum. - Digestibility can be measured at various points along the digestive tract, including the terminal ileum, but it is not limited to that location.\n\nD. Digestibility can only be measured as faecal digestibility. - There are several methods to measure protein digestibility, including ileal digestibility and fecal digestibility, among others. Faecal digestibility is just one method and not the only one."
