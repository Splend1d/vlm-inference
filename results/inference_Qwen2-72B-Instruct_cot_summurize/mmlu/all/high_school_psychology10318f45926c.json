However, the use of affirming verbal cues like \"Yes, uh huh\" suggests that the therapist is actively listening and validating Amy's feelings, which is a common practice in humanistic therapy (Option C). Humanistic therapies emphasize empathy, unconditional positive regard, and active listening to help clients explore their feelings.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that active listening and validation can also be components of other therapeutic approaches, such as cognitive therapy (Option D), where therapists might use similar techniques to understand a client's perspective before helping them to reframe negative thought patterns. Without more context, it's difficult to rule out other forms of therapy definitively. \n\nIf we have to choose based on the given information, humanistic therapy (Option C) would be the most likely answer because of its emphasis on creating a supportive environment through active listening and affirmation."
