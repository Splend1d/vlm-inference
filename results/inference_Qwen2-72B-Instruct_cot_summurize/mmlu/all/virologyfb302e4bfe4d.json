The teratogenic lesions of cataracts, deafness, mental retardation, and microcephaly in the foetus\n\nRubella syndrome, also known as congenital rubella syndrome (CRS), refers to a group of birth defects that occur when a fetus is exposed to the rubella virus during pregnancy, typically in the first trimester. This can lead to serious health problems such as cataracts, deafness, heart defects, mental retardation, and microcephaly. The syndrome is a significant concern for public health, which is why vaccination against rubella is recommended for women of childbearing age to prevent such complications."
