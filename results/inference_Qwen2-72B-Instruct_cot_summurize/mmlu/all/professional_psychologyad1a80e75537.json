This finding comes from research conducted by Kurt Lewin and his colleagues in the 1930s and 1940s on leadership styles in children's groups. They found that children were able to adjust well when the leadership style changed from autocratic (where the leader makes all decisions and has strict control over the group) to democratic (where the leader shares decision-making with the group members). This suggests that children are capable of adapting to different leadership styles and can function effectively in more participatory group environments. \n\nOption B is incorrect because the presence or absence of the leader did make a significant difference in the behavior of autocratic groups. Option C is also incorrect because laissez-faire groups (where there is little or no leadership) tended to be less effective at maintaining task orientation compared to autocratic or democratic groups. Option D appears to be a placeholder for an answer choice that was not provided."
