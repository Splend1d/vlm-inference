It gives rise to several structures, including:\n\nA. The neural tube: This is a crucial structure that eventually forms the brain and spinal cord.\n\nB. Ectomesenchymal cells: These are multipotent stem cells that give rise to various types of connective tissue, including bone, cartilage, and muscle in the head and neck region.\n\nC. Dental enamel: This is the hardest substance in the human body and covers the crowns of teeth. It is formed by specialized ectodermal cells called ameloblasts.\n\nTherefore, the ectoderm contributes to the formation of all three structures mentioned."
