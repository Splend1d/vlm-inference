At this point, the sum of consumer surplus (the benefit consumers receive from paying less than what they are willing to pay) and producer surplus (the benefit producers receive from receiving more than their minimum acceptable price) is maximized. This total surplus represents the total welfare or economic efficiency achieved in the market."
