While some children may improve over time, many continue to experience difficulties into adulthood, although the severity and impact of these difficulties can vary widely. It's important to note that not all children with reading disabilities will have accompanying issues with vocabulary, but it is a common co-occurring challenge.\n\nRegarding the other options:\n\nA. These children usually have subtle hearing disorders - This is not necessarily true for all children with reading disabilities. While hearing problems can contribute to reading difficulties, specific reading disabilities are typically not caused by auditory processing issues alone.\n\nB. Reading skills usually do not reach normal levels as these children reach adulthood - While some children with reading disabilities may continue to struggle throughout their lives, others can make significant progress with appropriate interventions. The extent to which reading skills normalize can vary greatly depending on the individual and the support they receive.\n\nC. These children usually excel in sports - There is no inherent connection between having a reading disability and excelling in sports. Children with reading disabilities can have a wide range of abilities and interests, including sports, but this is not a defining characteristic of reading disabilities."
