                    "text": "Let's analyze each statement separately:\n\nStatement 1: \"In AdaBoost weights of the misclassified examples go up by the same multiplicative factor.\"\n\nThis statement is true. In AdaBoost (Adaptive Boosting), after each iteration, the weights of the misclassified examples are increased by a multiplicative factor. This is done so that the next weak learner focuses more on these misclassified examples. The exact formula for updating the weights involves multiplying the current weight by a factor that depends on the error rate of the weak classifier and the normalization factor to ensure that the weights sum up to 1.\n\nStatement 2: \"In AdaBoost, weighted training error e_t of the tth weak classifier on training data with weights D_t tends to increase as a function of t.\"\n\nThis statement is false. In fact, the goal of AdaBoost is to decrease the weighted training error over time. Each weak classifier is trained on a distribution of the training set where previously misclassified examples have higher weights. Thus, each subsequent weak classifier tries to correct the mistakes of its predecessor. As a result, the weighted training error e_t should generally decrease (or at least not increase) as t increases because the algorithm is iteratively improving its ability to correctly classify the examples.\n\nSo, the answer is C. True, False."
