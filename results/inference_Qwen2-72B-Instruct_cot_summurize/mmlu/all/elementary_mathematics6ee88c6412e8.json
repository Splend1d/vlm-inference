If there are 6 groups of marbles with 8 marbles in each group, then the total number of marbles would be \\(6 \\times 8 = 48\\). This does not equal 56, so this option is false.\n\nB. If there are 7 groups of marbles with 7 marbles in each group, then the total number of marbles would be \\(7 \\times 7 = 49\\). This does not equal 56, so this option is false.\n\nC. If there are 8 groups of marbles with 7 marbles in each group, then the total number of marbles would be \\(8 \\times 7 = 56\\). This equals 56, so this option is true.\n\nD. If there are 9 groups of marbles with 6 marbles in each group, then the total number of marbles would be \\(9 \\times 6 = 54\\).
