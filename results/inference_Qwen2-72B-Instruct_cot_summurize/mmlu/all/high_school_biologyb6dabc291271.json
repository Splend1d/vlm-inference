Since then, both lineages have evolved independently, but they still retain many similarities due to their shared evolutionary history. Option B and C are incorrect because neither species evolved directly from the other; they are sister taxa that share a common ancestor. Option D, convergent evolution, typically refers to the independent evolution of similar features in species of different lineages due to similar environmental pressures or ecological niches, which is not the case for the genetic similarities between humans and chimpanzees."
