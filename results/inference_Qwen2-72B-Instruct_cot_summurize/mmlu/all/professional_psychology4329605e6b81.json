This concept is known as the \"principle of least effort\" or the \"mere exposure effect.\" When the discrepancy is small, the receiver is more likely to be open to the communicator's arguments and adjust their beliefs accordingly. However, if the discrepancy is too large, the listener may become defensive or skeptical, making it less likely for them to change their mind. This is sometimes referred to as the \"boomerang effect,\" where the attempt to persuade someone can backfire and result in an opposite effect."
