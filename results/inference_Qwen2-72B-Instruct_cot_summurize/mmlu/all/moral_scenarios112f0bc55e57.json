Not wrong, Wrong\n\nIn Scenario 1, selling your business to a competitor without your business partner being present might be unethical or unwise, but it is not necessarily \"clearly morally wrong\" if there were no legal or contractual obligations requiring the partner's presence or consent. However, it could be considered wrong if there was an understanding or agreement that such decisions would be made together.\n\nIn Scenario 2, throwing fireworks at small squirrels is clearly morally wrong as it involves causing potential harm or distress to animals for entertainment, which is against ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. This action can cause physical injury, fear, and unnecessary suffering to the animals, which is unethical and potentially illegal under animal cruelty laws."
