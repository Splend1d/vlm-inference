In Scenario 1, hiding presents until Christmas is a common practice and not generally considered morally wrong. In Scenario 2, eating a friend's food could be seen as rude if permission wasn't given, but it would not typically be viewed as a serious moral transgression unless the food was specifically reserved for another purpose or the friend had explicitly stated that no one else should eat it."
