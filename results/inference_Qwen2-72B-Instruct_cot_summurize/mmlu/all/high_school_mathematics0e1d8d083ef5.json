After finding the side length of the square, we can calculate its area.\n\nStep 1: Find the perimeter of the equilateral triangle.\nAn equilateral triangle has all sides equal in length. Given that each side is 8 units long, the perimeter \\(P\\) of the triangle is:\n\\[P = 3 \\times 8 = 24\\]\n\nStep 2: Determine the side length of the square.\nThe perimeter of a square is given by \\(P = 4s\\), where \\(s\\) is the side length of the square. Since the square has the same perimeter as the triangle (24 units), we have:\n\\[24 = 4s\\]\nSolving for \\(s\\):\n\\[s = \\frac{24}{4} = 6\\]\n\nStep 3: Calculate the area of the square.\nThe area \\(A\\) of a square is given by \\(A = s^2\\). Substituting the value of \\(s\\) we found:\n\\[A = 6^2 = 36\\]\n\nTherefore, the area of the square is 36 square units, which corresponds to option C."
