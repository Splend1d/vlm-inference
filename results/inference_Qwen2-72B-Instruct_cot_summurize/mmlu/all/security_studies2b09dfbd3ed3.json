'A nation is secure to the extent to which it is not in danger of having to sacrifice core values if it wishes to avoid war, and is able, if challenged, to maintain them by victory in such a war.' Lippman, W.\nB. 'Security itself is a relative freedom from war, coupled with a relatively high expectation that defeat will not be a consequence of any war that should occur.' Bellamy, M.\nC. 'Emancipation is the freeing of people (as individuals and groups) from the physical and human constraints which stop them carrying out what they would freely choose to do . . . Security and emancipation are two sides of the same coin. Emancipation, not power or order, produces true security. Emancipation, theoretically, is security.' Booth, K.\nD. None of the above\n"

                    "text": "The question asks for the best description of security in the contemporary world according to the field of Security Studies. All three definitions provided touch on important aspects of security as understood within this field, but they emphasize different dimensions.\n\nA. Lippman's definition focuses on the ability of a nation to protect its core values without being forced into war and, if war does occur, to maintain those values through victory. This definition has a strong emphasis on state-centric security and the use of military power.\n\nB. Bellamy's definition is similar to Lippman's but adds the element of relative freedom from war and the expectation of avoiding defeat. It still maintains a focus on the state and the potential outcomes of conflict.\n\nC. Booth's definition introduces a more human-centric approach to security, linking it to emancipation. This perspective argues that true security comes from freeing people from constraints that limit their choices and actions, suggesting that security and emancipation are interdependent.\n\nIn contemporary Security Studies, there has been a shift towards a broader understanding of security that includes non-military threats and emphasizes human security. While all three definitions have been influential, the most comprehensive view that encompasses current thinking in the field is likely C, which considers security as a condition that enables individuals and groups to pursue their goals freely without undue constraint.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that Security Studies is a diverse field, and scholars may differ in their priorities and emphases. Some might argue that a combination of elements from all three definitions provides the most robust understanding of security in the contemporary world. Nonetheless, for the purposes of answering the question based on the options provided, C is the closest to the contemporary understanding of security that includes both state and human security dimensions."
