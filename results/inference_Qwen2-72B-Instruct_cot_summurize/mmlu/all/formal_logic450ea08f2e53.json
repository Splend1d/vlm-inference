F \u2228 D\n3. ~E \u00b7 ~F\n\nStep 1: Assume all propositions are true.\n\nStep 2: Check for immediate contradictions.\n- Proposition 1 says D and E have the same truth value.\n- Proposition 3 says E and F are both false.\n\nIf we assume E is true (and thus D is true due to proposition 1), then proposition 3 would be violated since it requires E to be false. So, E cannot be true. Therefore, E must be false, and so must D (due to proposition 1).\n\nNow we have:\nD = False\nE = False\n\nStep 3: Try to find a consistent valuation.\n- Proposition 1 is satisfied since D and E have the same truth value (False).\n- Proposition 2 requires either F or D to be true. Since D is false, F must be true to satisfy this proposition.\n- Proposition 3 is also satisfied since E and F have opposite truth values (E is False, and F is True).\n\nSo, the consistent valuation is:\nD = False\nE = False\nF = True\n\nThis valuation does not match any of the options provided, but it shows that the set of propositions is consistent. However, among the given options, the closest one is:\n\nC. Consistent. Consistent valuation when D and E are true and F is false\n\nBut this is not correct based on our analysis. The correct answer based on our analysis would be something like:\n\nConsistent. Consistent valuation when D and E are false and F is true.\n\nUnfortunately, this option is not provided, but the conclusion is that the set of propositions is consistent."
