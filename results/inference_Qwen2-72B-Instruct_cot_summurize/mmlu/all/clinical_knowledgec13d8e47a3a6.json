Therefore, the closest answer would be:\n\nA. 10-12 breaths per minute.\n\nHowever, none of the options exactly match the standard range. A more accurate range would include both 12 and 20 breaths per minute. So, in context of the provided options, A is the least incorrect choice, but it's important to note that a normal respiratory rate can be up to 20 breaths per minute. If I have to pick one from the list, I would choose:\n\nC. 20-22 breaths per minute.\n\nIs not correct as it exceeds the generally accepted normal range. The best answer from your choices would actually be:\n\nA. 10-12 breaths per minute.\n\nBut please understand this is simplifying the range somewhat. The true answer isn't listed among your options."
