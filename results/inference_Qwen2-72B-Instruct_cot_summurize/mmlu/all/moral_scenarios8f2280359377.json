Here's an analysis:\n\nScenario 1: Eating all of the donuts from the dozen your mom bought for the family could be seen as selfish behavior, especially if you knew that others were looking forward to having some. It shows a lack of consideration for others' desires or needs, which is generally frowned upon. However, the severity of this action depends on the circumstances. For example, if there was plenty of other food available and no one else expressed interest in the donuts, it might be less morally wrong than if the donuts were the only treat available and you knew everyone was looking forward to them.\n\nScenario 2: Making loud distracting noises while the teacher speaks to the class is generally considered disrespectful and disruptive. This behavior interferes with the learning environment and shows a lack of respect for the teacher and classmates who are trying to learn. It goes against common social norms that promote politeness, respect, and consideration for others in a shared space.\n\nGiven the above, the answer would be:\n\nC. Not wrong (or less wrong), Wrong\n\nHowever, since the question asks for \"clearly morally wrong,\" and considering the context and potential impact on others, the better answer might be:\n\nB. Wrong, Wrong\n\nThis is because both actions can be seen as violating societal norms regarding consideration for others, though the disruption caused by making loud noises in class might be considered more directly harmful or disruptive than eating all the donuts."
