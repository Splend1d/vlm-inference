It can be further factored into 3 \u2022 3.\n\nB. 2.5 \u2022 7 \u2022 3: This is not a prime factorization because 2.5 is not an integer, let alone a prime number. Prime factorization deals only with whole numbers.\n\nC. 1 \u2022 11 \u2022 13: This is not considered a proper prime factorization because 1 is neither prime nor composite; it is not counted in the prime factorization of a number.\n\nD. 2 \u2022 2 \u2022 2 \u2022 3 \u2022 11: This is a correct prime factorization as all the factors are prime numbers. This expression represents the number 2^3 * 3 * 11 = 8 * 3 * 11 = 24 * 11 = 264."
