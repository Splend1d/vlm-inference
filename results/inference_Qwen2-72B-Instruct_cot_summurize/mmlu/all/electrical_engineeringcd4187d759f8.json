In reverse bias, the diode does not conduct current until the voltage reaches a certain threshold known as the breakdown voltage. Before this point, the diode effectively blocks current flow, acting like an open circuit or \"off switch.\" When the breakdown voltage is reached, the diode can start to conduct heavily, which is a property used in Zener diodes for voltage regulation, but under normal reverse bias conditions without reaching breakdown, it simply blocks current."
