Therefore, \\(f(x)\\) changes sign from negative to positive as \\(x\\) moves from 0 to 1. By the Intermediate Value Theorem, there exists at least one real solution to \\(f(x) = 0\\) in the interval \\((0, 1)\\).\n\nNow, we need to determine if there is more than one solution in \\([0, 1]\\) or any solution outside this interval.\n\nThe derivative of \\(f(x)\\) is \\(f'(x) = e^x + 1\\). This derivative is always positive for all real numbers \\(x\\), indicating that \\(f(x)\\) is strictly increasing everywhere. Since \\(f(x)\\) is strictly increasing, it can have at most one root in any interval.\n\nGiven that \\(f(x)\\) changes sign exactly once on \\([0, 1]\\) and does so monotonically, there is exactly one root in this interval, meaning \\(k = 1\\).\n\nFor \\(n\\), the number of real solutions not in \\([0, 1]\\), we consider the behavior of \\(f(x)\\) outside this interval. For \\(x < 0\\), note that \\(e^x\\) will be less than 1 but still positive, making \\(f(x) < 0\\) since \\(x - 2\\) will also contribute negatively. Hence, there are no roots for \\(x < 0\\).\n\nFor \\(x > 1\\), \\(f(x)\\) is strictly increasing and already positive at \\(x = 1\\), so it remains positive for all \\(x > 1\\). Thus, there are no additional real solutions outside of \\([0, 1]\\), implying \\(n = 0\\).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. \\(k = 1\\) and \\(n = 0\\)."
