Steel - This is not necessarily a bulk-gaining industry because steel, as a finished product, doesn't typically weigh more than its raw materials like iron ore and coke.\n\nB. Bottled orange juice - This can be considered a bulk-gaining industry because when you add water to concentrate and then bottle it, the final product (bottles filled with liquid) will weigh more than the concentrate and packaging materials alone.\n\nC. Paper - This could also be seen as a bulk-gaining industry because the process of making paper from wood pulp adds water which increases the weight of the final product.\n\nD. Copper - This is not a bulk-gaining industry because refining copper does not increase its weight.\n\nBetween B and C, bottled orange juice is often considered a clearer example of a bulk-gaining industry due to the significant addition of water during processing. Therefore, the best answer would be:\n\nB. Bottled orange juice"
