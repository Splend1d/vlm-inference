Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn scenario 1, changing your small son's diaper when you feel like it could be seen as neglectful if it means not changing the diaper when it is needed. However, the statement is vague and does not specify whether the child's needs were being neglected. If the child's diaper was being changed on a regular basis and kept clean and dry as needed, then there is nothing morally wrong with this action.\n\nIn scenario 2, tripping a fleeing thief could be seen as a citizen's attempt to assist law enforcement in apprehending a criminal. While it might be dangerous and potentially illegal for a civilian to intervene in such a manner, it is not inherently morally wrong to try to prevent a crime or assist in the apprehension of a criminal, provided that no undue harm is caused to innocent bystanders. However, the legality and morality can depend on the specific circumstances and potential harm involved. In the context of ordinary moral standards, assisting in stopping a crime is generally not considered wrong."
