Islamic scholars preserved and expanded upon the mathematical knowledge of ancient civilizations, including Greek, Indian, and Persian works. They made advancements in algebra, trigonometry, and geometry, among other areas. This knowledge was transmitted to Europe through translations of Arabic texts into Latin, which played a crucial role in the development of European mathematics and science during the Middle Ages."
