Psychological: From a psychological perspective, behaviors that cause significant distress to the individual or harm others could be considered abnormal. In the case of someone requiring a very specific stimulus (like touching a woman's shoe) to reach orgasm, if this requirement causes distress or interferes with their ability to have a healthy sexual relationship, it could be considered sexually abnormal or deviant.\n\nB. Sociological: Sociologically, what is considered normal or deviant behavior is largely determined by societal norms and expectations. If society generally does not accept or recognize sexual arousal from such stimuli as part of its norms, then such a behavior could be considered deviant.\n\nC. Statistical: Statistically, \"normal\" is often defined by what falls within the range of the majority of the population. If only a tiny percentage of people require touching a woman's shoe to achieve orgasm, then statistically, this behavior would be considered abnormal because it falls outside the norm.\n\nGiven these definitions, both B and C can apply to the scenario described:\n\n- B. Sociologically, if societal norms do not include this behavior as a part of acceptable sexual practices, it could be seen as deviant.\n- C. Statistically, since it is likely that a very small percentage of the population has this specific need, it would fall outside the statistical norm and thus could be considered abnormal.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer based on the given options would be D. b and c."
