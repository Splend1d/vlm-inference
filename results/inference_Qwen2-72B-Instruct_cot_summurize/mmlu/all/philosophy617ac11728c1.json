However, this simplification might not fully capture Bentham's complex theory of sanctions. In his philosophy, sanctions can be broadly categorized into four types: physical, political, moral, and religious. Moral sanctions, in particular, refer to the pleasures and pains that result from the approval or disapproval of others, which influence an individual's behavior due to their desire for a good reputation and social harmony. Yet, the option provided that most closely aligns with Bentham's view would be B, as it relates to structured consequences imposed by a governing body."
