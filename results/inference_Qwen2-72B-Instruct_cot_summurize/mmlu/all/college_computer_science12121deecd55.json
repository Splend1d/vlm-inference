Every vertex must have an even degree.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\n\nI. A complete graph with 12 vertices (K12)\nIn a complete graph, every vertex is connected to every other vertex. For K12, each vertex has a degree of 11 (since there are 11 other vertices). Since 11 is odd, this graph does not satisfy the second condition for having an Euler circuit.\n\nII. A complete graph with 13 vertices (K13)\nSimilarly, for K13, each vertex has a degree of 12 (since there are 12 other vertices). Since 12 is even, this graph satisfies both conditions for having an Euler circuit.\n\nIII. A tree with 13 vertices\nA tree is a connected graph with no cycles. In a tree, except for the leaves (vertices with degree 1), all other vertices have an even degree. However, since a tree with more than one vertex always has at least two leaves, it will always have vertices with odd degrees. Therefore, a tree cannot have an Euler circuit.\n\nThe answer is B.
