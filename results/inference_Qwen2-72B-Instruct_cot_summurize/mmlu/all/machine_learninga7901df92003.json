In a classification context, KDE can estimate the probability density function of each class in the feature space. By comparing these densities at the location of an unknown sample, one can predict the class of the sample based on which class has the highest density at that point.\n\nStatement 2: False. While it's true that there is a relationship between logistic regression and Gaussian Naive Bayes under certain conditions, such as when assuming equal covariance matrices for all classes, it does not imply a one-to-one correspondence between their parameters. Logistic regression models the log-odds of a binary outcome as a linear function of the input features, while Gaussian Naive Bayes models the likelihood of the data given the class under the assumption of Gaussian distributions for the features. Their parameterizations are different, although under specific assumptions (e.g., equal class priors and covariances), they can yield similar decision boundaries.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. True, False"
