Both A and C. \n\nn-3 (omega-3) and n-6 (omega-6) polyunsaturated fatty acids, as well as monounsaturated fatty acids, have been shown to have beneficial effects on plasma LDL cholesterol levels. Omega-3 fatty acids can help reduce triglyceride levels and may also lower LDL cholesterol in some cases. Monounsaturated fats can help raise HDL (\"good\") cholesterol levels while lowering LDL (\"bad\") cholesterol levels when they replace saturated fats in the diet.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the effects of omega-6 fatty acids on cholesterol levels are somewhat more complex. While they can be beneficial in moderation, excessive intake of omega-6s relative to omega-3s has been associated with inflammation and other health issues. The key is balance and replacing less healthy fats like saturated and trans fats with healthier fats like monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats."
