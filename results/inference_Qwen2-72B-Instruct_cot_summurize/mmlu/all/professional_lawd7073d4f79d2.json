The items were displayed on a variety of tables and shelves, which were easily accessible to the customers. While the woman was walking down one of the aisles, her attention became focused on a doll that was prominently exhibited on an overhead display shelf. When the woman approached the doll display, she reached up to grab the doll. As she did so, the woman failed to see a baseball lying on the floor. She tripped over the baseball and fell down, fracturing her hip. If the woman asserts a claim against the toy store for her injuries, will the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur apply on the issue of whether the toy store was negligent and responsible for the baseball being on the floor?\n\nA. Yes, because the woman was a business invitee on the premises of the toy store.\nB. Yes, because the toy store was in control of the premises at the time of the accident.\nC. No, because another customer may have caused the baseball to be on the floor.\nD. No, because the baseball was an intervening act that cuts off the toy store's liability.\n"

                    "text": "The doctrine of res ipsa loquitur (the thing speaks for itself) is a legal doctrine used in negligence cases to infer negligence from the very nature of an accident or injury in the absence of direct evidence on how any defendant behaved. In this case, the woman tripped over a baseball left on the floor of the toy store and sustained injuries. To determine if res ipsa loquitur applies, we need to consider the elements of this doctrine:\n\n1. The accident must be of a type that does not occur in the absence of someone\u2019s negligence.\n2. The instrumentality causing the harm must be under the exclusive control of the defendant.\n3. There must be no voluntary action or contribution on the part of the plaintiff.\n\nIn this scenario, the first element is likely met since it can be reasonably inferred that a baseball would not normally be left on the floor of a toy store without negligence. However, the second and third elements are more problematic.\n\nRegarding the second element, while the toy store has control over its premises, it is not necessarily true that they had exclusive control over the placement of the baseball. It could have been placed there by another customer, which would mean the store did not have exclusive control over the instrumentality causing harm. This fact alone makes the application of res ipsa loquitur questionable.\n\nAs for the third element, there is no indication that the woman voluntarily contributed to the accident, but the presence of the baseball on the floor due to another customer's actions could be seen as an intervening cause that might cut off the toy store's liability.\n\nGiven these considerations, the answer to the question is:\n\nC. No, because another customer may have caused the baseball to be on the floor.\n\nThis answer acknowledges that the presence of the baseball on the floor could have been due to the actions of a third party, which complicates the application of res ipsa loquitur. However, it is important to note that even if res ipsa loquitur does not apply, the woman may still have a negligence claim based on traditional principles of duty, breach, causation, and damages. The toy store may still be liable if it can be shown that they had notice of the hazard and failed to correct it or warn customers about it."
