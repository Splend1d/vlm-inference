                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the sinusoidal function that models the water level changes and then find its derivative to calculate the rate of change of the water level at noon.\n\nThe general form of a sinusoidal function is:\n\\[y = A \\sin(B(x - C)) + D\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\(A\\) is the amplitude (half the distance between the maximum and minimum values),\n- \\(B\\) determines the period (\\(B = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\text{period}}\\)),\n- \\(C\\) is the horizontal shift (phase shift), and\n- \\(D\\) is the vertical shift (average value).\n\nGiven:\n- High tide: 15 feet at 8 A.M.\n- Low tide: 3 feet at 2 P.M. (which is 6 hours after 8 A.M.)\n\nFirst, let's determine the amplitude (\\(A\\)):\n\\[A = \\frac{15 - 3}{2} = 6\\]\n\nNext, the period of the sinusoidal function is twice the time between high tide and low tide since the tide goes from high to low and then back up again. The period is \\(2 \\times 6 = 12\\) hours. Thus,\n\\[B = \\frac{2\\pi}{12} = \\frac{\\pi}{6}\\]\n\nThe vertical shift (\\(D\\)) is the average water level:\n\\[D = \\frac{15 + 3}{2} = 9\\]\n\nSince the high tide occurs at 8 A.M., and our function will be based on sine (which reaches its maximum value when \\(x = 0\\)), we need to adjust for this phase shift. Let's set \\(x = 0\\) at 8 A.M. for simplicity. This means the phase shift (\\(C\\)) is 0 because the high tide (maximum value) happens at \\(x = 0\\).\n\nSo, the function modeling the water level is:\n\\[y = 6 \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{6}(x)\\right) + 9\\]\n\nWe want to find the rate of change of the water level at noon (4 hours after 8 A.M.). To do this, we take the derivative of the function with respect to \\(x\\) (time in hours):\n\\[y' = 6 \\cdot \\frac{\\pi}{6} \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{6}x\\right) = \\pi \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{6}x\\right)\\]\n\nAt noon (\\(x = 4\\)):\n\\[y'(4) = \\pi \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{6} \\cdot 4\\right) = \\pi \\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{3}\\right)\\]\n\nUsing the cosine of \\(\\frac{2\\pi}{3}\\), which equals \\(-\\frac{1}{2}\\):\n\\[y'(4) = \\pi \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = -\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\]\n\nHowever, this result isn't listed in the options directly. The absolute value of the rate of change is \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\), but none of the options match exactly. It seems there might have been an oversight or a typo in the question or answer choices. The closest match to our calculation is:\n\nB. \u03c0\\(\\sqrt{3}\\)/2\n\nBut, given our calculations, the correct rate of change of the water level at noon should be \\(-\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\) feet per hour (indicating the water level is decreasing). None of the provided options perfectly matches this result. However, considering the context and the closest match among the provided options, B would be selected if one must choose, acknowledging the discrepancy."
