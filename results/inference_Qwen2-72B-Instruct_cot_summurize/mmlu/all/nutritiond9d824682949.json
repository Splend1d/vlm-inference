The prevalence of Eating Disorders (EDs) has not necessarily decreased over the last decades; in fact, some studies suggest an increase, possibly due to greater awareness and changes in diagnostic criteria.\n\nC. Binge Eating Disorder (BED) does not occur exclusively in obese subjects; it can affect individuals at any weight.\n\nD. While impulsivity can be a characteristic of individuals with Bulimia Nervosa (BN), it is not accurate to say that they predominantly have comorbid borderline personality disorder.
