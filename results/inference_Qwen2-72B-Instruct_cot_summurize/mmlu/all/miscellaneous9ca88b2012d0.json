Order of precedence\n\nRobert's Rules of Order establishes an order of precedence for motions, which determines the priority and importance of different types of motions. This ensures that more important motions are dealt with before less important ones. The order of precedence is as follows:\n\n1. Main Motion\n2. Privileged Motion\n3. Incidental Motion\n4. Subsidiary Motion\n5. Previous Question\n6. Motion to Adjourn\n\nWithin each category, there is a further hierarchy based on the motion's relative importance or urgency."
