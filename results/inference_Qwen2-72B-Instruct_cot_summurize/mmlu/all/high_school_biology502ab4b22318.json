RNA replication lacks the proofreading functions characteristic of DNA replication.\n\nRNA-dependent RNA polymerases, which are responsible for replicating RNA viruses, generally lack the proofreading (or exonuclease) activity that DNA polymerases possess. This means that mistakes made during RNA synthesis are less likely to be corrected, leading to a higher mutation rate. While some of the other options may also contribute to the higher mutation rates seen in RNA viruses, it is the lack of proofreading ability that is most directly responsible for this increased susceptibility to mutation."
