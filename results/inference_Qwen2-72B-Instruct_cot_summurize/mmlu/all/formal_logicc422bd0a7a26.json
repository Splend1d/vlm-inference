                    "text": "The correct answer is:\n\nD. Gba\n\nThis represents that \"Ben (b) greets (G) Alexis (a)\" but since the sentence says \"Alexis is greeted by Ben\", which means Alexis (a) is the receiver of the action, not the doer. So, we need to flip the direction, making it Gba, meaning Ben greets Alexis. However, the given options seem to be incorrectly structured for this context, as they should ideally represent \"Alexis is greeted by Ben\" as something like \"Gab\" if 'G' was intended to represent being greeted rather than greeting. But based on the provided symbolization key (Gxy: x greets y), option D is the closest match to the given sentence. \n\nHowever, if we strictly follow the given symbolization key (Gxy: x greets y), the correct representation for \"Alexis is greeted by Ben\" would actually be \"Gab\", which is not an option here. This discrepancy suggests either a misinterpretation of the question or an error in the options provided. Given the options and the symbolization key, the closest match is indeed \"Gba\". But please note that this does not perfectly align with standard predicate logic conventions based on the sentence and the given symbolization key."
