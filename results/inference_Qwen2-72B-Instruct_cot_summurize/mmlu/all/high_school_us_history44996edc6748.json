They spread and grow in the evil soil of poverty and strife. They reach their full growth when the hope of a people for a better life has died. We must keep that hope alive. . . . Great responsibilities have been placed upon us by the swift movement of events. . . . I am confident that the Congress will face these responsibilities squarely.\"\n\u2014President Harry S.

President Truman's statement is part of the context of the early Cold War era, where the United States was taking on a more active role in global politics to counteract the spread of communism and promote democratic values and economic stability. This excerpt from his speech reflects the belief that the U.S. had a responsibility to intervene in international matters to prevent the rise of totalitarian regimes, which he links to conditions of poverty and despair. This theme of U.S. interventionism and leadership in world affairs has been a continuous thread throughout American history, particularly since World War II."
