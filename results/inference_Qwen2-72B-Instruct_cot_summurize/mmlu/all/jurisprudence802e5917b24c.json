It implies that judges have no agency or responsibility to challenge or mitigate the effects of unjust laws, which counters the argument that judges should resign if they find the legal system fundamentally unjust. The other statements either support the idea of resignation or present reasons why resignation might not solve the problem but do not directly contradict the notion that judges should consider stepping down in response to systemic injustice."
