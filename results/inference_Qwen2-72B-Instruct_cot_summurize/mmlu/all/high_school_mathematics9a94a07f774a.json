                    "text": "To find the expected number of times Bob will roll his die in a non-leap year, we need to understand how many times he'll roll on average each day and then multiply by the number of days in a non-leap year.\n\nGiven that a six-sided die has numbers from 1 to 6, and excluding the number 1 (since he rolls again if he gets 1), we have five possible outcomes for each roll. Out of these five outcomes, four are distinct (2, 3, 4, 5, 6). The probability of rolling any specific number (including 1) is \\(\\frac{1}{6}\\).\n\nHowever, since Bob rolls again if he rolls a 1, we need to adjust our probabilities. The probability of not rolling a 1 on any given roll is \\(\\frac{5}{6}\\). This means that on average, Bob will roll the die \\(\\frac{6}{5}\\) times per day (because it takes an average of \\(\\frac{1}{\\frac{5}{6}} = \\frac{6}{5}\\) rolls to get one successful outcome, where success here is not rolling a 1).\n\nA non-leap year has 365 days. Therefore, over the course of a non-leap year, the expected number of times Bob will roll his die is:\n\\[365 \\times \\frac{6}{5} = 365 \\times 1.2 = 438\\]\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\nD. 438"
