The agent asked the addict to obtain heroin for him, but the addict refused. For several weeks the agent continued to plead with and beg the addict to get him drugs; finally, the addict gave in to the pressure and got the drugs. The police promptly arrested him. At trial, the defendant raised the defense of government entrapment. Will the trial court likely dismiss the case based on that argument?\n\nA. Yes, because this was entrapment in that the intent to commit the crime originated with the government.\nB. No, this was not entrapment because the addict was predisposed to want to obtain drugs due to his status as a drug user.\nC. No, this was not entrapment because the addict went voluntarily to get the drugs; he could have refused.\nD. Yes, this was entrapment because as soon as the agent asked a second time, he had established entrapment under the majority rule.\n"

                    "text": "The answer to this question is not straightforward and can depend on various factors and the jurisdiction's specific laws. However, I will provide an analysis based on general principles.\n\nIn the context of entrapment defenses, courts typically consider two main elements: (1) whether the government's conduct created a substantial risk that the crime would be committed by someone other than one ready to commit it, and (2) whether the defendant was predisposed to commit the crime before the government's intervention.\n\nIn this case, the government agent repeatedly asked the addict to obtain heroin, even after the addict initially refused. This could suggest that the government's conduct went beyond what might be considered reasonable persuasion and into coercion or inducement. The fact that the addict was a known heroin addict does not necessarily mean he was predisposed to commit the crime of selling drugs; being an addict does not inherently equate to being a dealer.\n\nThe key question for the court will be whether the addict was predisposed to dealing drugs before the government's intervention or if the government's actions induced him to commit a crime he otherwise would not have committed. If the court finds that the addict was not predisposed to dealing drugs and that the government's actions were the primary reason he committed the crime, then the defense of entrapment may be successful.\n\nGiven these considerations, options A and D suggest that the case will be dismissed based on entrapment, while options B and C suggest that it will not. Option D incorrectly assumes that asking a second time automatically establishes entrapment under the majority rule, which is not accurate. Most jurisdictions require a showing that the government's actions created a substantial risk that the crime would be committed by someone not predisposed to do so.\n\nTherefore, the most likely correct answer based on the information provided and the principles of entrapment law is:\n\nA. Yes, because this was entrapment in that the intent to commit the crime originated with the government.\n\nHowever, this is a complex legal issue, and the outcome would depend on the specific evidence presented at trial and the interpretation of the law by the presiding judge."
