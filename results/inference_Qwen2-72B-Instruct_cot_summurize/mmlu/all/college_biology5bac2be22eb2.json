                    "text": "The correct answer is B. The blastomere with the gray crescent will form a complete, but small, embryo.\n\nExplanation: In amphibians, the gray crescent is the region of the zygote where the future dorsal side of the embryo forms. It contains important signaling molecules that guide the development of the embryo. When the first cleavage plane is manipulated to segregate the gray crescent into one of the two blastomeres, this blastomere retains the ability to form a complete embryo because it has the necessary signals for proper development. However, since it starts with fewer cells than a normal embryo would at that stage, the resulting embryo will be smaller than usual. The blastomere without the gray crescent lacks these signals and will not develop into a complete embryo."
