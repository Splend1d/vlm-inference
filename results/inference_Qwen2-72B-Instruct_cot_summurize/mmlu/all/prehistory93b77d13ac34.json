This is an indication of the environmental conditions during the late Pleistocene or early Holocene period, when North America was still recovering from the last Ice Age. While caribou may have been part of the diet of the people living there, the evidence provided by their bones primarily indicates something about the climate rather than the specific dietary habits or health issues of those people. Importation of caribou from another region is unlikely given the time frame and technological capabilities of prehistoric peoples."
