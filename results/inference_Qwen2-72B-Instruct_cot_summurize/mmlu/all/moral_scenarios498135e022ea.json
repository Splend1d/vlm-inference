In Scenario 1, the action is simply smiling at a passerby, which is a friendly gesture. In Scenario 2, the actions described are routine personal hygiene activities followed by going outside, which are not morally wrong in themselves. The context might matter for Scenario 2 (for example, if the person was not properly dressed for public), but based on the information given, there is no indication of inappropriate attire or behavior."
