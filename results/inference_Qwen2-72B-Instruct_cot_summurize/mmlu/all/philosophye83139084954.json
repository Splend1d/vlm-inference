Rawls believes that under these conditions, rational individuals would choose principles of justice that secure basic liberties for all and ensure fair equality of opportunity. Utilitarianism, which aims to maximize overall happiness, could potentially lead to significant sacrifices by a minority for the greater good of the majority. This would be unacceptable from behind the veil of ignorance, as one might end up being part of the disadvantaged minority. Thus, the risk involved in adopting utilitarian principles would lead the parties to prefer principles that guarantee certain minimum rights and protections for everyone.\n\nAdditionally, C. it requires us to do unjust things, such as executing innocent people, can also be considered a reason why parties in the original position would reject utilitarianism. Utilitarianism could justify harmful actions if they result in a greater overall good, which conflicts with the protection of individual rights that Rawls deems essential. However, the primary concern is the risk associated with the potential for such injustices rather than the specific examples of what those injustices might be."
