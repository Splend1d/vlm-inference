Extraction of maximum value from nutrients\n\nAfter a meal, the most critical function of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract is to extract the maximum value from the nutrients consumed. This includes breaking down food into smaller components that can be absorbed by the body and used for energy, growth, and repair. The digestive process involves mechanical and chemical digestion, absorption of nutrients through the walls of the GI tract, and transportation of these nutrients to other parts of the body where they are needed.\n\nWhile all the functions listed (absorption and retention of water and electrolytes, elimination of toxins, and maintenance of barrier function) are essential for overall health and survival, immediately after a meal, the extraction of nutrients takes precedence as it directly impacts the body's ability to utilize the food for immediate energy and long-term health benefits."
