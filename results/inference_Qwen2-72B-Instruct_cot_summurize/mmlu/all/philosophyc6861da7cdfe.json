Instead, Butler argues that moral failings, such as injustice, arise from an imbalance or disorder in our affections and desires. He posits that humans have a natural moral faculty (conscience) that should govern their other desires and affections. When this faculty is weakened or overridden by stronger desires for external goods, ill-will toward others, or even self-hatred, injustice can result.\n\nHowever, if we must choose the closest answer based on Butler's philosophy, it would be:\n\nA. desires for external goods.\n\nButler suggests that when the desire for external goods (such as wealth, power, or status) becomes disproportionate to our concern for what is right and just, it leads to moral failure and injustice. This is because these desires can overpower our conscience and lead us to act against our moral principles."
