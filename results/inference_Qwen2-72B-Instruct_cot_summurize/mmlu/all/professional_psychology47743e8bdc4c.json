According to this model, a good fit occurs when a child's temperament is well-matched to the demands and expectations of their environment, leading to positive developmental outcomes. Conversely, a poor fit can result in maladjustment or behavioral problems. This model has been influential in understanding how individual differences in temperament interact with environmental factors to influence child development."
