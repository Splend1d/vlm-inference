Grant reprieves and pardons - This is correct. The President has the constitutional authority to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States, except in cases of impeachment.\n\nB. Appoint Supreme Court justices - This is incorrect. While the President nominates Supreme Court justices, they must be confirmed by the Senate before taking office.\n\nC. Negotiate and ratify treaties - This is partially correct but ultimately incorrect for the context of this question. The President can negotiate treaties, but they must be ratified by a two-thirds vote in the Senate.\n\nD. Declare war - This is incorrect. The power to declare war is constitutionally granted to Congress, not the President.\n\nTherefore, the action that the President can take without congressional approval from the given options is:\n\nA. Grant reprieves and pardons"
