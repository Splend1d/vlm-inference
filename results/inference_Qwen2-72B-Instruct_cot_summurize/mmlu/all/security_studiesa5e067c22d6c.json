Analysis of environmental security is understood as the integrity of the whole ecological system whose primary threat is human activity. However, it radically challenges security thinking in that it demands a shift in the reason for action from national security interest to the welfare of the entire social-ecological system of the planet.\nB. Environmental security contends that the principle threat to the ecological integrity is human activity and therefore humans can be secured to the extent that welfare is protected at the domestic level. The reason for action is to be found in individual and national interests.\nC. The crossover of common insecurity issue areas is unlikely because not all problems are truly global. Not all states are equally responsible for environmental problems, nor is there such a thing as equality of risk. Systemic interdependence is unlikely to manage those security areas.\nD. The ecological security and human security approaches to environmental security do not challenge the security community to consider alternative objects of security. Ecological security displays continuity with major interpretations of security, which typically centralize the security of the state.\n"

Environmental security challenges traditional security thinking by shifting the focus from national security interests to the welfare of the entire social-ecological system of the planet. This approach argues that the primary threat to ecological integrity is human activity, and securing humans requires protecting the environment.\n\nB. Another perspective on environmental security contends that the main threat to ecological integrity is indeed human activity, but the reason for action should be grounded in individual and national interests rather than a concern for the global ecosystem. This view suggests that security can be achieved by addressing domestic issues and protecting human welfare.\n\nC. Some argue that the crossover of common insecurity issue areas is unlikely because not all problems are truly global. They claim that not all states are equally responsible for environmental problems, nor is there such a thing as equality of risk. This perspective questions the assumption of systemic interdependence and its ability to manage various security areas effectively.\n\nD. Critics also suggest that ecological security and human security approaches to environmental security do not challenge the security community to consider alternative objects of security. They argue that ecological security displays continuity with major interpretations of security, which typically prioritize the security of the state over other concerns. This critique highlights the need for a more comprehensive and inclusive understanding of security that goes beyond state-centric perspectives."
