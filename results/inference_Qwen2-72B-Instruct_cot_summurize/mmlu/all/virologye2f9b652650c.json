Activists pushed for reforms in the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to speed up the approval process for new treatments, resulting in easier access to investigational drugs for people with AIDS. This activism also influenced the practice of medicine in the U.S., encouraging more patient-centered care and involving patients in decision-making processes regarding their treatment."
