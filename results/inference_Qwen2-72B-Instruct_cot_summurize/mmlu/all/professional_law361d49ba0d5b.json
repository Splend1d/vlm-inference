However, it cannot be used as substantive evidence because the witness was not questioned about it while on the stand, and therefore, the opposing counsel did not have the opportunity to cross-examine the witness regarding the discrepancies between the affidavit and the testimony. Additionally, the affidavit would generally be considered hearsay, but it can be admitted for the limited purpose of impeaching the witness's credibility."
