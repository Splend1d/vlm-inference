Adverbs typically modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs, and they often indicate the manner in which something is done. In this case, \"quickly\" can modify a verb to describe how an action is performed. For example: \"She moved quickly.\" The other options (hurried, fast, speedy) can function as adjectives describing a noun (e.g., a hurried person, a fast car, a speedy delivery). However, they can also be used as adverbs, but in their base form, they are more commonly recognized as adjectives. \"Quickly,\" on the other hand, is unambiguously an adverb."
