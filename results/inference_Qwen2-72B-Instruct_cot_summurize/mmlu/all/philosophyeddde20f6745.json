Covert observation\n\nCovert observation, where the researcher observes participants without their knowledge or consent, is most commonly associated with a lack of informed consent. This method raises ethical concerns because it violates individuals' rights to privacy and autonomy. Informed consent is a fundamental principle in research ethics that requires researchers to obtain voluntary consent from participants after providing them with all relevant information about the study's purpose, procedures, risks, benefits, and their rights."
