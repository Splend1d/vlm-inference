Operant conditioning involves learning through the consequences of behavior, such as reinforcement or punishment.\n\nHowever, if we have to choose the closest one, option C might be interpreted as operant conditioning if we assume that Rebecca canceled her credit card to avoid the annual fee (a negative consequence), which could be seen as negative reinforcement (removing an unpleasant stimulus to increase the likelihood of the behavior occurring again). But this interpretation assumes additional context not provided in the question.\n\nFor a more straightforward example of operant conditioning, consider:\n\n- A child receives a treat for cleaning their room (positive reinforcement).\n- A worker gets a pay deduction for consistently arriving late to work (punishment).\n- A dog learns to sit on command to receive a treat (positive reinforcement).\n- An employee stops coming in early after realizing they do not get acknowledged for it (negative reinforcement by removing an effort that was not being rewarded).\n\nIn these examples, the behavior is modified based on the consequences that follow."
