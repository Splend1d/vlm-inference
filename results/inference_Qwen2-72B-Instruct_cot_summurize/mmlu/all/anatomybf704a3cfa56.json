They will be unable to breathe without life support.\n\nDamage to the spinal cord at the level of the sixth cervical vertebra (C6) can result in significant impairment or loss of function below that level, including the muscles involved in respiration. The phrenic nerve, which innervates the diaphragm (the primary muscle used in breathing), originates from C3-C5, slightly above the level of injury. However, other respiratory muscles controlled by nerves lower down the spinal cord may also be affected, potentially leading to severe respiratory compromise. Therefore, a patient with this type of injury might require mechanical ventilation or other forms of life support to assist with breathing."
