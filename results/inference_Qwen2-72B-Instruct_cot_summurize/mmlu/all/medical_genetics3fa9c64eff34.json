Developmental epigenetics focuses on how environmental factors during development, including the prenatal period, can influence gene expression and potentially have long-lasting effects on health and behavior. However, it's worth noting that this research could also be seen as fitting into the broader category of \"social epigenetics,\" which examines how social and environmental factors impact gene expression and health across generations (Option B). Nonetheless, the most direct label for this specific area of research would be developmental epigenetics."
