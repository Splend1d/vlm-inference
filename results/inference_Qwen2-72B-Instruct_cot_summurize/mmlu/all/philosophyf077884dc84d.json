According to Ross's ethical theory, we gain an intuitive awareness of the rightness or wrongness of certain actions in specific situations. From these particular judgments, we can then abstract and formulate more general moral principles or duties. This process is akin to the way we might recognize patterns in nature before formulating scientific laws. Ross believed that some of these duties are self-evident to reflective individuals when they consider particular cases."
