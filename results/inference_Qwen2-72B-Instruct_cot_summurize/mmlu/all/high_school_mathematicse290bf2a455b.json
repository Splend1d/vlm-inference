This means that the denominator cannot be zero and that the expression under the square root must be non-negative.\n\nFirst, let's find where the expression under the square root, \\(x^2-3x-4\\), is greater than zero because the square root of a negative number is not real. The expression can be factored as follows:\n\n\\[x^2-3x-4 = (x-4)(x+1)\\]\n\nThis quadratic equation equals zero when \\(x=4\\) or \\(x=-1\\). These points divide the number line into three intervals: \\((-\u221e, -1)\\), \\((-1, 4)\\), and \\((4, \u221e)\\).\n\nNext, we test each interval to see where the expression \\(x^2-3x-4\\) is positive:\n\n1. For \\(x < -1\\), choose \\(x = -2\\):\n   \\[(-2)^2 - 3(-2) - 4 = 4 + 6 - 4 = 6 > 0\\]\n\n2. For \\(-1 < x < 4\\), choose \\(x = 0\\):\n   \\[(0)^2 - 3(0) - 4 = -4 < 0\\]\n\n3. For \\(x > 4\\), choose \\(x = 5\\):\n   \\[(5)^2 - 3(5) - 4 = 25 - 15 - 4 = 6 > 0\\]\n\nTherefore, the expression under the square root is positive in the intervals \\((-\u221e, -1)\\) and \\((4, \u221e)\\).\n\nHowever, since the denominator cannot be zero, we also have to exclude the points where the expression under the square root is zero, i.e., \\(x = -1\\) and \\(x = 4\\). But these points are already excluded from the intervals identified above.\n\nSo, the domain of the function \\(f(x)\\) is the union of the intervals where the expression under the square root is positive, which is:\n\n\\[(-\u221e, -1) \\cup (4, \u221e)\\]\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\nC. \\((-\u221e, -1) \\cup (4, \u221e)\\)"
