Therefore, the sum of 711 and 497 would be closest to the range:\n\nD. 1,050 and 1,300\n\nThis estimation method provides a quick way to determine which range the actual sum will fall into without needing to perform the exact calculation. However, the actual sum (1208) confirms that it indeed falls within this estimated range."
