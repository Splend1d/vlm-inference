I have read\u2026the last will and testament of the Lord Jesus over many times, and yet I cannot find by one tittle of that testament that if He had been pleased to have accepted of a temporal crown and government that ever He would have put forth the least finger of temporal or civil power in the matters of His spiritual affairs and Kingdom. Hence must it lamentably be against the testimony of Christ Jesus for the civil state to impose upon the souls of the people a religion, a worship, a ministry, oaths (in religious and civil affairs), tithes, times, days, marryings, and buryings in holy ground\u2026\"\nRoger Williams, The Hireling Ministry None of Christ's, 1652\nWhich of the following documents encouraged church membership in the Massachusetts Bay Colony?\n\nA.

The Cambridge Agreement\n\nThe Cambridge Agreement was an agreement made in 1629 by the Puritans who founded the Massachusetts Bay Colony. It provided for the establishment of a \"godly\" community, and church membership was required for full participation in the colony's governance. This agreement led to the founding of the Massachusetts Bay Colony as a haven for Puritans seeking to establish a society based on their religious beliefs. \n\nThe quote from Roger Williams, however, expresses a different view, advocating for the separation of church and state, which was a radical idea at the time. Williams believed that civil authorities should not have any say in spiritual matters, a concept that later influenced the development of religious freedom in the United States."
