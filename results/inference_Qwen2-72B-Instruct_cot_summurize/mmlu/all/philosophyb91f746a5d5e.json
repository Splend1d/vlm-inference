He believed that human existence is filled with suffering and that desire is the root cause of this suffering. According to Schopenhauer, life is a constant cycle of unfulfilled desires leading to dissatisfaction and suffering. He argued that the only way to escape this cycle is through the denial of one's own will, which can be achieved through artistic contemplation, asceticism, or compassion. Therefore, option C best represents Schopenhauer's attitude toward life."
