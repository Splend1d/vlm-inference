The commonly recognized layers are Societal Culture, Organizational Culture, and Subculture (which can include teams, departments, etc.). In this context, \"Business\" and \"Company\" aren't typically considered distinct layers of cultural influence but rather encompassing terms that could include elements of societal and organizational culture. However, since we have to choose one option that is not a layer of cultural influence from the given choices, \"D. Company\" would be the closest answer, as it is not typically listed as a separate layer in models of cultural influence.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\nD. Company"
