While Europe certainly has environmental issues, such as climate change and pollution, it cannot be said that there is apathy towards these problems. In fact, many European countries have been at the forefront of efforts to address environmental concerns and promote sustainability. The other options you provided (rising immigration, lack of population growth, and urban ethnic ghettos on the rise) are all significant challenges that Europe is currently facing. However, it's worth noting that these issues are complex and multifaceted, and there is no simple solution to any of them."
