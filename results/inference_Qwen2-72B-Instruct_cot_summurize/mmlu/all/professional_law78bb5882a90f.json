The dealer lived approximately two miles from the theater. After picking up the marijuana, the classmate then drove to the concert. As he was driving to the concert, the classmate smoked two marijuana cigarettes so that he could be \"high\" for the show. While the car was parked outside the theater, through no fault of the classmate, it was struck by another car and damaged. Repairs will cost $750. The driver of the vehicle that struck the student's car fled the scene and cannot be identified. If the student asserts a claim against the classmate for the damage to the student's car, the plaintiff will recover\n\nA. the value of the car before it was damaged because the car was damaged while under the classmate's dominion and control.\nB. the value of the car before it was damaged because the classmate used the car for a purpose other than that for which it was lent.\nC. the cost of repairing the car because the car was damaged while under the classmate's dominion and control.\nD. nothing, because the classmate was not negligent in causing the car's damage.\n"

In this case, the student lent his car to his classmate, who had dominion and control over the car during the time it was damaged. Therefore, the classmate is responsible for the repair costs. The fact that the classmate used the car for an unauthorized purpose (buying marijuana) does not change the fact that the car was under his control when it was damaged. The student can recover the cost of repairing the car from the classmate."
