In scenario 2, packing a knife in one's backpack could be seen as morally questionable depending on the intent, but without additional context, it's not clear if the action is intended for harm or self-defense, and whether it violates school policy or law. However, given that carrying a knife to school is typically against school rules and could potentially endanger others, this action might be considered wrong according to ordinary moral standards and legal guidelines in schools. Therefore, a more accurate response considering societal norms and school policies would be:\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nBut based on the original question's options and assuming we are strictly evaluating according to ordinary moral standards without consideration of specific laws or policies, the initial answer is D. Not wrong, Not wrong."
