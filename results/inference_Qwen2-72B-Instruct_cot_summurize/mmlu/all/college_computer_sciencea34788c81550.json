Worst-case search time is logarithmic in the number of nodes: This statement is true because in a height-balanced binary search tree (AVL tree), the tree is balanced, which means that the depth of the tree is kept as small as possible. Therefore, the worst-case search time is O(log n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree.\n- II. Average-case search time is logarithmic in the number of nodes: This statement is also true. Since the tree is balanced, the average-case search time will also be O(log n).\n- III. Best-case search time is proportional to the height of the tree: This statement is true but not very informative since the best-case scenario would occur when the search key is found at the root of the tree, resulting in a search time of O(1). However, the height of the tree does determine the maximum depth that may need to be searched, so the statement is technically correct.\n- IV. The height of the tree is logarithmic in the number of nodes: This statement is true because in a height-balanced binary search tree, the height of the tree is guaranteed to be O(log n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. This is due to the balancing property of the tree."
