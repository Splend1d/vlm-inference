Testimony of a surprise witness to the accident when the court is willing to grant the trucking company a continuance to prepare for cross-examination.\n\nOption A is likely to be excluded under Federal Rules of Evidence 407, which prohibits the admission of evidence regarding subsequent remedial measures to prove negligence or culpable conduct in connection with the event.\nOption B is likely to be excluded under Federal Rules of Evidence 403, which allows courts to exclude relevant evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury.\nOption C is likely to be excluded because the testimony from the plaintiff's boss would be cumulative to the already admitted payroll records that show the plaintiff's lost wages.\nOption D is most likely to be admitted since the court is willing to grant the trucking company a continuance to prepare for cross-examination, which would allow them to adequately respond to the surprise witness's testimony."
