The smaller the molar mass, the faster the molecules move on average, because the denominator in the formula above is smaller.\n\nHere are the approximate molar masses of the gases in question:\n- Hydrogen (\\(H_2\\)): 2 g/mol (since hydrogen has an atomic mass of about 1 g/mol and it's diatomic)\n- Oxygen (\\(O_2\\)): 32 g/mol (oxygen has an atomic mass of about 16 g/mol and it's diatomic)\n- Nitrogen (\\(N_2\\)): 28 g/mol (nitrogen has an atomic mass of about 14 g/mol and it's diatomic)\n\nGiven these values, hydrogen has the smallest molar mass and thus its molecules would have the highest average speed at a given temperature.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. hydrogen"
