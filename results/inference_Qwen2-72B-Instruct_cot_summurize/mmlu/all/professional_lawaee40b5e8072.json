It authorizes the president of either country to issue a proclamation nullifying any state or local laws in that country that have the effect of impeding imports from the other country. The foreign country uses the metric system of measurement, and thus all goods produced there and exported to the United States are packaged in metric sizes, such as liters and kilograms. A law of a state in the United States requires all goods sold in that state to be packaged in traditional American sizes, such as quarts or pounds. Because the state law substantially impedes imports from the foreign country, the President of the United States has issued a proclamation nullifying the state law pursuant to the treaty. Is the President's proclamation valid?\n\nA. No, because the Constitution vests in Congress the exclusive authority to specify binding legal standards for weights and measures, and the President therefore lacks constitutional authority for the proclamation.\nB. No, because the principles of federalism embedded in the Constitution prohibit the President from taking action to invalidate a state law.\nC. Yes, because it is authorized by a valid treaty of the United States and is not prohibited by any provision of the Constitution and, therefore, is the supreme law of the land.\nD. Yes, because the President has inherent authority to nullify any state law that substantially impedes commerce between substantially impedes commerce between the United States and another country.\n"

Yes, because it is authorized by a valid treaty of the United States and is not prohibited by any provision of the Constitution and, therefore, is the supreme law of the land.\n\nUnder Article VI of the U.S. Constitution, treaties made under the authority of the United States are considered the supreme law of the land. This means that when there is a conflict between a state law and a valid treaty, the treaty prevails. In this case, the treaty authorizes the President to issue a proclamation nullifying state laws that impede trade with the foreign country. Since the state law requiring traditional American sizes for packaging impedes imports from the foreign country, which uses the metric system, the President's proclamation is valid under the supremacy clause of the Constitution. The President's authority to issue such a proclamation is derived from the treaty, which is a valid exercise of congressional power under the Treaty Clause of the Constitution (Article II, Section 2). Therefore, the President's proclamation is valid as long as the treaty itself is constitutional."
