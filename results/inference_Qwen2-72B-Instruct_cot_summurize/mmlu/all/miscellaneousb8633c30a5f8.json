The time between high tides is known as the tidal cycle, which is determined by the position of the moon and its gravitational pull on the Earth's oceans. On average, it takes about 12 hours and 25 minutes for the Earth to rotate relative to the moon, causing the water levels to rise and fall twice per day. This is known as a semi-diurnal tide. However, in some locations, the tidal cycle can be closer to 24 hours due to the influence of other factors such as the coastline shape and ocean currents. These areas experience a diurnal tide with only one high and one low tide per day."
