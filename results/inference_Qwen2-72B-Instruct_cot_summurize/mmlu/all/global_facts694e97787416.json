Depression: According to NIMH, in 2020, women were nearly twice as likely as men to experience depression. This gender difference has been consistently observed across different age groups and cultural backgrounds.\n\n2. Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD): The prevalence of AUD is higher among men than women. According to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), in 2020, about 15.9 million adults aged 18 or older had AUD, with rates significantly higher among men (8.4%) than women (4.2%).\n\nIt's important to note that these statistics can vary based on various factors such as age, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and cultural background, but overall, the pattern described in option D holds true."
