So for the second stone:\n- He walks 5 feet to place the stone (3 + 2).\n- Then he walks 5 feet back to the crate.\nTotal distance for the second stone = 5 + 5 = 10 feet.\n\nThe pattern for the distance increases by 4 feet with each stone placed (since he walks an additional 2 feet out and 2 feet back).\n\nLet's calculate the total distance walked after placing the 50th stone:\n\nWe have an arithmetic series where:\n- The first term \\(a_1\\) is 6 feet (the distance walked for the first stone).\n- The common difference \\(d\\) is 4 feet.\n- The number of terms \\(n\\) is 50 (since he places 50 stones).\n\nThe formula for the sum \\(S_n\\) of the first \\(n\\) terms of an arithmetic series is:\n\\[S_n = \\frac{n}{2} [2a_1 + (n - 1)d]\\]\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\\[S_{50} = \\frac{50}{2} [2 \\times 6 + (50 - 1) \\times 4]\\]\n\\[= 25 [12 + 49 \\times 4]\\]\n\\[= 25 [12 + 196]\\]\n\\[= 25 \\times 208\\]\n\\[= 5200\\]\n\nTherefore, after placing the 50th stone and returning to the crate, the total distance Alex walked is 5200 feet.\n\nCorrect answer: C. 5200"
