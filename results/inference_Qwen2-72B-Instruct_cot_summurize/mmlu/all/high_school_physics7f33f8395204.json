The normal force acts perpendicular to the surface of the road and has a component directed towards the center of the circle (due to the banking of the road). The friction force also contributes to this inward force if the car is not traveling at the ideal speed for which the curve is designed, or if the road surface is not perfectly smooth.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. a combination of the normal force and the friction force"
