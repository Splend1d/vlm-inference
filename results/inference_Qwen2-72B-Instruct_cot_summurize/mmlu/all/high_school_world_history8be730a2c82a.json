Take this winter:\nThe Shanxi troops were never sent home.\nThe District Officers are demanding the land tax,\nBut where will it come from? You can't get blood from a stone!\nI honestly think it's bad luck to bear a son now,\nIt's better to have a daughter: at least she can marry\nAnd live with the neighbors next door.\nBut a son will end up lying on some distant prairie.\"\nDu Fu, \"Ballad of the Army Carts,\" ca. 750 C.E.\nBased on the poem and your knowledge of history, Tang relations with western nomadic peoples and frontier peoples relied on which of the following?\n\nA. Adroit diplomacy and establishment of client relationships with bordering nomads\nB. The ability of the Tang emperor to project military power on the frontier in order to impose his will\nC. The permanent settlement of Han Chinese in frontier zones\nD. The payment of tribute to nomadic rulers\n"

                    "text": "Based on the poem \"Ballad of the Army Carts\" by Du Fu, written around 750 CE, Tang relations with western nomadic peoples and frontier peoples seem to rely heavily on the projection of military power (option B). The poem speaks of soldiers being sent to the Yellow River and garrisons in the west, indicating military campaigns and the maintenance of a significant military presence on the frontier. It also mentions the Martial Emperor's territorial ambitions, suggesting that the expansion and control of territory were key aspects of Tang policy towards the west.\n\nAdditionally, the poem touches upon the hardships faced by soldiers and their families due to these military demands, including the conscription of young men and the neglect of agricultural duties at home. This further supports the idea that the Tang dynasty's approach to managing its borders involved extensive military engagement rather than diplomatic means or permanent settlement of Han Chinese in frontier zones (options A and C). There is no mention of tribute payments to nomadic rulers (option D) in the context provided by the poem. Therefore, option B appears to be the most accurate based on the information given."
