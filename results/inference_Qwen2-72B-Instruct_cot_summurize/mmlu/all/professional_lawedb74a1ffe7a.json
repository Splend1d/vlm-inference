The state charged that selling the video violated its anti-obscenity law. The store owner defended on the ground that the prosecution violated his constitutional right to freedom of speech. Should the store owner prevail in this defense?\n\nA. No, because the store owner is engaged in the commercial sale of the video, which is not protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\nB. No, because the video consists entirely of portrayals of nudity, appeals to the prurient interest of viewers, and lacks serious social value as a whole.\nC. Yes, because mere portrayals of nudity are insufficient to justify a finding that the video is obscene as a matter of constitutional law.\nD. Yes, because the portrayals of nudity occurred outside the United States, and therefore the state lacks a compelling interest in applying its anti-obscenity law to the sale of the video.\n"

Yes, because mere portrayals of nudity are insufficient to justify a finding that the video is obscene as a matter of constitutional law.\n\nThe Supreme Court has established a three-part test for determining whether material is obscene and therefore not protected by the First Amendment. This is known as the Miller test, named after the 1973 case Miller v. California. Under this test, material is considered obscene if:\n1. The average person, applying contemporary community standards, would find that the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest;\n2. The work depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined by applicable state law; and\n3. The work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.\n\nIn the scenario described, the video consists entirely of pictures of nude sunbathers on a beach, which may not necessarily appeal to the prurient interest (lustful thoughts) and may have some artistic or documentary value. Moreover, since the video does not depict any sexual conduct, it may not meet the second part of the Miller test. Therefore, based on the information provided, it appears that the video may not be obscene under the constitutional standard, and the store owner's defense based on freedom of speech could potentially succeed. However, the final determination would depend on the specific application of the Miller test by the courts considering the case."
