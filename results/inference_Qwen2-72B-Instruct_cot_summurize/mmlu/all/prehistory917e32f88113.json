The presence of primary and secondary refuse: Pedestrian surveys are useful for identifying sites where past human activities have left behind refuse, whether in its original location (primary) or moved from its original context (secondary). This refuse can include artifacts, ecofacts, and other materials that provide insights into past human behavior.\n\nB. Naturally exposed layers in which to search for artifacts, ecofacts, or bone: Surveys are often conducted in areas where natural processes have exposed archaeological deposits, making them visible on the surface. These layers can contain a variety of materials that are important for understanding the history and prehistory of an area.\n\nC. Associations that can be established between artifacts, ecofacts, and bone: Pedestrian surveys allow researchers to collect and analyze these different types of materials in their spatial context. Establishing associations between artifacts, ecofacts, and bone can help reconstruct past environments, diets, tool-making techniques, and other aspects of human life.\n\nD. The existence of a cache or collection of artifacts: Caches, which are concentrated collections of artifacts that were intentionally stored by past peoples, can be particularly informative. Finding such caches during a pedestrian survey can provide valuable insights into resource procurement strategies, trade networks, and other cultural practices.\n\nIn summary, pedestrian surveys are useful when there is a potential for finding any of these elements, as they contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the archaeological record."
