However, the question seems to be focusing on how this impacts his demand curve rather than directly linking utility to price.\n\nIn standard economic theory, a consumer's demand curve shows the quantity of a good that a consumer is willing and able to purchase at various prices. A constant increase in total utility as more units are consumed does not directly tell us about the shape of the demand curve because the demand curve is derived from the marginal utility curve, not the total utility curve. The demand curve reflects the relationship between price and quantity demanded.\n\nHowever, if we assume that Matt\u2019s willingness to pay for each additional bratwurst remains constant due to constant increases in total utility (which is not realistic but serves the purpose of the hypothetical scenario), then his demand for bratwurst would not change with price, which would suggest a vertical demand curve. This means that no matter the price, Matt would buy the same amount of bratwurst because his marginal utility (and thus willingness to pay) does not decrease with consumption.\n\nYet, this interpretation might not align with standard economic theory since it implies an unrealistic scenario where Matt\u2019s demand is perfectly inelastic, meaning it does not respond to price changes at all. In reality, as prices increase, most consumers would buy less, leading to a downward-sloping demand curve.\n\nGiven the options provided:\n\nA. Vertical - This would suggest Matt\u2019s demand is perfectly inelastic, which could theoretically result from constant increases in total utility, but this is not a typical or realistic scenario.\n\nB. Horizontal - This would suggest Matt\u2019s demand is perfectly elastic, meaning he would only buy bratwurst at one specific price and none at any other price, which doesn\u2019t fit the scenario described.\n\nC. Downward sloping - This is the typical shape of a demand curve, reflecting the law of demand where lower prices lead to higher quantities demanded.\n\nD. Upward sloping - This would be counterintuitive and rare, suggesting that Matt would buy more as prices rise, which goes against the law of demand.\n\nGiven the scenario described, the closest answer that fits the description would be:\n\n**A. Vertical** - Assuming a literal interpretation of the question and that Matt\u2019s demand for bratwurst does not change with price due to constant increases in total utility, although this is not a realistic demand behavior according to standard economic theory."
