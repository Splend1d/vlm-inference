Secondary succession would begin to occur.\n\nAfter a fire in a forest, secondary succession is the process that leads to the re-establishment of plant and animal communities in the affected area. This process begins with pioneer species, such as grasses, ferns, and shrubs, that can tolerate harsh conditions and colonize disturbed areas. Over time, these species are replaced by others that require more stable environments, eventually leading to the return of tree species like fir, birch, and white spruce."
