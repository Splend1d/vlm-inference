Partial reinforcement\n\nPartial or intermittent reinforcement schedules typically produce more persistent behaviors that are more resistant to extinction compared to continuous reinforcement. This is because partial reinforcement requires the subject to continue performing the behavior without guaranteed reinforcement, leading to a stronger association with the behavior and reward."
