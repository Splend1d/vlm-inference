This belief system dates back to the 15th century when Guru Jambheshwar laid down 29 principles to be followed by his followers, which included the protection of trees and wildlife. The most famous example of this is the Chipko movement, where Bishnoi villagers hugged trees to prevent them from being cut down by loggers."
