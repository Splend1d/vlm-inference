However, if we must identify one that is not explicitly mentioned as a primary marketing function, option A \"Promote marketing intelligence\" could be interpreted as more of an internal process rather than a direct marketing function.\n\nMarketing intelligence is crucial for making informed decisions and developing strategies, but promoting it (in the sense of actively advertising or selling the concept of marketing intelligence) is not typically seen as a direct marketing function. Instead, gathering, analyzing, and utilizing marketing intelligence to inform strategy development and execution is what falls under the scope of marketing activities.\n\nThe other options are clearly identified as core marketing functions:\n\nB. Develop sales tactics: This involves creating strategies and plans to sell products or services, which is a direct marketing function.\n\nC. Develop the customer proposition: This refers to defining what value your product or service offers to customers, which is central to marketing.\n\nD. Work with other business functions and third parties: Marketing often collaborates with various internal departments (like product development, finance, and operations) and external partners (like distributors, advertisers, and suppliers) to ensure the success of marketing campaigns and initiatives.\n\nTherefore, based on the question's context, the answer would be:\n\nA. Promote marketing intelligence."
