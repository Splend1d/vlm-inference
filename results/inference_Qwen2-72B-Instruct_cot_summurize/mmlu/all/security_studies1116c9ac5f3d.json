Acceptance that there can be no absolute security, instead design resilient IT systems and build international cooperation and information exchange in order to reduce threat and increase resilience.\n\nThis option recognizes the reality that complete eradication of cyber threats is not feasible due to the ever-evolving nature of these threats and the vulnerabilities inherent in complex IT systems. It emphasizes the importance of designing resilient systems that can withstand attacks, recover quickly, and continue functioning even under adverse conditions. Additionally, it highlights the need for international cooperation and information exchange, which are crucial for sharing intelligence about new threats, coordinating responses, and developing best practices for cybersecurity."
