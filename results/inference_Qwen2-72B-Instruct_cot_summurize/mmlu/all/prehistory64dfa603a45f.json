Obsidian tools have indeed been found at sites in both regions. Obsidian is a volcanic glass that was highly valued for its sharpness and was used to make tools and weapons. The obsidian found in the Indus Valley has been traced to sources in Anatolia (modern-day Turkey), which suggests long-distance trade connections.\n\nB. Glass beads, copper, and gold from Mesopotamia have been found at Harappan sites in the Indus Valley. These materials were not locally available in the Indus region but were abundant in Mesopotamia, indicating that they were traded over long distances.\n\nC. Harappan seals have been found in Mesopotamia, and Mesopotamian cylinder seals have been found in the Indus Valley. Seals were used as a means of identification and authority, and their presence in foreign lands indicates direct contact and exchange between the two civilizations. The Harappan seals found in Mesopotamia suggest that goods from the Indus Valley were being traded there, while the Mesopotamian cylinder seals found in the Indus Valley indicate the reverse.\n\nThese findings provide strong evidence for the existence of trade networks connecting the Indus Valley civilization with ancient Mesopotamia during the Bronze Age."
