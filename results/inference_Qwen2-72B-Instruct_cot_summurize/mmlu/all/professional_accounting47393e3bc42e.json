The straight-line method and the effective interest method are two methods for amortizing bond premiums. However, the straight-line method can only be used if it does not differ materially from the effective interest method.\n\nIf Dean Co. incorrectly used the straight-line method instead of the effective interest method to amortize the premium, this would result in less interest expense being recognized each period compared to the effective interest method. This would cause the bond carrying amount to be overstated at the end of the bond's life because the total amount of premium amortization recognized would be less than it should have been under the effective interest method.\n\nFurthermore, since less interest expense was recognized each period, retained earnings would be understated at the end of the bond's life because the lower interest expense resulted in higher net income and therefore higher retained earnings than would have been the case under the effective interest method."
