The vacation expense would be the amount of vacation pay that was actually taken by the employees.\nFor the first employee, who earns $600 per week and took a two-week vacation, the vacation expense would be $1200 (2 weeks * $600 per week). For the second employee, who earns $800 per week and took no vacation, there would be no vacation expense.\nHowever, the second employee still has two weeks of vacation time that they have earned but not taken, so this would be included in the vacation liability. The vacation liability for the second employee would be $1600 (2 weeks * $800 per week).\nTherefore, in its year-end financial statements, Elan Co. should report a vacation liability of $1600 and a vacation expense of $1200. So the correct answer would be A. $1600 $1200."
