The mutation causes a \"shift\" in the reading frame of the genetic message.\n\nLet's analyze each option given:\n\nA. CAT HAS HIS \u2192 CAT HAS HIT\n\nThis change doesn't alter the reading frame; it just replaces one codon with another (assuming we're dealing with a three-letter genetic code for simplicity). This would be a point mutation, not a frameshift mutation.\n\nB. CAT HAS HIS \u2192 CAT HSH ISA\n\nThis change introduces an extra letter (\"S\") into the sequence. This extra letter shifts the reading frame from that point on, so every subsequent triplet of letters will code for a different amino acid than before. This is a frameshift mutation.\n\nC. CAT HAS HIS \u2192 CAT HIS HAT\n\nThis change involves the removal of a letter (\"A\"), which also shifts the reading frame from that point on, changing all subsequent triplets and thus altering the amino acid sequence. This is also a frameshift mutation.\n\nD. CAT HAS HIS \u2192 CAT WAS HIT\n\nThis change doesn't alter the reading frame; it just replaces one codon with another, similar to option A. It would be a point mutation, not a frameshift mutation.\n\nGiven the options provided, both B and C represent frameshift mutations because they involve the insertion or deletion of nucleotides, which alters the reading frame of the genetic message. However, since you asked for a single answer, and assuming there can only be one correct choice, option B is a clear example of a frameshift mutation due to the insertion of an additional nucleotide."
