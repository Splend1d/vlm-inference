Synthesis of ATP\n\nWhen electrons flow cyclically through the electron transport chain associated with photosystem I, it leads to the synthesis of ATP through a process known as cyclic photophosphorylation. This process does not involve the reduction of NADP+ to NADPH, release of O2, or the reduction of CO2 to sugar, which are associated with other parts of the photosynthetic process."
