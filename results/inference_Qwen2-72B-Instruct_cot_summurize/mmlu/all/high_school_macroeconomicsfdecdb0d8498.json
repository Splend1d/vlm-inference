A strong dollar makes U.S. exports more expensive for foreign buyers, which can lead to a decrease in export demand and thus negatively affect U.S. real GDP.\n\nA. Removing tariffs and quotas would generally be expected to increase trade and economic activity, potentially boosting real GDP.\n\nB. High investment in human capital is typically associated with long-term growth and an increase in real GDP as it leads to a more skilled workforce.\n\nC. Increasing the money supply can have various effects on the economy, but if done prudently, it can stimulate economic activity and potentially increase real GDP. However, if done excessively, it can lead to inflation, which could negatively impact real GDP in the long run. But this option is not the most direct cause of a fall in real GDP compared to option D."
