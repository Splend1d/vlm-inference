Under international law, the conduct of any state organ shall be considered an act of that state, regardless of whether the conduct was authorized or ultra vires (beyond the powers or authority). This principle is established in the International Law Commission's Articles on State Responsibility. It means that a state is responsible for the actions of all its organs, including the legislative, executive, and judicial branches, as well as administrative agencies and local governments. This principle applies regardless of whether the act was committed within or outside the territory of the state, and whether it was lawful or unlawful under domestic law."
