He grounded this principle in utilitarianism, a consequentialist ethical theory that evaluates the morality of actions based on their outcomes or consequences. According to utilitarianism, an action is morally right if it maximizes happiness or pleasure and minimizes pain or suffering for the greatest number of people.\n\nMill's harm principle states that the only reason for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others. This principle is designed to protect individual liberty while also acknowledging the need to prevent actions that could harm others. Mill argued that individuals should be free to act as they choose, as long as their actions do not cause harm to others. This principle is a cornerstone of liberal thought and has been influential in shaping modern conceptions of personal freedom and government intervention."
