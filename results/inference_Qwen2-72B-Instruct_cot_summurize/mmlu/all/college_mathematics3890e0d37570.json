In the next 2 days, John writes \\(\\frac{2}{j}\\) of a test. This pattern repeats until they complete the test in 10 days. Since 10 is an even number, both Kate and John have completed their last shift by the end of the 10th day. Therefore, the total work done is:\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{2}{k} + \\frac{2}{j}\\right) \\times 5 = 1 \\text{ test}\n\\]\n\n### When John starts:\nJohn works for 0.5 days more than Kate because the total time is 10.5 days. So, John does one full shift (2 days) more than Kate plus half a day. Kate does 5 shifts, and John does 5.5 shifts. The total work done is:\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{2}{k} \\times 5 + \\frac{2}{j} \\times 5 + \\frac{1}{2j}\\right) = 1 \\text{ test}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying both equations, we get:\n1. \\(\\frac{10}{k} + \\frac{10}{j} = 1\\)\n2. \\(\\frac{10}{k} + \\frac{11}{j} = 1\\)\n\nSubtracting the first equation from the second gives us:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{j} = 0.1 \\Rightarrow j = 10\n\\]\n\nPlugging \\(j = 10\\) into any of the original equations, let's use the first one:\n\\[\n\\frac{10}{k} + \\frac{10}{10} = 1 \\Rightarrow \\frac{10}{k} + 1 = 1 \\Rightarrow \\frac{10}{k} = 0 \\Rightarrow k = 10\n\\]\n\nSo, both Kate and John each take 10 days individually to write a practice test.\n\n### Working Together Simultaneously:\nThe combined rate when they work together is:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{k} + \\frac{1}{j} = \\frac{1}{10} + \\frac{1}{10} = \\frac{2}{10} = \\frac{1}{5}\n\\]\n\nThus, working together, they can complete a practice test in:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{5}} = 5 \\text{ days}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the answer is **B. 5 days**."
