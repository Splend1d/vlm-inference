Test validity refers to the extent to which a test measures what it claims to measure.\nB. Stability and D. Consistency are related to test reliability, which refers to the consistency of test results over time or across different administrations of the test.\nC. Replicability is also not the best synonym for test validity, although it is an important concept in scientific research. Replicability refers to the ability to obtain similar results when repeating an experiment or study.\nThe best synonym for test validity is actually \"accuracy,\" which means that the test accurately measures what it is intended to measure. However, accuracy was not one of the options given, so none of the choices provided is a perfect match. If forced to choose, I would select A. Truthfulness as the closest option, but it's important to note that truthfulness is not a commonly used synonym for test validity in academic literature."
