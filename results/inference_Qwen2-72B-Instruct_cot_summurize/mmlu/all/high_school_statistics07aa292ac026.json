The probability that someone requests only an oil change is \\(P(O) - P(O \\cap T)\\).\n\nSo, the number of customers who request only an oil change is \\(0.6 - 0.1 = 0.5\\).\n\nThe total number of customers who request an oil change (either alone or with a tire replacement) is \\(0.6\\).\n\nTherefore, the probability that a customer who requests an oil change does not also request a tire replacement is the ratio of those who request only an oil change to those who request an oil change at all:\n\n\\[P(T'\\mid O) = \\frac{P(O) - P(O \\cap T)}{P(O)} = \\frac{0.5}{0.6} = \\frac{5}{6} = 0.833\\]\n\nThus, the correct answer is D. 0.833."
