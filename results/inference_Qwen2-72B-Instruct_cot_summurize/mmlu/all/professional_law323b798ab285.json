This service is authorized under a certificate of convenience and necessity issued by the Interstate Commerce Commission, pursuant to federal statute. The certificate does not, however, specify particular highways, streets, or locations for the bus service. The company's advertising stresses that it picks up and delivers passengers at the center of each city that it serves. The company's management regards this as a particularly effective advertising point in competition with the airlines and the railroads, because short-haul traffic supplies a major part of the bus company's revenues. One of the major cities on the east coast, acting to relieve traffic congestion and air pollution, has recently enacted an ordinance that prohibits (a) the operation of all trucks and buses in a five- square- mile central business area, known as center city, between the hours of 10:00 A. M. and 4:00 P. M. on weekdays, and (b) all on-street parking of passenger automobiles in center city between the same weekday hours. The company's bus station in this city is located in the heart of the center city area. According to its transportation schedules, more than 75 buses either enter or leave this station between the hours of 10:00 A. M. and 4:00 P. M. each weekday. If the company brings suit challenging the constitutionality of the city ordinance, the court will most likely declare the ordinance\n\nA. constitutional, because it is within the city's police power to regulate transportation services in the center city business district.\nB. constitutional, because it is a valid exercise of municipal regulation in the area of intrastate commerce.\nC. unconstitutional, because it violates the dormant commerce clause.\nD. unconstitutional, because the ordinance is discriminatory per Se.\n"

                    "text": "The answer to this question is somewhat nuanced and would depend on a detailed legal analysis of the case. However, based on the information provided, the most likely answer is:\n\nA. constitutional, because it is within the city's police power to regulate transportation services in the center city business district.\n\nCities have broad police powers to regulate activities within their boundaries for the purpose of promoting public health, safety, and welfare. The city's ordinance appears to be aimed at relieving traffic congestion and reducing air pollution, which are legitimate local concerns. Moreover, the fact that the federal government has authorized the bus company's operations through a certificate of convenience and necessity does not necessarily preclude the city from regulating those operations in furtherance of its own legitimate interests.\n\nHowever, it is possible that the ordinance could be challenged under the dormant commerce clause if it places an undue burden on interstate commerce. The dormant commerce clause prohibits states and municipalities from enacting laws that discriminate against or unduly burden interstate commerce. In this case, the ordinance may have a significant impact on the bus company's ability to conduct its interstate business, particularly since it operates in multiple states along the east coast. If the ordinance effectively prevents the company from picking up and delivering passengers in the heart of one of the major cities it serves, it could be argued that it places an undue burden on interstate commerce.\n\nUltimately, the court would need to balance the city's interest in regulating transportation services within its boundaries against the potential impact on interstate commerce. Without further information about the specific facts of the case, it is difficult to predict how the court would rule."
