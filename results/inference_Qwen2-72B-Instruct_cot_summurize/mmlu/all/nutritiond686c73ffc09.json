This increase in estrogen levels is thought to be one of the mechanisms by which obesity increases the risk of endometrial cancer. Estrogen has a proliferative effect on the endometrium, and unopposed estrogen (without the balancing effects of progesterone) can lead to endometrial hyperplasia and, ultimately, cancer."
