                    "text": "The correct answer is B. The proton will be bent in a circular path.\n\nWhen a charged particle like a proton enters a magnetic field (which is what is produced inside a solenoid), it experiences a force perpendicular to both its velocity and the magnetic field direction. This force is known as the Lorentz force. Since the force is always perpendicular to the velocity, it does not change the speed of the proton but changes its direction, causing the proton to move in a circular path.\n\nNote: For this answer to be true, we are assuming that the solenoid's magnetic field is uniform and that the proton's velocity upon entry is perpendicular to the field lines, which would typically be the case if the proton is entering along the axis of the solenoid, provided the field is properly aligned. If the field were not uniform or the proton entered at an angle to the field, the path might not be perfectly circular. However, given the options provided, B is the most accurate choice based on typical conditions."
