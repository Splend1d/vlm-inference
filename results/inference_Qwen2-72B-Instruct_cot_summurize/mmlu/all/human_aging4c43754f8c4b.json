Gerontological\n\nWhile gerontology, which is the study of the social, cultural, psychological, cognitive, and biological aspects of aging, can certainly be relevant to understanding health in older adults, it is not typically considered a primary mechanism through which social support influences health. The other three options\u2014social, behavioral, and psychological factors\u2014are more directly supported by research as mechanisms linking social support to health outcomes. For example, social support may lead to healthier behaviors (behavioral), reduced stress and improved mental health (psychological), and enhanced social integration and cohesion (social)."
