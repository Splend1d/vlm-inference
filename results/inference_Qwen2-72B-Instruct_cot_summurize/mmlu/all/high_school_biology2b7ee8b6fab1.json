Differences in the timing and expression levels of different genes leads to structural and functional differences.\n\nCell differentiation in vertebrates (and other organisms) is primarily due to differential gene expression. While all cells in an organism contain the same set of genes, not all genes are active or expressed at the same level in every cell type. The specific combination of genes that are turned on or off, as well as the level of their expression, determines the characteristics of a particular cell type. This process is controlled by various factors including transcription factors, signaling molecules, and epigenetic modifications, which can alter the accessibility of genes for transcription without changing the underlying DNA sequence."
