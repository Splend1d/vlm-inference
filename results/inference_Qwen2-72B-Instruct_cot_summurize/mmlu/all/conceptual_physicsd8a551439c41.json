This is known as natural background radiation. While human activities like nuclear power generation and past military testing have contributed to radiation levels in some areas, their contributions are generally much smaller than those from natural sources on a global scale. Cosmic rays contribute significantly to natural background radiation, especially at higher altitudes and latitudes, but they are still part of the category of natural background radiation."
