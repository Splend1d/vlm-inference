He believed that the meaning of an ethical term lies in the psychological causes and effects it has a tendency to be connected with, particularly in terms of how it influences people's actions and attitudes. This is known as Stevenson's emotivist theory of meaning. According to this view, ethical statements do not convey factual information about the world but rather express the speaker's feelings or attitudes toward a particular subject and attempt to influence the feelings or attitudes of others."
