A political group got a proposition on the ballot, and a majority of the people voted to eliminate the right of same-sex couples to marry. The proposition did not affect any of the other rights that same-sex couples may have possessed from existing state law. Persons affected sued the state government for unconstitutionally taking away the rights that they had and doing it for no legitimate purpose, in violation of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Will the court grant the requests of the lawsuit and declare the proposition void and reinstate the rights of same-sex couples to marry?\n\nA. Yes, under the due process clause no compelling state interest justifies denying same-sex couples the fundamental right to marry.\nB. Yes, because under the Fourth Amendment it would be an illegal interference against the right of privacy guaranteed to everyone.\nC. No, because the people voted to take a provision out of the existing constitution and when that is done by public vote it cannot be altered.\nD. No, because the ballot proposition was properly placed on the ballot and all statutory procedures were followed, thus precluding the courts from taking adverse action.\n"

Yes, under the due process clause no compelling state interest justifies denying same-sex couples the fundamental right to marry.\n\nIn this scenario, the court would likely rule in favor of the plaintiffs based on the precedent set by the U.S. Supreme Court in Obergefell v. Hodges (2015), which held that the fundamental right to marry is guaranteed to same-sex couples by both the Due Process Clause and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The court would likely find that the state's action in revoking the right to marry for same-sex couples through a popular vote does not serve a compelling state interest and violates the due process clause. Therefore, the court would declare the proposition void and reinstate the rights of same-sex couples to marry. Option B is incorrect because the right to marry is protected under the due process clause, not the Fourth Amendment. Options C and D are incorrect because they ignore the constitutional protections afforded to same-sex couples and the precedent set by Obergefell v. Hodges."
