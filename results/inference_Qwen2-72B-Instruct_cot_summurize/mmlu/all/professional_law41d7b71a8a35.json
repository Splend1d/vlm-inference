                    "text": "On April 10, the owner of a golf course entered into an oral agreement with a gardener whereby the gardener promised to install all new sprinkler heads on the sprinkler system at the 18-hole golf course. In return, the owner promised to pay the gardener $2,400 upon completion of the job. Since a golf tournament was scheduled for the weekend of April 20 \u0080\u009421, the gardener agreed to replace all the sprinkler heads no later than April 19. Before accepting the job, the gardener had inspected the golf course and determined that 240 sprinkler heads had to be replaced. By April 14, the gardener had installed 80 new sprinkler heads on the first six holes of the 18-hole golf course. That afternoon, however, the owner learned that the gardener had been adjudicated bankrupt on April 12, so he notified the gardener to discontinue the job. The next day, the owner hired a landscaper to complete the installation work at $8 per head. The landscaper installed the remaining 160 sprinkler heads and completed the work on April 19. Despite making reasonable efforts, the gardener was unable to find any gainful employment during the period. Also, the gardener's application for unemployment compensation was rejected at the same time. Which of the following statements, if found to be true, would provide the owner with legally justifiable grounds for discharging the gardener?\n\nA. The gardener had been adjudicated bankrupt onApril 12.\nB. The gardener had only completed 33 percent of the installation work when he was discharged.\nC. The contract between the owner and the gardener was not in writing.\nD. Half of the sprinkler heads installed by the gardener were determined to be defective, and the gardener refused to replace the sprinkler heads.\n"

Half of the sprinkler heads installed by the gardener were determined to be defective, and the gardener refused to replace the sprinkler heads.\n\nThis scenario involves a breach of contract due to the quality of the work performed by the gardener. If it can be proven that half of the sprinkler heads installed by the gardener were defective and the gardener refused to correct this issue, the owner would have grounds to discharge the gardener based on failure to fulfill contractual obligations.\n\nThe other statements do not necessarily justify termination:\n\nA. Bankruptcy does not automatically disqualify someone from completing a job or entering into contracts. Unless there was a specific clause in the contract stating that bankruptcy would lead to termination, this alone is not a legal justification for discharging the gardener.\n\nB. The percentage of work completed is not relevant unless there was a specific milestone or deadline not met that was part of the contract. Since the gardener was on track to meet the deadline (April 19), this is not a justifiable reason for discharge.\n\nC. The lack of a written contract does not void the verbal agreement or justify termination. Oral agreements are legally binding under certain circumstances, such as when they are for services rather than goods over a certain value."
