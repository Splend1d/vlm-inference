While it's true that muscle glycogen content can affect power output, it's not accurate to say that maximum sustainable power is simply inversely related to muscle glycogen content, as other factors also play significant roles. Additionally, dietary choices like a high-fat diet may influence performance, but they do not directly improve maximum sustainable power in the context of the given options."
