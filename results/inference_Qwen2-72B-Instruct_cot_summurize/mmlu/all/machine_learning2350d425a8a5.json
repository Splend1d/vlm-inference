This is due to advancements in deep learning architectures and training techniques.\n\nStatement 2 is also true. The original ResNet paper (He et al., 2015) used stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with a momentum term for optimization, rather than the Adam optimizer. Adam has become popular since then, but it was not used in the original ResNet implementation."
