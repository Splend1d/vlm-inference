There is growing evidence of direct partnerships between terrorist groups and transnational criminal organization resulting from the end of the Cold War and the need to secure new forms of financial sponsorship. For most terrorist groups criminal activity has been amongst the most important sources of funds with the diffusion of terrorist networks globally operating in correlation to the diffusion of illicit market activities.\nB. The nexus between terrorist groups and criminal organizations are generally a temporary aberration. Differential long-term strategic goals meant that levels of cooperation were generally tactical temporary alliances that would have little pervasive effects.\nC. There is increasing evidence over the convergence of terrorism and transnational crime, but there is no consensus about whether this phenomenon is a long-term strategic alliance or episodic \"marriages of convenience\".\nD. All of these options.\n"

Option A highlights the reality that some terrorist groups have turned to criminal activities as a source of funding due to changes in global political dynamics. This can include drug trafficking, human smuggling, and other illicit activities. However, option B points out that such partnerships may be short-lived and based on convenience rather than shared ideology or strategy. Option C acknowledges the growing body of evidence suggesting a convergence between terrorism and transnational crime, but also notes that experts do not agree on the nature or longevity of these connections. Overall, the answer reflects the nuanced and evolving relationship between these two types of non-state actors."
