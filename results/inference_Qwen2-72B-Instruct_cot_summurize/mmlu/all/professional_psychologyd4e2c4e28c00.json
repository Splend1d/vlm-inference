According to ethical guidelines established by organizations such as the American Psychological Association, researchers must avoid causing harm to participants and must obtain informed consent from all participants. Deception can be considered a form of harm, especially if it causes pain, and therefore should be avoided unless absolutely necessary and justified by the study's potential value. However, even in cases where deception may be justified, researchers must still take steps to minimize any potential harm to participants and ensure that they are fully debriefed after the study."
