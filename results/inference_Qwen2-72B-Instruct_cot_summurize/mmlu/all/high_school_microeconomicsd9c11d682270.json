At her current level of consumption, Melanie's marginal utility of apples is 12 and her marginal utility of oranges is 18. If she has already spent all of her lunch money, how should Melanie change her consumption decision to maximize utility?\n\nA. She should make no changes; she is consuming the utility maximizing combination of apples and oranges.\nB. She should increase her apple consumption and decrease her orange consumption until the marginal utility per dollar is equal for both.\nC. She should decrease her apple consumption and increase her orange consumption until the marginal utility per dollar is equal for both.\nD.

This is because the consumer maximizes utility when the last dollar spent on each good yields the same marginal utility.\n\nGiven:\n- Price of an apple (Pa) = $1\n- Price of an orange (Po) = $2\n- Marginal utility of an apple (MUA) = 12\n- Marginal utility of an orange (MUO) = 18\n\nThe marginal utility per dollar spent on apples (MUPa) is MUA / Pa = 12 / 1 = 12.\nThe marginal utility per dollar spent on oranges (MUPo) is MUO / Po = 18 / 2 = 9.\n\nSince MUPa > MUPo, Melanie is getting more marginal utility per dollar from her last apple than from her last orange. Therefore, she should shift her spending towards apples, which will increase the marginal utility per dollar of oranges and decrease the marginal utility per dollar of apples, moving towards equality.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\nB. She should increase her apple consumption and decrease her orange consumption until the marginal utility per dollar is equal for both."
