The Olmecs are often recognized for their colossal stone heads and other sculptures that depict religious or ceremonial figures, which have been found across different Olmec sites, suggesting a shared belief system or pantheon. While agricultural surpluses (Option C) were important to support their complex society, and there is evidence of some level of organized military (Option B), it is the religious and cultural elements that seem to have been most widespread and unifying across the Olmec region. Therefore, the closest answer would be A. religious iconography. However, if considering the impact of all factors on the unification of a culture, D. all of the above could also be argued as a valid response in a broader context."
