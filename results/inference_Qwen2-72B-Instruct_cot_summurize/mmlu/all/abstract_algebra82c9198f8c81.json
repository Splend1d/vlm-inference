                    "text": "Let's analyze each statement:\n\nStatement 1: \"R is a splitting field of some polynomial over Q.\"\n\nThis statement is true. The field of real numbers, denoted by \\(\\mathbb{R}\\), is not algebraically closed (unlike the complex numbers \\(\\mathbb{C}\\)), meaning there exist polynomials with coefficients in \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) that do not have roots in \\(\\mathbb{R}\\). However, for any given polynomial with rational coefficients, we can always construct its splitting field by adjoining all its roots to \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\). Since \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) contains all real roots of any such polynomial, it can indeed be seen as a splitting field for some polynomial over \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\).\n\nStatement 2: \"There is a field with 60 elements.\"\n\nThis statement is false. A finite field, also known as a Galois field, must have \\(p^n\\) elements, where \\(p\\) is a prime number and \\(n\\) is a positive integer. This is because every finite field has a characteristic which is a prime number (the smallest positive integer such that adding the multiplicative identity to itself that many times yields the additive identity), and the number of elements in a finite field is a power of this prime. Since 60 is not a power of a prime number (\\(60 = 2^2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5\\)), there cannot be a field with exactly 60 elements.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. True, False"
