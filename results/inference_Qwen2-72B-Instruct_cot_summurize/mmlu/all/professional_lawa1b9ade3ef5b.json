                    "text": "A 73-year-old widower owned a 40-acre farm. The widower had two children, a son and a daughter. After the daughter married, she and her husband lived on the farm in a small cottage. From 1985 to 1989, the daughter and the husband helped the widower farm and maintain the property. The widower, whose health was deteriorating, needed the services of the daughter and her husband in order to continue to live on the farm. In December 1989, the daughter told the widower that she and her husband were planning to move out of state. Worried that he could not survive without their help, the widower said to the daughter, \"Please don't ever leav. e. I'm totally dependent on you and your husband. If you stay and continue to care for me and help with the farming, the farm will be yours when I die. \" The daughter turned down a job offer in a neighboring state and decided to do as the widower requested. For nine years, the daughter cared for her father while her husband handled most of the farming operations. In 1998, the widower died intestate with the daughter and the son as his only surviving heirs. The period required to acquire title by adverse possession in the jurisdiction is seven years. In an appropriate action to determine the legal and equitable rights of the daughter and the son, respectively, in the farm, the result will depend upon the application of the principles of and exceptions to the\n\nA. statute of frauds.\nB. parol evidence rule.\nC. law for adverse possession.\nD. doctrine of resulting trusts.\n"

                    "text": "The result in this case will likely depend upon the application of the principles of the doctrine of resulting trusts (Option D). A resulting trust is a type of implied trust where property is held by one party for the benefit of another due to certain circumstances or understandings. In this scenario, the widower made an oral agreement with his daughter that if she stayed to care for him and help with the farming, the farm would be hers upon his death. This understanding can potentially give rise to a resulting trust.\n\nThe daughter and her husband provided care and labor to the widower and the farm for nine years based on the widower's promise, which can be seen as reliance on the promise to the extent that it would be unjust for the son to inherit an equal share without considering the daughter's contributions and the widower's intentions. The court may find that a resulting trust was created in favor of the daughter due to her substantial performance and reliance on the widower's promise.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the statute of frauds (Option A) might also be relevant because agreements regarding the transfer of land interests must typically be in writing to be enforceable. Still, courts often recognize exceptions to the statute of frauds, such as part performance or detrimental reliance, which may apply here given the daughter's actions based on the widower's promise.\n\nAdverse possession (Option C) does not seem applicable since there is no indication that the daughter and her husband were occupying the land under a claim of right exclusive of the owner's interest or in a manner that would meet the requirements for adverse possession.\n\nThe parol evidence rule (Option B) generally prohibits the introduction of oral statements to contradict or add to the terms of a written contract. Since there doesn't appear to be a written contract in this case, the parol evidence rule is not directly relevant, but it might come into play if there were written documents that the parties were trying to interpret or modify with oral testimony. However, this rule does not address the core issue at hand regarding the daughter's equitable claim to the farm.\n\nIn summary, the doctrine of resulting trusts is the most relevant principle to determine the legal and equitable rights of the daughter and the son in the farm."
