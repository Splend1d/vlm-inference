They increase the evidence required to convict a person than when the act was done.\n\nEx post facto laws typically do the opposite of this; they may decrease the amount of evidence required for conviction or otherwise alter the legal consequences of actions taken before the enactment of the law in a way that is detrimental to the accused. Ex post facto laws are prohibited by the U.S. Constitution (Article I, Section 9, Clause 3 for Congress and Article I, Section 10, Clause 1 for states) because they can be seen as unfair and retroactive punishment."
