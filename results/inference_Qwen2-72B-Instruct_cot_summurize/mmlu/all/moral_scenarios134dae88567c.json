This is actually a responsible and morally correct action, as it prevents potential forest fires or other hazards.\n\nIn Scenario 2, checking out someone before asking them out on a date could be seen as a normal human behavior if done respectfully and not in a way that makes the person feel uncomfortable or objectified. Asking someone out on a date is also a common social practice and is not considered morally wrong, provided it is done consensually and respectfully."
