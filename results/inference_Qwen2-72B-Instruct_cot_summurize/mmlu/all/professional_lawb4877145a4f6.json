Six months later, when the man was still in possession, he conveyed the land by quitclaim deed as a gift to a friend, who knew nothing of the deed to the cousin. The friend did not record his deed. The man then vacated the land, and the friend took possession. The recording act of the jurisdiction provides as follows: \"No unrecorded conveyance or mortgage of real property shall be good against subsequent purchasers for value without notice, who shall first record.\" Recently, the cousin learned about the friend's deed and possession, immediately recorded her deed, and sued the friend for possession and to quiet title. The friend then recorded his deed and raised all available defenses. For whom is the court likely to decide?\n\nA. For the cousin, because she was first in time and the friend was not a purchaser.\nB. For the cousin, because the friend failed to first record.\nC. For the friend, because a subsequent good- faith donee has priority over a prior donee who fails to record.\nD. For the friend, because he was first in possession.\n"

This is consistent with the recording act that states an unrecorded conveyance is not good against subsequent purchasers for value without notice, who shall first record.\n\nHowever, the fact that the friend took possession before the cousin recorded her deed could also play a significant role in the court's decision. Possession can be a powerful factor in determining priority, especially if it is open and notorious. In this case, the friend's possession might strengthen his claim, even though he did not record his deed first.\n\nSo, the answer would be:\n\nD. For the friend, because he was first in possession, but the more legally grounded reason would be:\nC. For the friend, because a subsequent good-faith donee has priority over a prior donee who fails to record."
