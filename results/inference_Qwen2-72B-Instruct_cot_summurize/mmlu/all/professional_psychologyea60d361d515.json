Breach of confidentiality\n\nWhile all of the options listed can lead to ethical complaints against psychotherapy supervisors, breaches of confidentiality are among the most common reasons for such complaints. Supervisors have a duty to maintain the confidentiality of their supervisees' clients and to handle all information shared in supervision sessions with care and discretion. Failure to do so can result in serious harm to clients and damage to the professional reputation of both the supervisor and the supervisee. However, it's important to note that sexual harassment and incompetence can also be significant issues in the field of psychotherapy supervision and can lead to ethical complaints as well."
