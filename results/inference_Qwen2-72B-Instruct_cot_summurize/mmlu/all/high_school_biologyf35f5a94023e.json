This condition occurs when a female does not have two complete X chromosomes in all of her cells. Typically, females have two X chromosomes, but those with Turner syndrome may have only one X chromosome or are missing part of an X chromosome.\n\nHere's why the other options are incorrect:\n\nA. Cystic fibrosis: This is an autosomal recessive disorder and does not result from X chromosome aneuploidy.\nB. Hemophilia: This is indeed related to the X chromosome as it is an X-linked recessive disorder. However, it typically affects males who have only one X chromosome and no second copy to mask the defective gene. Women with one affected X chromosome are usually carriers and do not develop the full-blown disease due to having a second, normal X chromosome.\nD. Tay-Sachs disease: This is another autosomal recessive disorder and does not result from X chromosome aneuploidy."
