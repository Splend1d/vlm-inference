He argued that by critically examining our lives, we can gain a deeper understanding of ourselves and the world around us, which can lead to a more virtuous and fulfilling existence. Simply following the crowd or accepting things at face value without questioning them is not enough for a truly meaningful life. Therefore, Socrates' claim that \"the unexamined life is not worth living\" means that we must take responsibility for our own lives and engage in self-reflection to lead a life that is truly worth living."
