Knowing that his parents were giving a dinner party that evening, the boy filled a bucket with ice-cold water and balanced it on the partially open door of the guest bedroom, thinking that his father would take the guests' coats there to put them on the bed. The boy then went off to play at a friend's house. The boy's father decided to keep all the guests' coats in the hall closet instead of putting them in the guest bedroom. Later that evening, one of the guests mistakenly wandered into the guest bedroom while searching for a bathroom. As the guest opened the door, the bucket fell and hit his head, causing a severe cut that required a dozen stitches. If the guest sues the boy for negligence, the most likely result is\n\nA. the boy wins, because a child's conduct cannot be negligent.\nB. the boy wins, because the guest unreasonably assumed the risk of entering an unfamiliar room rather than asking for directions to the bathroom.\nC. the boy loses, because this \"practical joke\" posed a risk of severe harm and, therefore, the boy had a duty to exercise as much care as a reasonable adult.\nD. the boy loses, because he did not act with the amount of care that one would expect from a 12-year-old child.\n"

While children are held to a standard of care that is appropriate for their age, setting a trap that results in serious injury is likely to be considered beyond what is acceptable for a 12-year-old. The court would consider whether a child of similar age and experience would have foreseen the potential danger of the prank and acted differently.\n\nIt's important to note that the outcome could also depend on various factors such as local laws regarding child responsibility, contributory negligence on the part of the guest, and the specifics of how the incident occurred. However, based on the information provided, option D is the most likely legal conclusion."
