Rent was to be paid in installments due on the first day of each month. One year later, in 1986, the landowner died leaving no heirs. In her will, the landowner left her entire estate to the Girl Scouts of America. The apartment building was not specifically mentioned in the will. One month after the landowner died, the tenant, having learned of the landowner's death, decided to remain on the property, but stopped paying rent. The Girl Scouts of America organization was unaware of the landowner's gift to the organization until 2009, when attorneys for the organization conducted an inventory of testamentary gifts to the Girl Scouts of America, which revealed that they had a claim to ownership of the apartment building. The statutory period for adverse possession in this jurisdiction is 20 years. In an ejection action by the Girl Scouts of America against the tenant, the organization will prevail\n\nA. because the tenant discontinued paying rent following the landowner's death.\nB. if the tenant leased the apartment building to a teacher for three years while he (the tenant) was called into military service.\nC. if the tenant believed that his lease with the landowner was still in effect after the latter died.\nD. because the tenant never paid taxes on the apartment building.\n"

                    "text": "None of the options A, B, C, or D provided would necessarily guarantee that the Girl Scouts of America would prevail in an ejection action against the tenant. However, the most relevant consideration in this scenario would be the statute of limitations for adverse possession.\n\nGiven that the statutory period for adverse possession in this jurisdiction is 20 years and the Girl Scouts of America only became aware of their claim to the apartment building in 2009, at least 13 years after the landowner's death in 1986, and assuming the tenant continuously occupied the property without paying rent or acknowledging the Girl Scouts' ownership from 1986 onwards, the tenant could potentially have a claim to the property through adverse possession if 20 years had elapsed since the landowner's death and the tenant had met all other requirements for adverse possession under local law.\n\nFor the Girl Scouts of America to prevail, they would need to demonstrate that the tenant did not meet the criteria for adverse possession, such as showing that the occupation was not continuous, exclusive, open, notorious, and hostile (without permission). Alternatively, if the Girl Scouts can prove that the tenant's occupation did not meet the full 20-year requirement at the time of the lawsuit, they could also prevail.\n\nHowever, none of the options given directly address the issue of adverse possession or the length of the tenant's occupation. Therefore, the correct answer to the question as posed is not listed among the options provided. If we were to infer based on the information given and the options provided, none of them would directly ensure the Girl Scouts' success in the ejection action. But in terms of legal grounds, the most critical factor would be whether the tenant has met the requirements for adverse possession, which is not addressed in any of the options."
