These two structures are not considered homologous because they have different evolutionary origins and underlying structures, despite serving similar functions. Bird wings and insect wings are examples of analogous structures, which have evolved independently in response to similar environmental pressures or needs. In contrast, homologous structures share a common ancestry and often have similar underlying skeletal or genetic components, as seen in the other examples provided (A, B, and C)."
