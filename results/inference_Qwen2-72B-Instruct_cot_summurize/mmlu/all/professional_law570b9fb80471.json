Lot 1 consisted of a single- family house with a yard, garage, and driveway. On May 1, 1999, the boss moved into the house on lot 1. One year later, the co-worker and the boss executed and delivered the following deed instrument to a neighbor \". . . hereby grant to (the neighbor) the northerly 30 feet of lot 1, consisting of the paved driveway now existing, to be used for the ingress and egress of motor vehicles, but should (the neighbor) or his heirs and assigns use said property for any other purpose, all the rights, privileges, and immunities herein granted shall cease and determine. \" In consideration for the said deed, the neighbor paid the co-worker and the boss $2,000 (which they divided equally). The deed was never recorded by the neighbor. Because the boss didn't own a car, she never used the driveway. Similarly, the neighbor never used the driveway because he unexpectedly had his driver's license suspended shortly after executing the above instrument. The boss died intestate on May 1, 2001, leaving her daughter as her sole heir. Following her mother's death, the daughter moved into the house on May 2, 2001. On June 1, 2001 the neighbor sold lot 2 to a professor by a deed that contained no mention of the driveway located on lot 1. The neighbor and the professor assumed that the latter had the right to use the driveway, so they didn't insert any recitations in their deed instrument regarding the driveway. Immediately upon her taking possession of the premises, the daughter began to use the driveway on lot 1. Consequently, she objected to the professor's use of the driveway. After the daughter refused to permit the professor to use the driveway, he brought suit to determine his right to continue use of the driveway. The professor should\n\nA. win, because he acquired an implied easement to use the driveway as owner of the dominant tenement.\nB. win, because the neighbor's easement to use the driveway was conveyed to the professor.\nC. lose, because the Statute of Frauds was not satisfied.\nD. lose, because the neighbor's non-use of the driveway effectuated an abandonment of the easement.\n"

                    "text": "The professor should A. win, because he acquired an implied easement to use the driveway as owner of the dominant tenement.\n\nExplanation:\nAn implied easement can arise when there is a clear intention by the original parties to create an easement and it is necessary for the reasonable enjoyment of the dominant tenement. In this case, the neighbor originally acquired an easement over the driveway on Lot 1, which was intended for ingress and egress of motor vehicles. Although the easement was not recorded, it still existed. When the neighbor sold Lot 2 to the professor, it can be argued that the easement was appurtenant to Lot 2 and passed with the sale, even though it was not mentioned in the deed. The professor, as the new owner of Lot 2, would have the right to use the driveway as long as it is for the intended purpose (ingress and egress of motor vehicles), and it is reasonably necessary for the enjoyment of Lot 2. The fact that the neighbor never used the driveway does not necessarily mean that the easement was abandoned, especially if there was a valid reason for non-use (in this case, the neighbor's driver's license suspension).\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the specific laws and court interpretations regarding easements and implied easements can vary by jurisdiction, and the outcome of such a lawsuit could depend on local statutes and case law."
