She says the symptoms began after she tripped over a tree branch in her yard and scraped her left leg. Current medications include antiretroviral therapy and ibuprofen as needed. Vital signs are temperature 38.3\u00b0C (100.9\u00b0F), pulse 86/min, respirations 14/min, and blood pressure 138/70 mm Hg. There is a 5\u00d78-cm area on the anterior surface of her left lower extremity that is swollen, erythematous, and tender. She previously has developed a rash after taking erythromycin, and she has had an anaphylactic response to penicillin. Which of the following antibiotic therapies is most appropriate for this patient?\n\nA. Amoxicillin\nB. Ciprofloxacin\nC. Clarithromycin\nD. Clindamycin\n"

Ciprofloxacin (option B) is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic and can be used for skin infections, but it's not the first choice for cellulitis which is likely the diagnosis here given the clinical presentation.\n\nClarithromycin (option C) is a macrolide antibiotic and could be considered; however, the patient had a rash when taking erythromycin, another macrolide, which suggests potential cross-reactivity and makes clarithromycin a less ideal choice.\n\nClindamycin (option D) is effective against many of the bacteria that cause skin infections, including MRSA (Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus), and it does not have the same cross-reactivity concerns as the other options given the patient's medication history. It is often used in cases where there is a penicillin allergy and would be the most appropriate choice among the options provided.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Clindamycin"
