Smoking is a major risk factor for CAD and quitting smoking can significantly reduce the risk of developing heart disease. It is important for the patient to understand the risks associated with smoking and to receive support in quitting, such as nicotine replacement therapy or counseling. While other interventions such as a more rigorous exercise program and dietary changes may also be beneficial, smoking cessation is the most critical step in reducing her risk of CAD given her current habits and family history."
