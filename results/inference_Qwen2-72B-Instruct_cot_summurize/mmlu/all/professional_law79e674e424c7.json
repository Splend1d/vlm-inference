Don't let her do it again!\" can be considered an excited utterance, which is an exception to the hearsay rule. An excited utterance is a statement made while the declarant is under the stress of excitement caused by a startling event or condition, and such statements are considered more reliable because they are spontaneous reactions to events rather than deliberate fabrications. In this case, the customer's reaction to the ongoing crime and the immediate danger posed by the armed woman would likely qualify as a sufficiently exciting event to justify the admission of the statement under this exception."
