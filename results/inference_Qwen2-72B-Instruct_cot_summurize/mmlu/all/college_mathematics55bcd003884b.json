For a function to have a local maximum at a point \\(c\\) in its domain, it does not necessarily mean that the derivative \\(f'(c)\\) exists or equals 0. If the derivative exists at \\(c\\), then indeed, \\(f'(c) = 0\\), as this is one of the necessary conditions for \\(c\\) to be a critical point where a local extremum might occur (assuming the function is differentiable there). However, a function can have a local maximum at a point where it is not differentiable. A classic example is the absolute value function \\(f(x) = |x|\\) at \\(x = 0\\), which has a local minimum but is not differentiable at \\(x = 0\\).\n\n**Statement 2**: \"There exist non-constant continuous maps from \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) to \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\).\"\n\nThis statement is also false. The set of rational numbers \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) is countable and dense in the real line \\(\\mathbb{R}\\). However, any continuous function from \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) to \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) cannot be non-constant because of the intermediate value property of continuous functions. If such a function were non-constant, it would take on all values between any two distinct values in its range, including irrational numbers, which contradicts the assumption that its range is within \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\). Therefore, the only continuous functions from \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) to \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) are constant functions.\n\nGiven these analyses, the correct answer is **D. False, False**."
