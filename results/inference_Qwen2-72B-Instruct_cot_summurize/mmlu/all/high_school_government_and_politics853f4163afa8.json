The difference in size between the two chambers means that more work is done on the floor in the Senate and more work is done in committees in the House.\nB. The Senate as a whole has confirmation powers that the House does not have.\nC. Members are appointed to the committee in the House but are elected to committees in the Senate.\nD. A member of any party can serve a committee in the House, but only major party members can serve on committees in the Senate.\n"

The difference in size between the two chambers means that more work is done on the floor in the Senate and more work is done in committees in the House.\n\nThe House of Representatives has significantly more members (435) than the Senate (100). This larger size makes it less practical for the entire House to handle all legislative work on the floor, leading to a greater reliance on committees to do much of the detailed work of crafting legislation. In contrast, the smaller Senate can more easily manage its legislative workload with fewer committees and more direct floor action."
