In other words, a behavior that occurs frequently or has a higher probability of happening (the reinforcer) is used to reinforce a behavior that occurs less frequently or has a lower probability of happening. For example, allowing a child to play video games (a high-preference activity) after they finish their homework (a low-preference activity). This principle helps in increasing the frequency of the less preferred behavior by using the more preferred behavior as a reward."
