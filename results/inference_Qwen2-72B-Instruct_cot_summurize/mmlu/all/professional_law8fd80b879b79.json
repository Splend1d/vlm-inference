The pedestrian sued the occupants of all the rooms from which the chair might have been thrown. At trial, the pedestrian has been unable to offer any evidence as to the exact room from which the chair was thrown. The defendants have filed a motion for a directed verdict. Should the court grant the motion?\n\nA. No, because it is unreasonable to expect the pedestrian to prove which of the defendants caused the harm.\nB. No, because of the doctrine of alternative liability.\nC. Yes, because a plaintiff always has the burden to prove that a particular defendant's conduct was the factual cause of the plaintiff's physical harm.\nD. Yes, because the pedestrian has failed to offer evidence that the defendants jointly engaged in tortious conduct.\n"

No, because of the doctrine of alternative liability.\n\nThe doctrine of alternative liability applies when multiple defendants could have caused the harm, and the plaintiff is unable to determine which one actually did. In such cases, if the plaintiff can prove that one of the defendants must have been responsible, the burden shifts to the defendants to prove that they were not the cause of the harm. This doctrine is particularly relevant in situations where the defendants' actions created a common risk of harm to the plaintiff, and it would be unjust to allow all of them to escape liability simply because the precise source of the harm cannot be determined."
