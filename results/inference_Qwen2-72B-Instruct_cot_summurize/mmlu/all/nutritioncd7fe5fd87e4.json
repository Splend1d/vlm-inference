The products of protein digestion may be absorbed as free amino acids or as di- or tripeptides\nB. Gastric digestion of all proteins is equally efficient because of the grinding action of the antrum\nC. Gastric zymogenic (chief) cells produce and secrete chymotrypsin, elastase and carboxypeptidase A and this initiates the process of protein digestion\nD. The products of digestion of dietary protein by luminal and brush-border enzymes are only absorbed by one of the 14 different amino acid transporters\n"

The products of protein digestion may be absorbed as free amino acids or as di- or tripeptides\n\nThis statement is the most correct because it accurately describes how the products of protein digestion can be absorbed in the small intestine. Proteins are broken down into smaller peptides and individual amino acids during digestion, and these components can then be absorbed across the intestinal epithelium.\n\nB is incorrect because gastric digestion efficiency can vary depending on the type of protein and its structure.\nC is incorrect because gastric zymogenic (chief) cells produce pepsinogen, which is converted to pepsin in the stomach; chymotrypsin, elastase, and carboxypeptidase A are produced by the pancreas.\nD is incorrect because while there are indeed multiple amino acid transporters involved in the absorption of amino acids, the statement implies that only one transporter is responsible for all amino acid absorption, which is not accurate."
