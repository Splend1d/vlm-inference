Convenience and quota samples. \n\nConvenience sampling involves selecting participants who are easily accessible or convenient to the researcher, while quota sampling involves selecting participants based on certain characteristics until a predetermined quota is met. These types of samples are not random because they do not give all members of the population an equal chance of being selected. Cluster sampling, stratified sampling, and random sampling are examples of probability sampling methods that involve selecting participants randomly from the population."
