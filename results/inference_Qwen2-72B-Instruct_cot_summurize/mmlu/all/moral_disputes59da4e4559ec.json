This perspective emphasizes the importance of maintaining the health and stability of natural systems, which in turn supports the well-being of all living organisms, including humans. While minimizing damage and suffering and promoting human welfare are also important considerations, Baxter's focus on ecosystem integrity provides a broader framework for understanding the complex interdependencies within the natural world and the potential consequences of our actions on these systems."
