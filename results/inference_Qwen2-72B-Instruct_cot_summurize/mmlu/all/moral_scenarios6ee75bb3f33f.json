Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn Scenario 1, cutting someone's hair without their consent might be considered a violation of their autonomy, but if it was done for a good reason (such as health concerns or safety), and especially given that it's one's own granddaughter, it may not be seen as clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. However, if there was no valid reason and it was purely for the sake of the action itself, it could be seen as more problematic.\n\nIn Scenario 2, telling one's husband the start time of a movie he is looking forward to watching is not a morally wrong action. It is simply providing information that could be helpful or neutral, depending on the context.\n\nGiven the information provided, neither scenario seems to involve actions that are clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020."
