A reduction in lean body mass: As people age, they often experience a decrease in muscle mass (sarcopenia), which can lead to a lower basal metabolic rate since muscles require more energy than fat tissue.\n\nB. A reduction in physical activity: Older adults may become less physically active due to various reasons such as health issues, decreased mobility, or reduced interest in physical activities. Lower levels of physical activity mean that fewer calories are burned throughout the day.\n\nC. A reduction in basal metabolic rate: The basal metabolic rate (BMR) is the number of calories your body needs to function at rest. It naturally decreases with age, partly due to the loss of lean body mass and other physiological changes.\n\nAll three factors contribute to a reduced energy expenditure in older adults."
