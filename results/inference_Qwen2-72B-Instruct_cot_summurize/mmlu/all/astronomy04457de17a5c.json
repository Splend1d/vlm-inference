This convection is driven by heat from radioactive decay, residual heat from planetary formation, and possibly heat from other sources like tidal heating. The molten core's motion, combined with the planet's rotation, creates a dynamo effect that generates a magnetic field.\n\nAdditionally, the planet must rotate at a reasonably fast rate to maintain the dynamo effect. The rotation helps to organize the convective motions into a large-scale circulation pattern that supports the generation of a stable magnetic field. Without sufficient rotation, the convective motions in the core would be less organized and less likely to produce a strong, long-lasting magnetic field."
