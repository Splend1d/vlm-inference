The defendant purchased a ski mask and then went into the liquor store, put his gun into the face of the clerk, and demanded the money from the register. Terrified, the clerk gave him the money from the register. The defendant pocketed the money, grabbed a bottle of tequila off the shelf for his celebration, and then ran back to the car and drove off. About an hour later, the defendant was slowly approaching his hideout in the outskirts of town when a young child suddenly darted in front of the defendant's car. He applied the brakes but couldn't stop in time. The car struck the child, killing her. For the child's death, the defendant should be found guilty of which, if any, of the following crimes?\n\nA. Felony murder.\nB. Involuntary manslaughter.\nC. Voluntary manslaughter.\nD. No crime.\n"

                    "text": "The defendant could potentially be charged with felony murder. Felony murder is a legal doctrine that holds a person criminally liable for a killing that occurs during the commission or attempted commission of a dangerous felony, even if the killing was unintentional. In this case, the defendant was fleeing from the armed robbery (a dangerous felony) when the accident occurred. Therefore, the defendant can be held responsible for the child's death under the felony murder rule.\n\nAnswer: A. Felony murder.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that laws vary by jurisdiction, and the specific elements required to prove felony murder may differ. In some jurisdictions, the prosecution must also show that the death was a foreseeable consequence of the felony being committed. Additionally, some jurisdictions have modified or abolished the felony murder rule. Therefore, the applicability of felony murder in this scenario would depend on the specific laws of the jurisdiction where the incident took place."
