The parasympathetic nervous system resumes control and reverses the sympathetic responses.\n\nWhen the child is frightened by the sudden barking of the dog, her body responds with a \"fight or flight\" response, which is controlled by the sympathetic nervous system. This response increases heart rate, blood pressure, and respiration, among other things. When her mother picks her up, the child begins to feel safe again, triggering the parasympathetic nervous system to take over. This system helps the body return to a state of calm by reversing the effects of the sympathetic nervous system, such as lowering heart rate and blood pressure."
