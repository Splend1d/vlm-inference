Nearly all of the enzyme molecules are interacting with acetaldehyde molecules.\n\nAt the maximal rate of reaction (Vmax), nearly all of the enzyme molecules are occupied by substrate (acetaldehyde) and are catalyzing the reaction as fast as they can. This is known as saturation kinetics where further increases in substrate concentration do not increase the reaction rate because there are no more available enzyme active sites to bind the substrate. The other options do not accurately describe what happens at Vmax. Activation energy does not decrease; it's the role of the enzyme to lower the activation energy but this value remains constant. The change in free energy of the reaction is not affected by substrate concentration, and the enzyme specificity remains unchanged regardless of substrate concentration."
