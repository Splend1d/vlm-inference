In this case, Brown cosigned Royal's note to State Bank, which means Brown is jointly and severally liable for the debt. Even if Royal is later found to be mentally incompetent, Brown's liability does not change. Brown would still be responsible for paying the debt when it becomes due. The incompetence of the primary borrower (Royal) does not discharge the surety (Brown) from their obligation under the note."
