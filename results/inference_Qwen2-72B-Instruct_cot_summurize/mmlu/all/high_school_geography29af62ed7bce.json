Good transportation network\n\nA good transportation network typically strengthens a state's infrastructure and economy, facilitating easier movement of goods, services, and people. It does not pose a challenge to the state's sovereignty or governance in the way that transnational corporations, supranational entities like the EU, or international organizations such as the WTO might. These latter entities can challenge state power through various means, including influencing policy through economic leverage, setting rules that states must follow, or by redistributing decision-making power beyond national borders."
