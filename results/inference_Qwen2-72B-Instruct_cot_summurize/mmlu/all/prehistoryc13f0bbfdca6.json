The population outstripping the productive capacity of the environment: Overpopulation and overuse of resources such as wood for building and fuel could have led to deforestation and soil erosion, reducing the ability of the land to support agriculture.\n\nB. Drought: A prolonged drought during the late 1200s, known as the Great Drought, is thought to have severely impacted the Ancestral Puebloans' ability to grow crops and sustain their population.\n\nC. A new religion attracting them to the south: While less documented than environmental factors, there is some evidence to suggest that cultural or religious changes played a role in the migration of the Ancestral Puebloans from Mesa Verde to other areas, possibly including the adoption of new religious practices that were centered in the south.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be D. all of the above. However, it's important to note that the exact reasons for the abandonment remain a subject of ongoing research and debate among archaeologists and historians."
