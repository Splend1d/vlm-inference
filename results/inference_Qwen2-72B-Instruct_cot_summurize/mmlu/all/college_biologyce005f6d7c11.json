This gradient results in water moving into the roots by osmosis from the soil solution into the root cells where there is a higher concentration of solutes. This process occurs against the concentration gradient of water and requires energy (ATP), which is why it is considered active transport. The accumulation of water in the root cortex cells generates hydrostatic (root) pressure that can push water up the xylem in short plants or in plants under certain conditions. However, in taller plants, transpiration pull is the primary mechanism for water movement up the plant."
