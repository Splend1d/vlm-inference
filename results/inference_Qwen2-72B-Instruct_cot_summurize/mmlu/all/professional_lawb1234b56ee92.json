Five years ago the man conveyed a right-of-way easement over his land to the woman because it provided a more direct route between her house and the highway. The easement was evidenced by a clearly marked path. The document granting the easement was promptly recorded. Three years ago, the woman conveyed her house to the man. The man never took actual possession of the house. Two years ago, the man conveyed the house to a purchaser by a warranty deed. Two months after the purchaser moved into the house, a neighbor informed him about the easement. He then began using the path that had been marked on the man's land. When the man noticed the purchaser using the path, he erected a barricade on his land that effectively prevented the purchaser from using the path. The purchaser has sued the man, claiming that he has an easement over the man's land. Who is likely to prevail?\n\nA. The man, because the easement was extinguished.\nB. The man, because the purchaser did not have actual notice of the easement at the time of acquisition.\nC. The purchaser, because he purchased the house by warranty deed.\nD. The purchaser, because the easement was of public record when he acquired the house.\n"

The purchaser, because the easement was of public record when he acquired the house.\n\nWhen the man granted the easement to the woman five years ago, it was recorded, making it a matter of public record. This means that anyone acquiring the property thereafter would be bound by the easement, even if they were not personally aware of it. The fact that the easement was visible as a path on the man's land also supports the notion that it was apparent and should have been discoverable through due diligence during the property purchase. Therefore, the purchaser is likely to prevail in his claim that he has an easement over the man's land, as it was part of the property rights transferred with the house."
