This defense can be used when a defendant unknowingly ingests an intoxicating substance and subsequently commits a crime. If the defendant can prove that he did not know the punch contained PCP, he may be able to establish a defense of involuntary intoxication. However, it is important to note that the success of this defense will depend on the specific laws of the jurisdiction in which the case is being tried and the facts of the case."
