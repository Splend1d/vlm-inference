However, he also argues that this right is not absolute and can be overridden by other moral considerations, such as the duty to assist those in dire need or to respect human rights. Wellman's view is often associated with a libertarian perspective on immigration, emphasizing the importance of individual freedom and property rights in the context of state sovereignty."
