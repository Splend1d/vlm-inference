                    "text": "The correct answer is D. The modern rabies vaccine is grown in human diploid cells from an aborted embryo. This method of production allows for a safer and more effective vaccine, as the virus is grown in a cell culture rather than in animal tissue. The use of human diploid cells also ensures that the vaccine is free from any potential animal viruses that could be harmful to humans. The rabies vaccine has evolved significantly since its development by Louis Pasteur in the late 19th century, and the current vaccines are much more effective and safe than the original formulations. Modern rabies vaccines typically require a series of 4-5 doses, administered intramuscularly, rather than the 16 doses given into the peritoneal cavity that were required in earlier formulations."
