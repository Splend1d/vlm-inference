Non-governmental groups have played a significant and effective role in developing arms control measures in recent years.\n\nNGOs have been influential in raising awareness, advocating for policy changes, monitoring compliance with international agreements, and providing expertise and research on arms control issues. They often work closely with governments, international organizations, and other stakeholders to promote responsible arms trade practices and prevent the proliferation of weapons that can be used to violate human rights or fuel conflict. Examples include the Arms Trade Treaty, which was heavily influenced by NGO advocacy, and the work of groups like Amnesty International and Oxfam in exposing illicit arms trafficking and pushing for greater transparency and accountability in the global defence trade."
