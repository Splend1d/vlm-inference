                    "text": "The correct answer is C. because Mars has a more eccentric orbit than the Earth.\n\nMars' orbit around the Sun is more elliptical (eccentric) than Earth's, meaning that at certain points in its orbit, Mars is significantly closer or farther from the Sun than at other times. When Mars is closest to the Sun (perihelion), it happens to be during its southern hemisphere summer, leading to warmer and more intense seasons there compared to the northern hemisphere. This results in more extreme seasonal changes in the southern hemisphere of Mars than would be experienced if its orbit were less eccentric. While option D is also true, Mars' axial tilt contributes to the seasonal variations but does not specifically explain why the southern hemisphere experiences more extreme seasons. The eccentricity of its orbit plays a more direct role in this phenomenon."
