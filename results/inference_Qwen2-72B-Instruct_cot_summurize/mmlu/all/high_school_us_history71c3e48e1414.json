They only wanted to work in rice paddies without helicopters strafing them and bombs with napalm burning their villages and tearing their country apart. They wanted everything to do with the war, particularly with this foreign presence of the United States of America, to leave them alone in peace, and they practiced the art of survival by siding with whichever military force was present at a particular time, be it Viet Cong, North Vietnamese or American.\"\nJohn Kerry, 1971\nFrom the quote above, it is reasonable to infer that\n\nA. many Vietnamese viewed the United States as a colonial influence\nB. most Vietnamese were opposed to Communism\nC. most Vietnamese favored Communism\nD. some Viet Cong fought alongside American troops in opposition to North Vietnam\n"
