It involves physical violence and harm towards another person without justification.\n\nIn scenario 2, spraying a cat's fur with flea medicine might not be considered morally wrong if it was done appropriately and for the welfare of the animal. Flea medicine is typically used to protect cats from fleas, which can cause discomfort and health issues for the cat. However, it's important to use such products according to the instructions and to ensure they are suitable for the specific animal to avoid causing harm. If the action was taken responsibly, it would not be considered morally wrong."
