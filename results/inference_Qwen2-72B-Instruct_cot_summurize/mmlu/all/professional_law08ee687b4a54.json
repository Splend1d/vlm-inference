The contract stipulated that no money would be due until the owner's caretaker approved the work done by the painter. The painter completed the painting of all six cottages. Two days after the painter had finished the painting, a wildfire destroyed the six cottages. Although the caretaker had inspected four of the cottages to his approval, he had not inspected the other two cottages prior to their destruction. Which of the following is the LEAST accurate statement with respect to the caretaker's approval of the painting of the cottages?\n\nA. The owner would only be obligated to pay for the painting of the four cottages that the caretaker approved.\nB. The caretaker's approval of the painting of the two cottages destroyed by the wild fire would be excused.\nC. The owner would be obligated to pay for the painting of all of the cottages.\nD. The impossibility of securing the caretaker's approval would render the owner absolutely liable for all of the painting.\n"

The impossibility of securing the caretaker's approval would render the owner absolutely liable for all of the painting.\n\nThis statement is inaccurate because the contract stipulated that payment was contingent upon the caretaker's approval. Since the caretaker did not have the opportunity to inspect and approve the last two cottages before they were destroyed, it cannot be assumed that the owner is absolutely liable for the entire amount. The terms of the contract must be considered, and it may be that the owner is only liable for the work that was approved by the caretaker, which would be the four cottages that were inspected and approved before the wildfire."
