These changes included the cooling and drying of the Earth's climate, which caused forests to recede and be replaced by grasslands and savannas. This shift in habitat would have been detrimental to many ape species that were adapted to living in forested environments, leading to their extinction. The other options (A, B, and D) are not accurate explanations for the extinctions at the end of the Miocene."
