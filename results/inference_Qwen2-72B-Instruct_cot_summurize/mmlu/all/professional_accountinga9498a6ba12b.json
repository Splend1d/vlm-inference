Disclose the departure from GAAP in a separate paragraph of the accountant's report.\n\nWhen performing a review engagement of the financial statements of a nonissuer (a company that does not issue securities registered with the SEC), if the accountant identifies material departures from Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and management refuses to correct them, the accountant should disclose this fact in the review report. This disclosure would typically take the form of an \"emphasis of matter\" paragraph that highlights the departure from GAAP and its effect on the financial statements. It is important to note that during a review engagement, the accountant does not express an opinion or assurance on the financial statements as they would in an audit; instead, they provide a conclusion based on the procedures performed. In this case, since the accountant cannot conclude that the financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP due to the material misstatement related to lease capitalization, they should clearly communicate this limitation in their report."
