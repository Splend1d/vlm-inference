Alfred Adler, the founder of Adlerian psychology, emphasized the importance of social interest and community feeling in human behavior. He also believed that individuals strive for superiority and that misbehavior often stems from a desire for attention, power, or revenge, as mentioned by the psychologist. Additionally, Adlerian theory includes the concept of mistaken goals, where children may have incorrect beliefs about how to achieve their goals, leading to misbehavior. The use of appropriate consequences aligns with Adler's belief in the importance of encouragement and the development of social skills through cooperation and mutual respect."
