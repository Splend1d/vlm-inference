Lower market prices\n\nHere's why: The return on investment (ROI) for feeding hogs has decreased from $151 for every $100 spent on feed last year to $130 for every $100 spent on feed this year. If feed costs are stable and there have been no significant death losses, then the most probable cause for the reduced ROI would be a decrease in the selling price of hogs. Lower market prices mean that even though the cost of feed remains the same, the income generated by selling the hogs is less than it was the previous year, resulting in a lower return per dollar spent on feed.\n\nOption A (lower feed efficiency) could also potentially reduce returns, but since the question specifies that the return is measured per $100 of feed, this metric already takes into account how efficiently the feed is converted into hog growth. Therefore, if the return is lower, it suggests that the issue lies not with the efficiency of feed conversion, but rather with the revenue side of the equation, which points to option C. Options B and D do not directly explain the decrease in returns as described."
