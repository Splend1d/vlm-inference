Shampoos often contain detergents and surfactants that help to remove oils and buildup from hair and scalp, but these same ingredients can be too harsh for the delicate skin on other parts of your body. Using shampoo on your skin can strip away natural oils, leading to dryness, irritation, and potentially even rashes or other skin conditions. Therefore, it's generally recommended to use products designed for the skin, such as body washes or soaps, when showering or bathing."
