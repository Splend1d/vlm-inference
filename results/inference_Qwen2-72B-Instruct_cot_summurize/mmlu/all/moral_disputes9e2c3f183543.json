He argues that pleasure and the absence of pain are the ultimate ends that humans seek, and that what is desirable is what leads to pleasure or avoids pain. This is a central tenet of utilitarianism, which holds that actions are right if they promote happiness and wrong if they produce the opposite of happiness."
