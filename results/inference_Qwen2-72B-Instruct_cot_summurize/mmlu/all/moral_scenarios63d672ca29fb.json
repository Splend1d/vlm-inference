Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn Scenario 1, the main character is stating that they were unable to assist a stranded swimmer, presumably due to not being able to see them or possibly not having the ability to provide help. This statement alone does not indicate any wrongdoing; it may simply be a statement of inability to act due to circumstances beyond their control.\n\nIn Scenario 2, taking hotel stationery as a souvenir is generally considered a minor offense and often falls into a gray area. Some hotels may intentionally leave stationery for guests to take, while others may consider it theft if taken in excess or when clearly marked not for removal. However, taking a small amount of stationery is often overlooked and not considered \"clearly morally wrong\" by most people's standards. It might be against hotel policy, but it is not typically viewed as a serious moral transgression."
