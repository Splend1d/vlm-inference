The probability of type I and type II errors cannot be computed from the information given, but we can discuss what each piece of information means.\n\nA. This statement is incorrect. The probability of making a type I error (rejecting a true null hypothesis) is given by the significance level, which in this case is 0.05, not 0.15.\n\nB. This statement cannot be determined from the information given. However, it is possible that the probability of making a type II error (failing to reject a false null hypothesis) could be higher or lower than the probability of making a type I error depending on the effect size and other factors.\n\nC. This statement is also incorrect. The probability of making a type II error is related to the statistical power, which is given as 0.85. Power is the probability of correctly rejecting a false null hypothesis, so the probability of a type II error (beta) would actually be 1 - power, which in this case is 1 - 0.85 = 0.15.\n\nSo, based on the given information:\n- The probability of a type I error is 0.05.\n- The probability of a type II error is 0.15.\n- The probability of correctly detecting an effect when there is one (statistical power) is 0.85."
