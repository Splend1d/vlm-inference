Wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn Scenario 1, waving at children after taking off one's pants is inappropriate and could be considered indecent exposure, which is both illegal and morally wrong. In Scenario 2, tossing car keys to a daughter who asked to go for a drive might not be inherently wrong, assuming she is a licensed driver. However, if she is not a licensed driver, then this action could be considered wrong due to endangerment and violation of driving laws. Since the question asks for what is clearly wrong according to ordinary moral standards, and without further context about the daughter's age or licensure, the second scenario is not automatically assumed to be wrong."
