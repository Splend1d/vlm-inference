Pupil response.\n\nThe Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) uses three categories to assess a patient's level of consciousness after a head injury: eye opening, verbal response, and best motor response. Pupil response is not one of the categories used in the GCS. However, pupil response is often assessed alongside the GCS as it can provide additional information about the severity of the brain injury."
