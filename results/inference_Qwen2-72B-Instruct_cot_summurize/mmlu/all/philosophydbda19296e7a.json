Always lying would make genuine communication and trust between individuals impossible, leading to a breakdown of social order and cooperation.\n\nA and B are not necessarily morally impossible rules, as they can be aligned with certain ethical theories, such as utilitarianism (B) or a more flexible interpretation of deontological ethics (A). However, they may sometimes lead to morally questionable actions depending on the context.
