A buyer recently purchased an undeveloped beachfront lot in the jurisdiction. He hired a building contractor to construct a new house on the property. Thereafter, the contractor employed a subcontractor to provide on-site maintenance. The contractor contracted with a cement company to supply concrete for the foundation of the structure. After excavation started, an employee of the cement company delivered a load of concrete to the construction site. To facilitate delivery, the contractor and the subcontractor had built an access ramp extending from the street to the lot. As the employee was driving over the ramp, it suddenly collapsed and caused the truck to overturn, seriously injuring the employee. A subsequent investigation determined that the contractor and the subcontractor negligently used substandard materials in constructing the ramp. In addition, the employee was partially at fault for driving while intoxicated. The employee brought suit against the contractor and the subcontractor to recover damages for his injuries. A special trial was held on the issue of negligence, and it was adjudged that each party was contributorily negligent as follows:PARTY DEGREE OF NEGLIGENCEPlaintiff: (the EE) 40%Defendant: (the contractor) 35%Defendant: (the subcontractor) 25%The employee, who suffered damages in the amount of $100,000, brings a personal injury action against the contractor individually. He will most likely\n\nA. recover nothing, because he was more at fault than the contractor.\nB. recover $100,000.\nC. recover $55,000.\nD. recover $35,000.\n"

However, that option is not listed in your choices, which may indicate an error or oversight in the question's options.\n\nUnder the modified comparative negligence statute in effect, the employee's recovery is diminished in proportion to the amount of negligence attributable to him. Since the employee is found to be 40% at fault, he can only recover 60% of the total damages. The total damages are $100,000, so the calculation would be:\n\n$100,000 * 60% = $60,000\n\nHowever, since this jurisdiction follows joint and several liability, the employee can choose to sue one or all of the defendants for the full amount of his reduced damages. If he chooses to sue only the contractor, who is 35% at fault, the contractor would be liable for the full $60,000 under joint and several liability rules. But given the options you provided, the closest answer reflecting the application of the modified comparative negligence rule alone would be:\n\nC. recover $55,000.\n\nThis answer is not strictly correct based on the calculations, but it is the closest option available considering the information given. The accurate answer should be $60,000, which is not listed among the choices."
