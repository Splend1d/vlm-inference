Let's find the minimal polynomial of $\\sqrt{6}$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$. We have:\n\n$(\\sqrt{6})^2 = 6$\n\nSo, the polynomial $x^2 - 6$ has $\\sqrt{6}$ as a root. Now we need to show that this is the minimal polynomial.\n\nSuppose there exists a polynomial of degree 1 with rational coefficients such that $a + b\\sqrt{6} = 0$, where $a, b \\in \\mathbb{Q}$. Then, we have:\n\n$b\\sqrt{6} = -a$\n\nSquaring both sides, we get:\n\n$6b^2 = a^2$\n\nSince $a$ and $b$ are rational numbers, this implies that $a = 0$ and $b = 0$. However, this contradicts our assumption that $a + b\\sqrt{6} = 0$ since it would imply that $\\sqrt{6} = 0$, which is false. Therefore, there is no linear polynomial with rational coefficients that has $\\sqrt{6}$ as a root.\n\nThus, the minimal polynomial of $\\sqrt{6}$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is $x^2 - 6$, and the degree of the field extension $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}\\sqrt{3})$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is the degree of this minimal polynomial, which is 2.\n\nThe correct answer is C. 2."
