Prostaglandins are hormone-like substances that your body produces. During menstruation, your uterus releases prostaglandins to help it contract and shed its lining. If your body produces too many prostaglandins, the resulting strong uterine contractions can cause painful cramps.\n\nC. **highly sensitive nerve endings** can contribute to the perception of pain during menstrual cramps. The sensitivity of nerve endings can vary from person to person, which might explain why some individuals experience more severe cramping than others.\n\nB. An increased oxygen supply to the uterus is not typically associated with causing menstrual cramps. In fact, it's often the opposite\u2014reduced blood flow (and thus reduced oxygen supply) to the uterus due to strong contractions can lead to cramping.\n\nD. **frequent masturbation** has no direct link to causing menstrual cramps. Some people actually find that masturbation can relieve menstrual cramps by promoting relaxation and releasing endorphins, which are natural painkillers.\n\nSo, the correct answers are A (with the correction noted above) and C."
