Bakke (1978) was a landmark Supreme Court case that addressed the issue of affirmative action and racial quotas in the context of public university admissions. Allan Bakke, a white male applicant, challenged the University of California, Davis Medical School's admissions policy, which reserved 16 out of 100 seats for minority applicants. Bakke argued that this policy violated his constitutional rights under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The Supreme Court ruled that the use of rigid racial quotas was unconstitutional but affirmed that race could be considered as one factor in college admissions decisions to promote diversity."
