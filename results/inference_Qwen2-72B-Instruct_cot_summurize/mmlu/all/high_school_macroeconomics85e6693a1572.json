This action reduces the amount of excess reserves that banks have available to lend out. Since the money multiplier effect is based on the excess reserves that banks can lend, selling securities will reduce the potential for new loans and thus the money supply.\n\nThe formula to calculate the change in the money supply when reserves are changed is:\n\nChange in Money Supply = Change in Reserves * Money Multiplier\n\nwhere the Money Multiplier = 1 / Reserve Requirement Ratio\n\nGiven a reserve requirement of 10%, the money multiplier is:\n\nMoney Multiplier = 1 / 0.10 = 10\n\nIf the FED sells $29 million worth of securities, it means $29 million in reserves are removed from the banking system. The change in the money supply would then be:\n\nChange in Money Supply = $29 million * 10 = $290 million\n\nSince the FED is removing reserves, the change is a decrease, not an increase.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. decrease by $290 million."
