The cashier was nervous and moving slowly, and when she accidentally spilled all of the money out of the bag and onto the floor, the defendant shot her and left. The bullet lodged close to the cashier's spine, paralyzing her. The defendant was subsequently prosecuted and convicted of robbery and assault with a deadly weapon. Two months later, the cashier decided she wanted an operation to remove the bullet. The doctors warned the cashier that the procedure was very risky and could result in her death. The cashier decided to go ahead with the surgery and, unfortunately, died as a result. If the defendant is now prosecuted for felony murder, he should be found\n\nA. not guilty, because he was not the cause of the cashier's death.\nB. not guilty, because the subsequent prosecution violates double jeopardy.\nC. not guilty, because the cashier decided to have the surgery, aware of the risks.\nD. guilty, because he was the cause of the cashier's death.\n"

The legal principle of \"proximate cause\" holds that if someone's actions lead to a foreseeable harm, even if there are intervening events, they can still be held responsible for the ultimate harm. In this case, the defendant's actions (shooting the cashier) caused her injury and paralysis. The decision to undergo surgery was an understandable response to that injury, and although the surgery was risky, it would not have been necessary had the defendant not shot the cashier. Therefore, the defendant's actions can be seen as the proximate cause of the cashier's death.\n\nAs for option B, double jeopardy does not apply here. Double jeopardy protects individuals from being tried twice for the same crime. However, the defendant was not previously convicted of murder, only of robbery and assault with a deadly weapon. A charge of felony murder based on the cashier's death would be a new charge stemming from the same incident but addressing a different outcome (death rather than injury), and thus would not violate double jeopardy protections."
