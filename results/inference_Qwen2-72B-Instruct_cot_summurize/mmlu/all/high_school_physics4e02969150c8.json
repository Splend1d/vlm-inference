                    "text": "The correct answer is D. Nothing would happen.\n\nThe key concept in the photoelectric effect is not the intensity of the light but its frequency (or equivalently, its wavelength and energy). According to Einstein's explanation of the photoelectric effect, which won him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921, light can eject electrons from a metal surface if the energy of the photons (light particles) is greater than or equal to the work function of the metal. The work function is the minimum amount of energy required to remove an electron from the surface of the metal.\n\nIf low-intensity visible light of wavelength 550 nm (which corresponds to green light) does not produce photoelectrons, it means that the energy of these photons is less than the work function of the metal. Increasing the intensity of this light will not change the energy of the individual photons; it only increases the number of photons per unit area per unit time. Since the energy of each photon remains below the threshold required to overcome the work function, no photoelectrons will be produced regardless of how intense the light becomes.\n\nTherefore, increasing the intensity of light that is already insufficient to cause the photoelectric effect will not result in the emission of photoelectrons."
