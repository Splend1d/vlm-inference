Social constructivism employs theories of causality in the study of international relations, in addition to prioritising the study of identity as a socially constructed theory. In contrast, realism regards state of actor behaviour in the international system to follow an 'action-response' pattern.\nB. Realism regards identity as a crucial point for consideration in international relations. Realist theory is based on the assumption that identity informs behaviour.\nC. Realism is based in the notion of causality whilst social constructivism relies on theories of identity that are based in intersubjective meanings.\nD. Social constructivists regard the state as an independent unit whose behaviour is shaped by the requirements of the international system, whilst realists regard state interaction as being the natural progression of identity formulation.\n"

Realism is based in the notion of causality while social constructivism relies on theories of identity that are based in intersubjective meanings.\n\nRealism and social constructivism are two major theoretical perspectives in international relations that offer different explanations for how states behave and interact with one another. Realism assumes that states are rational actors that pursue their own interests in a self-help international system characterized by anarchy and competition. Realism focuses on power politics, military capabilities, and national security as the primary drivers of state behavior.\n\nIn contrast, social constructivism emphasizes the role of ideas, norms, and identities in shaping state behavior. Social constructivists argue that the identities of states are not fixed but rather are constructed through social interactions and shared understandings. These identities can influence state behavior in various ways, such as by shaping preferences, beliefs, and expectations.\n\nThus, while realism is based on the notion of causality, where state behavior is seen as a response to objective conditions and power dynamics, social constructivism relies on theories of identity that are based in intersubjective meanings. According to social constructivists, the identities of states are not simply given but are constructed through social interactions and shared understandings. As a result, state behavior is not solely determined by objective conditions but also by the subjective interpretations and meanings that states attach to those conditions."
