                    "text": "An actress went to a plastic surgeon for removal of an abnormal growth on her right cheek. Under a written contract, the plastic surgeon agreed to surgically remove the growth for $1,000. As the actress subsequently recalled, just before signing the agreement the parties orally agreed that if any additional medical procedures were required during surgery, they would be included in the $1,000 fee. The plastic surgeon, however, has no recollection of any such oral agreement. As agreed, the surgery was performed on an outpatient basis at the plastic surgeon's office. She applied a localized anesthesia that enabled the actress to remain conscious during surgery. While the operation was being performed, the plastic surgeon noticed another growth on the actress's neck. As the plastic surgeon subsequently recalled, she informed the actress about the growth and recommended that it be removed as well. According to the plastic surgeon's account, the actress orally agreed to have the growth removed for an additional $500. The actress has no recollection of any such oral agreement. The plastic surgeon performed both removal procedures satisfactorily. Following the surgery, the actress paid the plastic surgeon $1,000, but refused to pay any additional money for the removal of the second growth. After unsuccessfully attempting to collect the $500, the plastic surgeon brought suit against the actress to recover the additional fee. At trial, the plastic surgeon objected to the introduction of testimony regarding any oral agreement made before the written contract was signed. By the same token, the actress objected to the introduction of testimony concerning any oral agreement made during surgery. Will the plastic surgeon be entitled to recover the additional $500 if both offerings of parol evidence are admitted and believed?\n\nA. No, because the oral agreements contradict each other; neither would be enforceable under the so-called knock-out rule.\nB. No, because in removing the growth from the actress's neck, the plastic surgeon performed a legal duty already owed her that was neither doubtful nor the subject of an honest dispute.\nC. Yes, because the oral modification of the prior writing was fair and equitable in view of circumstances not anticipated by the parties when the writing was executed.\nD. Yes, because the actress would be unjustly enriched by not paying the additional $500, and injustice can be avoided only by enforcement of her oral promise.\n"

Yes, because the oral modification of the prior writing was fair and equitable in view of circumstances not anticipated by the parties when the writing was executed.\n\nIn this case, the oral agreement made during the surgery could be considered a valid modification of the original contract. The original contract covered the removal of the growth on the actress's cheek, but the discovery of the additional growth on her neck during the surgery created unforeseen circumstances. If the actress indeed orally agreed to have the second growth removed for an additional $500 during the surgery, and if this testimony is admitted and believed, then the oral modification could be enforceable. This is because it pertains to a new service (removal of the neck growth) that was not covered by the original contract, and the modification was made in good faith and due to unforeseen circumstances. The \"knock-out rule\" does not apply here because the oral agreements are not necessarily contradictory, and the concept of unjust enrichment does not directly address the issue of whether the modification was fair and equitable."
