None of these.\n\nAn ideal pulley system with no friction or mass in the ropes and pulleys would provide a mechanical advantage equal to the number of segments of rope supporting the load. In this case, if you're lifting a 100-N crate with only 25 N of force, that means you have a mechanical advantage of \\( \\frac{100\\,N}{25\\,N} = 4 \\).\n\nThis means there are 4 segments of rope supporting the load. For every meter of rope you pull down, the crate will rise \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) meter, because the force you apply is distributed over 4 segments of rope. Therefore, for every 1-meter length of rope pulled down, the crate rises 25 cm (or 0.25 meters). However, option A incorrectly lists this as \"25 cm\" without specifying the conversion to meters, which might lead to confusion, especially since \"25 m\" is also an option but clearly incorrect given the context. Thus, the most accurate representation isn't listed among the options provided, making the correct response D. None of these."
