They use a different method of transforming the model so that the probabilities lie between zero and one.\n\nExplanation:\nA. Logit and probit models are used when the dependent variable is binary (0/1). Both models transform the probability of the outcome occurring into a continuous variable that can range from 0 to 1. However, they do this using different functions: the logit model uses the logistic function, while the probit model uses the cumulative standard normal distribution function.\nB. This statement is incorrect because both the logit and probit models are designed to ensure that predicted probabilities fall strictly within the (0,1) interval. Neither model should result in too many observations with predicted probabilities of exactly 0 or 1.\nC. This statement is incorrect. In fact, for both logit and probit models, the marginal effect of a change in an explanatory variable is not simply the estimate of the parameter attached to that variable. The marginal effect depends on the values of the explanatory variables and is typically calculated at specific points of interest or as an average across all observations.\nD. This statement is incorrect. The probit model is based on the cumulative standard normal distribution function, not a cumulative logistic function. The logit model, on the other hand, is based on the logistic function."
