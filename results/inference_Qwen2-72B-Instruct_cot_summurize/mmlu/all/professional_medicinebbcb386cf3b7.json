Past medical history is negative for any similar episodes. He does not take any medications. He smokes cigarettes, has a 40\u00a0pack-year history, and consumes more than 8\u00a0cans of beer per day. Abdominal examination reveals epigastric tenderness. Laboratory studies reveal a serum amylase level of 467\u00a0U/L (reference range: 28-100\u00a0U/L) and a\u00a0\u03b3-glutamyltransferase\u00a0level of 212\u00a0U/L (reference range: <\u00a055\u00a0U/L). Referred pain in this patient is transmitted to the spinal cord by which of the following nerves?\n\nA. anterior rami of T1-T5\nB. anterior rami of T6-T10\nC. anterior rami of T11-T12\nD. posterior rami of T1-T5\n"

The specific thoracic levels that innervate the epigastric area are T6-T10. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. anterior rami of T6-T10\n\nThese nerves carry sensory information from the abdominal viscera, including the pancreas, which is likely the source of the patient's pain given his laboratory results and symptoms suggestive of acute pancreatitis."
