In 1997, the rancher conveyed the 200-acre tract for a consideration of one dollar, receipt of which was acknowledged, \"to my uncle, his heirs, and assigns, but if my uncle's wife dies without issue, to my personal assistant and her heirs and assigns. \"After taking possession of the 200-acre tract, the uncle discovered considerable oil reserves on the property. He then began oil drilling operations and removed large quantities of oil, which he sold. At no time did he give notice to the personal assistant of his oil-drilling activities. Months passed before the personal assistant learned that the uncle was selling oil from the drilling operations. The personal assistant has now brought an action in equity for an accounting of the value of the oil removed and for an injunction against any further oil removal.

Since the uncle was given possession of the 200-acre tract and there was no explicit reservation of mineral rights by the rancher, the uncle, as the possessor of the land, would have the right to extract and profit from the minerals found on the property, including oil. This right is typically considered an incident of the estate when possession is transferred, unless specifically reserved or excluded.\n\nOption A (the right to remove oil is an incident of a defeasible fee simple) could also be relevant, but the key point is that the uncle has possession and thus the right to exploit the natural resources on the property. Option B (the personal assistant has no interest in the 200-acre tract) is incorrect because the personal assistant does have a contingent remainder interest that would vest if certain conditions are met (i.e., if the uncle's wife dies without issue). Option C (there was no showing that the uncle acted in bad faith) might be a factor in equitable considerations, but it is not the primary legal basis for the uncle's right to remove oil."
