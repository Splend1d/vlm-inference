However, there is some evidence that suggests most Americans were unaware of the full extent of the Holocaust while it was happening.\n\nFor instance, a 1943 Roper survey found that 68% of Americans did not know what the term \"concentration camp\" meant. Furthermore, a Gallup poll from December 1942 showed that only 46% of Americans thought that Nazi Germany was \"trying to exterminate all the Jews in Europe,\" while 26% said they didn't think so, and 28% said they didn't know.\n\nGiven these data points, none of the options provided (A. 30%, B. 50%, C. 70%, D. 90%) directly match historical polling data. However, if we had to choose the closest option based on available information, option B (50%) might be the closest, but it's important to note that this does not accurately represent widespread knowledge or belief at the time. The true level of understanding about the Holocaust among the American public in 1943 was likely lower than 50%."
