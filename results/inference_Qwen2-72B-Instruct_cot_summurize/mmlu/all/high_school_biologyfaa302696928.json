Gastrulation.\n\nGastrulation is a crucial stage in embryonic development during which the blastula (a hollow sphere of cells) transforms into a gastrula with distinct cell layers. This process involves the movement and rearrangement of cells to form the three primary germ layers: the ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm. These layers will later give rise to all the tissues and organs of the adult organism."
