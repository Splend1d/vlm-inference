It is a measure of how much the output of an instrument changes in response to a small change in input. In other words, it is the ratio of the change in output to the change in input.\n\nResolution, on the other hand, is the smallest increment that can be detected by an instrument's display or output. Accuracy is the degree of closeness of measurements to the true value. Precision is the degree to which repeated measurements under unchanged conditions show the same results."
