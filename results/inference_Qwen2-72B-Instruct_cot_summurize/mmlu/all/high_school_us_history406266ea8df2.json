Moreover, I am cognizant of the interrelatedness of all communities and states. I cannot sit idly by in Atlanta and not be concerned about what happens in Birmingham. Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly affects all indirectly. Never again can we afford to live with the narrow, provincial 'outside agitator' idea. Anyone who lives inside the United States can never be considered an outsider anywhere in this country. . . .\"\n\u2014Martin Luther King, Jr., \"Letter from a Birmingham Jail,\" April 16, 1963\nOn which of these documents is Susan B.

In her speeches and writings, Anthony often cited the Declaration of Independence's assertion that \"all men are created equal\" as a basis for arguing that women should have equal rights, including the right to vote. She believed that the principles enshrined in the Declaration applied equally to women and that the government was failing to uphold its own founding ideals by denying women the full rights of citizenship."
