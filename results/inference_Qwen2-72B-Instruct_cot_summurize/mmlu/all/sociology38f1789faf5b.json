Discovery) are all examples of multi-media empires because they own a diverse array of media properties across various platforms, including film studios, television networks, music labels, publishing houses, and theme parks. They produce and distribute content globally through multiple channels, making them significant players in the entertainment industry. While they also have operations in multiple countries, which could suggest they have characteristics of transnational corporations (A), the primary descriptor that fits them best is that they are multi-media empires."
