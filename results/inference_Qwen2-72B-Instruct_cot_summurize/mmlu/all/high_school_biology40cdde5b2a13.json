This process occurs when two or more populations of a species evolve in different directions due to differences in their environments, leading to increased genetic divergence and the development of distinct characteristics. In the case of the Galapagos finches, each population adapted to its own specific ecological niche on the islands, resulting in a wide variety of beak shapes and sizes suited to different food sources."
