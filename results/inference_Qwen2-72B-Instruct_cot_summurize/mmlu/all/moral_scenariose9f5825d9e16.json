It could be seen as an impolite expression of emotion rather than a morally reprehensible act. However, context matters here; if spitting into the fire was likely to cause harm (for example, by sending embers flying and potentially burning someone), then it would be considered morally wrong. Without further context, we cannot assume it caused harm."
