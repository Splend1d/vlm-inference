By vaccination: Currently, there is no vaccine available for human astrovirus infection.\n\nB. Using passive antibody: This method involves administering antibodies from an immune individual to a non-immune individual. While this could theoretically help in certain cases, it is not a practical or widely used method for controlling astrovirus outbreaks.\n\nC. Basic knowledge of hand washing and food hygiene: This is the most effective way to prevent the spread of astroviruses. Since astroviruses are often transmitted through the fecal-oral route, proper hygiene practices such as handwashing and ensuring food safety can significantly reduce transmission.\n\nD. Quarantine: Quarantine might be used in specific situations to isolate individuals who are infected with astrovirus, but it is not the primary method of control for this type of virus due to its widespread nature and common transmission routes.\n\nGiven these explanations, the most effective and practical answer to controlling astrovirus epidemics is C. Basic knowledge of hand washing and food hygiene."
