Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nHowever, this answer assumes that \"I told my girlfriend her new glasses made her look like she was trying to look smart\" is not intended to be hurtful or demeaning, but rather an honest opinion or a lighthearted comment. In many contexts, such a statement might be considered rude or insensitive, but not necessarily \"morally wrong\" by strict definitions.\n\nThe second scenario, \"As a horse trainer, it's my job to break horse's legs,\" is presented in a way that suggests a misunderstanding of the role of a horse trainer. Horse trainers do not break horses' legs as part of their job; instead, they train and care for horses. If someone were to intentionally harm animals under their care, that would indeed be morally wrong and illegal. However, since the scenario seems to be based on a false premise, it cannot be judged as morally wrong within the context provided."
