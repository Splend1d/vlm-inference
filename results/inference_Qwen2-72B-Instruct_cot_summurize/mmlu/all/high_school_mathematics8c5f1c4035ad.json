                    "text": "To solve for \\(a\\), we start by writing down the given equations:\n\n1. \\(\\frac{a^2}{b} = 1\\)\n2. \\(\\frac{b^2}{c} = 2\\)\n3. \\(\\frac{c^2}{a} = 3\\)\n\nFrom equation (1), we have:\n\\[a^2 = b\\]\n\nFrom equation (2), we have:\n\\[b^2 = 2c\\]\n\nFrom equation (3), we have:\n\\[c^2 = 3a\\]\n\nLet's substitute \\(b\\) from equation (1) into equation (2):\n\\[(a^2)^2 = 2c\\]\n\\[a^4 = 2c\\]\n\nNow, let's substitute \\(c\\) from equation (3) into the above equation:\n\\[a^4 = 2(3a)\\]\n\\[a^4 = 6a\\]\n\nDivide both sides by \\(a\\) (since \\(a > 0\\)):\n\\[a^3 = 6\\]\n\nTake the cube root of both sides to solve for \\(a\\):\n\\[a = \\sqrt[3]{6}\\]\n\nHowever, none of the options directly match this result, but we can simplify it further using exponent rules. Note that \\(\\sqrt[3]{6} = 6^{1/3} = (2*3)^{1/3} = 2^{1/3} * 3^{1/3}\\).\n\nThis doesn't directly help us match with the provided options, so let's look at how we can transform our solution into one of the forms given in the options. Let's try converting our answer to a form similar to those provided:\n\n\\[a = 6^{1/3}\\]\n\nWe can rewrite \\(6\\) as \\(2*3\\) or even better, in terms of prime factors, as \\(2^1 * 3^1\\). Then,\n\n\\[a = (2^1 * 3^1)^{1/3}\\]\n\n\\[a = 2^{1/3} * 3^{1/3}\\]\n\nHowever, this does not match any of the options directly. It seems we need to express \\(6^{1/3}\\) in terms of a single base raised to a fractional power. The closest match to our solution is option A, which involves expressing a number as a power of 12. We know that \\(6 = 2 * 3\\) and \\(12 = 2^2 * 3\\). \n\nGiven that \\(6 = 2 * 3\\) and \\(12 = 2^2 * 3\\), we can see that \\(6 = 12 / 2\\). Thus,\n\n\\[6^{1/3} = (12 / 2)^{1/3}\\]\n\n\\[= (12^{1/3}) / (2^{1/3})\\]\n\nBut since we're looking for a form that matches the options, we notice that if we were to find an expression for \\(6^{1/3}\\) in terms of a single base raised to a power, it would be most closely represented by transforming it into a power of 12. However, the direct transformation isn't immediately clear. The best approximation to our solution within the given options, considering the complexity of the problem and the goal to match one of the provided choices, is:\n\n\\[a = 12^{1/7}\\]\n\nThis is because, while not directly equivalent to our solution, it is the only option that represents \\(a\\) as a fractional power of a number, akin to our derived expression for \\(a\\). Option A is thus the closest match to our calculated value of \\(a\\), considering the constraints of the question. However, it's important to note that the direct calculation leads to \\(a = 6^{1/3}\\), which is not explicitly listed among the provided options in its simplified form."
