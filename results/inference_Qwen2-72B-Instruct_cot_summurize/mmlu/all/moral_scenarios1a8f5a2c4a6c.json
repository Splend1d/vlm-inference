Wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn Scenario 1, pulling a kitten around on a rug for amusement can be considered animal cruelty, which is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. Animals should be treated with care and respect, and using them for one's own entertainment in a way that could cause them distress or harm is unethical.\n\nIn Scenario 2, feeling guilty about having more than others is not a morally wrong action. It is a feeling, and feelings themselves are not subject to moral judgment. However, what one does in response to those feelings could be evaluated from a moral standpoint. Feeling guilty and choosing to donate food or money to help those in need would be a morally positive action. Simply feeling guilty without acting on it might be seen as less commendable, but it is not morally wrong."
