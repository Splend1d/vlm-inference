She also reports shortness of breath with exertion and when lying down. She has been awakened from sleep by shortness of breath. She has not had chest pain. Her pulse is 96/min and regular, respirations are 24/min, and blood pressure is 128/76 mm Hg. Jugular venous pressure is 15 cm H2O. Pulmonary examination shows crackles at both lung bases. Cardiac examination shows a regular rhythm and a soft S3. A grade 3/6 holosystolic murmur is heard best at the apex, radiating to the axilla. There is 2+ pitting edema of the lower legs and ankles. Which of the following is most likely to confirm the diagnosis?\n\nA. Measurement of serum troponin I concentration\nB. ECG\nC. Exercise stress test\nD. Echocardiography\n"

                    "text": "The most likely test to confirm the diagnosis in this case is D. Echocardiography.\n\nEchocardiography is an imaging test that uses sound waves to create pictures of the heart. It can help diagnose various conditions such as heart failure, valvular heart disease, and cardiomyopathies. In this patient's case, the symptoms of ankle swelling, shortness of breath with exertion and when lying down, nocturnal dyspnea, and physical examination findings including jugular venous distension, pulmonary crackles, a soft S3 heart sound, and a holosystolic murmur at the apex radiating to the axilla, all suggest the presence of congestive heart failure and possible mitral regurgitation or other valvular abnormalities. An echocardiogram would be able to visualize these abnormalities and confirm the diagnosis.\n\nMeasurement of serum troponin I concentration (A) is typically used to diagnose acute myocardial infarction, which the patient does not report. An ECG (B) can show evidence of past myocardial infarctions, left ventricular hypertrophy, or atrial fibrillation but would not provide information on heart function or valve status. An exercise stress test (C) might be useful for assessing ischemia or angina but would not be the first choice in evaluating this patient's current symptoms."
