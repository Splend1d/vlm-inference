Without knowing the student\u2019s opportunity cost of studying, we have no way of knowing whether or not her marginal benefits outweigh her marginal costs.\n\nExplanation: The question does not provide enough information to determine the relationship between the marginal benefit and marginal cost of the fourth hour of studying. We would need to know the student's opportunity cost (what else she could be doing with her time) and how effective this additional hour of studying will be in improving her performance on the exam. Without this information, we cannot determine if the marginal benefit of the fourth hour of studying is greater than, equal to, or less than its marginal cost."
