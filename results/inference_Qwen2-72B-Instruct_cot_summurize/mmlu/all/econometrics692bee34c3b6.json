                    "text": "The Durbin-Watson test statistic ranges from 0 to 4, and it is used to detect the presence of autocorrelation in the residuals from a regression analysis. A value of 2 indicates no autocorrelation. Values significantly below 2 (closer to 0) indicate positive autocorrelation, while values significantly above 2 (closer to 4) indicate negative autocorrelation.\n\nGiven a Durbin-Watson test statistic value of 1.53, which is less than 2 but not extremely low, suggests some degree of positive autocorrelation in the residuals. However, to make a definitive conclusion, one would typically compare this test statistic to critical values for the Durbin-Watson statistic based on the number of observations (n = 50) and the number of regressors (k = 3 including the constant).\n\nWithout the specific lower and upper critical values for n = 50 and k = 3, we can't definitively conclude whether the residuals are positively autocorrelated or if the test result is inconclusive. Typically, if the test statistic falls within the range of these critical values, the result is considered inconclusive.\n\nHowever, based solely on the information given and assuming a typical interpretation where values significantly below 2 suggest positive autocorrelation, the most likely answer is:\n\nA. Residuals appear to be positively autocorrelated\n\nBut it's important to note that without consulting the critical values, this conclusion could potentially be D. The test result is inconclusive, if the value of 1.53 falls within the inconclusive range defined by the lower and upper critical values for the Durbin-Watson test statistic."
