This is indeed the fallacy of composition, which is option C.\n\nThe fallacy of composition occurs when someone assumes that what holds true for individual components of a system will also hold true for the system as a whole. For example, if every player on a soccer team is excellent, it does not necessarily follow that the team as a whole will win the championship.\n\nIn contrast:\n- A. Gambler's Fallacy is the belief that past events affect the likelihood of future independent events.\n- B. Equivocation is when someone uses a word with multiple meanings in an argument without clarifying which meaning they intend, leading to confusion or misinterpretation.\n- D. Appeal to Pity is an attempt to win an argument by eliciting feelings of pity rather than using logical reasoning.\n\nSo, given your description, the most likely answer is indeed C. Fallacy of Composition."
