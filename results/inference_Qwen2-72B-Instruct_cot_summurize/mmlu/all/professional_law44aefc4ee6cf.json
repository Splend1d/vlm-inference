Late one night, the defendant broke into the bar and proceeded to load large kegs of beer onto his truck. As he was leaving, the defendant inadvertently threw his cigarette butt into a trash can behind the bar. Soon afterward, the trash ignited into a small fire. Although the defendant had time to douse the fire without any danger to himself, he did not do so. Instead, he climbed into the truck and drove away. Although the fire spread beyond the trashcan, the fire department responded quickly and was able to put it out. The floor behind the bar was charred. The statutes for both burglary and arson in this jurisdiction include residential and business structures. The defendant should be convicted of which of the following crimes?\n\nA. Arson, burglary, and larceny.\nB. Arson and burglary.\nC. Larceny and burglary.\nD. Arson, robbery, and burglary.\n"

Burglary: The defendant broke into the bar with the intent to commit theft inside, which is the definition of burglary.\n\n2. Larceny (or Theft): The defendant stole large kegs of beer from the bar, constituting larceny or theft.\n\n3. Arson: By throwing his cigarette butt into the trash can and failing to extinguish the resulting fire, the defendant caused a fire to the property. Even though the fire department was able to put out the fire, the defendant's actions intentionally or recklessly caused damage by fire, which meets the criteria for arson.\n\n4. Robbery: This crime involves taking property directly from a person or in their presence through force or threat. Since the defendant did not take the beer directly from a person or under the threat of force, robbery does not apply in this scenario.\n\nGiven these details, the correct answer would be:\n\nA. Arson, burglary, and larceny.\n\nThis choice includes all the crimes the defendant actually committed based on the provided information."
