In Scenario 1, placing one's grandmother in a nursing home against her wishes is generally seen as a violation of her autonomy and could be considered morally wrong, especially if there were no compelling reasons for doing so that would outweigh her preferences. In Scenario 2, refusing to hire someone based on their gender is clearly discriminatory and violates principles of equality and fairness, making it morally wrong."
