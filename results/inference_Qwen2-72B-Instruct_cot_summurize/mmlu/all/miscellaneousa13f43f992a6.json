While there have been Popes named Leo (including the famous Leo I, the Great), Lando (Lando I), and Linus (the second Pope after St. Peter), there has never been a Pope named Lawrence. However, it's worth noting that Lawrence is the English form of the name Lorenzo, and there have been Popes named Lorenzo (such as Pope St. Lawrence III). But since the question specifically asks about the name \"Lawrence,\" the answer remains that no Pope has ever had this exact name."
