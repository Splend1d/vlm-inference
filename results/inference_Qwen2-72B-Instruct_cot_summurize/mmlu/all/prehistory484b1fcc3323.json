These include massive stone heads, altars, and thrones that depict rulers and deities, as well as complex ceremonial sites such as La Venta and San Lorenzo. The Olmec are considered to be one of the earliest complex societies in Mesoamerica, and their monumental architecture reflects their sophisticated political and religious systems."
