Without additional context, it's impossible to provide an accurate answer. The numbers provided (36,000, 12,000, 24,000, and 7,000) are all significant in various religious texts and historical events, but without knowing which tradition or story this question is based on, none of these can be confirmed as correct. If this is from a Buddhist context, for instance, the numbers could potentially relate to the numbers of disciples of the Buddha, but again, without more information, it's not possible to give a definitive answer. Could you please provide more details or context?"
