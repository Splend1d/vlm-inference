His pulse is 80/min, and blood pressure is 130/70 mm Hg. The lungs are clear to auscultation. Cardiac examination shows an S4. While undergoing an ECG, the patient says that he feels the chest pain returning. The most appropriate immediate treatment is a drug with which of the following mechanisms of action?\n\nA. Increases cAMP concentration\nB. Increases nitric oxide concentration\nC. Inhibits potassium flux\nD. Inhibits sodium flux\n"

                    "text": "The most appropriate immediate treatment for this patient would be a drug that increases nitric oxide concentration (Option B). Nitric oxide (NO) is a potent vasodilator that can help relieve angina by relaxing vascular smooth muscle, decreasing peripheral resistance, and reducing the workload on the heart. This effect is particularly useful during episodes of chest pain, as it can help to reduce myocardial oxygen demand and improve coronary artery blood flow.\n\nDrugs that increase nitric oxide concentration include nitrates such as sublingual nitroglycerin, which is often used in the acute management of angina pectoris. By increasing NO levels, these drugs cause relaxation of smooth muscles in the arterial walls, leading to vasodilation and decreased preload, which in turn reduces the workload on the heart and helps to alleviate chest pain.\n\nIn contrast, drugs that increase cyclic AMP (cAMP) concentration (Option A) are usually beta-adrenergic agonists, which can increase heart rate and contractility, potentially worsening ischemia in the setting of coronary artery disease. Inhibitors of potassium flux (Option C) or sodium flux (Option D) typically refer to antiarrhythmic medications, which do not have a primary role in the acute management of angina unless there is an associated arrhythmia."
