However, given that Peter Singer is known for his utilitarian ethics and strong advocacy for animal rights and effective altruism, it's likely that he would favor a stronger version of any ethical principle that aligns with these views.\n\nIf we consider a common scenario in discussions of Singer's work, where the two principles might relate to the duty to help others or prevent suffering, then option A (he considers the stronger version to be correct) seems more plausible based on his philosophical stance.\n\nHowever, for a precise answer, one would need to refer to the exact text or article where Singer discusses these two versions of the principle. Singer often argues for positions that some might consider radical or extreme by conventional standards, so it wouldn't be surprising if he favored the stronger version of an ethical principle when faced with a choice between two."
