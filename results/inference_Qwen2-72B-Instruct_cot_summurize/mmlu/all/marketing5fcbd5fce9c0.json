Price guarantee schemes are aimed at providing customers with the peace of mind of knowing that the company they are purchasing from is competitive in price.\n\nPrice assurance programs typically offer to match or beat a competitor's lower price, while price guarantee schemes promise to refund the difference if the customer finds a lower price within a certain period after purchase. These programs can help build trust and confidence in the company's pricing strategy, encouraging customers to make a purchase without worrying about finding a better deal elsewhere. \n\nA. Price competitiveness refers to a company's ability to offer products or services at prices that are competitive with those of its rivals, but it does not necessarily provide the same level of reassurance as a price assurance or guarantee program.\n\nC. Reference prices are the prices that consumers use as a benchmark when evaluating the prices of similar products or services, but they do not necessarily indicate whether a company is competitive in price or provide any guarantees or assurances to customers."
