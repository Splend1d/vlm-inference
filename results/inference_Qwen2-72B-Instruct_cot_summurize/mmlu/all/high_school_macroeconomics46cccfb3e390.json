If the Federal Reserve is concerned about this effect, it would want to lower interest rates to encourage private investment and offset the impact of government borrowing on the economy.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. expansionary monetary policy by lowering the discount rate.\n\nLowering the discount rate makes it cheaper for banks to borrow from the Federal Reserve, which can lead to lower interest rates throughout the economy and potentially stimulate private investment. This action would counteract the crowding-out effect. However, it's worth noting that selling Treasury securities (option B) would actually be a contractionary monetary policy move, as it would remove liquidity from the banking system and likely raise interest rates, exacerbating the crowding-out effect."
