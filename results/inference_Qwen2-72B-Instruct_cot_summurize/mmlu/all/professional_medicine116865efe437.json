The elevated eosinophil count further supports this suspicion.\n\nAmong the options given:\n\nA. Blood smear - This can be useful for detecting some parasites, but it is not the most specific test for diagnosing parasitic infections that affect the gastrointestinal tract.\n\nB. Bone marrow biopsy - This is not typically used to diagnose parasitic infections affecting the gastrointestinal system.\n\nC. KOH preparation - This is used for identifying fungal infections, not parasitic ones.\n\nD. Microscopic examination of the stool - This is the most appropriate test for diagnosing parasitic infections of the gastrointestinal tract, including those that could cause the symptoms described. It allows for the identification of ova (eggs), larvae, or adult forms of various parasites that may be present in the stool.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **D. Microscopic examination of the stool**."
