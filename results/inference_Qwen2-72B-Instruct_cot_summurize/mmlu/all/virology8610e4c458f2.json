Since the statement is about the absence of new cases within a specific timeframe, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Incidence\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the statement itself is describing the incidence rate being zero during that period, not giving a typical measurement of incidence which would involve numbers of cases and the size of the population at risk. But among the options given, incidence is the most appropriate term to describe what is being stated. The other options (lifetime expectancy, lifetime prevalence, and period prevalence) do not fit the description provided."
