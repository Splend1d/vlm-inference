The population given is 836,527.\n\nThe thousands digit in this number is 6, and the hundreds digit (which determines whether the thousands digit rounds up or down) is 5. Since the hundreds digit is 5 or greater, you round the thousands digit up by one.\n\nThus, rounding 836,527 to the nearest ten thousand gives you 840,000.\n\nSo the correct answer is:\n\nD. 840,000"
