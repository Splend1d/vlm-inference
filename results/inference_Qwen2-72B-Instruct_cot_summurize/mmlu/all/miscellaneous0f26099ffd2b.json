This group includes animals such as fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. While some chordates (such as lancelets and tunicates) do not have a permanent backbone, they still have a notochord, which is a flexible rod that can be considered a precursor to the backbone. Mollusks, invertebrates, and echinoderms do not necessarily have backbones or spinal cords."
