They have a right publicly to remonstrate against the abuses of power in the strongest terms, to put their neighbors upon their guard against the craft or open violence of men in authority, and to assert with courage the sense they have of the blessings of liberty, the value they put upon it, and their resolution at all hazards to preserve it as one of the greatest blessings heaven can bestow.\u2026 But to conclude: The question before the Court and you, Gentlemen of the jury, is not of small or private concern. It is not the cause of one poor printer, nor of New York alone, which you are now trying. No! It may in its consequence affect every free man that lives under a British government on the main of America. It is the best cause. It is the cause of liberty. And I make no doubt but your upright conduct this day will not only entitle you to the love and esteem of your fellow citizens, but every man who prefers freedom to a life of slavery will bless and honor you as men who have baffled the attempt of tyranny, and by an impartial and uncorrupt verdict have laid a noble foundation for securing to ourselves, our posterity, and our neighbors, that to which nature and the laws of our country have given us a right to liberty of both exposing and opposing arbitrary power (in these parts of the world at least) by speaking and writing truth.\n\u2014Andrew Hamilton, concluding argument, libel trial of newspaper editor\nJohn Peter Zenger, August 4, 1735\nAndrew Hamilton assumes which of the following?\n\nA. Americans have more freedoms than people in other countries.\nB. People in other countries have more rights than Americans.\nC. Natural rights are merely ideas that don't really exist.\nD. Rights are granted by the government.\n"

Natural rights are real and must be protected, particularly the right to speak and write the truth without fear of censorship or retribution from those in power. He also implies that these rights are inherent to all free men and are not granted by the government but are instead recognized and protected by it. This is evident in his statement that \"it is a right, which all free men claim\" and that \"nature and the laws of our country have given us a right to liberty.\" Additionally, he asserts that the cause being argued could affect \"every free man that lives under a British government on the main of America,\" suggesting a belief in universal rights applicable beyond just American borders.
