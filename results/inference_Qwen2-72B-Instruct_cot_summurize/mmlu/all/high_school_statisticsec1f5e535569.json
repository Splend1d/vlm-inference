Approximately 95% of the outcomes will be within two standard deviations of the mean.\n\nWhile it is true that for many distributions, such as the normal distribution, approximately 95% of the data falls within two standard deviations of the mean, this rule does not apply universally to all distributions, including discrete ones. For example, if you have a discrete random variable with very skewed probabilities or one that has a large number of possible outcomes with low probabilities and just a few with high probabilities, then less than 95% of the outcomes might fall within two standard deviations of the mean. This is because the empirical rule (or 68-95-99.7 rule) specifically applies to normally distributed data, and not all discrete random variables follow a normal distribution."
