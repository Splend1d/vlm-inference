A Union of African states will project more effectively the African personality. It will command respect from a world that has regard only for size and influence. The scant attention paid to African opposition to the French atomic tests in the Sahara, and the ignominious spectacle of the U.N. in the Congo quibbling about constitutional niceties while the Republic was tottering into anarchy, are evidence of the callous disregard of African Independence by the Great Powers.\"\nKwame Nkrumah, Ghanian leader, 1961\nThe passage is most clearly an example of which of the following?\n\nA. Responses to failed unification attempts in Africa\nB. A plea for the United Nations to intervene in Africa\nC. A proposal to increase the standing of Africa in the modern world\nD. Ardent opposition to the influence of capitalism in Africa\n"
