They follow a group of individuals over time, assessing exposure (in this case, sugar consumption) at the beginning of the study and then monitoring the development of the outcome (dental caries) over the course of the study. This design allows researchers to establish temporal relationships between exposure and outcome, making it particularly suitable for studying the long-term effects of diet on health."
