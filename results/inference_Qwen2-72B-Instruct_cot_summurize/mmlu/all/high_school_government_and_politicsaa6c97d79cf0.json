The Senate may use the filibuster to block an executive order.\n\nThe filibuster is a tactic used in the Senate to prevent a vote on a bill or other matter, but it does not apply to executive orders issued by the President. Executive orders are directives issued by the President that have the force of law, but they do not require approval from Congress. While Congress can pass legislation to limit or overturn an executive order, the filibuster is not a mechanism for doing so. The other options listed are all ways in which the legislative branch can check the power of the executive branch."
