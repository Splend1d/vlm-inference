Then, we can determine how many moles of the metal reacted and from there calculate the molar mass of the metal.\n\nThe balanced chemical equation for the reaction between a metal (let's assume it's a monovalent metal for simplicity) and hydrochloric acid (HCl) is:\n\n\\[ \\text{M} + 2\\text{HCl} \\rightarrow \\text{MCl}_2 + \\text{H}_2 \\]\n\nHowever, since we're only interested in the production of hydrogen gas (\\(H_2\\)) and the mass of the metal that reacts with one mole of hydrochloric acid, we'll focus on the stoichiometry of \\(H_2\\) to \\(\\text{M}\\) which, in this case, is 1:1 if we consider a monovalent metal. The actual valency of the metal does not matter for the purpose of calculating the mass of the metal that reacts with one mole of HCl because the question is asking for the mass of metal that reacts with one mole of HCl, not the exact stoichiometry of the reaction.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of moles of hydrogen gas produced. We know that 1 mole of any gas at STP occupies 22.4 L (or 22,400 mL). The volume of hydrogen gas produced was given as 28.3 mL.\n\nThe number of moles of hydrogen gas (\\(n_{H_2}\\)) can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[ n = \\frac{V}{V_m} \\]\n\nwhere \\(V\\) is the volume of the gas in liters at STP and \\(V_m\\) is the molar volume of a gas at STP (22.4 L/mol).\n\n\\[ n_{H_2} = \\frac{28.3 \\, \\text{mL}}{22,400 \\, \\text{mL/mol}} = \\frac{28.3}{22,400} \\, \\text{mol} = 0.00126 \\, \\text{mol} \\]\n\nSince the stoichiometry of the metal to hydrogen gas is 1:1, 0.00126 mol of the metal reacted to produce 0.00126 mol of hydrogen gas.\n\nGiven that 0.0623 grams of the metal produced 0.00126 mol of hydrogen gas, we can calculate the molar mass of the metal (\\(M_m\\)) using the formula:\n\n\\[ M_m = \\frac{\\text{mass of metal}}{\\text{number of moles of metal}} \\]\n\n\\[ M_m = \\frac{0.0623 \\, \\text{g}}{0.00126 \\, \\text{mol}} = 49.44 \\, \\text{g/mol} \\]\n\nThis value is closest to option D, which is 49.3 g. Therefore, the correct answer is D. 49.3 g. However, please note that the calculated value is slightly higher than the option provided due to rounding during calculations."
