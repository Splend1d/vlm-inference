In Japanese Buddhism, Mapp\u014d (\u672b\u6cd5) refers to the era of degeneration or decline of the Dharma, believed to have begun around the 11th century and lasting for ten thousand years. During this period, it is said that the true teachings of the Buddha will be lost, and people will be unable to attain enlightenment through traditional means. This concept has had a significant impact on Japanese culture and history, influencing everything from religious practices to political developments."
