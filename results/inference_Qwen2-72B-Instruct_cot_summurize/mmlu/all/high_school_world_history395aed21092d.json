These are lands that the Winter King lost in battle.\n\nIn the context of the song, \"Rhine and Prague\" are mentioned because they represent territories that the Winter King (Frederick V of the Palatinate) attempted to control during the Thirty Years' War but ultimately lost. The Winter King's claim to the Bohemian throne led to his defeat at the Battle of White Mountain near Prague in 1620, after which he was forced to flee and lost his influence over the Rhineland as well. Thus, the mention of these places highlights the consequences of the Winter King's actions and serves as a reminder of his failed ambitions."
