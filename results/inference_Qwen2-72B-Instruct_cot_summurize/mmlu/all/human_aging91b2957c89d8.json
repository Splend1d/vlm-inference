Those who experience high environmental demands become more docile\n\nThis concept suggests that individuals who face high levels of environmental demands, such as stress or adversity, may adapt by becoming more docile or submissive as a coping mechanism. This can be seen in various contexts, including social, educational, and occupational environments. The hypothesis implies that docility might be a learned behavior in response to challenging conditions. However, it's important to note that the relationship between environmental demands and docility can be complex and may not always lead to increased docility, depending on other factors like individual resilience and support systems."
