This concept is most closely associated with option A: the addition of non-basic workers to an urban economy that has added more basic workers.\n\nIn this context, \"basic\" workers are those employed in industries that sell goods or services outside the local area, bringing new money into the local economy. \"Non-basic\" workers are those employed in industries that serve the local market, such as retail, restaurants, and other service sectors. When an urban economy adds more basic workers (e.g., due to the establishment of a new factory), these workers spend their income within the local economy, supporting non-basic jobs. This spending generates additional income for others, who then spend their income, leading to a cascade of economic activity that amplifies the initial impact of the new jobs. This amplification is known as the multiplier effect."
