The set \\(aH\\) is called a left coset of \\(H\\) in \\(G\\), and \\(Ha\\) is a right coset. The number of elements in each coset (the size of the coset) is equal to the order of the subgroup \\(H\\). This is because the operation that takes an element \\(h \\in H\\) to \\(ah\\) or \\(ha\\) is bijective for any fixed \\(a \\in G\\), meaning it maps elements from \\(H\\) to \\(aH\\) or \\(Ha\\) without repetition. Hence, the cardinalities \\(|aH|\\) and \\(|Ha|\\) are indeed equal to the order of \\(H\\).\n\nStatement 2: If \\(H\\) is a subgroup of \\(G\\) and \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) belong to \\(G\\), then \\(aH\\) and \\(Hb\\) are identical or disjoint.\n\nThis statement is also true. For any two cosets of \\(H\\) in \\(G\\), either they are identical or they are disjoint. This is a fundamental property of cosets. If \\(aH\\) and \\(Hb\\) have a common element, say \\(x\\), then \\(x = ah_1 = h_2b\\) for some \\(h_1, h_2 \\in H\\). It can be shown that this implies \\(aH = Hb\\). If there is no common element, then by definition, the sets are disjoint.\n\nTherefore, both statements are true.\n\nThe correct answer is A. True, True."
