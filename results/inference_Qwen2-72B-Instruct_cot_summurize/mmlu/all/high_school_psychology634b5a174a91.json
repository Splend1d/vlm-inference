An external event causes us to experience a specific emotion, and this emotion triggers certain physiological changes to occur.\nB. When our body responds to an external event, our brain interprets the biological changes as a specific emotion.\nC. Each person follows a predictable pattern of changes in response to stress, including alarm, resistance, and exhaustion.\nD. A combination of psychological changes and our cognitive interpretations combine to produce our emotional experiences.\n"

A combination of psychological changes and our cognitive interpretations combine to produce our emotional experiences.\n\nStanley Schachter's two-factor theory of emotion suggests that emotions result from a combination of physiological arousal and cognitive interpretation. This theory posits that first, there is a general physiological arousal, which is then cognitively interpreted based on the situation or context, leading to a specific emotional experience."
