Viral RNA level: The higher the viral load (amount of HIV) in the bodily fluids of an infected person, the greater the risk of transmission.\nB. Presence of other infections: Having other sexually transmitted infections or certain types of inflammation can increase the likelihood of HIV transmission.\nC. Condom use: Consistent and correct use of condoms significantly reduces the risk of HIV transmission during sexual activity.\n\nThese factors, among others like the type of sexual act and the presence of antiretroviral therapy in the HIV-positive partner, can influence the probability of HIV transmission."
