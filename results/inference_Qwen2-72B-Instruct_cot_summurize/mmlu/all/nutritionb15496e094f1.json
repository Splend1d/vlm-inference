The amino acid pattern of human tissue protein is assumed to be the requirement patterns for infants and young children.\n\nThis statement is not entirely accurate as it stands, but it can be modified to be more correct: \"The amino acid pattern of breast milk is often used as a reference for the amino acid requirements of infants and young children, as it closely matches the amino acid composition required for growth and development.\"\n\nAmino acid requirements vary by age, sex, health status, and other factors. For infants, the amino acid requirements are often based on the amino acid profile found in breast milk because it provides optimal nutrition for their growth and development. As individuals grow older, their amino acid requirements change, and adult requirements are determined through different methods, such as nitrogen balance studies."
