                    "text": "A male neonate, who was born at 36 weeks' gestation 2 hours ago in the labor and delivery unit of the hospital, now shows signs of respiratory difficulty. The mother, an 18-year-old primigravid woman, smoked one pack of cigarettes daily throughout her pregnancy. She received prenatal care during most of the pregnancy. One episode of chlamydial cervicitis was detected during the last trimester and treated with azithromycin. The neonate was born via cesarean delivery due to fetal heart rate decelerations. The amniotic fluid was stained with light particulate meconium. Apgar scores were 9 and 9 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. The patient is 50 cm (20 in; 50th percentile) long and weighs 3005 g (6 lb 10 oz; 50th percentile); head circumference is 35 cm (14 in; 50th percentile). The infant's vital signs now are temperature 36.6\u00b0C (97.8\u00b0F), pulse 150/min, and respirations 70/min. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 95%. Physical examination discloses mild subcostal and intercostal retractions. Chest x-ray shows prominent pulmonary vascular markings and fluid in the intralobar fissures. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\n\nA. Group B streptococcal sepsis\nB. Meconium aspiration syndrome\nC. Respiratory distress syndrome\nD. Transient tachypnea of newborn\n"

                    "text": "The most likely diagnosis for this neonate given the history and physical examination findings is D. Transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN). \n\nThe infant's history includes prematurity (36 weeks' gestation), maternal smoking during pregnancy, and exposure to meconium-stained amniotic fluid. Although these factors can be associated with various neonatal conditions, the clinical presentation of tachypnea, mild retractions, normal oxygen saturation, and chest X-ray findings of prominent pulmonary vascular markings and fluid in the intralobar fissures are characteristic of TTN.\n\n- Group B streptococcal sepsis (option A) would typically present with more severe systemic symptoms such as fever, hypotension, or signs of shock.\n- Meconium aspiration syndrome (option B) is possible given the history of meconium-stained amniotic fluid, but it usually presents with more severe respiratory distress, cyanosis, and often requires mechanical ventilation.\n- Respiratory distress syndrome (option C), which is common in preterm infants, would also present with more severe respiratory distress and typically lower oxygen saturation levels.\n\nThus, the most probable diagnosis based on the provided information is transient tachypnea of the newborn. This condition is characterized by rapid breathing that resolves over the first few days of life without significant intervention."
