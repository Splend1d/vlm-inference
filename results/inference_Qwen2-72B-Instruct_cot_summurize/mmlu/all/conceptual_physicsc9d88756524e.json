Each color is bent at a slightly different angle because each color has a different wavelength and thus refracts (bends) differently as it passes through the prism. The colors are separated in order from the least bent to the most bent: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet.\n\nGreen light is bent more than red light but less than blue or violet light. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. red light."
