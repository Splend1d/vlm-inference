This perspective holds that war and violence are unjustifiable means of resolving conflicts, and that peaceful methods should be pursued instead. Just war theory (A) and jus ad bellum (D) are related concepts that outline the conditions under which war might be considered morally justifiable, while moral nihilism (C) is an entirely different philosophical position that denies the existence of objective moral truths."
