                    "text": "The key to answering this question lies in understanding how the number of trials (flips) affects the probability of achieving certain outcomes, which is governed by the laws of probability and statistics, specifically the binomial distribution and the central limit theorem.\n\nFor the first game, where you want to achieve between 45% and 55% heads, you are aiming for an outcome close to the expected value of a fair coin flip, which is 50%. According to the law of large numbers, as the number of trials increases, the observed proportion will tend closer to the true probability (in this case, 50%). Therefore, it's easier to stay within a range around 50% with a larger number of flips because the results will be less variable. So, for the first game, you'd prefer 300 flips.\n\nFor the second game, you're trying to get more than 80% heads. This is a much more extreme event and deviates significantly from the expected value of 50%. With fewer flips, there's a higher chance of getting such a skewed result due to the greater variability in outcomes. As the number of flips increases, the likelihood of deviating so far from the expected value decreases due to the narrowing of the standard deviation around the mean. Hence, for the second game, you'd prefer 30 flips.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nD. 300 times for the first game and 30 times for the second."
