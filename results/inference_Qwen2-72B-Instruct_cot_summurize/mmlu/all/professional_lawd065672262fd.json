After a doctor reset the broken nose, the patient was transferred to a room in the west wing of the hospital. In extreme pain, the patient asked the nurse for a painkiller. Without seeking the doctor's approval, the nurse administered an injection of morphine, which the nurse should have known to be an excessive dosage. The patient died an hour after the injection; the cause of death was a morphine overdose. The nurse's injection of morphine to this patient would most likely constitute\n\nA. a cause-in-fact, but not a legal cause of the patient's death.\nB. a legal cause, but not a cause-in-fact of the patient's death.\nC. a cause-in-fact and a legal cause of the patient's death.\nD. neither a legal cause nor a cause-in-fact of the patient's death.\n"

In this case, it is clear that but for the nurse's administration of an excessive dosage of morphine, the patient would not have died from a morphine overdose. Therefore, the nurse's actions were a cause-in-fact of the patient's death.\n\nLegal cause, also known as proximate cause, involves determining whether the defendant's conduct was sufficiently related to the harm to hold the defendant legally responsible. Legal cause is typically established by showing that the harm was a foreseeable result of the defendant's conduct and that there were no intervening causes that broke the chain of causation. In this case, it can be argued that the nurse's administration of an excessive dosage of morphine was a foreseeable result of her actions and there were no intervening causes that broke the chain of causation. Therefore, the nurse's actions were a legal cause of the patient's death."
