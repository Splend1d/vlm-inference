Civil and political rights\n\nThe European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), drafted by the Council of Europe in 1950, primarily focuses on civil and political rights. These include the right to life, prohibition of torture, freedom from slavery and forced labor, the right to liberty and security, fair trial rights, respect for private and family life, freedom of thought, conscience, and religion, freedom of expression, freedom of assembly and association, and the right to marry and found a family. It also includes provisions against discrimination in the enjoyment of these rights.\n\nWhile the ECHR does touch upon some economic and social rights through its Protocol No. 1, which includes the protection of property and the right to education, it is not predominantly focused on economic and social rights or environmental rights. Economic freedom is not a primary concern of the convention either."
