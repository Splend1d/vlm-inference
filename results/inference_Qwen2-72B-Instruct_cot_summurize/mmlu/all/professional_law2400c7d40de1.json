A senator, in his investigation of infiltration by antigovernment organizations of national labor unions, found a provision in a law passed by Congress that makes it a crime for a member of an antigovernment organization to act as an official of a labor union. After a subsequent legislative hearing, the president is dismissed from his position by the executive committee of the union. During a legislative hearing, the senator made derogatory statements about the president's involvement in an antigovernment organization. In determining whether the president has a valid cause of action against the senator for defamation, which of the following most accurately summarizes the applicable rule of law?\n\nA. Congressional committees do not have the authority to violate a person's Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination.\nB. A congressman shall not be questioned in any other place for any speech or debate made by him during a congressional hearing.\nC. The constitutional requirement for actual malice must be proved by the party defamed in order to recover in a defamation suit.\nD. It is not a denial of due process or of First Amendment rights for a congressional investigative committee member to make such utterances.\n"

A congressman shall not be questioned in any other place for any speech or debate made by him during a congressional hearing.\n\nThis rule is based on the Speech or Debate Clause in Article I, Section 6 of the U.S. Constitution, which provides members of Congress immunity from prosecution or civil liability for statements made during the course of their legislative duties. This includes statements made during congressional hearings. Therefore, the senator would not be liable for defamation based on statements made during the legislative hearing. However, this protection does not extend to statements made outside of the legislative context. \n\nIt is worth noting that C could also be relevant in some defamation cases involving public officials or public figures, where the plaintiff must prove \"actual malice\" to succeed in a defamation lawsuit. However, B is more directly applicable to the scenario described, as it pertains specifically to the immunity of members of Congress for statements made during official proceedings."
