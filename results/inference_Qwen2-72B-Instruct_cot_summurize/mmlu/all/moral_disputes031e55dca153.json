Callahan discusses the Dutch Commission on Euthanasia in 1990 to show that laws permitting euthanasia can and have been abused, and that doctors who perform euthanasia may not report doing so. The commission found that many cases of euthanasia were not being reported by doctors, and that some cases did not meet the legal requirements for euthanasia. This raised concerns about the potential for abuse and the need for strict regulations and oversight to prevent it."
