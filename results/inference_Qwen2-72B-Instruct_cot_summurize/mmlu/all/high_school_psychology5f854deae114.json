Inter-rater reliability\n\nInter-rater reliability is most critical in this study because it assesses the consistency or agreement between the ratings provided by different raters (in this case, the three raters viewing the footage). Since the data collection involves subjective judgments made by multiple individuals about the same behaviors, ensuring that these raters are giving similar scores for the same observed behaviors is crucial for the validity of the results.\n\nCoefficient-alpha reliability (also known as Cronbach's alpha) measures the internal consistency of a test or survey, which is not directly relevant here since the ratings are based on observed behaviors rather than a standardized test.\n\nAlternate-forms reliability refers to the consistency of scores across different versions of a test measuring the same construct, which does not apply to this observational study.\n\nTest-retest reliability measures the consistency of scores over time, which is not the primary concern in this scenario where the focus is on the consistency of ratings across different raters at the same point in time."
