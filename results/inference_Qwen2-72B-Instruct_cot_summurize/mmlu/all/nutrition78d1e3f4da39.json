Increased energy quantity/density and a more sedentary lifestyle: This refers to the increased availability and consumption of high-calorie, nutrient-poor foods, coupled with reduced physical activity due to technological advancements and changes in work and transportation patterns.\n\nB. Decreased leisure-time activity: This is related to the overall decrease in physical activity as people spend more time on sedentary activities such as watching television, using computers, and playing video games.\n\nWhile genetics can play a role in obesity, changes in genetic profiles are not considered a primary cause of the current obesity epidemic, as genetic changes occur over much longer periods than the recent increase in obesity rates. Therefore, option C is less directly relevant to the current epidemic.\n\nSo, the correct answer would be a combination of A and B, but since the question only allows for one selection, A is the closest to being the most comprehensive answer. However, an accurate representation would acknowledge that both A and B contribute significantly to the obesity epidemic."
