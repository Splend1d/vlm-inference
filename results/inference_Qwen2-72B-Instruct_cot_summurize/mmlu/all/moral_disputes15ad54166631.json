Frances Kamm uses the example of a scientist who is motivated by a desire for mastery to argue that the morality of an action should not be judged solely based on the agent's motivation. Even if the scientist's motivation is considered bad or selfish, the positive outcome of finding a cure for congenital blindness could still make the action morally permissible. This suggests that the morality of an action is determined by more than just the agent's intentions or motivations."
