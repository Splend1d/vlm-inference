The negativity attached to HM during the Cold War restricted the prominence of HM at this time, excluding it from mainstream security studies. Following this, the broadening of the security studies agenda has led to increasing inclusion of HM as an area for study.\n\nDuring the Cold War, HM, which is closely associated with Marxist theory, was often sidelined in Western academia due to the ideological conflict with capitalist states. The end of the Cold War brought about a broader understanding of security beyond traditional military concerns, leading to a more inclusive academic environment where non-traditional approaches, including HM, gained more acceptance. This shift allowed for a greater integration of HM into security studies, focusing on issues such as economic inequality, class struggle, and the role of capitalism in international relations."
