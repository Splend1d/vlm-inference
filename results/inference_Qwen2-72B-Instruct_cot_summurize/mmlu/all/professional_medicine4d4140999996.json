However, the interpretation of this finding also depends on the confidence interval (CI).\n\nA confidence interval of 1.1 to 1.8 indicates that the true RRR is likely between these two values with 95% certainty. Since the lower limit of the CI (1.1) is above 1, it suggests that the association between regular exercise and increased risk of hip fractures is statistically significant at the 5% level.\n\nHowever, the question asks for the most appropriate conclusion about the effect of regular exercise on the risk for hip fracture. Given that a RRR greater than 1 indicates an increased risk, the correct answer would be:\n\nD. Statistically significant overall increase in risk\n\nIt's important to note that this conclusion might seem counterintuitive given the common belief that exercise reduces the risk of fractures by improving bone density and balance. This example highlights the importance of carefully interpreting statistical results and considering them within the context of existing knowledge and potential confounding factors. In reality, regular exercise is generally associated with a decreased risk of hip fractures in elderly populations. The hypothetical scenario presented here might suggest an unexpected result that would require further investigation."
