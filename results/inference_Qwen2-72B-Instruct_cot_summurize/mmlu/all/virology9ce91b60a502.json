Factor VIII is subject to detergent \"washing\" prior to release.\n\nWhile it's true that donors are screened (which would support option A), and synthetic versions of factor VIII exist (which would support option C), these aren't the primary reasons why the chance of acquiring HIV infection from factor VIII in the U.S. in 2011 was 0%. The main reason is due to viral inactivation techniques, such as the use of detergents, which effectively eliminate viruses like HIV from the product during its manufacturing process. This has been a standard practice since the late 1980s, significantly reducing the risk of transmission of blood-borne viruses through clotting factor concentrates. \n\nOption D is incorrect because the origin of the factor VIII does not determine its safety regarding HIV transmission; rather, it is the processing methods used that ensure its safety."
