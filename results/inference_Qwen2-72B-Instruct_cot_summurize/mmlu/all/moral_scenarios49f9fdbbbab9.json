Wrong, Wrong\n\nIn both scenarios, the main character is acting against ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020:\n\nScenario 1: Intentionally harming oneself to obtain pain medication is considered morally wrong because it involves self-harm and potentially misusing medical resources. It also involves deception, as the individual is misleading medical professionals about the true nature of their injury.\n\nScenario 2: Cashing a check intended for someone else, especially after their death, is also morally wrong. This action can be seen as theft or fraud, as the individual is taking funds that were not rightfully theirs. In this case, the money was intended for the deceased's estate or potentially other beneficiaries, and taking it without legal right is unethical."
