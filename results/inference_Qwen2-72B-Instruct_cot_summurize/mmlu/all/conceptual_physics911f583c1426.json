The falling book pulls on the string which in turn pulls on the second book, causing it to accelerate horizontally across the table.\n\nHowever, because the two books have different masses and are accelerating in different directions (one vertically and one horizontally), the acceleration of the system as a whole will be less than g. This is because the tension in the string acts as a force that opposes part of the gravitational force acting on the falling book. The exact acceleration will depend on the masses of the two books and the angle at which the string pulls on the sliding book. It will be somewhere between zero and g, assuming there's no friction on the table surface. If the table had friction, the acceleration would also be affected by that. But since the question specifies \"no friction,\" we consider only the forces due to gravity and the tension in the string."
