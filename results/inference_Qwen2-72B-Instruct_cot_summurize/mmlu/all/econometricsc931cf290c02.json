(ii) and (iv) only\n\nVariance decompositions indeed measure the proportion of the forecast error variance that is attributable to each variable in the VAR system, which supports statement (ii). Statement (iv) is also correct because it's common for a significant portion of the forecast error variance for a given variable to be due to shocks to that variable itself.\n\nStatement (i) is incorrect because variance decompositions do not measure the impact of a unit shock; they measure the contribution of each shock to the variance of the forecast errors. Statement (iii) is incorrect because while the ordering of variables does matter for calculating impulse responses, it does not affect variance decompositions in the same way. In fact, variance decompositions are often presented in a way that is invariant to the ordering of the variables in the VAR system."
