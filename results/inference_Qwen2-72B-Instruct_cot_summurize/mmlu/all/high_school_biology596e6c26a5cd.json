Silent mutations.\n\nSilent mutations occur when a nucleotide substitution does not result in an amino acid change in the protein sequence due to the redundancy of the genetic code. This means that two species could have diverged significantly at the DNA level but still produce identical or nearly identical amino acid sequences in their proteins. As a result, comparing amino acid sequences may not accurately reflect the true evolutionary distance between species, as silent mutations would not be reflected in the protein sequence but would be apparent in the DNA sequence.\n\nWhile the other options (gene duplications, translocation events, and crossing-over) can also affect the accuracy of evolutionary relatedness determinations, they do so at the DNA level and are not specific to the comparison of amino acid sequences versus nucleotide sequences. Silent mutations, however, directly impact the accuracy of evolutionary relatedness determinations based on amino acid sequences by obscuring the true number of mutations that have occurred over time."
