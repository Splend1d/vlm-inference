Capitalized as part of goodwill and tested annually for impairment.\n\nAcquisition costs, such as legal fees, consulting fees, and other direct costs associated with the purchase of another company, are typically capitalized as part of goodwill when one company acquires another. Goodwill is then subject to annual impairment testing under accounting standards such as US GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) and IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards). If it is determined that the value of the goodwill has been impaired, a write-down must be recorded, which will impact the acquiring company's financial statements."
