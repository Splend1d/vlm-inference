The standard provides criteria by which tests and manuals should be judged and serves as a benchmark for the quality of tests and testing practices. It does not provide reliability and validity data on specific tests or list approved tests and manuals, nor does it detail legal requirements for test use. However, adherence to the standard can help ensure that tests are used in a legally defensible manner."
