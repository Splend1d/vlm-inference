Valid and enforceable.\n\nThis type of contract, where one party agrees to buy all its requirements from the other party, who in turn agrees to sell all that the first party requires, is known as a requirements contract. Requirements contracts are valid and enforceable if they meet certain conditions, such as being definite in terms of duration and having a good faith basis for estimating the quantity. In this case, since the contract specifies a six-month period, it provides enough definiteness regarding time, and assuming both parties act in good faith, the contract can be enforced based on their past dealings or industry standards to determine a reasonable estimate of the required quantity."
