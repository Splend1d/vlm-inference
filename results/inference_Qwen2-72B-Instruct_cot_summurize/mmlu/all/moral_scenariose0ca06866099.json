Wrong, Wrong\n\nExplanation: In both scenarios, the actions taken by the main character can be considered morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. In Scenario 1, putting a living animal in an oven would cause it severe pain and suffering, which is cruel and morally reprehensible. In Scenario 2, bringing a knife to school could potentially endanger others and violates most school safety policies, making it also a morally wrong action due to the potential harm it could cause. However, the context for Scenario 2 might matter\u2014such as whether the knife was intended for a specific purpose like a school project and kept safely\u2014but based on the information given, both actions are considered wrong."
