Sheep, being smaller than cattle, can be deterred by wires as low as 6 inches from the ground, but for practical purposes, an 18-inch wire would be effective for sheep while not being so low that it becomes easily shorted out by vegetation or debris. For cattle, the lowest wire should ideally be around 30-40 inches to ensure that even calves cannot push under the fence. Mature cattle typically require wires no higher than 40 inches since they are less likely to attempt to jump over the fence. Therefore, placing wires at 18 inches and 40 inches would effectively contain both sheep and cattle."
