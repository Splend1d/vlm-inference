In this case, we want to find the probability that the bakery runs out of bread, which means we're interested in the demand being higher than the number of loaves baked (3,000).\n\nFirst, let's calculate the Z-score for a demand of 3,000 loaves:\n\n\\[Z = \\frac{X - \\mu}{\\sigma}\\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\(X\\) is the value of interest (3,000 loaves),\n- \\(\\mu\\) is the mean (2,500 loaves), and\n- \\(\\sigma\\) is the standard deviation (225 loaves).\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[Z = \\frac{3,000 - 2,500}{225} = \\frac{500}{225} = 2.22\\]\n\nThis Z-score tells us that a demand of 3,000 loaves is 2.22 standard deviations above the mean demand.\n\nNext, we need to find the probability associated with this Z-score. This can be done using a standard normal distribution table or a calculator function that gives the cumulative probability under the normal curve up to a given Z-score.\n\nFor a Z-score of 2.22, the area under the curve up to that point is approximately 0.9869. However, this represents the probability that the demand is less than or equal to 3,000 loaves, not the probability that the bakery runs out of bread (which would be the demand exceeding 3,000 loaves).\n\nTherefore, to find the probability that the bakery runs out of bread, we subtract this value from 1:\n\n\\[P(\\text{run out}) = 1 - P(\\text{demand} \\leq 3,000) = 1 - 0.9869 = 0.0131\\]\n\nRounding to four decimal places, the answer is closest to 0.0132, which corresponds to option D."
