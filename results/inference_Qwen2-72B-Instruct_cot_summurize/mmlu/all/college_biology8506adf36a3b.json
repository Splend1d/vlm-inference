This segmentation allows for increased flexibility and specialized functions in different parts of the body. While they do share some other features like having well-developed sense organs and in many cases a closed circulatory system, the most distinctive similarity between these two phyla is their segmented bodies. However, it's important to note that the segments in annelids and arthropods have evolved independently and may not be homologous."
