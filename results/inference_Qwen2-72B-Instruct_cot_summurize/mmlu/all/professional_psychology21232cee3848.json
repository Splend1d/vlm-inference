It also helps to establish a routine that can be gradually adjusted to reduce dosage over time without increasing the patient's anxiety or perception of pain. This method is known as scheduled dosing and can be an effective part of a comprehensive pain management plan that includes other non-pharmacological interventions such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), physical therapy, and relaxation techniques."
