This perspective views the public as easily influenced and controlled by mass media, which can shape opinions and behaviors through one-way communication.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that modern media effects theories have evolved beyond this simplistic view. For instance, the uses and gratifications theory (D. audiences make selective interpretations of media messages) posits that people actively choose media based on their needs and desires, while the political economy perspective (A. the content of the media is determined by market forces) focuses on how economic structures influence media content. The cultural hegemony or Gramscian theory (B. the subordinate classes are dominated by the ideology of the ruling class) examines how dominant ideologies are perpetuated through media to maintain social control."
