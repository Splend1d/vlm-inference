Formalism treats legal reasoning as syllogistic reasoning.\n\nAmerican realists criticized formalism for treating legal reasoning as a purely logical process, akin to syllogistic reasoning, where the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises. They argued that this view devalued the role and authority of judges in making law, as it suggested that judicial decisions were predetermined by the application of rules to facts, leaving no room for judicial discretion or creativity. In reality, American realists believed that judges often played an active role in shaping the law through their decisions, considering not only formal logic but also social, economic, and political factors."
