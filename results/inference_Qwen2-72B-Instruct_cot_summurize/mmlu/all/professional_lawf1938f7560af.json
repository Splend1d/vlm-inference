He allowed her husband to drive the car home but arrested her for driving under suspension. After securing her inside the squad car, he conducted a search of her vehicle. The officer found a bag of cocaine inside a zippered jacket on the back seat. He arrested her for possession and possession with intent to deliver a controlled substance. Prior to trial, the driver moved for suppression of the cocaine. Is it likely that the trial court will grant the suppression motion?\n\nA. Yes, it must be suppressed because she was secured in the squad car and the police could not expect to find evidence relating to the current arrest in the car.\nB. No, the motion will be denied because there is no expectation of privacy toward property inside one's car.\nC. No, the motion will be denied because this was a valid search incident to an arrest.\nD. Yes, the motion will be granted because a search of a vehicle requires a search warrant unless there are exceptional exigent circumstances.\n"

No, the motion will be denied because this was a valid search incident to an arrest.\n\nWhen a person is arrested, police officers have the authority to conduct a search of the person and the area within their immediate control, including the vehicle they were operating, without obtaining a warrant. This is known as a search incident to arrest and is justified by the need to protect the safety of the officer and to prevent the destruction or concealment of evidence. In this case, since the driver was arrested for driving under suspension, the officer was justified in searching the vehicle she was driving as part of the arrest process. The fact that she was already secured in the squad car does not negate the validity of the search incident to arrest, as the officer could still reasonably expect to find evidence related to the offense in the vehicle. The discovery of the cocaine during this search would therefore be admissible in court."
