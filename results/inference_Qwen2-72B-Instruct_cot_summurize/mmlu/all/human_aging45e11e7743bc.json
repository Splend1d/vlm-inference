Mechanistic** view.\n\nA mechanistic perspective sees development as a process driven by cause-and-effect relationships where individuals can influence their own development through their actions and choices. This view emphasizes the role of personal agency and the environment in shaping development, suggesting that people can actively contribute to their own aging process through lifestyle choices, health behaviors, and other personal decisions.\n\nHere's a brief explanation of the other options:\n\nA. Organismic: This perspective views development as an unfolding of innate potentials and abilities. It suggests that humans have an inherent drive toward growth and self-actualization, and that development follows a predetermined path.\n\nB. Nurture: This term is often used in the context of the nature vs. nurture debate to emphasize the role of environmental factors in shaping behavior and development. However, it does not specifically refer to a theory of development but rather an aspect of how development occurs.\n\nC. Continuity: This perspective posits that development is a smooth, gradual process without distinct stages. Development is seen as a continuous accumulation of skills and knowledge over time.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer based on the description provided is D. Mechanistic."
