Respiratory tract infections\n\nAdenoviruses have a significant clinical impact on the respiratory system, causing illnesses such as the common cold, bronchitis, pneumonia, and croup, particularly in children and immunocompromised individuals. While adenoviruses can also cause diarrhoea, eye infections (conjunctivitis), and haemorrhagic cystitis, their greatest public health impact is through respiratory tract infections. Adenoviruses types 4 and 7 are particularly associated with severe respiratory disease."
