However, if we apply this concept to human sociology, the closest analogy would be:\n\nD. new residents move into areas occupied by older resident groups.\n\nThis describes the process where new populations (whether they be people, plants, or animals) move into an area that is already inhabited by existing populations. Over time, these newcomers may alter the environment or social structure, leading to changes in the community composition\u2014a process akin to ecological succession. In human societies, this can manifest as gentrification, cultural exchange, or demographic shifts."
