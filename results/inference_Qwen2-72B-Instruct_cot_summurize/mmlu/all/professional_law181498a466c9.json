Connecticut (1965) established that there is a right to privacy implied in the Constitution, and that this right includes the use of contraceptives by married couples. This decision struck down a Connecticut law that banned the use of contraceptives by married couples, finding that such a law violated the right to marital privacy. Given this precedent, a federal statute that prohibited the sale and use of contraceptive devices by married persons would likely be found unconstitutional for violating the right to privacy."
