                    "text": "The correct answer is C. The thermic effect of food, also known as dietary-induced thermogenesis, is indeed partly related to sympathetic activity stimulation in the postprandial phase. When you eat, your body's metabolism increases to digest and absorb the nutrients from the food. This process requires energy, which is produced by the body in the form of heat. The sympathetic nervous system plays a role in this response by increasing metabolic rate.\n\nTo clarify the other options:\n\nA. The thermic effect of food is actually higher for protein than for carbohydrates. Protein has the highest thermic effect, followed by carbohydrates, and then fats.\n\nB. The thermic effect of food does not cause a decrease in body core temperature; rather, it leads to an increase in body heat production.\n\nD. Food malabsorption can attenuate the thermic effect of food because less of the food is being absorbed and used by the body, thus reducing the energy required for digestion and absorption."
