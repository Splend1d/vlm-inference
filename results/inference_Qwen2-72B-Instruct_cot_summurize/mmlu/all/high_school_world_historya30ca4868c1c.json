It did not even grudge us the spectacle of the conflict. More than sixty thousand fell, not beneath the Roman arms and weapons, but, grander far, before our delighted eyes. May the tribes, I pray, ever retain if not love for us, at least hatred for each other; for while the destinies of empire hurry us on, fortune can give no greater boon than discord among our foes.\"\nGermania, Publius Cornelius Tacitus, ca. 98 C.E.\nThe views expressed in the excerpt are best seen as evidence of which of the following in Roman society?\n\nA. Disgust for barbarian peoples\nB. Concern about barbarian attacks\nC. Absence of Stoicism among the aristocracy\nD. Maintenance of large armies\n"

Tacitus describes the conflict between the barbarian tribes with a sense of delight and almost a preference for their mutual destruction rather than engagement with Roman forces. He also implies that it is beneficial for the Romans if these tribes remain at odds with each other, indicating a lack of respect or positive regard for these groups.\n\nWhile there may be elements of concern about barbarian attacks (option B) and the maintenance of large armies (option D) implied by the text, the primary focus of Tacitus' sentiment is the distaste for the barbarian tribes and a hope that they continue to fight amongst themselves rather than uniting against Rome. Option C, absence of Stoicism among the aristocracy, does not seem to be directly addressed by the passage. Stoicism would typically advocate for emotional restraint and dispassion, but Tacitus' delight in the barbarians' conflict does not necessarily imply an absence of Stoicism among the entire aristocracy, only his personal reaction to the events."
