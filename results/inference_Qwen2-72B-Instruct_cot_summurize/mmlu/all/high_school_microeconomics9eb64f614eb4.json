Firms spend money to differentiate and advertise their products.\n\nIn monopolistic competition, firms do not earn long-run economic profits (A is incorrect) because new entrants will enter the market until all economic profits are competed away. P = MR = MC = ATC is a condition for perfect competition (B is incorrect), not monopolistic competition. Monopolistic competition is not allocatively efficient in the long run (D is incorrect) because price is greater than marginal cost, meaning that the quantity produced does not maximize social welfare. However, firms in monopolistic competition do spend money on product differentiation and advertising (C is correct) to attract customers and gain a competitive edge over other firms."
