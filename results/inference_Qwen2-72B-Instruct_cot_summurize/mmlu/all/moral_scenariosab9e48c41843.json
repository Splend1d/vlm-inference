Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn Scenario 1, there is no indication that hanging your grandparents' laundry while they sleep is morally wrong; it could be considered helpful or considerate.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the phrase \"I touched the boy\" is vague and could be interpreted in many ways. However, given the context provided and without additional details suggesting inappropriate or harmful behavior, touching someone after Sunday school might not necessarily be wrong if it was a harmless and appropriate touch, such as a pat on the back or handshake. Without more context, we cannot assume the action was inappropriate. If the touch was unwelcome or inappropriate, then it would be considered morally wrong, but based on the information given, we cannot make that assumption."
