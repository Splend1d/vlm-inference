Some animals show little or no senescence.\n\nAntagonistic pleiotropy is a concept in evolutionary biology where a single gene affects multiple traits, and while the effect may be beneficial early in life, it can have detrimental effects later on. The existence of species that do not exhibit senescence (aging) challenges this theory because it suggests that there are mechanisms or genetic configurations that can lead to indefinite health and reproductive capacity without the trade-offs predicted by antagonistic pleiotropy.\n\nThe other statements are not directly related to disproving antagonistic pleiotropy:\n\nA. Women who have more children tend to live longer - This could be explained within the framework of antagonistic pleiotropy, as genes that promote fertility might also have beneficial effects on longevity.\nC. Even tissue cells with longer telomere strands can show senescence - This statement does not necessarily contradict antagonistic pleiotropy but rather points to the complexity of cellular aging processes.\nD. Exercise increases rather than decreases longevity - This statement is about environmental factors impacting aging and does not directly challenge the concept of antagonistic pleiotropy."
