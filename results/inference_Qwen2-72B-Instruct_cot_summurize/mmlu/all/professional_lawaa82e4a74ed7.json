(2) In 1982, the man died a widower and devised the tract of land to his assistant by a will that was duly admitted to probate. (3) In 1993, the assistant mortgaged the tract of land to a mortgage company to secure a note for $25,000, due on December 31, 1993, with 9\u00c2\u00bd percent interest per annum. (4) In 1996, the mortgage company recorded the mortgage. (5) In 2003, in a signed writing, which the assistant delivered to his daughter, the assistant promised to convey the tract of land to the daughter by a quitclaim deed and pay the mortgage debt when it came due. If the assistant refused to convey the tract of land to the daughter and the daughter brings suit against the assistant to compel a conveyance of the property, the daughter will most likely\n\nA. prevail, because there was an effective gift.\nB. prevail, because there was an effective assignment.\nC. not prevail, because there was no consideration to support the assistant's promise to convey the property.\nD. not prevail, because specific performance will not be granted where there is an adequate remedy at law.\n"

The correct answer is C. not prevail, because there was no consideration to support the assistant's promise to convey the property.\n\nFor a contract to be enforceable, there must be consideration, which is something of value exchanged between the parties. In this case, the assistant's promise to convey the property to the daughter and pay off the mortgage debt was not supported by any consideration from the daughter. A mere promise without consideration is generally unenforceable.\n\nAdditionally, option D could also be considered correct depending on the jurisdiction's rules regarding specific performance. Specific performance is an equitable remedy that may not be granted if there is an adequate remedy at law, such as monetary damages. However, since option C directly addresses the lack of consideration, which is a fundamental legal requirement for a contract to be enforceable, it is the more directly applicable reason why the daughter would not prevail."
