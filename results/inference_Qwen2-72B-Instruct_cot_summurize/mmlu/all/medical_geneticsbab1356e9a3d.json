                    "text": "X-linked dominant inheritance is a pattern of inheritance in which a dominant allele located on the X chromosome can cause the trait or disorder to be expressed in both males and females. However, because males have only one X chromosome, they express the trait if they inherit the allele from their mother (who has two X chromosomes). Females can inherit the allele from either parent but need only one copy to express the trait.\n\nGiven these points, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Transmitted by males only to females\n\nThis is true because a male with an X-linked dominant condition will pass the affected X chromosome to all of his daughters (since he passes his X chromosome to daughters) but none of his sons (since he passes his Y chromosome to sons). However, it's important to note that this doesn't mean that only females can transmit the condition; females can also transmit it to both their sons and daughters. But among the options provided, D is the only one directly related to X-linked dominant inheritance patterns. \n\nOptions A, B, and C do not specifically describe features of X-linked dominant inheritance. Parental consanguinity (option A) refers to the practice of marrying within a small group, which can increase the likelihood of certain genetic disorders, but it is not specific to X-linked dominant inheritance. Male-to-male transmission (option B) is not possible in X-linked dominant conditions since males can only transmit the X chromosome to their daughters, not their sons. And transmission only by females (option C) does not accurately describe X-linked dominant inheritance since affected females can transmit the trait to both sons and daughters."
