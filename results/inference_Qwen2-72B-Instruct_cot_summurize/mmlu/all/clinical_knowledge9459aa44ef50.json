These transporters are regulated by insulin, which causes them to translocate from intracellular vesicles to the plasma membrane where they can facilitate glucose uptake. However, option B is not entirely accurate because while insulin does stimulate glucose uptake in muscle cells, it is not the only mechanism; for example, during exercise, glucose can also be taken up by muscles independently of insulin. Options C and D are incorrect because hexokinase is an enzyme that phosphorylates glucose once inside the cell, and monocarboxylate transporters are involved in the transport of molecules like lactate and pyruvate, not glucose."
