This is a fundamental concept in his political philosophy, as outlined in his work \"Leviathan.\" Hobbes believed that in the state of nature, all individuals have this right, leading to a war of all against all due to the lack of a common power to keep them in awe. To escape this condition, people enter into a social contract and establish a sovereign authority."
