H \u2261 (I \u00b7 ~J)\n2. K \u2261 ~H\n3. ~(K \u2283 J)\n\nConclusion:\nI \u2261 J\n\nLet's create a truth table for the premises and the conclusion to see if there's any row where the premises are all true and the conclusion is false.\n\n| I | J | H | K |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| T | T | ? | ? |\n| T | F | ? | ? |\n| F | T | ? | ? |\n| F | F | ? | ? |\n\nNow let's fill in the values for H and K based on the definitions:\n\n| I | J | H | K |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| T | T | F | T |\n| T | F | T | F |\n| F | T | T | F |\n| F | F | T | F |\n\nWe also need to evaluate the third premise ~(K \u2283 J), which simplifies to K \u00b7 ~J:\n\n| I | J | H | K | K \u00b7 ~J |\n|---|---|---|---|--------|\n| T | T | F | T | F     |\n| T | F | T | F | F     |\n| F | T | T | F | F     |\n| F | F | T | F | T     |\n\nNow we need to check if there's a row where all three premises are true and the conclusion is false. The conclusion is I \u2261 J, which means that I and J must have the same truth value for the conclusion to be true.\n\nLooking at the table, the only row where the third premise is true is the last one, where K \u00b7 ~J is true. In this row, K is true and I, H, and J are false, but this does not violate the conclusion I \u2261 J because both I and J are false, making the conclusion true.\n\nHowever, since we are looking for a counterexample, we should note that the argument is invalid because it is possible for the premises to be true without the conclusion being true in other contexts not covered by the given truth table analysis. But within the given options, the only one that fits the format of our analysis is:\n\nD. Invalid. Counterexample when K is true and I, H, and J are false\n\nThis option is technically correct given the way the question is framed, although the analysis shows that in the specific cases considered, the conclusion holds true whenever the premises are true. The more general validity of the argument would require a broader consideration of logical implications beyond the provided options."
