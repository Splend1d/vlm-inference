                    "text": "If the corporation had been an S corporation instead of a C corporation, the rules for reporting income would be different. With an S corporation, the income or losses of the corporation \"pass through\" to the shareholders, who then report their share of the corporation's income or losses on their individual tax returns, regardless of whether the corporation distributes any cash.\n\nGiven that Carson owned 40% of the corporation:\n\n- The corporation reported $400,000 in taxable income.\n- Under the S corporation rules, Carson would report 40% of this income on his individual tax return.\n- Therefore, Carson would report: $400,000 * 40% = $160,000\n\nHowever, since the question asks specifically about how much income Carson would have reported on his individual return considering the distributions were proportionate (and we're assuming the $70,000 distribution is relevant only in context), it's important to note that with an S corporation, the distributions themselves don't affect the amount of income reported by the shareholder. The income is reported based on the corporation's earnings, not the distributions made.\n\nSo, even if the corporation had distributed $70,000 in cash dividends proportionately, Carson would still report $160,000 of the corporation's income on his individual return, as long as he owns 40% of the S corporation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. $160,000"
