The use of religion to ponder conceptions of the afterlife.\n\nThe first text describes the descent into the underworld or \"House of Darkness\" in the Epic of Gilgamesh, an ancient Sumerian text that explores themes of mortality and the afterlife. The second text, The Maxims of Ptahhotep, is an Egyptian work that discusses moral and ethical principles, including the idea of divine justice and the consequences of one's actions in life, which can affect one's fate in the afterlife. Both texts reflect religious beliefs about what happens to individuals after death and the moral implications of these beliefs."
