Both\n\nThis is because Newton's law of cooling describes the rate at which an object cools down or warms up when placed in an environment with a different temperature. The law states that the rate of change of the temperature of an object is directly proportional to the difference between its own temperature and the temperature of the surrounding environment. Therefore, it applies to both cooling and warming processes."
