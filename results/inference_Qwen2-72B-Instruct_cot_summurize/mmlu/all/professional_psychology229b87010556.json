The z-score is a measure of how many standard deviations an element is from the mean. It is calculated as:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{(X - \\mu)}{\\sigma} \\]\n\nwhere \\(X\\) is the student's score, \\(\\mu\\) is the mean, and \\(\\sigma\\) is the standard deviation.\n\nLet's calculate the z-scores for each exam:\n\nFor English:\n\\[ z_{English} = \\frac{(150 - 125)}{20} = \\frac{25}{20} = 1.25 \\]\n\nFor Math:\n\\[ z_{Math} = \\frac{(100 - 90)}{10} = \\frac{10}{10} = 1.00 \\]\n\nFor Chemistry:\n\\[ z_{Chemistry} = \\frac{(55 - 45)}{5} = \\frac{10}{5} = 2.00 \\]\n\nFor History:\n\\[ z_{History} = \\frac{(30 - 30)}{5} = \\frac{0}{5} = 0.00 \\]\n\nThe higher the z-score, the better the student performed compared to the class average. Therefore, based on these calculations, the student performed best on the Chemistry exam with a z-score of 2.00.\n\nThe correct answer is C. chemistry."
