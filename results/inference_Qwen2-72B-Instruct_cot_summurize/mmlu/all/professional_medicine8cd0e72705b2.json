Physical examination shows localized tenderness over the lumbar spine after movement. X-rays of the spine show a compression fracture of L1-2. A DEXA scan shows decreased bone mineral density. Serum calcium and phosphorus concentrations and serum alkaline phosphatase activity are within the reference ranges. A bisphosphonate drug is prescribed. The expected beneficial effect of this drug is most likely due to which of the following actions?\n\nA. Decreased insulin-like growth factor-1 concentration\nB. Decreased osteoclast activity\nC. Decreased osteoprotegerin production\nD. Increased 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol concentration\n"

Decreased osteoclast activity\n\nBisphosphonates are drugs that inhibit bone resorption by binding to hydroxyapatite crystals in bone and inhibiting osteoclast activity. This action results in increased bone density and strength, reducing the risk of fractures in patients with osteoporosis."
