                    "text": "The buoyant force acting on an object submerged in a fluid is given by Archimedes' principle, which states that the upward buoyant force is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object. The buoyant force can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[ F_B = \\rho g V \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\(F_B\\) is the buoyant force,\n- \\(\\rho\\) is the density of the fluid (in this case, water),\n- \\(g\\) is the acceleration due to gravity,\n- \\(V\\) is the volume of the fluid displaced by the object.\n\nAs the balloon with the rock sinks deeper into the lake, the pressure increases, but the density of water (\\(\\rho\\)) remains relatively constant since water is nearly incompressible. The volume of water displaced by the balloon (\\(V\\)) will also remain constant as long as the balloon does not change shape or size significantly. Therefore, according to the formula, the buoyant force (\\(F_B\\)) should remain largely unchanged.\n\nHowever, there's a subtlety here: if the balloon is flexible and compressible, it might be compressed by the increasing pressure at greater depths, reducing its volume and thus the buoyant force. But assuming the balloon does not change significantly in volume due to the pressure (which is a reasonable assumption for a typical party balloon up to a certain depth), then the buoyant force would indeed remain largely unchanged.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. remains largely unchanged."
