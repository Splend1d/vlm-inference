The headaches are moderately severe, are present when he awakens in the morning, and are relieved with over-the-counter analgesics. He has no prior history of headaches. He tells you he was promoted to an upper-level managerial position in his accounting firm about 8 months ago, which necessitated relocating. Physical examination now discloses no abnormalities except for blurring of the optic disc margins bilaterally. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?\n\nA. Begin a trial of a \u03b2-blocking medication\nB. Order CT scan of the head\nC. Order EEG\nD. Refer him for consultation with a neurologist\n"

The patient's symptoms of new onset headaches, particularly their presence in the morning, along with the physical examination finding of blurred optic disc margins (papilledema), suggest increased intracranial pressure. This can be indicative of serious conditions such as a brain tumor, hydrocephalus, or other neurological disorders. A CT scan of the head would be indicated to investigate these possibilities.\n\nWhile a referral to a neurologist (option D) might also be necessary, it is important to first rule out any life-threatening causes of the symptoms through imaging studies such as a CT scan. An EEG (option C) is not typically used to diagnose the cause of headaches or papilledema, as it measures electrical activity in the brain and is more commonly used for diagnosing seizures and sleep disorders. Beginning a trial of a beta-blocking medication (option A) would not be appropriate as a first step, as this could mask symptoms of a potentially serious underlying condition without addressing the cause."
