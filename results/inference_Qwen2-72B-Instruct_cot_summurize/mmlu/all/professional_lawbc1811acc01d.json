The Secretary has the discretion to implement \"deferred action,\" which temporarily postpones the exportation of certain groups of undocumented immigrants. With 11.3 million people now here illegally, the Secretary implemented a program called the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA. The program deferred removal for two years of individuals who came to the United States as children, met certain eligibility criteria, and cleared a background check. A Sheriff in a county near the Mexican border, sued the Secretary, claiming that the policy would increase crime and drain resources in his county. The U.S. District Court dismissed the Sheriff's claim for lack of standing. On appeal, will the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals likely affirm the dismissal?\n\nA. Yes because the Sheriff is stressing a speculative possibility that his office may incur funding shortages and more enforcement problems at some undefined future time.\nB. Yes, because the Sheriff, as a part of the executive branch himself, is not legally qualified to bring a claim against the executive.\nC. No, because anyone has the right to object to the executive branch when it tries to legislate its own opinion into the existing law.\nD. No, because the Sheriff's county is near the border and it will in fact suffer an ingestion of more immigrants from the policy.\n"

Yes because the Sheriff is stressing a speculative possibility that his office may incur funding shortages and more enforcement problems at some undefined future time.\n\nIn this scenario, the Sheriff's claim is based on potential future harm that is not concrete or imminent enough to establish standing. Standing requires a plaintiff to show a personal injury that is concrete, particularized, and actual or imminent; fairly traceable to the defendant's challenged conduct; and redressable by a favorable ruling. Since the Sheriff's concerns about increased crime and resource drain are speculative and not guaranteed to occur, the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is likely to affirm the dismissal for lack of standing."
