MERRF results from a mutation in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) that impairs protein synthesis, oxygen consumption, and energy production. When an affected male and a normal female reproduce, which of the following best predicts the expected phenotypic ratios of the offspring?\n\nA. None of the offspring will be affected\nB. All males and no females will be affected\nC. Half of males and half of females will be affected\nD. One-fourth of the offspring will be affected\n"

In this scenario, since the affected individual is the male, he does not pass on any mitochondrial mutations to his offspring. The normal female contributes her normal mtDNA to all of her offspring.\n\nTherefore, none of the offspring will inherit the mutation that causes Myoclonic Epilepsy with Ragged Red Fibers (MERRF) from the affected male parent. So, the correct answer is:\n\nA. None of the offspring will be affected"
