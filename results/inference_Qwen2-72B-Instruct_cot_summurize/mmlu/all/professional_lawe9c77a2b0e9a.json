This means that the son does not have the power to convey a fee simple absolute, as he only holds a life estate. The friend is correct in stating that the son cannot convey a fee simple, and therefore the son would not succeed in a suit for specific performance because he cannot provide the friend with marketable title, which would include the full fee simple interest."
