In the Svetambara sect of Jainism, there is no formal role of 'semi-renunciation.' Still, nuns (aryikas) in this sect can have more flexibility compared to their male counterparts, which might be interpreted as a form of semi-renunciation. In contrast, the Digambara sect believes that women cannot achieve liberation and must be reborn as men to do so, which is why they don't allow women to become monks or nuns."
