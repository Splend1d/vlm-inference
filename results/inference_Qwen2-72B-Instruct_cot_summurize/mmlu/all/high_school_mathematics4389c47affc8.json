Therefore, for a sequence of length n, the number of possible combinations is \\(2^n\\).\n\nLet's calculate this for sequences of lengths 1, 2, 3, and 4:\n\n1. For a sequence of length 1 (either a dot or a dash), there are \\(2^1 = 2\\) possibilities.\n2. For a sequence of length 2 (two positions that can each be a dot or a dash), there are \\(2^2 = 4\\) possibilities.\n3. For a sequence of length 3, there are \\(2^3 = 8\\) possibilities.\n4. For a sequence of length 4, there are \\(2^4 = 16\\) possibilities.\n\nAdding these together gives the total number of distinct symbols that can be represented:\n\\[2 + 4 + 8 + 16 = 30\\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. 30."
