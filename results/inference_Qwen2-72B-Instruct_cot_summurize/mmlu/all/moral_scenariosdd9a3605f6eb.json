It could be seen as a lack of empathy or respect, but it doesn't rise to the level of harm that would make it morally wrong.\n\nIn scenario 2, declining free babysitting help might be considered ungrateful or shortsighted, but it is not morally wrong according to ordinary standards. The decision could be based on personal reasons such as trust, the need for privacy, or wanting to pay for professional services."
