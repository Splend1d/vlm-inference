It does not contribute to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), which measures the value of goods and services produced within a country's borders over a specific time period. The only part of this transaction that might be included in GDP is the fee charged by the broker ($29.95), as it is a service provided. However, the purchase of the shares themselves does not add to GDP because it is simply the transfer of ownership of an existing asset."
