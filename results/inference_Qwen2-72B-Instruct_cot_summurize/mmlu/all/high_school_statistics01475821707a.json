The number of heads in three tosses of a coin: This is a classic binomial distribution scenario. Each toss has two outcomes (heads or tails), and the probability of getting heads remains constant for each toss.\n\nB. The number of rainy days in a given week: This could be modeled as a binomial distribution if we assume that the probability of rain on any given day is independent of whether it rained on other days and is constant throughout the week. However, weather patterns can be influenced by previous days' conditions, so this assumption might not hold true in reality.\n\nC. The number of girls in a family of five children: Assuming the probability of having a girl or a boy is roughly equal and independent from one birth to the next, this could also be modeled using a binomial distribution.\n\nD. The number of students present in a class of 22: This is not a suitable scenario for a binomial model because the presence of one student is not independent of the presence of others. For example, if a student is absent due to illness, it increases the likelihood that another student who lives with them might also be absent. Additionally, the total number of trials (students) is fixed, which means that if one student is present, it affects the probability of the remaining students being present since the total must add up to 22. Therefore, the binomial assumptions of independence and a fixed number of trials do not hold here.\n\nThus, **D** is the correct answer. The number of students present in a class of 22 is not an appropriate situation to model using a binomial model."
