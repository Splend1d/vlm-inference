Let's analyze this condition to determine the property it implies about the group \\(G\\).\n\nExpanding the left side of the equation using the group operation gives:\n\n\\[ (ab)^2 = (ab)(ab) \\]\n\nBy the associative property of group operations, we can rewrite this as:\n\n\\[ (ab)(ab) = a(ba)b \\]\n\nSo our initial condition becomes:\n\n\\[ a(ba)b = a^2b^2 \\]\n\nWe can then cancel out \\(a\\) on the left and \\(b\\) on the right (since groups have inverses and thus allow cancellation):\n\n\\[ (ba)b = ab^2 \\]\n\nUsing the associative property again, we get:\n\n\\[ b(ab) = ab^2 \\]\n\nRearranging, we obtain:\n\n\\[ bab = ab^2 \\]\n\nMultiplying both sides by \\(b^{-1}\\) from the left:\n\n\\[ ab = b^2a \\]\n\nAnd finally, multiplying both sides by \\(b^{-2}\\) from the right:\n\n\\[ ab(b^{-2}) = a \\]\n\n\\[ ab = ab \\]\n\nThis doesn't give us direct information about the structure of \\(G\\) except that the operation performed was valid within the group properties. However, we made an assumption when we canceled elements that might not always be valid. Let's go back to:\n\n\\[ bab = ab^2 \\]\n\nLet's try another approach to simplify this expression. If we multiply both sides by \\(a^{-1}\\) from the left and \\(b^{-1}\\) from the right, we get:\n\n\\[ a^{-1}(bab)b^{-1} = a^{-1}(ab^2)b^{-1} \\]\n\n\\[ (a^{-1}b)a(bb^{-1}) = (a^{-1}a)(bb^{-1}) \\]\n\n\\[ (a^{-1}b)a = b \\]\n\n\\[ a^{-1}ba = b \\]\n\nSince this holds for all \\(a, b \\in G\\), we can see that the group operation commutes for any pair of elements, meaning:\n\n\\[ ab = ba \\]\n\nfor all \\(a, b \\in G\\). This means the group \\(G\\) is **abelian**.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. abelian"
