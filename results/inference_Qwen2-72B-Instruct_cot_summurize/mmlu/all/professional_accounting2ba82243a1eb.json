In this case, Decker has lived in the home for 15 years and sold it for $500,000 with a cost basis of $200,000, resulting in a capital gain of $300,000. However, since he is single, he can exclude up to $250,000 of that gain, which means he does not have to recognize any gain on the sale. Additionally, since Decker purchased a new home within six months of selling his old one, he may also be eligible for additional exclusions under the \"rollover\" provisions of the tax code. However, these provisions were eliminated for most taxpayers by the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, so they would not apply in this case. Therefore, the answer is A. $0."
