                    "text": "A defendant was booked on a commercial airline flight. When the defendant arrived at the airport, two undercover police narcotics agents observed him. His appearance and actions led the police to believe that he fit the description of a predetermined profile of a drug courier. The officers approached the defendant and told him they wanted to detain him for questioning. The defendant asked what for, and the police explained that they were narcotics agents assigned to the airport and that he fit the profile of a drug courier. They then asked the defendant to hand over his overnight bag. The defendant refused. The officers then explained that he wouldn't be permitted to board the plane unless they inspected the contents of his bag. The defendant told the officers that he changed his mind and decided not to fly today after all. The officers still requested that the defendant turn his overnight bag over to them. The defendant did so, and then he was given permission to leave the airport. The next day, the police had a dog sniff the defendant's bag for narcotics. The results of this search gave police suspicion to believe that the bag contained narcotics. They opened the defendant's bag and found heroin inside. The defendant was subsequently arrested and charged with unlawful possession of narcotics. At trial, the defendant's attorney moves to prevent introduction of the heroin into evidence. This motion will most likely be\n\nA. granted, because the police did not have probable cause to hold the bag overnight for the search.\nB. granted, because the heroin was discovered as a result of an unlawful airport detention.\nC. denied, because the defendant fit the predetermined profile of a narcotics courier.\nD. denied, because the search resulted from a lawful airport detention.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is likely to be B. granted, because the heroin was discovered as a result of an unlawful airport detention.\n\nThe police detained the defendant based solely on fitting a predetermined profile, which is generally not sufficient grounds for a legal detention or search under the Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. The police did not have probable cause or even reasonable suspicion to detain the defendant or search his bag at the time of the initial encounter. Probable cause requires more than mere suspicion; it requires specific and articulable facts that would lead a reasonable person to believe that a crime has been, is being, or will be committed. In this case, the defendant's refusal to hand over his bag and decision not to fly do not necessarily constitute probable cause or even reasonable suspicion to detain him further or search his belongings.\n\nAdditionally, the police holding the bag overnight without the defendant's consent or a warrant, solely based on fitting a profile, is likely to be considered an unlawful seizure. The subsequent use of a drug-sniffing dog and the discovery of heroin may also be deemed inadmissible as \"fruit of the poisonous tree,\" meaning that any evidence obtained as a direct result of an illegal search or seizure is also inadmissible in court.\n\nIt's important to note that the admissibility of evidence can be complex and depends on various factors, including the specific laws and precedents in the jurisdiction where the case is being tried. However, based on the information provided, option B appears to be the most likely outcome."
