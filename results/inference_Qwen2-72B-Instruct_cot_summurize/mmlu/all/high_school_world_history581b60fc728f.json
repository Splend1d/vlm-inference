And although I have a farm of 50 acres close to the town, no doubt the crops and premises would have been destroyed. In fact, this has already partly been the case, and I am now suing the Government for damages done by a contingent of 1,500 natives that have recently encamped not many hundred yards from the place, who have done much damage all around.\"\nLetter from a British citizen to his sister during the Anglo-Zulu War, South Africa, 1879\nWhich of the following reasons explains why European citizens moved in large numbers to Zulu lands in 1867?\n\nA. The British crown offered incentives to those who would establish homesteads in the unsettled lands of South Africa.\nB. The Zulu created attractive trade ports along the Indian Ocean.\nC. The Berlin Conference clarified boundaries, thus making it logistically sound for Europeans to move to the African colonies.\nD.

However, historical context can help us determine the most likely reason. Among the options provided:\n\nA. The British crown offered incentives to those who would establish homesteads in the unsettled lands of South Africa.\nB. The Zulu created attractive trade ports along the Indian Ocean.\nC. The Berlin Conference clarified boundaries, thus making it logistically sound for Europeans to move to the African colonies.\nD. A diamond rush ensued following the discovery of diamonds on Zulu lands.\n\nOption D is the most plausible reason based on historical events. The discovery of diamonds in the region of Kimberley in 1867 led to a diamond rush, attracting people from various parts of the world, including Europe, to the region. This event predated the passage and would explain the influx of European settlers into Zulu lands at that time. The other options either occurred later (such as the Berlin Conference in the late 1880s) or do not align with known historical incentives or actions by the Zulu or British governments."
