Violation of the statute is a felony punishable by a fine of $5,000 and imprisonment for up to two years. The state courts have interpreted this statute as a public welfare offense requiring no particular mental state for its violation. As such, this is a strict liability crime whereby culpability is imposed on a defendant for doing the proscribed act. A defendant, a 15-year-old, entered the store to purchase a shotgun as a present for her father. She took a shotgun off the shelf and went to the cashier's counter to pay for it. Not seeing the cashier anywhere, the defendant left the exact price for the shotgun on the countertop and left the store. If the defendant is prosecuted for violating the state statute, she should be found\n\nA. guilty, because she purchased the shotgun while under the statutory age.\nB. guilty, because the statute imposes absolute criminal liability.\nC. not guilty, provided she was unaware that the statute prohibited the sale of weapons to a person in her age group.\nD. not guilty, provided that the legislative intent was not to make the purchase of shotguns a criminal offense.\n"

This means that the statute is a strict liability crime, and culpability is imposed on a defendant for doing the proscribed act regardless of whether they had knowledge of their wrongdoing or not. Therefore, the defendant, who is under the age of 17, would be found guilty of violating the statute even if she did not know that the statute prohibited the sale of weapons to persons in her age group."
