Nor were there just three such stars; four wanderers complete their revolutions about Jupiter, and of their alterations as observed more precisely later on we shall give a description here. Also I measured the distances between them by means of the telescope. . . .\nSuch are the observations concerning the four Medicean planets recently first discovered by me, and although from this data their periods have not yet been reconstructed in numerical form, it is legitimate at least to put in evidence some facts worthy of note. Above all, since they sometimes follow and sometimes precede Jupiter by the same intervals, and they remain within very limited distances either to east or west of Jupiter, accompanying that planet in both its retrograde and direct movements in a constant manner, no one can doubt that they complete their revolutions about Jupiter and at the same time effect all together a twelve-year period about the center of the universe.\n\u2014Galileo Galilei, 1610\nWhich of the following is best demonstrated by the passage about intellectual thought at the time?\n\nA. It led to better scientific tools, which led to a rise in the standard of living during the seventeenth century across Europe.\nB. The ideas of the ancient Greeks guided all of their ideas.\nC. It used information obtained through experimentation to conceptualize the universe.\nD. It provided experimental proof of the theories of ancient thinkers, such as Aristotle, on how the universe worked.\n"

Galileo's observations and measurements of the four Medicean planets (now known as the Galilean moons) around Jupiter were based on empirical evidence gathered through his use of the telescope. This method of using observational data to form new understandings about the cosmos was a hallmark of the Scientific Revolution of the 16th and 17th centuries, which Galileo played a significant role in advancing."
