This theory suggests that the effectiveness of a leader depends on the situation at hand and that leaders should adapt their style to the maturity level of their followers and the specific circumstances they face. It's not about personality traits (option A), events (option B) in isolation, or a political situation (option D), but rather how the leader responds to the context in which they are leading."
