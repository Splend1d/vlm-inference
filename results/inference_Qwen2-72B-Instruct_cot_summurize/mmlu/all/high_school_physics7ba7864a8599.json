                    "text": "Let's analyze each statement:\n\nA. The change in internal energy of the gas is equal to the work done during the isobaric step.\n\nThis statement is not necessarily true because the change in internal energy (\\(\\Delta U\\)) is given by the first law of thermodynamics: \\(\\Delta U = Q - W\\), where \\(Q\\) is the heat added to the system and \\(W\\) is the work done by the system. During the isobaric step, both heat transfer and work occur, but we cannot conclude that the change in internal energy is equal only to the work done without considering the heat transfer.\n\nB. The change in internal energy of the gas is equal to the work done during the isobaric step minus the work done during the isothermal step.\n\nThis statement is also incorrect. The change in internal energy over a complete cycle is zero for any cyclical process since the system returns to its initial state. The change in internal energy does not depend solely on the work done during the isobaric and isothermal steps; it depends on the net heat and work over the entire cycle.\n\nC. The total work done during the cycle is positive.\n\nThis statement could be true depending on the specifics of the cycle. In general, whether the total work done is positive or negative depends on the specific details of the cycle. However, without additional information about the specifics of the cycle (such as the direction of the steps), we cannot definitively say whether this statement is true or false. Typically, in a cycle designed to do useful work, like an engine cycle, the total work done would be positive.\n\nD. The total work done during the cycle is equal but opposite to the net amount of heat transferred.\n\nThis statement is true based on the first law of thermodynamics applied to a cyclical process. Over a complete cycle, the change in internal energy is zero because the system returns to its initial state. Therefore, the net heat transferred into the system over the cycle must be equal to the net work done by the system over the cycle. Since the work done by the system is considered positive, the heat transferred into the system must be equal but opposite in sign to maintain the conservation of energy.\n\nThe correct answer is D."
