According to Keynesian economics, during recessions, the government should increase spending or cut taxes to stimulate aggregate demand and pull the economy out of the downturn. Conversely, during periods of high inflation, the government should reduce spending or increase taxes to cool down the economy. Monetary policy, while acknowledged as important, is considered secondary to fiscal policy in influencing the economy's overall demand."
