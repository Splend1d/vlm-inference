If there is no contradiction, then the set is consistent.\n\nLet's start by assigning truth values to the variables in one of the options given:\n\nOption B: U, W, and X are true, and T is false.\n\n1. (T \u2283 U) \u2283 (W \u2283 U)\n   - Since T is false and U is true, (T \u2283 U) is true.\n   - Since W is true and U is true, (W \u2283 U) is true.\n   - Therefore, (T \u2283 U) \u2283 (W \u2283 U) is true.\n\n2. T \u2283 ~(U \u2283 X)\n   - Since T is false, the antecedent is false, making the whole implication true regardless of the truth value of the consequent.\n   - However, let's check the consequent: U is true, X is true, so (U \u2283 X) is true.\n   - The negation of (U \u2283 X) is false.\n   - Regardless, since the antecedent is false, the whole implication is true.\n\n3. (T \u2283 ~X) \u2283 W\n   - Since T is false, (T \u2283 ~X) is true regardless of the truth value of ~X.\n   - Since W is true, the whole implication is true.\n\nSince there is no contradiction, this set of propositions is consistent under the given conditions. So, the answer is:\n\nB. Consistent. Consistent valuation when U, W, and X are true and T is false."
