Give drugs regularly with provision for additional 'as required' pain relief for breakthrough pain.\n\nThe best approach to the use of analgesic drugs following surgery is to administer them on a regular schedule, rather than waiting for the patient to request them or for pain scores to reach a certain threshold. This helps prevent pain from becoming severe and is more effective in managing postoperative pain. Additionally, having the option for additional 'as required' pain relief allows for management of breakthrough pain, which can occur despite regular dosing."
