The original equation 12 \u00f7 t = 4 is used to find the number of rolls per room (t). However, solving for t requires you to manipulate the equation. If you multiply both sides by t and then divide both sides by 4, you get t = 12 \u00f7 4, which simplifies to t = 3.\n\nOption D represents this relationship correctly: if you multiply the number of rooms (4) by the number of rolls per room (t), you should get the total number of rolls (12). So, 4 \u00d7 t = 12 is equivalent to the original problem when solved for t."
