The fires leach nutrients from the soil\u201a preventing the germination of plants that might compete with native species.\nC.

The fires remove dead and decaying plant matter, reducing the risk of more intense and destructive fires.\n\nPeriodic natural wildfires can play a crucial role in maintaining the health and balance of certain forest ecosystems. By removing accumulated dead plant material, they help prevent the buildup of excessive fuel that could lead to larger, hotter, and more destructive fires under drier conditions. This process also allows sunlight to reach the forest floor, stimulating new growth and promoting biodiversity."
