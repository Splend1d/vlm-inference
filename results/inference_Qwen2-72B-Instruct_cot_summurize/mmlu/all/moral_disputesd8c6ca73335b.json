He argues in favor of a version of retributivism that emphasizes proportionality, where the punishment should fit the crime in terms of its severity. Therefore, the answer to your question is:\n\nB. proportional\n\nNathanson's view is that punishment should be proportionate to the harm caused by the offender, rather than being based solely on the need for deterrence or rehabilitation. He also argues against the idea of punishment as mere retaliation or vengeance, emphasizing instead that it should serve a moral purpose of holding individuals accountable for their actions."
