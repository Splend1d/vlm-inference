High.\n\nThis is because the moving coil, also known as the current coil, is intended to carry the full line current. To minimize power loss and voltage drop in the coil, it is designed with a high resistance so that it draws only a small amount of current relative to the circuit being measured. This ensures that the wattmeter does not significantly load the circuit and provides accurate power measurements."
