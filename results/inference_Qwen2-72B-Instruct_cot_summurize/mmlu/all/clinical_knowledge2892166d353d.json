When the rate of lactate production exceeds the rate of lactate clearance, lactate accumulates in the blood. This can occur during intense exercise when muscles switch to anaerobic metabolism due to insufficient oxygen supply, leading to increased lactate production. However, lactate is not solely a waste product; it can also be used as an energy source by other muscles and organs under certain conditions."
