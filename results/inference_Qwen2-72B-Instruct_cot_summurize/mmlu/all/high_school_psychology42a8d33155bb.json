When a neuron fires, it sends an electrical signal down its axon. This signal, called an action potential, is an \"all-or-none\" response. That means if the neuron's membrane potential reaches a certain threshold, typically around -55 mV, an action potential will be generated. If this threshold is not reached, no action potential will occur. Once the action potential is initiated, its amplitude remains constant regardless of the strength of the stimulus that caused it to fire."
