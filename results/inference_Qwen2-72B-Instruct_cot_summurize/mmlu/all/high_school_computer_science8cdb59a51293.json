Here's what each of these notations means:\n\nA. O(1) - This means that the runtime or space usage is constant regardless of the input size. It does not grow with the input size.\n\nB. O(n) - This means that the runtime or space usage grows linearly with the input size. If the input size doubles, the resource requirement typically doubles as well.\n\nC. O(n^2) - This means that the runtime or space usage grows quadratically with the input size. If the input size doubles, the resource requirement typically quadruples.\n\nD. O(log n) - This means that the runtime or space usage grows logarithmically with the input size. As the input size increases, the resource requirement grows much more slowly than the input size.\n\nIn terms of growth rate, the order from smallest to largest is:\n\nO(1) < O(log n) < O(n) < O(n^2)\n\nTherefore, the largest asymptotically is:\n\nC.
