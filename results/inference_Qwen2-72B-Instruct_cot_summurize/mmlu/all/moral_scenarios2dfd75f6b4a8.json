In Scenario 1, jumping on a table might be seen as inappropriate or potentially damaging to the table, but it is not necessarily a morally wrong action unless it results in harm or significant damage. In Scenario 2, talking to someone after Sunday school is a normal social interaction and is not morally wrong."
