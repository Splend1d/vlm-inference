This is often seen in predator-prey relationships where adaptations in one species (like improved hunting techniques in predators) lead to corresponding adaptations in the other (such as better camouflage in prey), and vice versa. This back-and-forth evolution can result in an \"arms race\" where each species continuously adapts to counter the adaptations of the other."
