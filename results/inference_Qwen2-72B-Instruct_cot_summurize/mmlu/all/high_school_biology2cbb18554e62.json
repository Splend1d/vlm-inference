When land masses separate or new islands form, populations of species become isolated. Over time, these isolated populations can evolve independently of their mainland counterparts due to differences in available resources, predators, and other environmental factors. This can lead to the development of distinct traits and, eventually, new species. This process is known as allopatric speciation. The Gal\u00e1pagos Islands are a famous example where Charles Darwin observed many species that were closely related to those on the South American mainland but had evolved unique characteristics due to their isolation."
