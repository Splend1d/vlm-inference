Let's denote the rate at which Rowena paints as \\(R_r\\) and the rate at which Ruby paints as \\(R_u\\). Given that Rowena can paint a room in 14 hours and Ruby can paint the same room in 6 hours, we have:\n\n\\[R_r = \\frac{1}{14} \\quad \\text{(room per hour)}\\]\n\\[R_u = \\frac{1}{6} \\quad \\text{(room per hour)}\\]\n\nNow, according to the first condition, if Rowena paints for \\(x\\) hours and Ruby paints for \\(y\\) hours, together they complete half of the painting. This translates into the equation:\n\n\\[R_rx + R_uy = \\frac{1}{2}\\]\n\nSubstituting the rates we found above:\n\n\\[\\frac{x}{14} + \\frac{y}{6} = \\frac{1}{2}\\]\n\nMultiplying everything by 42 (the least common multiple of 14 and 6) to clear denominators:\n\n\\[3x + 7y = 21\\]\n\nThis is our first equation.\n\nAccording to the second condition, if Rowena paints for \\(y\\) hours and Ruby paints for \\(x\\) hours, they complete the whole room. This translates into the equation:\n\n\\[R_ry + R_ux = 1\\]\n\nAgain, substituting the rates:\n\n\\[\\frac{y}{14} + \\frac{x}{6} = 1\\]\n\nMultiplying everything by 42:\n\n\\[3y + 7x = 42\\]\n\nSo, we have two equations:\n\n\\[3x + 7y = 21\\]\n\\[3y + 7x = 42\\]\n\nLet's solve this system of linear equations. First, we can multiply the first equation by 7 and the second equation by 3 to make the coefficients of \\(x\\) in both equations equal:\n\n\\[21x + 49y = 147\\]\n\\[9y + 21x = 126\\]\n\nSubtracting the second equation from the first:\n\n\\[40y = 21\\]\n\nThus,\n\n\\[y = \\frac{21}{40}\\]\n\nSubstituting \\(y\\) back into one of the original equations, let's use the first equation:\n\n\\[3x + 7\\left(\\frac{21}{40}\\right) = 21\\]\n\n\\[3x + \\frac{147}{40} = 21\\]\n\n\\[3x = 21 - \\frac{147}{40}\\]\n\n\\[3x = \\frac{840 - 147}{40}\\]\n\n\\[3x = \\frac{693}{40}\\]\n\n\\[x = \\frac{231}{40}\\]\n\nTherefore, the ordered pair \\((x,y)\\) is \\(\\boxed{\\left(\\frac{231}{40}, \\frac{21}{40}\\right)}\\), which corresponds to option C."
