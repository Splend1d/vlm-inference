Christianity and Buddhism\n\nUniversalizing religions are those that seek to be practiced by all people in the world, often involving active proselytization or missionary work. Christianity and Buddhism both fall into this category as they have spread across multiple continents and cultures, seeking to convert people from various backgrounds.\n\nIt's worth noting that while Buddhism originated in a specific region (ancient India), it has evolved over time and spread widely, adapting to many different cultures and contexts. Christianity, originating in the Middle East, similarly spread throughout the Roman Empire and beyond, becoming a global religion.\n\nIslam is also considered a universalizing religion, but since it was not one of the options paired with another universalizing religion in your question, option D is the correct answer based on the choices provided. Judaism and Hinduism, on the other hand, are typically categorized as ethnic religions, primarily associated with specific ethnic groups and geographic regions."
