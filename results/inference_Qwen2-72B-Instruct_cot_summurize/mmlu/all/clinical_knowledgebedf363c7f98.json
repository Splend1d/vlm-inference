                    "text": "None of the statements A, B, and C are universally true for all cases of diplopia. However, statement D is true: A sixth nerve palsy causes a divergent squint.\n\nLet's analyze each statement:\n\nA. Diplopia can never occur if one eye is covered.\n- This statement is not always true. If both eyes are affected by a condition (like corneal abrasion or cataracts), covering one eye may not eliminate double vision. However, in most cases of diplopia due to misalignment of the eyes, covering one eye will eliminate the double vision.\n\nB. The outer image is always the false image.\n- This statement is not necessarily true. The determination of which image is \"false\" depends on the specific cause of the diplopia and the position of the eyes. It is not always the case that the outer image is the false one.\n\nC. A fourth nerve palsy occurs when the patient looks upwards.\n- This statement is not accurate. Fourth nerve palsy affects the superior oblique muscle, which plays a role in downward and inward eye movements. When a patient with fourth nerve palsy looks down and to the opposite side of the affected eye, they may experience double vision because the affected eye does not move properly in that direction.\n\nD. A sixth nerve palsy causes a divergent squint.\n- This statement is true. The sixth cranial nerve innervates the lateral rectus muscle, which abducts the eye (moves it laterally away from the nose). If this nerve is damaged, the affected eye cannot move outward effectively, leading to an inward turn of the eye (esotropia) and a divergent squint when looking toward the affected side."
