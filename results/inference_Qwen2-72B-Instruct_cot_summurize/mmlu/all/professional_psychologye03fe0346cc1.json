Scores on the BDI-II range from 0 to 63, with higher scores indicating more severe depressive symptoms. According to the standard guidelines for interpreting BDI-II scores:\n\n- Scores of 0-13 indicate minimal depression.\n- Scores of 14-19 indicate mild depression.\n- Scores of 20-28 indicate moderate depression.\n- Scores of 29-63 indicate severe depression.\n\nGiven this information, a score of 50 on the BDI-II would fall into the category of severe depression (option D). However, it's important to note that a clinical diagnosis should be made by a qualified healthcare professional based on a comprehensive evaluation, and not solely on the basis of a self-report inventory like the BDI-II."
