However, for the purpose of this question, we can make an educated guess based on common observations.\n\nDriving in heavy rain can lead to reduced fuel efficiency due to several reasons:\n\n1. **Increased Rolling Resistance**: Wet roads increase rolling resistance, which means the tires have to work harder to maintain traction, leading to increased fuel consumption.\n\n2. **Aerodynamic Drag**: Rain and water on the road can also affect aerodynamics, potentially increasing drag and thus reducing fuel efficiency.\n\n3. **Engine Load**: The engine may need to work harder under wet conditions, especially if you're frequently accelerating or decelerating due to reduced visibility and safety concerns.\n\n4. **Use of Accessories**: Increased use of accessories like the air conditioning (to demist windows) and wipers can also slightly reduce fuel efficiency.\n\nConsidering these factors, a reasonable estimate might be around a 2% to 10% decrease in fuel efficiency during heavy rain. However, for the purposes of answering the multiple-choice question, option B (About 2%) seems more likely than C (About 10%) for most modern vehicles under normal driving conditions. A 10% decrease would be more significant and is typically associated with extreme conditions or older, less efficient vehicles.\n\nSo, the answer that best fits within the context of a general estimation would be:\n\n**B. About 2%**"
