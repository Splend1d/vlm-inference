In this case, every gamete (sperm or egg) produced by each parent will carry the mutated gene since there is no other allele to pair with it.\n\nGiven this scenario, every child they have will receive one copy of the mutated gene from each parent, resulting in the child also having two copies of the mutated gene. Therefore, each child will be affected by the disorder.\n\nThe answer is:\n\nD. 1 (or 100% chance)"
