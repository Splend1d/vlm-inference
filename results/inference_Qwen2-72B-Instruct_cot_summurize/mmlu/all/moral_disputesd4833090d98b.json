According to public sources, Ali Soufan, a former FBI agent who interrogated high-value detainees after the 9/11 attacks, testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee in 2009 that he obtained valuable intelligence from detainees using non-coercive techniques and that torture was not necessary or effective for gathering information. He stated that \"the best intelligence is gained through building rapport with a detainee\" and that \"torture is not an effective interrogation technique.\" Therefore, option C is the correct answer. Options A, B, and D may also be true, but they are not directly supported by Soufan's testimony as cited by Baron."
