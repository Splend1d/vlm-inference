A low intake of carbohydrates in the diet can lead to reduced glycogen stores, which may result in decreased performance during high-intensity activities that last longer than a few minutes. While options A, B, and D might have some truth under certain conditions, option C directly addresses the impact of low carbohydrate intake on high-intensity exercise performance."
