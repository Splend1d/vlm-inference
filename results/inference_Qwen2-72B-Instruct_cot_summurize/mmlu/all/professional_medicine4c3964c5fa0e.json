Increased intensity of the murmur with deep inspiration\nC. Increased intensity of the murmur with forced expiration\nD. Positive Kussmaul sign (rise in jugular venous pulse with inspiration)\n"

A systolic heart murmur is a common finding in patients with endocarditis due to the presence of vegetations on the heart valves. The intensity of the murmur may increase with Valsalva maneuver (forced expiration against a closed glottis), which increases intrathoracic pressure and decreases venous return to the heart, leading to increased turbulence across the affected valve. Therefore, the expected physical finding would be C. Increased intensity of the murmur with forced expiration."
