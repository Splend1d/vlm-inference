In this case, the sample size is 16, which is generally considered large enough for the Central Limit Theorem to apply.\n\nThe mean of the sampling distribution of the sample means (also known as the expected value) will be equal to the population mean, which is 210 mg/dL. The standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the sample means (also known as the standard error) is calculated by dividing the population standard deviation by the square root of the sample size:\n\nStandard Error = Population Standard Deviation / \u221aSample Size\n\nSo,\n\nStandard Error = 15 / \u221a16 = 15 / 4 = 3.75 mg/dL\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: The shape is approximately normal with a mean of 210 and a standard deviation of 3.75."
