Wright Mills in his 1956 book \"The Power Elite,\" not by Scott in 1991. The term describes a small group of people who hold a disproportionate amount of power, authority, and resources in a society, often within the military, corporate, and political spheres. However, it seems there might be a confusion in the attribution, as the concept was indeed developed by Mills, not Scott."
