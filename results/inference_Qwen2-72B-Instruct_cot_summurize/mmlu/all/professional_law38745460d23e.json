                    "text": "The answer to this question is based on the U.S. Constitution's Supremacy Clause (Article VI, Clause 2), which establishes that the Constitution, federal laws, and treaties made under the authority of the United States are the supreme law of the land. When there is a conflict between a congressional act and a valid treaty, neither automatically prevails over the other simply by virtue of being a treaty or an act of Congress.\n\nIn general, the principle that applies is \"last in time prevails,\" meaning that if there is a direct conflict between a treaty and a later-enacted congressional statute, the statute will prevail. This is because treaties are considered to be part of the \"law of the land\" but can be modified or superseded by subsequent legislation. However, this does not mean that all treaties are subordinate to statutes; the specific circumstances and the intent of the treaty and the statute must be considered.\n\nAdditionally, the Supreme Court has interpreted that treaties and statutes should be read together, if possible, to give effect to both. If a clear conflict cannot be reconciled, then the last in time principle may apply.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer to your question is:\n\nC. The last in time prevails\n\nHowever, it's important to note that this is a simplified explanation of a complex legal issue, and the resolution of such conflicts can involve detailed analysis by courts."
