Selling Treasury securities to commercial banks.\n\nWhen the central bank sells Treasury securities to commercial banks, it removes reserves from the banking system, thereby reducing the money supply. This is a contractionary monetary policy that can offset the stimulative effects of expansionary fiscal policy, such as increased government spending or tax cuts. By reducing the money supply, interest rates may rise, which can discourage investment and consumption, thus diminishing the impact of fiscal stimulus on aggregate demand."
