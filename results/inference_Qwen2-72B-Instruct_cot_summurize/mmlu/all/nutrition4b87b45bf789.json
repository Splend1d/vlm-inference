The protein requirement is equal to the demand divided by the efficiency of utilization.\n\nExplanation: The protein requirement for an individual is determined by dividing the demand (amount of essential amino acids needed) by the efficiency of utilization (how well the body can use the protein consumed). This takes into account that not all proteins are equally digestible or contain all essential amino acids in sufficient quantities, so more protein may need to be consumed to meet the body's needs."
