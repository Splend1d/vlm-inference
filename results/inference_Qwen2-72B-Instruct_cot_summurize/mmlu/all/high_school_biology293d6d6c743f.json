Prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells have no structural similarities.\nC. The organelles in larger eukaryotic cells took care of the problems of having a larger surface area\u2013to\u2013volume ratio.\nD.

Eukaryotic organelles helped create separate environments for metabolic reactions, thus increasing their metabolic efficiency.\n\nThis statement is correct because eukaryotic cells contain membrane-bound organelles that allow for compartmentalization of various cellular processes. This compartmentalization creates separate environments for different metabolic reactions, which can increase the efficiency of these reactions by concentrating enzymes and substrates in specific locations."
