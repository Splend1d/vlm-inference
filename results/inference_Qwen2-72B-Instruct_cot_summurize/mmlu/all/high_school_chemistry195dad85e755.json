This means that not all of the HBr will be neutralized.\n\nThe amount of HBr that will remain after the reaction is:\n0.000125 moles HBr - 0.000115 moles KOH = 0.000010 moles HBr\n\nThe total volume of the solution after mixing is:\n50 mL + 50 mL = 100 mL or 0.100 L\n\nNow, we can find the concentration of the remaining HBr:\n\\[ [HBr] = \\frac{0.000010 \\, \\text{moles}}{0.100 \\, \\text{L}} = 0.00010 \\, \\text{M} \\]\n\nThe pH can be calculated from the concentration of H+ ions, which is equal to the concentration of HBr in this case since HBr is a strong acid that completely dissociates in water:\n\\[ [H^+] = [HBr] = 0.00010 \\, \\text{M} \\]\n\nThus, the pH is:\n\\[ \\text{pH} = -\\log [H^+] = -\\log(0.00010) = 4 \\]\n\nSo the answer is B. 4."
