                    "text": "When expansionary fiscal and expansionary monetary policies are used simultaneously, the most likely outcome is that interest rates will remain relatively constant (option C). Here's why:\n\nExpansionary fiscal policy involves increasing government spending or cutting taxes to stimulate economic growth, which can lead to an increase in aggregate demand. This increased demand could potentially push up interest rates as the government competes with the private sector for loanable funds.\n\nOn the other hand, expansionary monetary policy, also known as easy money policy, involves decreasing interest rates and increasing the money supply. This makes borrowing cheaper and encourages investment and consumption, further stimulating the economy. The decrease in interest rates due to expansionary monetary policy would counteract any potential rise in interest rates caused by expansionary fiscal policy.\n\nTherefore, the combined effect of these two policies can often result in interest rates staying relatively constant while both aggregate demand and output (real GDP) increase. This can also potentially lead to higher inflation if the economy is already near full capacity, but it does not necessarily mean inflation will decrease dramatically (option D) or that unemployment will increase (option A) or real GDP will decrease (option B).\n\nHowever, the exact outcomes can vary depending on the specifics of the economy at the time these policies are implemented, including factors like the level of economic slack, the state of the business cycle, and the effectiveness of the transmission mechanisms of monetary and fiscal policy."
