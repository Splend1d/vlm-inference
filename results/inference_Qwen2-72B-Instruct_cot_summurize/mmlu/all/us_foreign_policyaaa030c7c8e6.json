Bush decided not to pursue Saddam Hussein's removal from power due to the limited mandate given by the United Nations, which authorized the use of force only to expel Iraq from Kuwait. Additionally, Bush was concerned that a prolonged ground war could lead to significant American casualties and destabilize the region, potentially causing more problems than it solved. There were also concerns about what would happen to Iraq and the region if Saddam was removed without a clear plan for a stable transition of power."
