Which of the following power levels corresponds to the absolute threshold for hearing the decibels produced by the bell?\n\nA. 80%\nB. 70%\nC. 60%\nD. Not enough information given.\n"

Based on the data provided, none of the percentages correspond directly to an absolute threshold because none of them are at the 50% detection level. However, since the number of mice pressing the lever decreases as the power decreases, it can be inferred that the absolute threshold would be somewhere between 60% and 70%, where the number of mice responding drops from 15 to 10. Given the options, the closest we can infer based on the information provided is:\n\nC. 60%\n\nHowever, it's important to note that without additional data points or a more precise measurement showing where the 50% detection level occurs, option D (\"Not enough information given\") could also be considered a correct response in a strict sense. But based on the options provided and assuming the question is looking for the lowest power level where mice still responded, C is the best answer."
