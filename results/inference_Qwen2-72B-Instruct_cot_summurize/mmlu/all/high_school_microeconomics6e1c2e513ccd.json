                    "text": "In a monopsony labor market, there is only one buyer of labor (the employer) facing many sellers (the workers). This gives the employer market power to set wages below what they would be in a competitive market. In contrast, in a perfectly competitive labor market, there are many buyers and sellers of labor, and no single buyer or seller has market power.\n\nThe transition from a monopsony labor market to a perfectly competitive labor market would lead to an increase in both wages and employment. Here's why:\n\n1. **Wages would increase**: In a monopsony, the employer can pay lower wages because workers have no alternative employers to turn to. When the market becomes competitive, firms must offer higher wages to attract workers, as workers now have multiple job options. This leads to an increase in the equilibrium wage rate.\n\n2. **Employment would also increase**: In a monopsony, the quantity of labor employed is less than it would be in a competitive market because the monopsonist hires up to the point where the marginal cost of labor equals the marginal revenue product of labor. However, due to the monopsonist's market power, this occurs at a lower wage and lower employment level than in a competitive market. When the market becomes competitive, firms hire more workers because they are willing to hire up to the point where the wage equals the marginal revenue product of labor, which results in higher employment.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**A. Both would increase.**"
