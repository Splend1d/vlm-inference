It also imposes an excise tax of $100 per year on every itinerant commercial photographer for the privilege of using the streets and sidewalks. A credit is allowed against this latter tax for any excise tax paid to the city by the photographer or his employer in respect to the maintenance of a photographic studio in the city. In an action by a studio located in the city challenging the constitutionality of the $200 per year excise tax, the court will most likely declare the tax\n\nA. constitutional, as a nondiscriminatory license tax.\nB. constitutional, as within the powers of the state to tax the instruments of interstate commerce.\nC. unconstitutional, as an undue burden on interstate commerce.\nD. unconstitutional, as a discriminatory tax on the privilege of doing business within the state.\n"

The tax imposed on the studios ($200 per year) does not appear to be discriminatory since it applies equally to all such studios in the city. The fact that there is a credit available for itinerant photographers who pay the $100 tax if they or their employer have also paid the $200 studio tax indicates that the city is attempting to avoid double taxation and treat all parties equitably.\n\nAs long as these taxes do not disproportionately affect interstate commerce compared to intrastate commerce, they are likely to be seen as constitutional under the principle that municipalities can levy nondiscriminatory license taxes on businesses operating within their jurisdiction. The taxes must not be so high as to constitute an undue burden on interstate commerce, but based on the information provided, there is no indication that this is the case. Therefore, the court is most likely to find the $200 per year excise tax on studios constitutional."
