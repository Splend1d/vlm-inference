Intangibility, perishability, variability, inseparability, and a lack of ownership.\n\nLet's break down each of these characteristics:\n\n1. **Intangibility**: Services cannot be seen, tasted, felt, heard, or smelled before purchase. They are non-physical in nature, which makes them difficult to evaluate before consumption.\n\n2. **Perishability**: Unlike goods that can be stored for future use, services cannot be stored. Once a service opportunity passes, it is lost forever. This characteristic emphasizes the importance of managing demand and supply effectively.\n\n3. **Variability**: Services are often produced and consumed simultaneously, making them highly dependent on who provides the service and when and where it is provided. This leads to inconsistencies in quality as the service is influenced by the provider's skills, mood, and the customer's expectations.\n\n4. **Inseparability**: Services are typically produced and consumed at the same time. The customer and the service provider must interact during the service delivery process. This means that the quality of the service is directly linked to the interaction between the service provider and the customer.\n\n5. **Lack of Ownership**: When you buy a product, you own it. However, when you receive a service, you do not own anything tangible. You have received an experience or outcome, but there is no physical item to take possession of.\n\nThese characteristics differentiate services from goods and pose unique challenges for service providers in areas such as marketing, pricing, and quality control."
