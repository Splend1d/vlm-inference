The retailer stayed in possession and became the lessee for the next 25 years with monthly payments and various obligations regarding maintaining the property. The retailer had to pay most of the expenses on the property, and had options for further extensions but not to purchase the property back. Within a few years, lessee's business grew and he wanted to tear down one of the buildings and attach a new building to his store. The investor refused to consent. Lessee filed suit asking for an order compelling compliance. Will the court likely order the investor to comply with the lessor's demands?\n\nA. No, it will preclude the lessee from making such drastic changes without the investor's consent.\nB. Yes, the lessee will be able to make the improvements without the investor's consent but the improvements will belong to the investor.\nC. No, because in every sale-leaseback agreement, there is a clause guaranteeing that the lessee cannot make improvements without the written consent of the investor.\nD. Yes, because the lessee's equity interest surpasses the investor's interest, giving the lessee the right to make improvements.\n"

No, it will preclude the lessee from making such drastic changes without the investor's consent.\n\nIn a sale-leaseback arrangement, the terms of the lease typically dictate whether the lessee can make improvements to the property. If the lease does not explicitly grant the lessee the right to make significant alterations or improvements, the lessee would need the lessor's (investor's) consent. Since the investor refused to consent, and assuming the lease does not allow for such changes without consent, the court is unlikely to compel the investor to allow the lessee to proceed with the modifications. However, this answer assumes that the lease does not contain any clauses that automatically permit such improvements or that the investor's refusal was not in violation of any explicit terms of the lease."
