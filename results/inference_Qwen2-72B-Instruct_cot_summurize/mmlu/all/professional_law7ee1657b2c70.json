As he drove down a small hill toward an intersection with a stop sign, he applied the brakes, but they failed to work, and the truck did not slow down. The farmer could not stop for the stop sign. He saw a pedestrian crossing the street at the intersection and tried to steer around him, but was unable to do so. The pickup truck struck the pedestrian and seriously injured him. If the injured pedestrian asserts a negligence claim against the auto dealership that sold the truck to the farmer, and if it is conclusively proven that the brake failure resulted from a manufacturing defect in the car, will the pedestrian prevail?\n\nA. No, because the pedestrian was not a purchaser or user of the truck.\nB. No, if the farmer was negligent in being unable to steer around and avoid hitting the pedestrian.\nC. Yes, because the auto dealer placed a defective car into the stream of commerce.\nD. Yes, if the defect could have been discovered through the exercise of reasonable care by the auto dealer.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is C. Yes, because the auto dealer placed a defective car into the stream of commerce.\n\nUnder product liability law, a manufacturer or seller (such as the auto dealership) can be held liable for injuries caused by a defective product, even if the injured party was not the direct purchaser or user of the product. This is known as strict liability, which does not require proof of negligence on the part of the manufacturer or seller. The fact that the brake failure resulted from a manufacturing defect and led directly to the injury of the pedestrian would likely make the auto dealership liable under strict liability principles.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the pedestrian's status as a non-purchaser or non-user does not preclude them from asserting a claim under product liability law.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because the question of whether the farmer was negligent in steering around the pedestrian is irrelevant to the auto dealership's liability for selling a defective vehicle. While the farmer's actions might be relevant in determining comparative fault between the pedestrian and the farmer, this does not affect the dealership's responsibility for the defective product.\n\nAnswer D is also incorrect because, while it is true that a seller can be held liable if the defect could have been discovered through reasonable care, strict liability applies regardless of whether the defect could have been discovered. However, the more accurate reason for holding the auto dealership liable in this scenario is based on the principle of placing a defective product into the stream of commerce, which is covered by answer C."
