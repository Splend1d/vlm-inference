The driver of the other car sued the company. The company, in its defense, claimed that the employee's use of the vehicle was unauthorized. At trial, the company calls the employee's boss. The boss offers to testify that the employee called him five minutes after the accident and stated, \"I hope you won't be sore, because I took the company car without permission. \"The court should rule that this evidence is\n\nA. admissible as a declaration against interest.\nB. admissible as an admission.\nC. inadmissible, because the employee was not unavailable.\nD. inadmissible, because it violates the employee's Fifth Amendment rights.\n"

Such statements can be used as evidence in court if they are relevant to the case at hand, which in this scenario, they are. The fact that the employee made this statement to his boss can help the company defend itself against the lawsuit by showing that the employee was acting outside the scope of his employment when the accident occurred."
