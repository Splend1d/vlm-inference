In general, businesses have a duty to maintain their premises in a reasonably safe condition for their customers. This includes regularly inspecting the premises to discover and address any known or potential hazards. If the theater can be shown to have been negligent in failing to properly inspect and maintain the seats, the customer may be able to recover damages for their injuries. However, if the theater can demonstrate that it took reasonable steps to maintain the safety of its premises, the customer may not be able to recover."
