The fatal wound was inflicted by a single shot, and there was no suggestion of a conspiracy among those present. One of the three men was charged with the killing. The prosecution called one of the other men as its first witness. His testimony, if true, established that the defendant fired the shot that killed the victim. The defendant's attorney then called the man's longtime neighbor to impeach him. Which of the following offers of evidence is most likely to be admitted for the impeachment of the man?\n\nA. Testimony that the witness is a cocaine addict.\nB. Testimony that the witness embezzled money from his employer last year.\nC. Testimony that the witness is not, in the neighbor's opinion, worthy of belief.\nD. Testimony that the witness is an atheist.\n"

Testimony that the witness is not, in the neighbor's opinion, worthy of belief.\n\nThis type of testimony directly addresses the witness's credibility and character for truthfulness, which is relevant to assessing whether the jury should believe the witness's testimony. The other options (A, B, and D) may also be relevant under certain circumstances, but they do not directly pertain to the witness's credibility in the same way that option C does. For instance, being a cocaine addict or having committed embezzlement could be used to suggest a lack of moral character, but these are not necessarily direct indicators of the witness's honesty or reliability in court. Being an atheist is generally not relevant to a person's credibility in legal proceedings. However, it is important to note that the admissibility of evidence for impeachment purposes can depend on various factors, including the specific rules of evidence applicable in the jurisdiction where the trial is taking place."
