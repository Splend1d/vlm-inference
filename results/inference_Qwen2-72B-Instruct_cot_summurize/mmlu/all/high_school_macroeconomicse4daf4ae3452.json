The Fed, as the central bank of the United States, primarily uses monetary policy tools to influence economic conditions. Among the options given, the Fed might adopt the following policies to counter a recession:\n\nD. The purchase of bonds: This is part of what's known as open market operations. By purchasing bonds, the Fed injects money into the banking system, which can lower interest rates and encourage borrowing and spending. This can help stimulate economic activity during a recession.\n\nC. However, an increase in the discount rate would make it more expensive for banks to borrow from the Fed, which could actually slow down economic activity and is therefore not a policy the Fed would use to counter a recession. Instead, the Fed would likely lower the discount rate to make it cheaper for banks to borrow money, encouraging them to lend more to businesses and consumers.\n\nSo, the correct answer from the options given is:\n\nD. The purchase of bonds"
