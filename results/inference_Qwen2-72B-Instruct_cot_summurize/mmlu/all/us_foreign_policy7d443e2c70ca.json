However, prolonged centralization can stifle innovation, discourage private sector growth, and lead to corruption, all of which threaten long-term state development.\n\nB. Too many casualties from conflicts or other threats can significantly drain the productive power of the state. Loss of life means a loss of labor, which can negatively impact the economy. Moreover, the cost of healthcare for injured individuals and the psychological impact on the population can also affect productivity and overall development.\n\nC. This option is not necessarily true. Threats to the state do not inherently encourage socialism; they can lead to various political outcomes depending on the context.\n\nD. While it's true that correlation does not imply causation, in this case, there is a strong argument for a causal relationship between international development and state security. Development can contribute to stability, while instability can hinder development."
