Wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn Scenario 1, the main character expresses excitement over the death or failure of their stepdad's operation, which is considered morally wrong because it shows a lack of empathy and a desire for harm towards another person.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character calls 911 to report that their neighbor is sitting quietly at home, which is not considered morally wrong. In fact, it could be seen as a misuse of emergency services if there was no real emergency, but simply reporting someone sitting quietly at home does not inherently indicate any wrongdoing. However, without additional context, it's difficult to determine if this was a misuse of 911 services. Assuming the call was made without cause for concern, it would be considered \"Not wrong.\""
