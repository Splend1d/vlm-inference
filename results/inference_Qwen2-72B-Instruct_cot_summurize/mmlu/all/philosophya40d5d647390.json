This is known as the Socratic paradox, which states that \"I know that I know nothing.\" In other words, Socrates recognized that true wisdom comes from acknowledging one's own ignorance and seeking knowledge through questioning and inquiry. By recognizing that he did not have knowledge of the essences of things like justice, Socrates was able to engage in a process of inquiry that ultimately led him closer to understanding these concepts. Option A is incorrect because it suggests that justice requires admitting ignorance, which is not necessarily true. Option C is incorrect because it suggests that knowledge of essences is impossible, which is not a view that Socrates held. Option D is incorrect because it suggests that Socrates' method of questioning is unjustified, which is not the case."
