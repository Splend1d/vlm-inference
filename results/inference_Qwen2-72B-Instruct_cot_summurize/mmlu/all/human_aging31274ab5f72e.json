Sensory memories, which include things like visual, auditory, and tactile memories, tend to remain relatively stable over the adult years. While personal concerns, marital strain, and job satisfaction can all fluctuate depending on life circumstances, sensory memories are often more resistant to change. However, it's worth noting that this can vary from person to person, and some individuals may experience changes in their sensory memories due to age-related declines in sensory function or other factors."
