The contractor who was working on the restaurant expansion found that the north wall of the new structure needed extensive support, so anchor rods and concrete were added. The supporting anchor rods and concrete extended into a neighboring property farther to the north at a point 20 feet below the surface. Although there was no impact on the surface of his land or on existing uses, the owner of the neighboring property has sued the restaurant owner for trespass. Which party is likely to prevail?\n\nA. The neighboring property owner, because he should have been given notice of the intrusion before it occurred.\nB. The neighboring property owner, because the restaurant intruded upon his property the restaurant intruded upon his property without permission.\nC. The restaurant owner, because the decision to provide the additional support was reasonable.\nD. The restaurant owner, because there was no disturbance of peaceful enjoyment of the neighboring property. \u0080\u0083\n"

The neighboring property owner, because the restaurant intruded upon his property without permission.\n\nIn general, property rights extend both above the ground and below it. The fact that the restaurant's expansion did not disturb the surface of the neighboring property does not negate the fact that it physically intruded into the subsurface of the neighboring property without the owner's consent. This constitutes a trespass under common law. The restaurant owner may have had a reasonable need for the additional support, but this does not automatically grant them the right to use another person's property without their permission. The restaurant owner would typically need to negotiate an easement or other agreement with the neighboring property owner to legally use the subsurface space."
