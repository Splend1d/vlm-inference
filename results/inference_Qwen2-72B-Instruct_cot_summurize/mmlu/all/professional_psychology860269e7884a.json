This is to protect both the client and the therapist from potential harm and to maintain professional boundaries. Even if the relationship ended amicably, the potential for bias, conflict of interest, and impaired judgment is still present. Therefore, the most ethical course of action would be for Dr. Ryan to refer the man to another qualified mental health professional."
