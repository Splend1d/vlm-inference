If a woman with phenylketonuria (PKU) does not follow a special diet to control her phenylalanine levels during pregnancy, there is a very high risk that her child will have serious birth defects. These can include intellectual disability, microcephaly (a smaller than normal head size), and heart problems. It's important for women with PKU who are pregnant or planning to become pregnant to work closely with their healthcare provider to manage their condition."
