Ratio Data is an interval data with an absolute zero\n\nRatio data is characterized by having all the properties of interval data (ordered, constant scale) as well as an absolute zero point. This means that ratio data not only allows for the comparison of differences between values but also the comparison of magnitudes. For example, saying one object's length is twice that of another makes sense when dealing with ratio data. Examples include height, weight, and temperature in Kelvin."
