Ojizo-sama\n\nOjizo-sama, also known as Jiz\u014d Bosatsu or Jiz\u014d Bodhisattva, is a widely venerated figure in Japanese Buddhism who is often associated with the protection of travelers, especially children and those who have died before their parents. Among his many roles, he is believed to help guide the souls of deceased children to salvation, particularly those who have died prematurely or tragically. This includes protecting them from the suffering they might otherwise endure in the realm of hungry ghosts (preta) or other unhappy states of existence.\n\nGuan-yin (also spelled Kuan Yin, Guanyin, or Avalokiteshvara) and Kannon are both forms of the same bodhisattva, known for compassion and mercy, but not specifically for guiding the souls of dead children. Guan-yin/Kannon is more generally associated with saving beings from all kinds of suffering.\n\nAmitabha is a Buddha, not a bodhisattva, and is primarily associated with the Pure Land teachings that promise rebirth in the Western Paradise for those who recite his name or pray to him.\n\nThus, the correct answer to your question is C. Ojizo-sama."
