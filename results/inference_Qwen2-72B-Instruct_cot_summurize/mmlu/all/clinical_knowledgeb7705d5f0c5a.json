IV administration allows titration of a drug with its desired effect.\n\nIntravenous (IV) administration of drugs allows for rapid onset of action and precise control over the dosage, making it possible to titrate the drug to achieve the desired therapeutic effect. This method bypasses the digestive system and goes directly into the bloodstream, ensuring that the full dose reaches the systemic circulation quickly.\n\nA. IV administration does not delay the action of a drug; rather, it typically results in an immediate or very rapid onset of action compared to other routes of administration.\n\nB. While proper technique can minimize risks, IV administration still carries some risk of bacteraemia, especially if aseptic techniques are not strictly followed.\n\nD. It is common practice to use an intravenous cannula for both drug and fluid administration, provided that compatibility between the substances is confirmed and proper procedures are followed to prevent interactions or complications. However, it's important to note that certain medications may require dedicated lines to avoid dilution or interaction with other substances."
