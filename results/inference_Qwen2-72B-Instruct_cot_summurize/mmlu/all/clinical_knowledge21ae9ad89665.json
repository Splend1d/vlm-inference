The phlebitis scale categorizes the severity of inflammation at the IV site as follows:\n\n- **Stage 0**: No symptoms\n- **Stage 1**: Redness or tenderness at the site\n- **Stage 2**: Redness, tenderness, and swelling at the site\n- **Stage 3**: Redness, tenderness, swelling, and palpable cord at the site\n- **Stage 4**: All of the above plus purulent drainage\n\nGiven that two of the mentioned symptoms are present (pain and either erythema or swelling), it suggests a minimum of Stage 2 phlebitis. If all three symptoms (pain, erythema, and swelling) are present, it would be classified as Stage 3.\n\n**Action:**\nFor Stage 2 phlebitis, the recommended action is to re-site the cannula (remove the existing IV line and place a new one elsewhere). This is because keeping the IV line in place can exacerbate the condition and lead to complications such as infection or thrombosis. For Stage 3, in addition to re-siting the cannula, considering treatment for any potential underlying infection or inflammation is also advised.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**C. Stage 3 - re-site cannula and consider treatment.**\n\nHowever, if only two of the symptoms are present, then the action based on the provided options would be:\n\n**B. Stage 2 - re-site cannula.**"
