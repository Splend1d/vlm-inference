The relationship between these variables can be rearranged to solve for \\( \\Delta P \\):\n\n\\[ \\Delta \\text{Nominal Income} = \\Delta \\text{Real Income} + \\Delta P + (\\Delta \\text{Real Income} \\times \\Delta P) \\]\n\nSince we're dealing with small percentage changes, we can approximate that the term \\( (\\Delta \\text{Real Income} \\times \\Delta P) \\) is negligible. Thus, the equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[ 4\\% \\approx -1\\% + \\Delta P \\]\n\nSolving for \\( \\Delta P \\):\n\n\\[ \\Delta P \\approx 4\\% + 1\\% = 5\\% \\]\n\nThus, the price level increased by approximately 5%.\n\nThe correct answer is D. 5 percent increase."
