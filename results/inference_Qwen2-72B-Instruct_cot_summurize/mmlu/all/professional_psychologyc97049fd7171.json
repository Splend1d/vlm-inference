Children with high activity levels may react to pressure by becoming even more active in ways that don't help them solve the problem or cope with the situation. This could include fidgeting, pacing, or other forms of nonproductive motor activity. However, it's important to note that every child is different and may react to pressure in their own unique way. Some may become anxious, passive, or even physically and behaviorally abusive, depending on their personality, past experiences, and the specific circumstances."
