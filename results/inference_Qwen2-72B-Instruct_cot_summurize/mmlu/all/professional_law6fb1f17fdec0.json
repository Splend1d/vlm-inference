The door opened at 6 a.m. and hundreds of people rushed the entrance for a chance at a hugely discounted holiday gift. When defendant saw that there was a signed copy of a book written by his mother's favorite author, he jumped towards it, only to be blocked by a little old lady with a baseball bat. She was using the bat as a blocking tool, but he was determined to get the book, so he deliberately stuck his leg out in front of her and tripped her. She fell hard and in the process ended up with a blood clot in her leg, which traveled to her heart over a period of weeks, and ultimately caused her death. What crime can the defendant likely be convicted of?\n\nA. First degree murder\nB. Second degree murder\nC. Involuntary manslaughter\nD. voluntary manslaughter\n"

Involuntary manslaughter typically involves the unintentional killing of another person due to reckless behavior or criminal negligence, without malice aforethought. In this scenario, the defendant did not intend to kill the little old lady, but his actions in tripping her were reckless and resulted in her death.\n\nAnswer: C. Involuntary manslaughter\n\nIt is important to note that the specific charge may vary depending on the jurisdiction and the interpretation of the events by law enforcement, prosecutors, and the court. However, based on the information provided, involuntary manslaughter seems to be the most appropriate charge."
