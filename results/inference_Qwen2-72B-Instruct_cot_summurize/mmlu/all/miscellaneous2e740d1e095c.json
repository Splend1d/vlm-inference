GDP deflator\n\nReal GDP is calculated by dividing the nominal GDP by the GDP deflator, which adjusts for changes in price levels, allowing for a comparison of the value of goods and services produced from one year to another without the distortion of inflation. The formula to calculate Real GDP is:\n\nReal GDP = Nominal GDP / GDP Deflator\n\nThe other options listed (money supply, unemployment rate, and government's budget deficit) are not used in the calculation of real GDP."
