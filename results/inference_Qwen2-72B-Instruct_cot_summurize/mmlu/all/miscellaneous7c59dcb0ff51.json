However, we can make an educated guess based on available statistics.\n\nAccording to the Motion Picture Association (MPA), in 2019, there were about 26 billion movie \"attendances\" globally across all platforms (theatrical, home entertainment, and streaming). The US market represents a significant portion of this consumption, but no exact figures are given for home viewing alone.\n\nIn terms of home entertainment, the Digital Entertainment Group reported that in 2020, consumer spending on home entertainment in the US reached $25.2 billion, with digital rentals and purchases making up the majority. However, converting spending into the number of movies watched isn't straightforward since prices vary, and some services offer unlimited viewing for a monthly fee.\n\nFor the sake of estimation, let's consider a scenario where each US household watches an average of one movie per week. With approximately 128 million households in the US as of 2020, that would equate to roughly 6.7 billion movies watched annually if every household watched one movie per week (128 million households * 52 weeks = 6.656 billion).\n\nHowever, this is likely an underestimate since many households have multiple members who may watch different movies at different times, and people often watch more than one movie per week, especially considering the popularity of streaming services like Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Disney+.\n\nGiven these factors, it's reasonable to assume that the number could easily be in the tens of billions. Therefore, option C (20,000,000,000) seems to be the closest estimate among the choices provided. However, it's important to note that this is still a rough guess, and the actual number could be higher or lower depending on various factors such as changes in viewing habits, population size, and the availability of new content."
