These include unemployment benefits, welfare payments, and progressive taxation systems. During a recession, more people become eligible for these benefits, increasing government spending and supporting aggregate demand. Conversely, during an expansion, fewer people qualify for benefits, and tax revenues rise as incomes increase, helping to reduce budget deficits. These mechanisms help stabilize the economy by counteracting fluctuations in economic activity."
