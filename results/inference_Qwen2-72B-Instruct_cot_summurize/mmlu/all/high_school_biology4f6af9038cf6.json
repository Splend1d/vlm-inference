Since then, most cells on Earth have internal organelles. Which of the following best summarizes an advantage of having internal membranes and organelles?\n\nA. DNA can reproduce more efficiently.\nB. Even though prokaryotes do not have mitochondria, they contain structures that carry out the same function.\nC. Organelles separate specific reactions in the cell and increase metabolic efficiency.\nD. Compartmentalization enables prokaryotes to reproduce more quickly.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is C. Organelles separate specific reactions in the cell and increase metabolic efficiency.\n\nHaving internal membranes and organelles allows for compartmentalization within the cell. This means that different biochemical processes can occur in specific areas or compartments, which increases the efficiency of these processes. For example, the mitochondria are responsible for cellular respiration, while the chloroplasts (in plant cells) carry out photosynthesis. By separating these functions into distinct organelles, the cell can optimize each process, leading to more efficient metabolism overall."
