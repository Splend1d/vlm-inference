However, if we consider the original context of M*A*S*H, which is the Mobile Army Surgical Hospital during the Korean War, it was technically set outside of the U.S., specifically in Korea. But for the purposes of this question, since all are predominantly set within the United States, none of them fit the criteria of being set entirely outside of the country. If I have to pick one based on the strictest interpretation of your question, I would say \"M*A*S*H\" because it was set in Korea during the war, despite being produced in the U.S. and having many flashback or post-war episodes set in the U.S."
