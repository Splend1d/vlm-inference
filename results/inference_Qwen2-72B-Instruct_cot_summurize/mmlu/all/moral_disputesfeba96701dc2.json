Little argues that women have a right to control their own bodies and that forcing them to carry a pregnancy to term against their will would be a violation of this right. She also suggests that the moral status of the fetus is not clear until it becomes a person, which she defines as having the capacity for consciousness and self-awareness. Therefore, until the fetus reaches this stage, the mother should have the prerogative to terminate the pregnancy if she so chooses."
