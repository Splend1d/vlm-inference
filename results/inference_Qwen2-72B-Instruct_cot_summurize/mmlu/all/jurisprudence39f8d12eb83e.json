The international recognition of human rights after WWII.\n\nThe revival of natural law in the 20th century was significantly influenced by the aftermath of World War II and the resulting international focus on human rights. The atrocities committed during the war led to a renewed interest in the concept of universal moral principles that could serve as a foundation for international law and human rights. This culminated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted by the United Nations in 1948, which is based on the idea of inherent and inalienable rights that align with natural law theory."
