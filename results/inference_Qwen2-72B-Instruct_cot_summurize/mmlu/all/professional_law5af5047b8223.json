Be advised that this offer will remain open until October 1. \"On September 30, the retailer mailed the following letter, which was received by the manufacturer on October 1: \"Your offer is hereby accepted, but request delivery of 100 drinking fountains in October and 100 in November. \"However, on September 29, the manufacturer sent a fax to the retailer revoking its offer, which was received the same day.

This type of offer is known as an option contract, where the offeror (the manufacturer) promises to keep the offer open for a certain period without the need for consideration from the offeree (the retailer). Since the offer explicitly stated that it would remain open until October 1, the manufacturer cannot revoke the offer before that date without breaching the terms of the option.\n\nIn this case, the retailer attempted to accept the offer on September 30, which was within the time frame specified by the manufacturer. Although the acceptance letter was received after the manufacturer's revocation, the revocation was not valid since it was made before the expiration of the time period during which the offer was promised to be held open. Therefore, the manufacturer's attempt to revoke the offer before October 1 was not valid, and the retailer's acceptance on September 30 should have been effective. However, the retailer's acceptance also contained a modification to the delivery schedule, which could potentially make the acceptance a counteroffer rather than a true acceptance if the modification was material and not agreed upon by the manufacturer. But the primary issue here is the validity of the revocation, which is invalid due to the option contract created by the manufacturer's promise to hold the offer open."
