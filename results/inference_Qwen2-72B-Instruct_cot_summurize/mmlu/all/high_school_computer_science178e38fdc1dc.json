Every time the computer-controlled player has a turn, the game runs slowly because the computer evaluates all potential moves and selects the best one. Which of the following best describes the possibility of improving the running speed of the game?\n\nA. The game's running speed can only be improved if the game is played between two human players instead of with the computer-controlled player.\nB. The game's running speed might be improved by using a process that finds approximate solutions every time the computer-controlled player has a turn.\nC. The game's running speed cannot be improved because computers can only be programmed to find the best possible solution.\nD. The game's running speed cannot be improved because the game is an example of an algorithm that does not run in a reasonable time.\n"

The game's running speed might be improved by using a process that finds approximate solutions every time the computer-controlled player has a turn.\n\nThis answer is correct because it suggests a practical approach to improve the game's running speed: using heuristics or approximation algorithms to find good-enough solutions rather than the optimal one. This way, the computer-controlled player can make decisions faster without necessarily evaluating every single potential move."
