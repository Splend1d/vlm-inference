As a condition of the loan, a majority shareholder in the company agreed in writing to personally guarantee the loan. Thereafter, the company defaulted on the loan and entered into a repayment agreement with the bank. This agreement provided that the bank would \"use maximum efforts in selling the company's assets at the highest possible price. \" The bank proceeded to sell the company's assets, discharging the indebtedness of the widget company. Later, it was ascertained that the bank did not realize the \"highest possible price\" in administering the sale of the company's assets. Consequently, the shareholder was forced into bankruptcy and lost her entire investment in the company. The shareholder brings an appropriate action against the bank to recover her investment in the company. She will most likely\n\nA. not prevail, because the shareholder was an incidental beneficiary of the bank's sale of the company's assets.\nB. not prevail, because the bank's sale of the company's assets discharged whatever contractual relationship existed between the shareholder and the bank.\nC. prevail, because the bank did not realize the highest possible price from the sale of the cornpany's assets.\nD. prevail, because the bank breached its fiduciary duty to the shareholder under the terms of the contract between the bank and the company.\n"

It is also important to consider if there were any clauses in the contract that limit the bank's liability or indemnify them against certain actions.\n\nGiven the information provided, option C seems closest to the potential legal argument the shareholder could make: she may prevail because the bank did not realize the highest possible price from the sale of the company's assets, thus breaching the terms of the contract. However, without further details about the contract and the legal context, it is difficult to definitively state that the shareholder will prevail. Therefore, while C might be the best answer choice given, it does not guarantee success in the shareholder's action against the bank."
