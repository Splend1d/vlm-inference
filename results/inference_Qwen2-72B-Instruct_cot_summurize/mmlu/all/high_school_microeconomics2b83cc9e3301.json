This results in a price that is greater than the marginal revenue, which contrasts with a perfectly competitive market where price equals marginal cost. In the long run, a monopolist may also produce less output and charge higher prices compared to what would prevail under perfect competition. This can lead to less variety of products and potentially less overall efficiency in the market."
