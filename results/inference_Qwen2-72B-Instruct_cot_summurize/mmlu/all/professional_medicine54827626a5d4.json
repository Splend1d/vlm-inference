This is achieved by several mechanisms, including an increase in heart rate (which you've mentioned as 175/min), stroke volume (the amount of blood pumped by the left ventricle with each beat), and cardiac output (the product of heart rate and stroke volume). To accommodate this increased blood flow, the blood vessels dilate, particularly in the active muscles, which results in a decrease in total peripheral resistance (TPR).\n\nPulse pressure (the difference between systolic and diastolic blood pressures) can actually increase during exercise due to an increase in systolic blood pressure, which is common during physical activity as the heart works harder to pump more blood. Stroke volume also tends to increase during exercise to meet the higher oxygen demands of the body. Systolic blood pressure typically increases during exercise as well, as it reflects the pressure in the arteries when the heart contracts and pumps blood out.\n\nTherefore, the answer that is most likely to be decreased compared to before the exercise session is total peripheral resistance."
