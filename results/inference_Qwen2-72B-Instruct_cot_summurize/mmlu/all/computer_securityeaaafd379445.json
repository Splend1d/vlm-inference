No, an attacker can simply guess the tag for messages.\n\nGiven that the tag (output of the MAC function) is only 5 bits long, there are only \\(2^5 = 32\\) possible tags. This makes it very easy for an attacker to perform an exhaustive search (brute force attack) to find a valid tag for any given message. Even if the MAC itself is constructed securely and the underlying functions are pseudorandom, the short length of the output significantly weakens its security by making such attacks feasible."
