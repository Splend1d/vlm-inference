Therefore, the answer is one of the other three options. The Hopewell did not have a formal government or urban centers, and there is no evidence that they had a permanent military. However, of these three options, the one that best fits the description of what the Hopewell did have is:\n\nB. monumental earthworks\n\nBut since this is not one of the elements that the question asks us to exclude, the correct answer to the question is:\n\nA. formal government\nC. urban centers\nD. a permanent military\n\nThe Hopewell did not have any of these three elements, but they did have monumental earthworks."
