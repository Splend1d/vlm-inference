Because the practice of punishment is separate from its justification.\n\nIt's crucial to distinguish between what punishment is (the concept) and why we inflict it (the justification). The concept of punishment simply describes what happens when someone is subjected to an unpleasant consequence as a result of their actions. The justification, however, involves the reasoning behind why this action is taken. This distinction allows for a more nuanced understanding of the ethics of punishment and enables us to critically evaluate whether certain forms of punishment are justified or not.\n\nA. is incorrect because the justification for punishment does not depend on the concept itself but rather on the values and principles that society holds.\nB. is incorrect because definitions can have normative implications, and the concept of punishment often carries moral weight.\nC. is incorrect because while the concept of punishment may be controversial, separating it from its justification is still important for clear ethical analysis."
