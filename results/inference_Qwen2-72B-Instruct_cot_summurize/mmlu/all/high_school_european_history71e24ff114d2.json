Communism is already acknowledged by all European powers to be in itself a power.\nII. It is high time that Communists should openly, in the face of the whole world, publish their views, their aims, their tendencies, and meet this nursery tale of the Specter of Communism with a Manifesto of the party itself.\"\nKarl Marx and Friedrich Engels, The Communist Manifesto, 1848\nIn this passage, Marx and Engels seem to be chiefly preoccupied with\n\nA. provoking fear to drive their readers to action\nB. attacking the extreme communists who threatened to sink the entire movement\nC. demonstrating the understanding of the others in point of fact\nD. explaining the reasons for debunking opponents of communism\n"

This is not about provoking fear (option A), attacking other communists (option B), or merely demonstrating an understanding of their opponents (option C). Instead, it is about confronting and refuting the negative portrayal of communism by its adversaries."
