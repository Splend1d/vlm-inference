However, when a tire on the woman's car suddenly blew out, she lost control of her car and crashed, injuring a pedestrian. The pedestrian later sued the man, because the woman had no insurance or assets. Will the pedestrian be likely to prevail in that action?\n\nA. No, because the man did not cause the injury.\nB. No, because the man was driving very carefully.\nC. Yes, because the man and the woman were acting in concert in a dangerous activity.\nD. Yes, because the man was exceeding the speed limit. \u0080\u0083\n"

In this case, both the man and the woman were participating in an illegal and inherently dangerous activity (drag racing) that led to the injury of the pedestrian.\n\nWhile the man did not directly cause the injury, his participation in the illegal drag race created a situation where harm was foreseeable. As such, he can be held liable for the damages caused by the accident, even if the immediate cause (the tire blowout) was not under his control. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nC. Yes, because the man and the woman were acting in concert in a dangerous activity."
