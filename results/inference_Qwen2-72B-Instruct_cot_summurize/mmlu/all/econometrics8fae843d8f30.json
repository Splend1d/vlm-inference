The standard error of the slope coefficient in an OLS regression is indeed positively related to the residual variance. This makes sense because if there is more variability in the errors, it becomes harder to precisely estimate the relationship between the dependent and independent variables, leading to a larger standard error.\n\n(ii) True. The standard error of the slope coefficient is inversely proportional to the dispersion of the explanatory variable (X). If X has a wider spread, it provides more information about how Y changes with X, leading to a smaller standard error.\n\n(iii) True. The standard error decreases as the sample size increases. This is because more data generally leads to a more precise estimate of the true relationship, reducing the standard error.\n\n(iv) True. The standard error is a measure of the precision of the coefficient estimate. A smaller standard error indicates that the estimated coefficient is closer to the true population parameter, assuming the model is correctly specified."
