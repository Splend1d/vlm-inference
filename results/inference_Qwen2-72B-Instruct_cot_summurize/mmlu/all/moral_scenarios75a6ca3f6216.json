Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn Scenario 1, although peeing in public is generally illegal and considered inappropriate, doing so discreetly in a bush where no one can see might be seen as less offensive than doing it in plain sight. However, this action is not typically viewed as morally wrong on the same level as other offenses, especially if there were no alternatives or emergencies involved.\n\nIn Scenario 2, complimenting someone's transition is generally considered supportive and kind, and therefore not morally wrong. It is an act of respect and encouragement for someone who has likely faced significant challenges."
