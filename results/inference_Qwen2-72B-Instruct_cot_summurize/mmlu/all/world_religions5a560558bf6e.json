She is known for her radical doctrine of Divine Love, which she experienced as an overwhelming passion that consumed her entire being. Her teachings emphasized the importance of loving God for God's sake alone, rather than out of fear or hope for reward. This concept of \"love for love's sake\" became a central theme in Sufism and influenced many later mystics."
