The preclearance provision of the Voting Rights Act\n\nThe preclearance provision of the Voting Rights Act was designed to prevent discriminatory practices in voting, particularly in areas with a history of such practices. It requires jurisdictions with a history of discrimination to get federal approval before changing their voting laws or practices. This provision is more likely to increase voter turnout by ensuring fair access to voting rather than decrease it. The other options (B, C, and D) can be factors that contribute to lower voter turnout."
