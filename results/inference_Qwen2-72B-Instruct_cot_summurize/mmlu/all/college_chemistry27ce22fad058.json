In this scenario, the correct answer is:\n\nB. NH2\u2212\n\nThis is because the NH2\u2212 ion has an extra electron pair that can be donated to an acid (i.e., it can accept a proton), making it the strongest base among the given options when considering liquid ammonia as the solvent. Note that in liquid ammonia, even electron-poor species like H+ can act as acids, and thus, the NH2\u2212 ion, being rich in electrons, can act as a strong base by accepting these protons."
