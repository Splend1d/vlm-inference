Carbon isotopes vary depending on the type of photosynthesis process used by plants. C3 plants, which include most trees, shrubs, and cool-season grasses, have a different 13C/12C ratio than C4 plants, which include warm-season grasses like maize, sugarcane, and some types of grasses.\n\nBased on this principle, researchers can distinguish between diets that were high in C3 plant foods (such as nuts, fruits, and vegetables) versus those high in C4 plant foods (such as grains from maize). Additionally, because animals that eat C4 plants will also have higher 13C ratios in their tissues compared to those eating C3 plants, researchers can also infer if the diet was more meat-based (from animals feeding on C4 plants) or more plant-based.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. mostly meat or mostly vegetables.\n\nThis method cannot directly determine specific food items such as dairy consumption or the consumption of a certain type of honey, although it may provide indirect clues when combined with other isotopic data and archaeological evidence."
