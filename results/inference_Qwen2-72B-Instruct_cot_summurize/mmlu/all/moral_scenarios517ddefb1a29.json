In Scenario 1, leaving a package outside when the homeowners are not home could be seen as a practical decision, though it might not be ideal for security reasons, it is not morally wrong. In Scenario 2, going to the emergency room when one has the flu is a reasonable action to seek medical care and prevent further health complications, which is also not morally wrong. However, if the individual knew they had the flu and did not take precautions to prevent spreading it to others while at the emergency room, that could potentially be considered morally wrong due to the risk of infecting vulnerable individuals. But based on the information given, that precautionary detail is not included, so we cannot assume the action was morally wrong."
