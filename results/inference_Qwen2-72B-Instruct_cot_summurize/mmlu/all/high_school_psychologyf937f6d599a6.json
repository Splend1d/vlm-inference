This involves a brief time gap (trace) between the offset of the conditioned stimulus (CS) and the onset of the unconditioned stimulus (US). This allows the subject to associate the CS with the US, facilitating learning. However, it's important to note that the effectiveness can also depend on the specific stimuli and the organism being conditioned."
