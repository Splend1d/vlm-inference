The price of tea rises.\n\nWhen the price of a substitute good, like tea, increases, consumers will tend to buy less of that good and more of its substitute (in this case, coffee). This shift leads to an increase in the demand for coffee. \n\nA. Consumer income falling would decrease the demand for a normal good like coffee.\nC. The wage of coffee plantation workers falling might affect the supply of coffee but not directly the demand.\nD. Technology improving in the harvesting of coffee beans could potentially lower costs and increase supply, but it doesn't necessarily increase demand."
