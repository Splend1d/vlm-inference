The day that the defendant was to drive back to college, his roommate asked him if he would deliver a package to one of their classmates. The defendant agreed, and the roommate gave him a small package, which the defendant placed in his glove compartment. While driving back to school, the defendant was stopped for speeding. When the state trooper asked the defendant for his license and registration, he reached into the glove compartment. As he did, the package that his roommate had given him fell onto the floor. When it hit the floor, the box broke open and a plastic envelope containing a white substance slid out. Seeing that the substance appeared to be cocaine, the state trooper arrested the defendant for possession of illegal narcotics under a state statute making it a felony to willfully possess a controlled substance. The package did, in fact, contain cocaine. If the defendant is later brought to trial for this charge, his best defense is that\n\nA. the defendant didn't know what was in the package.\nB. the roommate didn't tell him he was carrying illegal narcotics.\nC. the package didn't belong to him.\nD. the cocaine was illegally seized.\n"

This is known as the \"lack of knowledge\" or \"innocent owner\" defense. For the defendant to be convicted of possession of a controlled substance, the prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant knew that he was in possession of the substance and knew the nature of the substance as an illegal drug. Since the defendant claims he was unaware that the package contained cocaine, this could potentially create reasonable doubt as to his guilt.\n\nHowever, it is also worth considering whether there might be an argument for D. the cocaine was illegally seized. Depending on the circumstances of the traffic stop and the search, there could be grounds to argue that the defendant's Fourth Amendment rights against unreasonable searches and seizures were violated. If the trooper did not have probable cause to search the vehicle or if the defendant's consent was not properly obtained, the evidence (the cocaine) could potentially be excluded from the trial under the exclusionary rule. However, since the package fell out accidentally when the defendant opened the glove compartment to retrieve his license and registration, it may be more difficult to argue that the seizure was illegal."
