However, it's important to note that his work was not in the realm of Classical economics but rather in monetarism, which is a separate school of thought in economics. Friedman's work focused on the role of monetary policy in economic stability, and he argued that changes in the money supply have significant effects on economic activity. He received the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1976."
