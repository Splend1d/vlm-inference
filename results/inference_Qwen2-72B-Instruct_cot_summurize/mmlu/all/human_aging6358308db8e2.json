One can make funeral and estate plans with the loved one.\n\nAn expected death, such as one due to a terminal illness, allows for the opportunity to have discussions about end-of-life wishes, including funeral arrangements and estate planning. This can provide a sense of closure and control for both the dying person and their loved ones. It also helps ensure that the dying person's final wishes are respected and carried out according to their preferences. While option A may be true to some extent, it is not the primary advantage of an expected death over an unexpected one. Option C is not necessarily an advantage of an expected death, and option D is not an appropriate or ethical response to a terminal illness."
