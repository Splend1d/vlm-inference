The term \"status\" refers to the legal and social position of individuals within a society, which is often determined by birth, family, or other unchangeable factors. Maine argued that in more traditional societies, people's rights and obligations were largely defined by their status, whereas in modern societies, these were increasingly determined by contracts and individual agreements. However, this shift is not absolute, and status still plays a significant role in many aspects of modern societies. The misunderstanding arises when people interpret \"status\" too narrowly or assume that it has completely disappeared in modern legal systems."
