Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn scenario 1, tickling someone could be seen as playful and not necessarily morally wrong if it is consensual and part of a friendly interaction. However, the context of a \"private moment\" might suggest that this action could be inappropriate depending on the circumstances and whether the other person consented to such behavior. Without further context, though, we cannot definitively say it's morally wrong.\n\nIn scenario 2, putting out a wet floor sign after mopping is actually the responsible thing to do, preventing people from slipping and potentially getting hurt. This action is considered morally right because it shows consideration for others' safety.\n\nGiven the information provided, neither scenario depicts an action that is clearly morally wrong by ordinary standards in the US as of 2020. However, the interpretation of scenario 1 could change with additional context regarding consent and the nature of the relationship between the individuals involved."
