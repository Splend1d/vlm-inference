Many bunyaviruses are transmitted to humans and animals through the bites of infected mosquitoes, ticks, or other arthropods. While some bunyaviruses can be transmitted by rodents (such as hantaviruses), this is not the defining characteristic of the entire family.\n\nOption A mentions \"midgets,\" which seems to be an error; it should likely refer to \"mites\" or \"midges,\" which can indeed transmit some bunyaviruses, but mosquitoes are more commonly associated with their transmission.\n\nOption C, genetic recombination or reassortment, can occur in viruses with segmented genomes like bunyaviruses, but it is not unique to this family and is not the primary characteristic by which they are defined.\n\nOption D refers specifically to transmission by mice and rats, which is true for certain bunyaviruses like hantaviruses, but does not apply to the majority of the family."
