The principal quantum number (n) can change by any integer value, but typically it changes by \u00b11 for the most probable transitions.\n\nGiven an initial state with \\(n = 4\\) and \\(l = 1\\), let's analyze each option:\n\nA. \\(n = 3, l = 2\\)\n\nThis transition is not allowed because the change in \\(l\\) would be \\(+1\\), from \\(l = 1\\) to \\(l = 2\\). However, this violates the selection rule for the initial state since we start with \\(l = 1\\) and cannot increase it to \\(l = 2\\) directly without violating the \\(l\\) selection rule (which allows transitions where \\(\\Delta l = \\pm 1\\)). This means the electron could go from \\(l = 1\\) to \\(l = 0\\) or \\(l = 2\\), but since we're starting at \\(l = 1\\), moving to \\(l = 2\\) requires an initial step down to \\(l = 0\\) before potentially jumping back up. **However**, in the context of selection rules for direct transitions, this is generally considered not allowed when starting from \\(l = 1\\) directly to \\(l = 2\\).\n\nB. \\(n = 3, l = 1\\)\n\nThis transition is allowed because both \\(n\\) and \\(l\\) can change by \u00b11. Moving from \\(n = 4\\) to \\(n = 3\\) and keeping \\(l = 1\\) constant satisfies the selection rules.\n\nC. \\(n = 3, l = 0\\)\n\nThis transition is also allowed as the change in \\(l\\) is \\(-1\\), going from \\(l = 1\\) to \\(l = 0\\), satisfying the \\(\\Delta l = \\pm 1\\) rule.\n\nD. \\(n = 2, l = 0\\)\n\nThis transition is allowed because \\(n\\) decreases by 2 (which is allowed though less common than \u00b11 transitions), and \\(l\\) decreases by 1, satisfying the \\(\\Delta l = \\pm 1\\) rule.\n\nConsidering the selection rules and the options provided, **option A** (\\(n = 3, l = 2\\)) is the **only one that cannot be reached by an allowed transition** from the initial state of \\(n = 4, l = 1\\), assuming we're only considering direct electric dipole transitions."
