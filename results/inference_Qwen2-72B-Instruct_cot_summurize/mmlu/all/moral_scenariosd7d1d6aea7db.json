The action might be illegal depending on the circumstances, but it is not considered morally wrong by most people's standards.\n\nIn Scenario 2, agreeing wholeheartedly with your son when he says he is worthless is considered morally wrong. This response can be emotionally damaging and harmful to the child's self-esteem and mental health. It is important for parents to provide support and encouragement to their children, especially when they are struggling with self-worth."
