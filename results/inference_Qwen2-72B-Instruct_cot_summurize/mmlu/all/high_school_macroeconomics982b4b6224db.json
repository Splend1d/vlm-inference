So, the answer would be B. stable for V and C. variable for Q. However, since you asked for one answer choice per variable, here they are:\n\nV: B. stable.\nQ: C. variable.\n\nMonetarists argue that changes in the money supply (M) primarily affect nominal variables like prices (P) rather than real variables like output (Q). According to monetarist theory, in the long run, changes in the money supply will only affect the price level, not real economic activity. The equation that represents this relationship is known as the Quantity Theory of Money, which can be expressed as MV = PQ, where M is the money supply, V is the velocity of money, P is the price level, and Q is the real output. Monetarists believe that controlling the growth rate of the money supply is crucial for controlling inflation."
