He landed the plane safely in a large yard behind a home located in a relatively remote area. Unfortunately, when he disembarked from the plane, he was attacked and injured by two large dogs kept by the homeowner to discourage trespassers. The homeowner, who had seen the plane land, had ordered the dogs to attack. Several months earlier, the homeowner had posted large signs around the perimeter of the yard warning of the dogs. Does the pilot have a viable claim against the homeowner for battery?\n\nA. No, because the homeowner had provided adequate warning.\nB. No, because the pilot was a trespasser.\nC. Yes, because the pilot can invoke the privilege of necessity.\nD. Yes, because the pilot could not reasonably have been expected to see the warning signs posted by the homeowner.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is C. Yes, because the pilot can invoke the privilege of necessity.\n\nUnder common law, there is a legal principle known as the \"privilege of necessity\" which allows individuals to take actions that would otherwise be illegal if they are necessary to prevent a greater harm or to protect life or property. In this case, the pilot was forced to make an emergency landing due to engine trouble and did so in the homeowner's yard. This action was necessary to prevent a greater harm (i.e., crashing the plane) and to protect the pilot's life. \n\nFurthermore, the homeowner's order for the dogs to attack the pilot after he had safely landed the plane and was in need of assistance is not justified under the circumstances. The homeowner's actions went beyond reasonable measures to protect their property and constituted an intentional act of harm against the pilot. Therefore, the pilot has a viable claim against the homeowner for battery despite the warning signs and the fact that the pilot may have technically been a trespasser at the time of the incident."
