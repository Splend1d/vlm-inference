(Note: there might be a typo in your question, I'm assuming you meant 128 Hz instead of 256 Hz as 128 Hz is the standard tuning fork used for this purpose)\n\nA. Testing pain with a venepuncture needle is not an acceptable practice in sensory assessment as it can cause unnecessary harm and discomfort to the patient.\n\nB. Proprioception is not appreciated via the same tracts as light touch. Proprioception involves the perception of body position and movement, and is mediated by different neural pathways than those involved in light touch sensation.\n\nD. Impulses for pain do not travel principally up the dorsal columns. Pain signals are transmitted through the spinothalamic tract, while the dorsal columns carry information about fine touch, vibration, and proprioception."
