Security studies did emerge in relation to the interests of the USA and Britain following the Second World War, particularly in the context of the Cold War, where the focus was on state-centric security against potential threats from the Soviet Union and its allies.\n\nB. The field often adopts a perspective that postcolonial scholars might refer to as 'the colonizer's view of the world,' focusing predominantly on the security concerns of Western states while overlooking or marginalizing the experiences and perspectives of non-Western countries and peoples.\n\nC. Security studies was originally defined by the power dynamics of the USA and Britain at a time when they were supporting colonial and imperial relations in the global South. This historical context has influenced the development of the field, shaping its priorities, methodologies, and epistemologies in ways that reflect and reinforce Western dominance.\n\nThe imperial nature of security studies is evident in its Eurocentric biases, the privileging of military over human security, and its tendency to overlook the legacies of colonialism and imperialism in shaping contemporary security challenges."
