There is no substitution that would make \"w\" become \"1\" while keeping the expression lexical.\n\n(II, III): f(x,1) and f(y,g(z))\n\n- These expressions can be made lexically identical by substituting x with y and there is no need to substitute 1 or g(z), since they already match their counterparts in the other expression. Thus, these expressions are unifiable.\n\n(I, III): f(w,w) and f(y,g(z))\n\n- These expressions can also be made lexically identical by substituting w with g(z) in the first expression. Thus, these expressions are unifiable as well.\n\nSo, the answer is D. (I, II) and (I, III) only, but since (I, II) cannot actually be unified as explained above, the correct answer based on the given options and the correct understanding of unifiability is:\n\nC. (II, III) only\n\nHowever, considering the explanation provided for unifiability, option B. (I, III) only should also be considered correct based on the provided options, but the question seems to imply choosing among the direct comparisons given. Therefore, strictly answering the question as presented: C. (II, III) only is the answer according to the direct comparison between pairs as asked."
