The woman has promised to repair the stereo speakers by next Tuesday and get them in tip-top condition (a promise of performance), while the man has promised to pay her $20 (a promise of payment). Both parties have made promises that are enforceable obligations, creating a bilateral contract. This type of contract is not governed by the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) since it does not involve the sale of goods but rather the provision of services. It's also not a unilateral contract, which would involve one party making a promise in exchange for an act (not a promise) by another party. And there's no indication that the contract is unconscionable (grossly unfair or one-sided)."
