The earliest known hominid fossils that show signs of bipedalism date back to around 6 million years ago, whereas the other developments listed occurred later in human evolution. For example, Oldowan stone tools appear about 2.6 million years ago, a larger cranium and brain size evolved gradually over millions of years, with the 1000 cc threshold being crossed by Homo erectus around 1.8 million years ago, and language is thought to have developed much more recently, likely within the last few hundred thousand years."
