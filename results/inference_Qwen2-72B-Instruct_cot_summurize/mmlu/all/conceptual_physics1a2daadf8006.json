This is described by the famous equation from general relativity, which relates the curvature of spacetime to the distribution of mass and energy within it.\n\nB. Gravity does affect clocks. This is known as gravitational time dilation. Clocks in stronger gravitational fields run slower than those in weaker fields. This effect has been confirmed through various experiments and is taken into account in GPS satellite technology.\n\nC. Light cannot escape from a black hole. A black hole is defined by an event horizon from which not even light can escape due to the intense gravitational pull. This is because the escape velocity at the event horizon equals the speed of light.\n\nAll three statements are accurate descriptions of aspects of general relativity."
