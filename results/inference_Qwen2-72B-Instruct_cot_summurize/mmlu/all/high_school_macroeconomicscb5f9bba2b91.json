                    "text": "C. When demand for stocks and bonds increases, the asset demand for money falls.\n\nExplanation:\nA. As the demand for bonds increases, the price of bonds goes up, which leads to a decrease in the interest rate, not an increase.\nB. If nominal GDP increases for a given money supply, the velocity of money increases, not decreases, as more transactions occur using the same amount of money.\nD. A macroeconomic recession typically decreases the demand for loanable funds because businesses and consumers are less likely to borrow during economic downturns.\n\nThe correct answer is C because when there is an increased demand for financial assets like stocks and bonds, people tend to hold less money in liquid form (cash or checking accounts), decreasing the asset demand for money."
