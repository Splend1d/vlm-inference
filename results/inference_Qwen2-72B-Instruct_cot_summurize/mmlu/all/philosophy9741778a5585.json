The external view and the internal view\n\nThis categorization allows for a more inclusive range of perspectives, encompassing both philosophical and religious viewpoints. Here's a breakdown of each:\n\n1. External View (Objective Meaning): This perspective suggests that life has inherent meaning or purpose that exists independently of human beliefs or perceptions. It often aligns with religious or spiritual worldviews where meaning is derived from divine will, cosmic order, or a greater scheme of things. Theistic views fall under this category, where meaning is given by a higher power or deity.\n\n2. Internal View (Subjective Meaning): This viewpoint posits that life's meaning is constructed by individuals based on their personal values, goals, and experiences. It emphasizes the role of human agency in creating one's own purpose. This can include secular humanism, existentialism, and other philosophies that focus on individual choice and responsibility.\n\nWhile options B, C, and D also represent significant viewpoints, they are not as comprehensive as option A in addressing the question of life's meaning across different belief systems and philosophical orientations. For instance, option B (pessimist's view vs. optimist's view) focuses on attitudes toward life rather than sources of meaning; option C (religious view vs. liberal view) might not fully capture non-religious or conservative perspectives; and option D (theistic view vs. agnostic view) does not account for atheistic or non-theistic perspectives that can still find meaning in life."
