New antivirals: Developing new antiviral medications specifically targeting filoviruses can help in treating infected individuals and reducing viral load, thereby decreasing the likelihood of transmission.\n\nB. New humanised monoclonal antibodies: Monoclonal antibodies can be engineered to target specific viral proteins, neutralizing the virus and preventing it from infecting new cells. This approach has been used successfully in the treatment of Ebola virus disease.\n\nC. Hygiene and social distancing: Basic infection control measures, such as hand hygiene, use of personal protective equipment (PPE), and maintaining physical distance from others, especially when an outbreak is occurring, can significantly reduce the spread of filoviruses.\n\nD. New vaccines: Vaccination is a critical tool for preventing the spread of filoviruses. Vaccines can protect individuals from infection and, if enough people are vaccinated, can lead to herd immunity, which helps to prevent the spread of the virus within a population.\n\nAll of these strategies can be effective in restricting the spread of filoviruses, and they are often used in combination during outbreaks."
