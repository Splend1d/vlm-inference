In scenario 1, the main character's decision to gamble and go into debt may be considered unwise or irresponsible by some, but it is not necessarily morally wrong unless it causes harm to others or violates legal or ethical standards. In scenario 2, taking out a gun to clean it is a normal and responsible activity if done safely and legally."
