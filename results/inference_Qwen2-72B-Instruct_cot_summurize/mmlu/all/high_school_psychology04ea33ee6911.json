Implementing a class-wide behavior management plan, such as a response-cost raffle.\n\nGiven the high number of students involved in problem behaviors, it would be most effective to start with a class-wide intervention. A response-cost raffle is a type of class-wide behavior management strategy where students earn tokens for positive behaviors, which can then be used to participate in a raffle for desirable items or privileges. If students engage in problem behaviors, they may lose some of their tokens (response cost). This approach encourages positive behavior while also discouraging negative behavior, and it can be implemented efficiently across an entire classroom. After implementing this strategy, the school psychologist can monitor its effectiveness and consider additional targeted interventions for students who continue to exhibit problem behaviors."
