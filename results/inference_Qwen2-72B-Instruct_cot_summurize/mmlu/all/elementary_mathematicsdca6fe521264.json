However, when expressing ratios, we typically simplify them to their lowest terms.\n\nThe simplified ratio is:\n\\[ \\frac{3}{9} = \\frac{1}{3} \\]\n\nHowever, none of the options provided exactly match this format. To match the options given, we express it as:\n\\[ 1:3 \\]\n\nBut since this exact option isn't listed, we look for the closest representation among the choices provided. The correct answer based on the options given would be:\n\nA. 1:03\n\nThis represents the same ratio of 1 part pear to 3 parts apple, just written with a leading zero for clarity, which is not necessary but sometimes used in specific contexts for formatting or alignment purposes."
