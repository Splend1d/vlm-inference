The patient says he does not have any symptoms. Medical history is otherwise unremarkable. His only current medication is haloperidol. The patient is not in acute distress. Vital signs are normal. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Mental status examination discloses a flat affect, distractibility, and derailment of thoughts. X-ray of the abdomen is obtained and shows a 4-cm nail in the left upper quadrant. No free air is visible. After admitting the patient to the hospital, which of the following is the most appropriate management?\n\nA. Administration of ipecac to induce vomiting and expectoration of the nail\nB. Observation to allow passage of the nail via normal peristalsis\nC. Open laparotomy and removal of the nail through a gastrotomy incision\nD. Removal of the nail through endoscopic esophagogastroscopy\n"

Removal of the nail through endoscopic esophagogastroscopy.\n\nEndoscopic retrieval is the preferred method for removing ingested foreign bodies that are located in the esophagus or stomach and pose a risk of perforation or other complications if left in place or allowed to pass spontaneously. Given the size of the nail (4 cm) and its location in the left upper quadrant (suggesting it is likely in the stomach), endoscopic retrieval would be the safest and least invasive option to remove the nail and prevent potential complications such as perforation, bleeding, or obstruction.\n\nAdministration of ipecac to induce vomiting is no longer recommended for the removal of ingested objects due to the risk of aspiration and further injury to the gastrointestinal tract. Observation may be considered for smaller, smooth objects that are likely to pass without issue, but given the size and potential sharpness of the nail, this is not an appropriate approach. An open laparotomy and gastrotomy would be a more invasive procedure and is typically reserved for cases where endoscopic retrieval is not possible or has failed."
