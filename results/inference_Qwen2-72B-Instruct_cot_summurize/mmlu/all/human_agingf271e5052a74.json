In a green cemetery, bodies are typically buried in biodegradable shrouds or simple coffins, allowing for natural decomposition. There are no vaults or concrete liners, and often no headstones, opting instead for native plants or GPS coordinates to mark the graves. This approach reduces the environmental impact of traditional burials, which can involve non-biodegradable materials and toxic embalming fluids."
