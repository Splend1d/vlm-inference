This is intended to make being on time more appealing in the future by removing an unpleasant consequence (sitting out). Positive punishment would involve adding something unpleasant (e.g., extra drills) as a consequence for being late. Modeling involves showing someone how to behave, and omission training involves withholding attention or rewards for certain behaviors."
