B and C only\n\nThe dorsal fins and tails of ichthyosaurs and fish are indeed examples of convergent evolution (B), which occurs when unrelated species evolve similar traits due to having to adapt to similar environments or ecological niches. In this case, both ichthyosaurs and fish evolved similar structures independently because they lived in the same type of environment: water. These features are also adaptations to a common environment (C), specifically the aquatic environment, which requires streamlined bodies, fins, and efficient tails for swimming. However, these structures are not homologous (A), meaning they did not evolve from a common ancestral structure, but rather developed independently through evolution."
