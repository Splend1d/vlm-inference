According to the Carnot efficiency formula, which represents the theoretical maximum efficiency of a heat engine,\n\n\\[ \\eta = 1 - \\frac{T_c}{T_h} \\]\n\nwhere \\( \\eta \\) is the efficiency, \\( T_c \\) is the temperature of the cold reservoir, and \\( T_h \\) is the temperature of the hot reservoir (both in Kelvin), the efficiency increases as \\( T_h \\) increases or \\( T_c \\) decreases. Therefore, running a heat engine at high temperatures can improve its efficiency. However, practical limitations due to material properties and other engineering considerations often prevent engines from operating at their theoretical maximum efficiency."
