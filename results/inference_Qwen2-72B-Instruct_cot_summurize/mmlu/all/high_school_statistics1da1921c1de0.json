We use z for proportions because proportions are approximately normal. Means are not.\nC. We use z for proportions because the sampling distribution of sample proportions is approximately normal, but that is not the case for the sampling distribution of sample means.\nD. When using the sample standard deviation to estimate the population standard deviation, more variability is introduced into the sampling distribution of the statistic.\n"

When using the sample standard deviation to estimate the population standard deviation, more variability is introduced into the sampling distribution of the statistic.\n\nWhen conducting inference procedures for means, we often don't know the population standard deviation (\u03c3), and instead, we use the sample standard deviation (s) as an estimate. This introduces additional uncertainty because s can vary from sample to sample, whereas \u03c3 is a fixed value. As a result, the sampling distribution of the sample mean is not exactly normal, even if the sample size is large, due to the variability in estimating \u03c3 with s.\n\nThe t-distribution accounts for this added uncertainty by having heavier tails than the standard normal distribution (z-distribution). As the sample size increases, the t-distribution approaches the standard normal distribution, but for smaller samples, it provides a more accurate reflection of the sampling distribution of the sample mean when \u03c3 is estimated from the data."
