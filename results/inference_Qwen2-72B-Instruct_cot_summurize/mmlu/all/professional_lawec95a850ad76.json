How should the court rule on the admissibility of the store manager's testimony?\n\nA. The testimony is admissible in its entirety as the statement of an opposing party.\nB. The testimony about the water is an admissible statement of an opposing party, but the rest of the testimony is inadmissible as an offer to pay medical expenses.\nC. The testimony is inadmissible in its entirety, because it is hearsay not within any exception.\nD. The testimony is inadmissible in its entirety, because the manager's statement is in the context of an offer to pay medical expenses.\n"

The testimony about the water is an admissible statement of an opposing party, but the rest of the testimony is inadmissible as an offer to pay medical expenses.\n\nThe statement by the store manager acknowledging the presence of water on the floor is admissible as it can be considered an admission by a party-opponent under the rules of evidence. However, the portion where the manager offers to pay for the ambulance and hospital bills is typically inadmissible as it is considered an offer to pay medical expenses, which is generally excluded to prevent penalizing parties who attempt to settle or act responsibly."
