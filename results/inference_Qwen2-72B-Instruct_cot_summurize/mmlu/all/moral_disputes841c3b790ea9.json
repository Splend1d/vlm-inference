This concept refers to a situation where all parties involved in a negotiation or agreement voluntarily agree to abide by certain rules or restrictions that may be coercive in nature, but are necessary to achieve a common goal. In this case, the common goal is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate climate change, and the mutual coercion comes from the enforceable sanctions that are agreed upon by all participating countries."
