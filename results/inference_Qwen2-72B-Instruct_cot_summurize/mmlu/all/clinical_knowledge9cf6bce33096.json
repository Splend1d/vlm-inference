An enlarged kidney is dull to percussion\n\nThis statement is true because a solid organ such as an enlarged kidney will transmit sound poorly, resulting in a dull sound when percussed. The other statements are not universally true:\n\nA. A pulsatile mass can be due to an aortic aneurysm, but it can also be caused by other conditions such as an arteriovenous malformation or a pulsating tumor.\n\nC. A large pelvic mass that disappears after urethral catheterization could be due to a distended bladder rather than an ovarian cyst. Catheterization would relieve the bladder distension, making the mass disappear.\n\nD. An indentible mass can indeed be caused by fecal loading of the colon, but it can also be due to other causes such as a hernia or a soft tissue tumor."
