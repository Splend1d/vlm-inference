Decrease variance\n\nAveraging the output of multiple decision trees, as done in techniques like Random Forests or Gradient Boosting Machines, helps to decrease the variance of the model. This is because each individual tree may overfit to its portion of the data, but by averaging many such trees, the model becomes more robust and less sensitive to noise in the training data. This process can also help to reduce bias to some extent, but the primary effect is on reducing variance."
