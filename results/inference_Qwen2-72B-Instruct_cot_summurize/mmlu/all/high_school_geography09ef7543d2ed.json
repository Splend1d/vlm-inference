However, it's worth noting that while coal is the most abundant in terms of total reserves, oil and natural gas (which is often included under the term \"petroleum\") are more widely used on an annual basis due to their higher energy content and ease of transport. So, while coal might be the correct answer in terms of sheer volume available, understanding the context of the question (whether it's asking about abundance in reserves or usage) can change how one interprets \"most abundant.\" For most geological and energy reserve discussions, though, coal would be considered the most abundant fossil fuel."
