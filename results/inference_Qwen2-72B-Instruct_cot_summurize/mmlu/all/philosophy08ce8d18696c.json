While the Bible does distinguish between body and spirit (or soul), it does not always present them as completely separate entities that exist independently of each other. Rather, the biblical perspective tends to emphasize a more integrated or holistic view of human nature, where body, soul, and spirit are interconnected aspects of a person's being.\n\nIt's worth noting that the relationship between body and soul in the Bible is complex and can be interpreted in various ways. Some interpretations align more closely with dualism, while others support a more integrated or monistic understanding of human nature. However, the strict Cartesian dualism, which posits a radical separation between the material body and the immaterial soul, is generally not supported by the biblical text."
