According to this theory, sensory information is sent to the thalamus, which then sends it to the appropriate parts of the brain for interpretation. Simultaneously, the thalamus sends signals to the body to produce physiological responses and to the limbic system to generate emotional experiences. This theory emphasizes the role of the thalamus in the integration of emotional and physical responses to stimuli."
