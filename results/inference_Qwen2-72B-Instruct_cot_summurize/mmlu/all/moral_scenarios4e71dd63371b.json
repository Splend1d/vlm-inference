Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation: In both scenarios, the actions of the main character do not necessarily violate ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. \n\nIn Scenario 1, helping a friend during a difficult time is generally considered a supportive and positive action.\n\nIn Scenario 2, skinny-dipping could be seen as inappropriate or against community rules if there are regulations against nudity in public spaces. However, without additional context about whether there were such rules or if anyone was offended or harmed by the action, it's not clear that the act itself is morally wrong. If everyone at the poolside was aware and consented, or if there were no explicit rules against it, then it might not be considered morally wrong. However, it could still be legally problematic depending on local laws. Without more information, we cannot definitively label this action as \"wrong\" from a moral standpoint."
