When you dilute a buffer by adding water, you decrease the concentration of both the weak acid and its conjugate base equally, but their ratio remains the same.\n\nAccording to the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n\n\\[ \\text{pH} = \\text{p}K_a + \\log\\left(\\frac{[\\text{Base}]}{[\\text{Acid}]}\\right) \\]\n\nIf the concentrations of the acid and base are equal (as in this case), the log of their ratio is 0, and thus the pH is equal to the pKa of the acid. When you double the volume of the buffer with water, the concentrations of both the acid and base are halved, but since they are still equal, their ratio remains 1:1. Therefore, the log of their ratio is still 0, and the pH does not change significantly\u2014it remains close to the pKa of the acid.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\nA. It has little effect."
