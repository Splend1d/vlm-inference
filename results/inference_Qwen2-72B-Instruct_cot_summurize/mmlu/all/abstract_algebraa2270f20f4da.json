The external direct product of two cyclic groups is not necessarily cyclic. For instance, consider the cyclic groups \\(\\mathbb{Z}_2\\) (the integers modulo 2) and \\(\\mathbb{Z}_3\\) (the integers modulo 3). Both are cyclic, but their external direct product, \\(\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_3\\), is not cyclic. This is because there is no single element in \\(\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_3\\) that generates the whole group. The direct product has order 6, but any element of the form \\((1, x)\\) or \\((0, y)\\) will only generate a subgroup of order 2 or 3 respectively, not the entire group.\n\n### Statement 2: The external direct product of \\(D_3\\) and \\(D_4\\) is isomorphic to \\(D_{12}\\).\n\nThis statement is also false. \\(D_n\\) denotes the dihedral group of order \\(2n\\), which represents the symmetries of a regular \\(n\\)-sided polygon, including both rotations and reflections. \\(D_3\\) is isomorphic to \\(S_3\\) (the symmetric group on 3 elements), and \\(D_4\\) has order 8. The external direct product \\(D_3 \\times D_4\\) would have an order of \\(|D_3| \\times |D_4| = 6 \\times 8 = 48\\), whereas \\(D_{12}\\) has an order of 24. Since \\(D_3 \\times D_4\\) and \\(D_{12}\\) do not even have the same order, they cannot be isomorphic.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**B. False, False**"
