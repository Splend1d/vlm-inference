The homeowner's and daughter's lots were in an unimproved natural state. The sister, however, had lived for 10 years in a house that she had built on her property. The daughter, in preparation for building a house on her lot, carefully excavated an area eight feet deep for the purpose of building a basement. The daughter completed construction of her house and macadamized an area for use as a driveway without changing the former contours of the land. Shortly thereafter, the sister began to make complaints to the daughter about the flooding of her basement, which she claimed had been previously free of water. The sister then built a concrete wall three feet along her border with the daughter to prevent the flow of rain water running onto her land from the daughter's property. This caused the surface water to stand and become stagnant on the daughter's land. The daughter demanded that the sister remove the wall, and upon the sister's refusal, the daughter brought an appropriate action to compel removal. The most likely result is\n\nA. the sister must remove the wall because she has no right to obstruct the flow of such surface water.\nB. the sister must remove the wall at the daughter's expense.\nC. the sister may leave the wall without being liable to the daughter for money damages.\nD. the sister may leave the wall, but she will be liable to the daughter for money damages.\n"

The sister, who had already been living on her property for 10 years, built a wall to protect her property from the increased runoff resulting from the daughter's excavation. The sister's actions can be seen as a reasonable response to the daughter's alterations that affected her property.\n\nHowever, the sister's wall causes water to stand and become stagnant on the daughter's property. Typically, in legal disputes over surface water, the lower (downstream) landowner cannot obstruct the natural flow of water so as to cause harm to the upper (upstream) landowner. But since the daughter initiated the change by altering the natural state of her land, the sister might not be liable for money damages if she can demonstrate that the wall was necessary to prevent further damage to her property caused by the daughter's actions.\n\nIt's important to note that the specific outcome would depend on local laws and legal precedents regarding surface water rights and the obligations of landowners in relation to their neighbors. In some jurisdictions, the sister might be required to find a solution that does not cause harm to the daughter's property, while in others, she might be allowed to maintain the wall if it can be shown that it was a reasonable response to the daughter's actions."
