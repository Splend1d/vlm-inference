Dumping.\n\nDumping refers to the practice of selling products in a foreign market at prices lower than those charged in the domestic market or below the cost of production. This can be used as a strategy to gain market share by undercutting local competitors and attracting customers with lower prices. However, it's often controversial and can lead to trade disputes, as it may harm local industries and is against World Trade Organization (WTO) rules if it causes material injury to the domestic industry in the importing country."
