The explanatory variable is fixed in repeated samples\n\nWhen we say that an explanatory variable is non-stochastic, it means that the variable is not random or subject to randomness. In econometrics and statistics, a non-stochastic variable is considered fixed in repeated samples, meaning its values do not change across different samples or observations. This is in contrast to stochastic variables, whose values can vary due to random factors."
