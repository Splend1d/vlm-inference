The woman's attorney had recently been embarrassed in court by the judge to whom the case was assigned. Wishing to avoid difficulties with the judge, the woman's attorney promptly removed the case to federal court on the basis of federal-question jurisdiction. The employer's attorney has timely moved to remand. How is the federal court likely to proceed?\n\nA. Remand the entire case.\nB. Remand the state claims but keep the federal claims.\nC. Retain the case to avoid the risk of bias and impropriety in having it proceed before a judge who has shown clear hostility toward the woman's attorney.\nD. Retain the case, because it was timely removed and the woman alleges federal claims.\n"

However, if the removal was done primarily to avoid a particular judge due to personal reasons rather than a legitimate legal basis for removal, the federal court may view this as an improper attempt to forum shop and may remand the case back to state court. Federal courts have the authority to remand cases to state court if they determine that they lack subject matter jurisdiction or if the removal was improperly invoked. Since the primary reason for removal seems to be avoiding a specific judge rather than a genuine need for federal adjudication, the federal court is likely to remand the entire case back to state court."
