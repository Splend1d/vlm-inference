Decrease the money supply; increase taxes; reduce government spending.\n\nThese policies are typically used to close an inflationary gap because they work to reduce aggregate demand in the economy, thereby helping to bring down inflation. Decreasing the money supply makes borrowing more expensive and reduces consumer and business spending. Increasing taxes reduces disposable income, leading to lower consumption. Reducing government spending also directly decreases aggregate demand."
