If this is not possible, the correct course of action is typically guided by the specific context and the severity of the potential consequences. However, in general, professional guidelines suggest that psychologists should:\n\nC. attempt to resolve the conflict but adhere to legal requirements when this is not possible.\n\nThis response acknowledges the importance of following the law while also recognizing the value of ethical principles. It is important to note that the American Psychological Association's (APA) Ethical Principles of Psychologists and Code of Conduct encourages psychologists to comply with both legal and ethical requirements and to take reasonable steps to ensure that their conduct conforms to the higher standard when these standards conflict. In some cases, seeking legal counsel or consulting with ethics experts may be necessary to determine the best course of action."
