He contends that the state should not interfere with individual liberty unless there is a clear and direct harm to others that justifies such interference. In the case of drug use, while it may indeed cause harm to others indirectly through its effects on the user's behavior or ability to fulfill obligations, this indirect harm does not meet the threshold for state intervention according to Huemer's reasoning.\n\nTherefore, Huemer would argue that the potential harm to others caused by an individual's drug use does not justify the state's prohibition of drugs, as this infringes upon personal autonomy without sufficient justification based on direct harm to others."
