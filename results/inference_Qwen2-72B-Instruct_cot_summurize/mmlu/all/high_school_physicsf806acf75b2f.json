Measure the difference between the pipe lengths for consecutive resonances; this is half the wavelength.\n\nWhen a guitar string is plucked, it produces a sound wave with a certain frequency. This sound wave can cause resonance in a nearby pipe if the length of the pipe matches a harmonic of the frequency of the sound wave. The resonant frequencies occur when the pipe's length corresponds to a multiple of half-wavelengths of the sound wave.\n\nBy adjusting the length of the pipe until you hear resonances (which occur at multiples of the fundamental frequency), and then measuring the difference in length between two consecutive resonances, you effectively measure half the wavelength of the sound wave. This works because the distance between two consecutive resonances is equal to one-half of the wavelength of the sound wave."
