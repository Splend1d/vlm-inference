In the long run, firms in monopolistic competition earn zero economic profit, meaning that their price equals their average total cost. This eliminates options A and B. Option C refers to a situation that might occur in the short run but does not generally describe monopolistic competition as a whole. In contrast, option D accurately reflects a key feature of monopolistic competition: since products are differentiated, firms often spend significant resources on advertising to differentiate their products further and attract customers."
