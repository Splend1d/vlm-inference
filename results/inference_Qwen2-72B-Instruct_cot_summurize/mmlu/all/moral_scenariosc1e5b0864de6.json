It could be considered a mistake or an inappropriate use of resources, but it does not rise to the level of clear moral wrongdoing. However, it's important to note that repeatedly misusing emergency services could be considered morally wrong and potentially illegal. In this single instance, though, it would likely be categorized as a minor error in judgment rather than a clear moral transgression."
