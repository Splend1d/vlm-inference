However, it's important to note that the involvement of medical professionals, family, and legal frameworks can also be crucial in ensuring that the decision is well-informed, voluntary, and ethically sound.\n\nVelleman himself has written extensively on the ethics of euthanasia, emphasizing the importance of personal identity and the self in moral decision-making. In his view, the person whose life is at stake should have significant say in decisions about euthanasia, provided they are competent to make such decisions. If the patient is not competent, then the situation becomes more complex and may involve considerations of the patient's previously expressed wishes, the best interests of the patient, and the ethical principles guiding medical practice."
