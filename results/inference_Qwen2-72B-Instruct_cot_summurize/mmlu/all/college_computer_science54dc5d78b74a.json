                    "text": "The given loop performs the operation `A[i] = A[i] + B[2*i];` for `i` from `0` to `255`. This means that for each iteration of the loop:\n\n- `A[i]` is loaded into a cache line (if not already there).\n- `B[2*i]` is loaded into a cache line (if not already there).\n- An addition operation is performed on these values.\n- The result is stored back into `A[i]`.\n\nSince the cache uses a write-back policy, when a cache line is updated, the data is not immediately written back to main memory. Instead, the cache line is marked as \"dirty,\" and the data is written back to main memory only when the cache line is evicted.\n\nGiven that array `A` has 256 elements of 4 bytes each, it requires 1024 bytes of storage. Since the cache has a block size of 8 bytes, array `A` would fit into 128 cache blocks (`1024 / 8 = 128`). However, since the cache is only 2K bytes large (2048 bytes) and has an 8-byte block size, it can hold only 256 blocks. This means that all of array `A` can fit in the cache, but not all of array `B`.\n\nArray `B` has 512 elements of 4 bytes each, requiring 2048 bytes of storage, which means it needs 256 cache blocks (`2048 / 8 = 256`). Since the cache can also hold 256 blocks, all of array `B` can technically fit in the cache, but not simultaneously with all of array `A`.\n\nWhen iterating through `A`, we notice that `B` is accessed in a non-consecutive manner (skipping every other element). This means that every access to `B` will result in a cache miss because the cache is direct-mapped, and the accesses to `B` will follow a pattern that will always conflict with certain cache lines due to the direct mapping and the stride of 2.\n\nSince the cache is initially empty, the first access to both `A` and `B` will result in a cache miss. Every subsequent access to `A` will hit in the cache until the corresponding block is evicted by a cache miss from `B`. Since `B` is twice the size of `A`, and we access every second element of `B`, we will have a cache miss for every access to `B`.\n\nAt the end of the loop, all of `A` will have been updated, and since the cache uses a write-back policy, all modified cache lines of `A` will need to be written back to main memory. Since all elements of `A` were updated, all 128 cache blocks of `A` will need to be written back to memory, resulting in a total of 1024 bytes being written back to memory.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **C. 1024**."
