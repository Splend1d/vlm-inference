Niacin lowers cholesterol an average of 18 points, while Lipitor lowers cholesterol an average of 41 points.\nB. There is a 0.95 probability that Lipitor will outperform niacin in lowering the cholesterol level of any given individual.\nC.

This statement is incorrect because the confidence interval does not give the absolute values for the mean cholesterol-lowering effects of niacin and Lipitor. It only gives the range of the difference in their mean effects. Therefore, we cannot conclude that niacin lowers cholesterol by 18 points on average and Lipitor by 41 points.\n\nB. This statement is incorrect because a 95% confidence interval does not imply a 0.95 (or 95%) probability that Lipitor will outperform niacin in any given individual. A confidence interval is about estimating the population parameter, not predicting individual outcomes.\n\nC. This statement is also incorrect because the 95% confidence interval (18, 41) indicates that we are 95% confident that the true difference in the mean cholesterol-lowering effect between Lipitor and niacin falls within this range. It does not provide a probability that Lipitor will outperform niacin by at least 23 points in any given individual.\n\nThe correct interpretation of the confidence interval would be something like: \"We are 95% confident that the true difference in the mean cholesterol-lowering effect between Lipitor and niacin lies between 18 and 41 points.\" However, none of the provided options matches this correct interpretation."
