To be considered unemployed, a person must be actively seeking work or on temporary layoff. Since this individual is not looking for work due to embarrassment over their inability to read, they are not actively seeking employment and therefore are not considered part of the labor force. They are also not considered employed since they do not have a job. Thus, the correct classification is that they are not in the labor force."
