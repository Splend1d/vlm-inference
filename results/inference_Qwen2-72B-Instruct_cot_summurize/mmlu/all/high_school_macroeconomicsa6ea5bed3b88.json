This is because their income does not adjust to keep up with inflation, unlike some other forms of income that may be tied to inflation adjustments or that may rise with economic growth. Debtors with fixed interest rates may actually benefit from inflation if their income rises faster than the interest rate on their debt, and investors in assets like gems, coins, and stamps may see the value of those assets rise with inflation. Property owners may also benefit from inflation if the value of their property increases at a rate greater than inflation."
