If P, then Q.\n2. P (or ~Q).\n3. Therefore, Q (or ~P).\n\nIn this structure, the first statement is the major premise, which establishes the conditional relationship. The second statement is the minor premise, which either affirms the antecedent (P) or denies the consequent (~Q). The conclusion follows logically from these premises.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Hypothetical syllogism"
