Here's why all four statements are true:\n\n(i) The tests will show whether the identified model is either too large or too small: This is true because diagnostic checks help to determine if the model is overfitting (too large) or underfitting (too small). Overfitting occurs when the model includes unnecessary parameters, while underfitting happens when important components are missing.\n\n(ii) The tests involve checking the model residuals for autocorrelation, heteroscedasticity, and non-normality: This statement is correct as part of the diagnostic process. Checking for autocorrelation ensures that there is no systematic pattern in the residuals, indicating that the model has captured all the relevant information from the data. Heteroscedasticity refers to the presence of unequal variances across time, which can violate assumptions about the error term. Non-normality refers to the distribution of residuals not conforming to a normal distribution, which may affect the reliability of statistical tests.\n\n(iii) If the model suggested at the identification stage is appropriate, the acf and pacf for the residuals should show no additional structure: This is true because if the model is correctly specified, the residuals should behave like white noise, meaning they should have no discernible pattern or structure. The autocorrelation function (acf) and partial autocorrelation function (pacf) of the residuals should not exhibit significant spikes, indicating that the model has adequately captured the underlying data-generating process.\n\n(iv) If the model suggested at the identification stage is appropriate, the coefficients on the additional variables under the overfitting approach will be statistically insignificant: This statement is also correct. When a model is overfitted, it includes more parameters than necessary. The coefficients of these additional variables should be close to zero and statistically insignificant, suggesting that they do not contribute significantly to explaining the variance in the data."
