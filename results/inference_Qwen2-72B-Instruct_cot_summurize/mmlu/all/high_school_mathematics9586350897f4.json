Since the legs are equal in this case, the area is:\n\\[Area = \\frac{1}{2} \\times leg \\times leg = \\frac{1}{2} \\times (5\\sqrt{2}) \\times (5\\sqrt{2})\\]\n\n\\[= \\frac{1}{2} \\times 25 \\times 2 = 25\\]\n\nTherefore, the area of the triangle is 25 square inches.\n\nThe correct answer is D. 25."
