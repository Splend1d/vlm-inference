Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation: In both scenarios, the actions taken by the main character do not seem to be morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. In Scenario 1, providing pain relief to an animal in distress can be seen as a compassionate and responsible action. However, it is important to note that giving medication without consulting a veterinarian could potentially be harmful, but the intention seems to alleviate suffering, which is generally considered a moral good. In Scenario 2, giving a teething biscuit to an infant to help with teething is a common and generally accepted practice. It is not inherently morally wrong, though ensuring the safety and appropriateness of the food for the infant's age and developmental stage is crucial."
