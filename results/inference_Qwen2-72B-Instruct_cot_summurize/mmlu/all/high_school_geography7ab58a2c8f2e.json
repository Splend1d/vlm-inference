While some Hindus may visit shrines or temples, pray multiple times a day, or make pilgrimages to various holy sites, bathing in the Ganges is a particularly significant practice in Hinduism. Making a pilgrimage to Jerusalem is more common among Jews and Christians, while praying five times a day is a practice observed by Muslims."
