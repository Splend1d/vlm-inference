The sulfur atom is at the center with four fluorine atoms and one lone pair arranged in a trigonal bipyramidal electron pair geometry. However, because of the presence of the lone pair, the molecule takes on a seesaw shape, making it asymmetrical.\n\nB. PCl5 - Phosphorus pentachloride has a trigonal bipyramidal structure which is symmetrical.\nC. BF3 - Boron trifluoride has a planar triangular structure which is symmetrical.\nD. CO2 - Carbon dioxide has a linear structure which is symmetrical."
