Higher consumer prices and a misallocation of resources away from efficient producers\n\nImport quotas limit the quantity of a good that can be imported into a country, which can lead to higher prices for consumers as they have less access to foreign-produced goods that may be cheaper or of better quality than domestically produced alternatives. Additionally, this protectionist measure can result in a misallocation of resources, as it shields inefficient domestic producers from international competition, allowing them to continue producing at higher costs without improving efficiency."
