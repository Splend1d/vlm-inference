This is the closest figure I could find to answer your question about the perception of corruption related to political parties specifically, but it does indicate a high level of perceived corruption within the political system overall. Therefore, the closest answer would be:\n\nC. 76% \n\nHowever, please note that this is an approximation based on related data, as exact figures for the perception of corruption specifically tied to political parties might not have been directly surveyed."
