                    "text": "The correct answer is D. The wave's height has become smaller.\n\nWhen a wave travels through a medium, such as water in this case, its energy is distributed over a wider area as the wavefront expands. This causes the amplitude (height) of the wave to decrease, which is an indication that the wave carries less energy than it did when it was first created. The other options do not directly indicate a loss of energy:\n\nA. The speed of the wave is determined by the properties of the medium and would not necessarily change as the wave moves away from the source unless it encounters a different medium or conditions that alter its speed.\n\nB. An increase in the wave pulse's width could be due to the spreading of the wavefront but does not necessarily imply a loss of energy. It could simply mean that the wave is covering a larger area.\n\nC. A decrease in the wave pulse's width is unlikely as the wave travels outward unless there is some mechanism constricting the wave, which is not described in the scenario. This option doesn't provide evidence of energy loss either."
