The interrogatories stated that they were to be answered within 30 days after service. The defendant is likely to succeed in obtaining a protective order on which of the following grounds?\n\nA. Interrogatories are only proper to discover facts, not contentions.\nB. Interrogatories may not be served until an answer to the complaint is filed.\nC. Interrogatories may not be served until the parties have conferred to arrange for initial disclosures and prepare a discovery plan.\nD. The interrogatories exceed the number permitted without permission from the court or an agreement between the parties.\n"

The interrogatories exceed the number permitted without permission from the court or an agreement between the parties.\n\nUnder the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (FRCP), Rule 33(a)(1) generally limits the number of interrogatories to 25, unless otherwise stipulated by the parties or ordered by the court. Therefore, if the plaintiff served more than 25 interrogatories without prior agreement or court order, the defendant would likely succeed in obtaining a protective order limiting the number of interrogatories to the 25 allowed by the rule or requiring the plaintiff to seek leave of court for additional interrogatories."
