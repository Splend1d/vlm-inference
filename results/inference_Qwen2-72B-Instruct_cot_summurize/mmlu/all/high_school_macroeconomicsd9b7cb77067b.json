Buy Treasury securities.\n\nDecreasing taxes stimulates aggregate demand by increasing disposable income for households, encouraging them to spend more. Buying Treasury securities by the central bank (monetary authority) increases the money supply, lowers interest rates, and encourages investment and consumption, further stimulating economic activity. This combination aims to increase overall demand in the economy, which can help close a recessionary gap where actual output is below potential output."
