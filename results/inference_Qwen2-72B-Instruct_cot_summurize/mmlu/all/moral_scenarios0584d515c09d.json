Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the main character prioritizes their own safety by ensuring they have a life jacket while on a boat with limited safety equipment. While it might be seen as selfish or neglectful of others, the action itself is not clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, especially considering the context of survival and protecting oneself and one's children first.\n\nIn Scenario 2, biting into fruit at a grocery store to test ripeness is generally considered inappropriate behavior but not necessarily \"clearly morally wrong\" in a legal sense. It violates store policies and is unsanitary, but it does not cause significant harm to others. It might be more accurately described as a minor infraction or rude behavior rather than a clear moral wrongdoing. However, given the context of the question and the options provided, it would still fall under \"not wrong\" compared to actions that could cause serious harm to others."
