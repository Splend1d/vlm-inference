This period also saw the development of more sophisticated stone tools and other cultural advancements. While bipedalism was already established in earlier hominids, it was not a new feature that developed after 400,000 years ago. The average brain size did not decrease; instead, there was a notable expansion, particularly in the neocortex, which is associated with complex cognitive functions."
