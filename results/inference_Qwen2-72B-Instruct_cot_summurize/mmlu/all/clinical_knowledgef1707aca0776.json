Type IIX fibres.\n\nType IIX fibers (also known as Type IIb) are fast-twitch glycolytic fibers that provide quick bursts of power but fatigue very quickly due to their reliance on anaerobic metabolism. They are primarily engaged in high-intensity activities like sprinting and heavy lifting. However, it's important to note that the exact sequence of fiber type recruitment and fatigue can be influenced by various factors including training status and the specific demands of the activity."
