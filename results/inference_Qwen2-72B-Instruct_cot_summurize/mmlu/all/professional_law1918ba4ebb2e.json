A farmer is the owner of parcel \"B,\" which is situated lower than \"A\" on the mountainside. In 2000, the rancher, who owned both parcels of land, constructed a private drainage system. This system consisted of an underground pipeline that extended across both parcels of land. Sewage from parcel \"A\" drained through the system to a municipal sewer, which was located at the bottom of the mountain. In 2005, the rancher sold parcel \"B\" to the farmer. The deed to the farmer did not contain any mention of the rancher's drainage system. Located on each of the parcels are large ranch-style homes occupied by the respective owners. Lately, the sewage drain has begun to emit an unpleasant odor across parcel \"B. \" As a result, the farmer sued the rancher in trespass praying for damages caused by the drainage system. Judgment should be for\n\nA. the rancher, because the deed to the farmer did not contain any covenants restricting the rancher's use of the land.\nB. the rancher, because the farmer's proper cause of action would be for nuisance, rather than trespass.\nC. the farmer, because the drainage system was the proximate cause of the plaintiff's damages as a matter of law.\nD. the farmer, because the rancher did not have the right to improve his own land in a manner that caused harm to another.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is D. the farmer, because the rancher did not have the right to improve his own land in a manner that caused harm to another.\n\nExplanation: When the rancher constructed the drainage system, he did so in a way that affected the neighboring property (parcel B) owned by the farmer. The fact that the rancher owns parcel A does not give him the right to cause damage or nuisances to the neighboring property. The deed to the farmer did not contain any mention of the rancher's drainage system, meaning there was no easement granted for such a system to exist. Therefore, the rancher's actions in constructing and maintaining the drainage system could be seen as a violation of the farmer's rights as a property owner, potentially constituting a private nuisance. Since the drainage system is causing an unpleasant odor on the farmer's property, it can be considered the proximate cause of the damages claimed by the farmer. However, the specific cause of action for such a scenario is typically nuisance rather than trespass, but given the options provided, D is the most appropriate choice."
