So, option A (using light of a shorter wavelength) would decrease the fringe width, not increase it.\n  \n- **Distance between the slits (\\(d\\)):** Decreasing the distance between the slits increases the fringe width. Therefore, option C (moving the slits closer together) would increase the fringe width.\n  \n- **Distance to the screen (\\(L\\)):** Increasing this distance increases the fringe width. However, this was not one of the options provided.\n  \n- **Wave speed:** The wave speed of light does not directly affect the fringe width in this equation. The speed of light in a vacuum is constant and doesn't change the interference pattern unless the medium through which the light travels changes, which wasn't specified in any of the options.\n\nGiven these considerations, the correct answer to increase the widths of the fringes in the interference pattern is:\n\nC. Move the slits closer together."
