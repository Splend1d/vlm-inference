It's not just about money, but also about the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services. While it does often employ the scientific method for analysis, economics also incorporates theoretical models and empirical evidence. Maximizing spiritual well-being may be a goal for some individuals or societies, but it is not the primary focus of economics as a discipline."
