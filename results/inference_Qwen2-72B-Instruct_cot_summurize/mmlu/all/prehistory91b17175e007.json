During this time, the center of Maya power shifted to the north, particularly to the region around Chichen Itza and Uxmal. The Maya experienced a resurgence during this period, but eventually, they declined again, although they never completely disappeared. Maya civilization continued to exist, albeit in a different form, until the arrival of the Spanish conquistadors in the 16th century."
