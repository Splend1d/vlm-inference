One evening around closing time, the woman took a diamond necklace from a cabinetin the jewelry section of the department store and wrapped it in tissue paper. The woman then surreptitiously stuffed the necklace in a shopping bag, intending to remove it when she left the store. Moments later, the store owner approached the woman and told her she needed to stay late in order to do inventory. While the woman was completing inventory, the owner discovered the necklace and called the police. The woman is most likely guilty of\n\nA. attempted larceny.\nB. larceny.\nC. false pretenses.\nD. embezzlement.\n"

In this case, the woman took a diamond necklace from the jewelry section, hid it in a shopping bag, and intended to take it out of the store without paying for it. This action fits the definition of larceny.\n\nAttempted larceny would be if she had been caught before actually taking possession of the necklace, but since she did take and hide the necklace, it goes beyond an attempt.\n\nFalse pretenses involve obtaining ownership of property by lying or misrepresenting facts. This does not apply here because the woman did not use deceit to gain possession of the necklace.\n\nEmbezzlement involves the misappropriation of funds placed in one's trust or belonging to one's employer. While the woman is an employee, embezzlement typically refers to misusing money or assets that have been entrusted to the person, which is not the case here as the necklace was not given to her care or control."
