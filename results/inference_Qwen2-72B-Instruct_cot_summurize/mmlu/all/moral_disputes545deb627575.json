However, based on his previous statements and positions on reproductive technologies and bioethics, it is likely that he would support option B: SCNT should not be allowed unless a healthy baby could be guaranteed.\n\nIn 2001, Pence co-sponsored the Human Cloning Prohibition Act, which would have banned all forms of human cloning, including SCNT. In 2005, he voted for the Ban on Human Cloning Act, which would have prohibited the use of federal funds for research involving human cloning. In both cases, Pence expressed concerns about the ethical implications of cloning and the potential risks to human life.\n\nGiven his opposition to human cloning and his emphasis on protecting human life, it is reasonable to assume that Pence would require a high level of safety and certainty before allowing SCNT to proceed. However, it is important to note that this is an interpretation based on his past actions and statements, and Pence has not specifically addressed the issue of safety standards for SCNT. Therefore, option D (none of the above) may also be a valid response."
