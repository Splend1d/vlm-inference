During the month of April 10000 units were started and 9000 completed units were transferred. The ending work-in-process inventory was complete as to materials and 50% complete as to conversion. The cost of direct materials was $114000 and the cost of direct labor amounted to $38000. Manufacturing overhead is assigned at the rate of 50% of direct materials. For the purpose of determining the cost of goods manufactured in April what is the cost per equivalent whole unit?\n\nA. $23.22\nB. $21.40\nC. $20.90\nD. 15.4\n"

                    "text": "To determine the cost per equivalent whole unit, we first need to calculate the total manufacturing costs for the month of April and then divide it by the total number of equivalent units produced.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total manufacturing costs:\n\n- Direct materials: $114,000\n- Direct labor: $38,000\n- Manufacturing overhead (50% of direct materials): $114,000 * 50% = $57,000\n\nTotal manufacturing costs = $114,000 + $38,000 + $57,000 = $209,000\n\nNext, we need to find out how many equivalent units were produced. We know that 9,000 units were completed, but we also have an ending work-in-process inventory that is 100% complete as to materials and 50% complete as to conversion.\n\nThe 1,000 units in work-in-process are complete for materials, so they count as 1,000 equivalent units for materials. Since they are only 50% complete for conversion, they count as 500 equivalent units for conversion.\n\nHowever, since the question asks for the cost per equivalent whole unit, we will consider both materials and conversion costs when calculating equivalent units. The 9,000 completed units are fully equivalent for both materials and conversion, and the 1,000 units in work-in-process count as 1,000 for materials and 500 for conversion.\n\nFor the purpose of calculating the cost per equivalent whole unit, we'll use the total equivalent units for both materials and conversion. In this case, we have:\n\n- Equivalent units for materials: 9,000 (completed) + 1,000 (work-in-process) = 10,000\n- Equivalent units for conversion: 9,000 (completed) + 500 (work-in-process) = 9,500\n\nSince the question asks for the cost per equivalent whole unit, we should use the higher number (10,000) for our calculation because it represents the total equivalent units considering both materials and conversion.\n\nNow, we can calculate the cost per equivalent whole unit:\n\nCost per equivalent whole unit = Total manufacturing costs / Total equivalent units\n= $209,000 / 10,000\n= $20.90\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. $20.90."
