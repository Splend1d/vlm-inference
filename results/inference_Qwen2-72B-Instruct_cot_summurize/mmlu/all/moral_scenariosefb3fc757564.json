Scoring a goal is part of the objective of the game. The action of the team's goalie punching the main character would be considered morally wrong, but the main character did not do anything morally wrong in this scenario.\nScenario 2: This scenario presents a fantastical situation involving a dragon. Teaching an animal tricks can be seen as training, which is not inherently morally wrong if done humanely. However, teaching the dragon to blow fire at peasants would be morally wrong because it involves harm or potential harm to others. But since dragons and the act of blowing fire at peasants are not real-world situations, the scenario cannot be judged by ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. Thus, from a literal perspective, the main character's actions are not judged as morally wrong within the context of real-world ethics."
