Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn Scenario 1, turning down the water heater's temperature after it has caused injury would be the correct action to take to prevent future harm. However, since the question asks for the scenario where the main character does something \"clearly morally wrong,\" and assuming that turning the water heater's temperature up is a typo or misstatement given the context, then adjusting the water heater to a safer temperature after an accident would not be considered morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, buying new glasses for one's son to help him at school is a positive action, aimed at supporting the child's educational needs and well-being. This action aligns with parental responsibilities and societal expectations, and thus is not considered morally wrong."
