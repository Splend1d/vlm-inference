                    "text": "The firing angle in a single-phase one-pulse controlled rectifier circuit with a resistive and counter EMF (electromotive force) load can be determined by analyzing the circuit's operation. The firing angle (\\(\\alpha\\)) represents the point in time when the thyristor or SCR (Silicon Controlled Rectifier) is triggered to conduct during each half cycle of the AC supply.\n\nIn a circuit with a sinusoidal source voltage \\(V_s = 400 \\sin(314t)\\) and a counter EMF \\(E = 200\\) V, the effective voltage across the load is reduced due to the counter EMF. The output voltage of the circuit can be expressed as:\n\n\\[V_o = V_s - E\\]\n\nFor a single-phase one-pulse controlled rectifier circuit, the output voltage at any given moment is the difference between the source voltage and the counter EMF, but only if the source voltage is greater than the counter EMF. This condition determines the range of the firing angle for which the SCR can be triggered effectively.\n\nThe counter EMF \\(E\\) reaches its maximum value when it equals the peak value of the source voltage. Given that the source voltage peaks at \\(400\\) V, the counter EMF of \\(200\\) V would reach its maximum when the source voltage is at half of its peak value, i.e., \\(200\\) V. This occurs at angles where the sine function equals \\(1/2\\), which corresponds to \\(\\sin^{-1}(1/2) = 30\u00b0\\) and \\(\\sin^{-1}(1/2) = 150\u00b0\\).\n\nTherefore, the firing angle can be anywhere from the point where the source voltage exceeds the counter EMF until the end of the positive half-cycle of the source voltage. In other words, the SCR can be triggered effectively from an angle slightly after \\(30\u00b0\\) (when the source voltage begins to exceed the counter EMF) until the end of the positive half-cycle, which is \\(180\u00b0\\).\n\nThus, the range of the firing angle control is from approximately \\(30\u00b0\\) to \\(180\u00b0\\).\n\nThe correct answer is **B. 30\u00b0 to 180\u00b0**."
