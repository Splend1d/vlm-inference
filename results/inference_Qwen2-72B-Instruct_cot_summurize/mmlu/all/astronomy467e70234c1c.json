The surface is primarily composed of nitrogen ice, with smaller amounts of methane and carbon monoxide ices. These substances can sublimate (change from solid to gas) when Pluto is closer to the Sun in its elliptical orbit (near perihelion), creating a thin atmosphere. When Pluto moves further away from the Sun (near aphelion), this atmosphere can freeze out again and return to the surface as ice."
