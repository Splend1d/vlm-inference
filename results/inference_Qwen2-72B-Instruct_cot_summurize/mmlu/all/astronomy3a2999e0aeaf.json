These bands are caused by differences in temperature, pressure, and chemical composition, which lead to alternating patterns of rising and falling air (or gas). The belts are darker in color and correspond to regions where air is sinking, while the zones are lighter in color and represent areas where air is rising. These atmospheric features give Jupiter its distinctive banded appearance when viewed from space."
