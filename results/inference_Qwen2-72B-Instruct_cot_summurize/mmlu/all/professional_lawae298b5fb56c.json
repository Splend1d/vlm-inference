Both the pedestrian and the driver suffered injuries. The pedestrian filed a negligence action against the driver in a federal district court in State B, seeking $100,000 in damages. The driver believes that the pedestrian was crossing the street illegally and is therefore responsible for the accident. The driver seeks an attorney's advice on how best to respond to the action. Assume that State B is a contributory negligence state. How should the attorney advise the driver to respond?\n\nA. File an answer raising the affirmative defense of contributory negligence and asserting a counterclaim for negligence, seeking damages for the driver's injuries.\nB. File an answer raising the affirmative defense of contributory negligence and defense of contributory negligence and move for judgment on the pleadings.\nC.

Additionally, by asserting a counterclaim for negligence, the driver can seek damages for their own injuries resulting from the accident, provided they can prove the pedestrian's negligence contributed to the incident. This strategy allows the driver to defend against the pedestrian's claim while also pursuing compensation for their own losses."
