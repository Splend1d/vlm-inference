The paternal copy of this gene is silenced.\n\nHere are the possible causes of Angelman syndrome:\n\nA. Maternal UPD 15: This means that both copies of chromosome 15 come from the mother. Since the paternal copy is necessary to silence the maternal UBE3A gene, having two maternal copies will not allow for any functional UBE3A protein to be produced, resulting in Angelman syndrome.\n \nB. Paternal UPD 15: This results in Prader-Willi syndrome rather than Angelman syndrome because it leads to the loss of expression of genes that are normally expressed only from the maternal chromosome.\n\nC. Deletion in the paternally derived chromosome 15: This would not lead to Angelman syndrome since the maternal copy of the UBE3A gene would still be expressed.\n\nD. A mutation in the SNRPN promoter: SNRPN is a gene located on chromosome 15 and is normally expressed only from the paternal allele. Mutations in its promoter region would not directly cause Angelman syndrome but could lead to Prader-Willi syndrome.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. Maternal UPD 15."
