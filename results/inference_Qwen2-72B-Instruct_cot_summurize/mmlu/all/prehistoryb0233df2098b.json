Fire makes meat more digestible and kills bacteria.\n\nWhile all of the options listed have been significant advantages of fire for humans, option B is often considered one of the most crucial in terms of human evolution. Cooking food with fire made it easier to digest and safer to eat, which had profound implications for human health and development. Cooking food also allowed humans to extract more nutrients from their meals, which supported brain growth and helped our ancestors survive in various environments."
