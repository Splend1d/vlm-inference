This means they become less sensitive to sounds and phonetic contrasts that are not used in their native language. This process is known as \"perceptual narrowing\" or \"perceptual attunement\". It's an important step in language acquisition because it helps infants to focus on the sounds and patterns that are most relevant for learning their native language.\n\nOption B (begin to be sensitive to rhythms in speech patterns) is also true but it is not specific to the latter part of the first year. Infants are sensitive to rhythm and prosody from birth.\n\nOption C (begin to utter their first words in a systematic progression determined by selective reinforcement of babbling) is also true, but it doesn't describe a change in language-learning ability per se, rather it describes a developmental milestone.\n\nOption D (begin producing more language than they can comprehend) is generally not true. Typically, children understand more language than they can produce until around age 2 or 3."
