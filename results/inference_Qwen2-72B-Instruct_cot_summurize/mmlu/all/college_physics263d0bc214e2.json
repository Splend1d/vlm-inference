Therefore, it has a total of five degrees of freedom.\n\nUsing the equipartition theorem, the average total energy per molecule is:\n\nE = (1/2)kT * number of degrees of freedom\n\nE = (1/2)kT * 5\n\nE = (5/2)kT\n\nHowever, since this choice is not available in your options, we should focus on the degrees of freedom directly related to the harmonic motion, which are the two degrees of freedom (kinetic and potential) associated with the vibration. Thus, for the harmonic oscillator itself:\n\nE = (1/2)kT * 2\n\nE = kT\n\nBut considering the context of a three-dimensional space where the particle can also move freely (translational degrees of freedom), the correct answer considering all degrees of freedom would have been (5/2)kT if it were an option.\n\nGiven the options you provided, the closest answer that considers only the degrees of freedom associated with the harmonic motion (vibrational) is:\n\nB. kT"
