To protest the requirement that they carry papers documenting their identity and residence, black South Africans gathered in front of police stations without their papers.

Therefore, the correct answer would be:\n\nC. The world condemns South Africa\u2019s discrimination.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the condemnation might not be as vocal or effective as it should be, given the use of \"whispers\" which implies a lack of boldness or strength in those condemnations. The contrast between the world's whispers and apartheid's declaration with \"snarling guns\" highlights this disparity."
