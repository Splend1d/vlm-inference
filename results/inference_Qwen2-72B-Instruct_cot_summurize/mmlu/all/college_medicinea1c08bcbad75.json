At the end of each week, she gives a sticker to any student who got above a 90% on three quizzes in a row. After months of this regimen, she finds that performance on the quizzes has increased significantly but that tardiness has only decreased slightly. Which of the following best explains the teacher\u2019s observation?\n\nA. Variable ratio schedules create the strongest responses and behavior that is the least susceptible to extinction.\nB. The students had more intrinsic motivation to do well on quizzes than to show up on time.\nC. The students\u2019 behavior change was stronger in response to a fixed-ratio schedule than it was to a continuous reinforcement schedule.\nD. The students\u2019 behavior change was stronger in response to a fixed-ratio schedule than it was to a variable-interval schedule.\n"

                    "text": "The scenario described can be explained by understanding different types of reinforcement schedules in behavior modification theory. The teacher's reward system operates on two different schedules:\n\n1. For showing up on time, the students receive a sticker every day they arrive on time. This is an example of continuous reinforcement (every correct response is reinforced).\n\n2. For scoring above a 90% on three quizzes in a row, the students receive a sticker at the end of the week. This is an example of a fixed-ratio schedule (reinforcement after a set number of responses).\n\nGiven the information provided, the increase in quiz scores (behavior related to academic performance) is much greater than the decrease in tardiness (behavior related to punctuality). This suggests that the behavior change was stronger in response to the fixed-ratio schedule (quiz performance) than it was to the continuous reinforcement schedule (punctuality).\n\nTherefore, the best answer is:\n\n**C. The students\u2019 behavior change was stronger in response to a fixed-ratio schedule than it was to a continuous reinforcement schedule.**\n\nThis option aligns with the principles of behaviorism, which suggest that fixed-ratio schedules often produce higher rates of response and resistance to extinction compared to continuous reinforcement. In other words, the students were more motivated to perform well on quizzes because the reward came after achieving a specific goal (scoring above 90% on three consecutive quizzes), whereas simply showing up on time every day might not have been as motivating or habit-forming."
