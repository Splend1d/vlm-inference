                    "text": "During high-intensity exercise, the body initially uses readily available energy sources such as muscle glycogen and blood glucose. As the exercise continues, particularly in the later stages, there can be a shift towards increased fat oxidation for energy, but this does not necessarily mean that blood glucose levels will fall dramatically.\n\nIn the context of intermittent high-intensity exercise lasting 80-90 minutes, it's important to consider several factors:\n\n1. **Initial Blood Glucose Levels:** If an individual starts with normal or high blood glucose levels, they may see a decrease as the body uses glucose for energy. However, if starting levels are low, the body might release counter-regulatory hormones (like glucagon and adrenaline) to increase glucose production in the liver, preventing a significant drop.\n\n2. **Intensity and Duration:** Intermittent high-intensity exercise involves periods of high effort interspersed with lower intensity recovery phases. During high-intensity periods, glucose uptake by muscles increases, potentially leading to a drop in blood glucose. However, during recovery periods, less glucose is used, which might stabilize or even slightly increase glucose levels due to hormonal responses.\n\n3. **Hormonal Responses:** High-intensity exercise stimulates the release of hormones like adrenaline and cortisol, which promote gluconeogenesis (the production of glucose from non-carbohydrate sources) and glycogenolysis (the breakdown of glycogen to glucose), helping to maintain blood glucose levels.\n\nGiven these factors, option B: \"remains relatively unchanged\" is the most likely answer for the average person engaging in intermittent high-intensity exercise for 80-90 minutes. While there may be small fluctuations, the overall effect of hormonal responses and energy source shifting typically prevents a significant and sustained drop in blood glucose levels.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that for individuals with diabetes or other conditions affecting glucose metabolism, the response might be different, and careful monitoring would be necessary to avoid hypoglycemia (option D). For healthy individuals, experiencing a drop of 1-3 mM (millimolar) in blood glucose (option C) is possible during such exercise but would likely be temporary and not lead to hypoglycemic levels."
