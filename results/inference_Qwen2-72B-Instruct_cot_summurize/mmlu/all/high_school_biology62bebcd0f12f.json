Natural selection\n\nNatural selection is the evolutionary mechanism through which organisms that are better adapted to their environment tend to survive and reproduce more successfully than those that are less well adapted. Over time, this leads to populations becoming better suited to their environments as advantageous traits become more common in the population. While mutation, non-random mating, and gene flow can all contribute to genetic variation within a population, natural selection is the primary driver of adaptive evolution."
