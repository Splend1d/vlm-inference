Which of the following is part of his response?\n\nA. He would say this begs the question because the immigration question is identical to the freedom-of-movement question.\nB. He would present an argument showing that there is actually no right to freedom of movement.\nC. He would argue that some rights are not absolute (e.g., the right to marriage doesn't allow you to marry an unwilling partner).\nD. He would use deontological premises to deductively conclude that unjust public policies are morally objectionable.\n"

He would argue that some rights are not absolute (e.g., the right to marriage doesn't allow you to marry an unwilling partner). \n\nWellman argues that while there is a general right to freedom of movement, this right is not absolute and can be limited in certain circumstances. He uses the example of marriage to illustrate this point, arguing that while people generally have a right to marry whom they choose, this right does not extend to forcing someone else to marry them against their will. Similarly, he argues that while people have a right to move freely within a country's borders, this right can be limited by justifiable immigration restrictions."
