The most widely accepted hypothesis is that Homo floresiensis is closely related to or a descendant of Homo erectus (Option A). This theory is based on several factors, including the geographical context\u2014Homo erectus fossils have been found in Indonesia\u2014and the morphological similarities between the two species.\n\nHomo erectus was one of the first hominins to migrate out of Africa and had a wide distribution across Asia. It is known for its ability to make and use tools and for its relatively large brain size compared to earlier hominins. The small-brained Homo floresiensis, despite its diminutive size, also showed evidence of tool use and fire-making capabilities, which could suggest a common ancestor with Homo erectus that possessed these traits.\n\nHowever, the relationship between Homo floresiensis and Homo erectus is not without controversy. Some researchers have proposed alternative hypotheses, such as a direct link to Homo habilis (Option B) or even a completely separate evolutionary line. The unique features of Homo floresiensis, including its small body size and brain, have led to debates about whether these characteristics are due to insular dwarfism\u2014a process by which the body size of an animal decreases over generations when living on an island\u2014or if they represent a distinct evolutionary adaptation.\n\nDespite ongoing research and discussions, the consensus among many scientists is that Homo floresiensis is most likely related to Homo erectus, making Option A the closest answer to your question."
