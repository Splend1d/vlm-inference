This could suggest that the standard of living was relatively high for its inhabitants compared to other ancient cities where there is a clear distinction between elite and commoner dwellings. However, it does not necessarily mean the city was a democracy (option C) or entirely egalitarian (option D), as architectural grandeur can exist alongside social hierarchies. Option B, commoners taking over elite residences, might be reflected in archaeological records but is not directly suggested by the confusion over housing types."
