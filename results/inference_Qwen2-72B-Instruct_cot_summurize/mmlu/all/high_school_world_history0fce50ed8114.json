If I have commanded that the tribute offerings sent by you, O King, are to be accepted, this was solely in consideration for the spirit which prompted you to dispatch them from afar. . . . As your Ambassador can see for himself, we possess all things. I set no value on objects strange or ingenious, and have no use for your country's manufactures. It behooves you, O King, to display even greater devotion and loyalty in future, so that, by perpetual submission to our Throne, you may secure peace and prosperity.\nHow did the Chinese restrict foreign trade during the era 1750\u20131900?\n\nA. European merchants were confined to a few cities designated for foreign trade.\nB. Only the Dutch traded with China; other Europeans had to use them as intermediaries.\nC. The Chinese imposed extraordinary tariffs on all foreign products.\nD. They passed laws intended to persecute and harass foreign residents.\n"

European merchants were confined to a few cities designated for foreign trade.\n\nDuring the period of 1750-1900, the Qing Dynasty in China restricted foreign trade by confining European merchants to specific ports, primarily Canton (Guangzhou), after 1757. This policy, known as the Canton System, limited direct trade with foreigners to these designated areas and placed it under strict government control. The system also included regulations on when trade could occur and how long foreign traders could stay in the port cities."
