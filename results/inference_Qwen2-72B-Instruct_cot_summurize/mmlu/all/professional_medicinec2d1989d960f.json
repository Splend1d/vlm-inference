GAD is characterized by excessive worry and anxiety about everyday things, difficulty concentrating, restlessness, irritability, muscle tension, and sleep disturbances. The patient's symptoms of a pounding heart, poor sleep, restlessness, and inability to concentrate align with these diagnostic criteria.\n\nAdjustment disorder with anxious mood (A) can also present with similar symptoms, but it typically occurs in response to a specific stressor, such as the recent relocation and job promotion in this case. However, GAD seems more fitting given the constellation of symptoms described.\n\nMajor depressive disorder (C) involves persistent feelings of sadness and loss of interest or pleasure in activities once enjoyed, along with other symptoms, which are not prominently described in this scenario.\n\nObsessive-compulsive personality disorder (D) is characterized by a pervasive pattern of perfectionism, control, and a reluctance to delegate tasks, which does not fit the description provided.\n\nGiven the information available, GAD appears to be the most appropriate diagnosis. However, a thorough evaluation by a mental health professional would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other possible conditions."
