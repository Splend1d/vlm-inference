Canada's third major migration stream came from Latin America.\n\nWhile there have been migrations from Latin America to Canada, it is not accurate to describe this as Canada's \"third major migration stream.\" Historically, after the initial French and British migrations, major waves of immigration to Canada came from various European countries, followed by significant numbers from Eastern and Southern Europe, and later from Asia and other parts of the world. Latin American immigration to Canada has increased in recent decades but was not one of the early or primary sources of migrants to the country."
