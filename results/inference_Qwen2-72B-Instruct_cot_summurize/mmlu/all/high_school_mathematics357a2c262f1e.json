The correct formula application and calculation should lead to:\n\n\\[ P(85, 3) = 85 \\times 84 \\times 83 \\]\n\n\\[ = 592,740 \\]\n\nNone of the options exactly match this result either, but it seems the closest option considering potential rounding or minor arithmetic errors would be B. 592,704. However, this discrepancy suggests the need to re-examine the calculation or the options provided, as the direct application of the permutation formula with exact arithmetic does not perfectly align with any of the given choices. \n\nThe most mathematically accurate response based on the formula and arithmetic applied would be closest to 592,740, which isn't listed among the options. If choosing from the provided options, B. 592,704 is the closest, albeit not an exact match."
