The least common multiple (LCM) of 5, 3, and 2 is 30. This means that any multiple of 30 will also be divisible by 5, 3, and 2.\n\nLooking at the options provided:\n\nA. 12 - Not a multiple of 5.\nB. 20 - Not a multiple of 3.\nC. 30 - A multiple of 5, 3, and 2.\nD. 45 - Not a multiple of 2.\n\nThus, the correct answer is C. 30.
