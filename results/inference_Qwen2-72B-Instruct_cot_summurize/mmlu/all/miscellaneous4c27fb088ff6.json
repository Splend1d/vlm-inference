New plant varieties being patented\n\nThe development and use of genetically modified (GM) plants often result in new plant varieties that can be patented by the companies or organizations that create them. This allows these entities to control the distribution and use of the seeds, which can have various impacts on farmers, biodiversity, and food systems. While some of the other options may occur in specific circumstances, patenting of new GM plant varieties is a more direct and common outcome of GM crop development. \n\nA. Reduced cost of plant seeds might not necessarily happen as GM seeds can often be more expensive due to research and development costs and profit margins.\nC. Increased genetic diversity within a planted field is unlikely as GM crops are often monocultures, reducing genetic diversity.\nD. Less oversight and fewer regulations than for unmodified crops is generally not true, as GM crops often face stricter regulations and oversight."
