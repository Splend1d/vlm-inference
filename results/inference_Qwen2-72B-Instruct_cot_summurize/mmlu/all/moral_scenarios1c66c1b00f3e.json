Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn both scenarios, the actions described do not necessarily involve any clear moral wrongdoing based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. Rolling a ball during a game is typically an expected action, and eating sandwiches could be considered acceptable if they were offered or if permission was given. Without additional context indicating that there was a violation of consent or harm caused to others, neither scenario describes a morally wrong action. However, it's worth noting that \"finger sandwitches\" might be a typo and should likely read \"finger sandwiches.\" If the sandwiches belonged to someone else and were consumed without permission, then Scenario 2 would be considered morally wrong."
