Economies of scale are associated with the rising or increasing portion of an average total cost (ATC) curve.\n\nEconomies of scale actually refer to the declining or decreasing portions of the ATC curve, which means that as production increases, the average total cost per unit decreases. This occurs due to various factors such as better utilization of resources, bulk purchasing discounts, and spreading fixed costs over more units of output. Thus, option B is incorrect because it suggests the opposite of what economies of scale entail."
