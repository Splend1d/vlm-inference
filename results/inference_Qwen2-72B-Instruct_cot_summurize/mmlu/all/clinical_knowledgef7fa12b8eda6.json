It plays a central role in metabolism by catalyzing the conversion of pyruvate, the end product of glycolysis, into acetyl-CoA, which can then enter the citric acid cycle (also known as the Krebs cycle or TCA cycle). This reaction is a key link between carbohydrate metabolism and fat and protein metabolism. The PDC is not involved in the conversion of pyruvate to lactate or lactate to pyruvate, which are reactions typically associated with anaerobic respiration in muscle cells under conditions of low oxygen availability."
