She left the store without paying for it. Unknown to the girl, the store security guard saw what she had done. He immediately ran outside, grabbed her arm, and accused her of stealing the candy bar. The girl broke down and started crying. She then told the security guard that she was hungry because she hadn't eaten any lunch. At a juvenile delinquency court hearing, the security guard proposes to testify to what the girl said. Upon objection by the girl's attorney, the strongest reason for admitting her statement will be because\n\nA. Miranda warnings need not be given to juveniles.\nB. the security guard's remark was an accusation, not an interrogation.\nC. the security guard was not employed by an agency of the government.\nD. the girl was not in custody.\n"

Additionally, since the security guard is not a law enforcement officer and the girl was not in custody at the time, Miranda warnings would not have been required. However, option D is also a valid point contributing to the admissibility of the statement, but option B directly addresses the nature of the interaction that led to the statement being made."
