In this scenario, the conductor is described as a smooth round wire, so it has the smallest radius of curvature at its lower surface, which is closest to the ground.\n\nHowever, in the context of high voltage transmission lines, \"electric stress\" often refers to the electric field intensity near the surface of the conductor due to the charge distribution on it. When a high voltage is applied between the conductor and ground, the electric field lines will be more concentrated at the lower surface of the conductor because that's where the conductor is closest to the ground, which is at a different potential. This concentration of field lines leads to a higher electric field strength or \"stress\" at the lower surface of the conductor compared to other surfaces.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nA. Lower surface of the conductor."
