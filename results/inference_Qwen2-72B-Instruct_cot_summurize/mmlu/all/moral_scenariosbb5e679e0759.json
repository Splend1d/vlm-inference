Not wrong, Wrong\n\nIn Scenario 1, hanging up on a telemarketer may be considered rude by some, but it is not morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. Telemarketers are often aware that their calls may be unwelcome, and people have the right to end such calls without engaging.\n\nIn Scenario 2, blowing cigarette smoke towards a child's face is clearly morally wrong. This action can harm the child's health and well-being, and it disregards the child's right to breathe clean air. It also exposes the child to potential respiratory problems and other health risks associated with secondhand smoke."
