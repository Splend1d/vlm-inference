The president of the bank has told us that most of the State banks exist by its forbearance. Should its influence become concentrated, as it may under the operation of such an act as this, in the hands of a self-elected directory whose interests are identified with those of the foreign stockholders, will there not be cause to tremble for the purity of our elections in peace and for the independence of our country in war? Their power would be great whenever they might choose to exert it; but if this monopoly were regularly renewed every fifteen or twenty years on terms proposed by themselves, they might seldom in peace put forth their strength to influence elections or control the affairs of the nation. But if any private citizen or public functionary should interpose to curtail its powers or prevent a renewal of its privileges, it cannot be doubted that he would be made to feel its influence.\"\nPresident Andrew Jackson, Veto of the Bank of the United States, 1832\nJohn Taylor of Caroline was a Virginia senator who served in office from 1792 to 1824. He distrusted large banking institutions and generally defended the institution of slavery. He was once quoted as saying that \"\u2026if Congress could incorporate a bank, it might emancipate a slave.\" Taylor is best categorized as\n\nA. a Jeffersonian Democrat\nB. a Jacksonian Democrat\nC. a Republican\nD. a Whig\n"

They often distrusted large financial institutions, such as national banks, which they believed could lead to undue influence by wealthy elites and potentially undermine state sovereignty and individual liberties. Taylor's skepticism about the federal government's power to incorporate a bank aligns with the Jeffersonian Democratic philosophy. Additionally, his support for slavery was also consistent with the views of many Southern Jeffersonian Democrats during that era."
