Since there is no lis pendens rule in international law and all depends on the consent of the parties to a dispute, there is no priority or hierarchy among international courts and tribunals\n\nExplanation: In international law, the concept of lis pendens (meaning \"suit pending\") does not apply as it does in domestic legal systems. There is no hierarchy among international courts and tribunals, and their jurisdiction is based on the consent of the parties involved in the dispute. This means that if two or more courts could potentially hear a case, the one that ultimately hears it will be the one to which the parties agree to submit their dispute. While certain courts may have specific mandates or subject-matter expertise, this does not automatically give them priority over other courts. The consent of the parties is key."
