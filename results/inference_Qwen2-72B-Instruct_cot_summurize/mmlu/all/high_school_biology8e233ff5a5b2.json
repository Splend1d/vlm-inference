If the population remains in equilibrium, what would be the expected frequency of that allele after 500 years?\n\nA. It will increase if the allele is favorable or will decrease if it is unfavorable for individuals in that population.\nB. Not enough information is provided to determine if the frequency of the allele will remain the same or change.\nC. The frequency of the allele will remain at 0.3 because the population is at Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.\nD. The frequency of the allele will remain the same; this is an example of the bottleneck effect.\n"

The frequency of the allele will remain at 0.3 because the population is at Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.\n\nIn Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, allele frequencies remain constant from one generation to the next unless acted upon by evolutionary forces such as mutation, migration, genetic drift, or selection. Since the population is stated to be in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, and no changes to these conditions are mentioned, the allele frequency should remain unchanged over time."
