Four years ago, in order to enhance the recreational aspects of this land, the county leased most of it to a company. The lease required the company to construct and operate a first-rate luxury hotel \u0080\u0094complete with bar, restaurant, and private marina \u0080\u0094and to pay the county 15% of its net profits as rent. The company set up management and operations bylaws for its new hotel, which were reviewed and approved by the county at the time the lease was negotiated. Upon completion of the facilities, the state granted the company a license to sell alcoholic beverages in its restaurant and bar. The hotel announced that the least expensive room was $1,000 per night. Much of the population in the county cannot afford to stay at the new hotel. One resident who cannot afford to pay the hotel fees brings an action against the company, claiming that the high fees operate to discriminate against the poor, in violation of the constitutional right to equal protection. What is the most likely result of this action?\n\nA. The company will lose because social class constitutes a suspect classification under the equal protection clause.\nB. The company will win, because hotel privileges are not an important or basic enough deprivation, for those unable to pay for them, to be held to violate equal protection.\nC. The resident will win because all public rights cannot be limited to those who can afford them.\nD. The resident will win because discrimination against poor people violates the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n"

The company will win, because hotel privileges are not an important or basic enough deprivation, for those unable to pay for them, to be held to violate equal protection.\n\nThe equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment generally does not apply to economic status or wealth classifications, as these are not considered suspect classifications. Therefore, the fact that the hotel charges high rates that some residents cannot afford is not a violation of the equal protection clause. Hotel accommodations are not considered a fundamental right or necessity, and thus the pricing policy is not subject to strict scrutiny under the equal protection analysis. The court would likely find that the hotel's pricing is a matter of economic decision-making rather than discriminatory intent based on social class."
