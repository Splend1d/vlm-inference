It had distinctive tread marks and an unusual wear pattern on the sole. It also had a \"V\" mark on the heel bottom that indicates the brand was a Victory shoe. The detective, armed with a proper search warrant, searched the suspect's apartment, where he found a shoe to a right foot that of the same size, and with a similar wear pattern and the same \"V\" mark as the shoeprint found at the scene. The shoe for the left foot was not found but the shoe for the right foot was seized from the suspect's closet and offered as evidence at trial. Is this admissible evidence?\n\nA. Yes, because it is direct evidence of guilt.\nB. Yes, because it is appropriate circumstantial evidence of guilt.\nC. No, because this shoe is irrelevant and will have no residue or other probative evidence relating to it.\nD. No, because footprint evidence is highly speculative unless both shoes and shoe prints are offered and authenticated.\n"

Yes, because it is appropriate circumstantial evidence of guilt.\n\nThe right-foot shoe found in the suspect's apartment shares characteristics with the left-foot shoeprint found at the crime scene, such as the size, wear pattern, and the \"V\" mark indicating the brand. Although it is not the exact shoe that made the print, the similarities between the two provide circumstantial evidence that could suggest the suspect was wearing a matching pair of shoes when the crime was committed. This can be used by the prosecution to build a case against the suspect, even though it does not directly prove guilt. Circumstantial evidence can be powerful if it leads to reasonable inferences that support the prosecution's theory of the crime."
