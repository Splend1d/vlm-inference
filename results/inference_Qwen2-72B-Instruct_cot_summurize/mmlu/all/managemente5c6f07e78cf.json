Scenario planning\n\nContingency planning is the process of preparing for unexpected events or emergencies by creating strategies and procedures to address potential risks. Another term often used to describe this concept is scenario planning, which involves envisioning various possible future scenarios and developing plans to respond to them. While all four options might be related to planning in some way, only scenario planning closely aligns with the idea of contingency planning."
