The basement flooded whenever it rained heavily \u0080\u0094 there were marks along the entire basement wall that showed the level of the flood waters, and there were thin but distinct lines in the wall that were actual cracks in the foundation. The seller painted most of the interior of the house, including the basement walls, and plastered the fracture lines, which obliterated the flood marks and fracture marks. A buyer purchased the home after inspecting the basement and seeing no signs of flooding. After the first heavy rain the problem was revealed.

Yes, the seller has a duty to make adequate disclosure of the known facts with respect to material defects.\n\nIn real estate transactions, sellers are generally required to disclose known material defects that could affect the value or desirability of the property. In this case, the flooding in the basement and the cracks in the foundation are material defects that should have been disclosed to the buyer. By painting over the flood marks and plastering the cracks, the seller actively concealed these defects, which could be considered fraudulent misrepresentation. As such, the buyer may have grounds to sue the seller for damages or to rescind the sale based on the seller's failure to disclose these significant issues."
