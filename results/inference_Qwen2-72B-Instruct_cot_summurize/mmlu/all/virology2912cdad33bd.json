However, none of the options you listed specifically mentions this category. Among the options given:\n\nA. Respiratory infections\nB. Diarrheal diseases\nC. Malaria\nD. Tuberculosis\n\nThe correct answer would be:\n\nD. Tuberculosis\n\nTuberculosis (TB) is a major global health problem, particularly in developing countries. It is one of the top 10 causes of death worldwide and the leading cause from a single infectious agent (Mycobacterium tuberculosis). However, it's important to note that the exact number of deaths attributed to each cause can vary from year to year and region to region.\n\nAs of the latest data, non-communicable diseases, including cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes, and chronic respiratory diseases, collectively account for over 70% of all deaths worldwide. But within the context of your question, TB stands out as causing significantly more deaths than the other options listed."
