An internationally wrongful conduct consists of an action or omission attributable to the State, which constitutes a breach of an international obligation of the State.\n\nThis definition is based on the International Law Commission's Articles on State Responsibility, which provide a framework for determining when a state is responsible for an internationally wrongful act and what consequences may follow. The key elements of this definition are that the conduct must be attributable to the state (meaning that the state can be held responsible for it) and that it must breach an international obligation of the state. This could include violations of treaty obligations, customary international law, or other sources of international law."
