One of the men told the other that he knew an alarm specialist who could help disarm the security system. One of the men then approached the alarm specialist and asked if he would assist them in disarming the home's alarm system. The alarm specialist said that he didn't want to participate in the crime but told the man how he could disarm the system himself. The two men thereafter went to the home to commit the burglary. When they arrived at the home, they saw a vicious guard dog patrolling the fenced-in area of the home. Deciding it would be too risky to confront the dog, the two men abandoned their planned burglary. Which of the following is the most accurate statement regarding the criminal liability of the two men and the alarm specialist?\n\nA. The two men are guilty of conspiracy.\nB. The two men and the alarm specialist are guilty of conspiracy.\nC. The two men are guilty of conspiracy and the two men and the alarm specialist are guilty of attempted burglary.\nD. The two men and the alarm specialist are guilty of both conspiracy and attempted burglary.\n"

                    "text": "The most accurate statement regarding the criminal liability of the two men and the alarm specialist is:\n\nA. The two men are guilty of conspiracy.\n\nExplanation: The two men agreed to commit a crime (burglary), which constitutes a conspiracy. The fact that they did not actually carry out the burglary does not negate the charge of conspiracy, as this charge is based on the agreement to commit a crime rather than the successful completion of the crime itself. However, the alarm specialist, while providing information on how to disarm the system, did not agree to participate in the crime and thus may not be guilty of conspiracy unless there is evidence that he was part of the agreement. Since the question does not provide enough information to conclude that the alarm specialist was part of the conspiracy, only options involving the two men can be correct under the given circumstances. Attempted burglary requires an overt act toward committing the burglary, but the abandonment of the plan due to the presence of the guard dog suggests that no such attempt reached a stage that would legally constitute an attempt. Therefore, the most accurate statement based on the provided information is that the two men are guilty of conspiracy."
