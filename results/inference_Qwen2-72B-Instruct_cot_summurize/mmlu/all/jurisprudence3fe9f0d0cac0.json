That facts about the world or human nature cannot normally ordain what ought to be.\n\nIn \"Justice for Hedgehogs,\" Ronald Dworkin discusses Hume's principle, which is based on David Hume's famous dictum that one cannot derive an \"ought\" from an \"is.\" This principle asserts that factual statements (what \"is\") do not logically entail normative statements (what \"ought\" to be). In other words, just because something exists or occurs in a certain way does not necessarily mean it should be that way. This principle is crucial in understanding the relationship between descriptive and prescriptive claims in moral and legal philosophy."
