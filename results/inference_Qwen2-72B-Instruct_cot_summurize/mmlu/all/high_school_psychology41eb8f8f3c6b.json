PET (Positron Emission Tomography) scan\nIII. fMRI (functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging)\n\nIf these are the intended options, then the correct answer would be:\n\nD. II and III only\n\nBoth PET scans and fMRI are used to image brain function. PET scans use a radioactive tracer to show how different areas of the brain are working during a specific task, while fMRI measures changes in blood flow and oxygenation in the brain which is associated with neuronal activity."
