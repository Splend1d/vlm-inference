New Populism is often associated with a political ideology that emphasizes the interests and values of ordinary people over those of the elite or establishment. It can manifest as skepticism towards globalization, international trade agreements, and involvement in foreign conflicts, reflecting a preference for focusing on domestic issues and concerns. This movement has been evident in various political contexts around the world but gained particular prominence in the United States during the 2016 presidential election and the subsequent administration of President Donald Trump."
