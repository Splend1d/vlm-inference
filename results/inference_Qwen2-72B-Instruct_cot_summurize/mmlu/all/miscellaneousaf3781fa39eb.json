Investment levels diminish\n\nAn increase in interest rates typically makes borrowing more expensive, which can discourage businesses and individuals from taking out loans to finance investments. This can lead to a decrease in overall investment levels. While higher interest rates can attract foreign investors and potentially increase the value of the U.S. dollar (option C), this is not the most direct or immediate impact. Higher interest rates do not generally cause employment to increase (option B) or mortgage rates to decline (option D)."
