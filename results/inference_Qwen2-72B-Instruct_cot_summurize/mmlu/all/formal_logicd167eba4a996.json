A \u2228 B\n3. ~C\n\nWe can use modus ponens on 1 and 2 to get:\n4. C \u2228 D\n\nThen, since we have ~C from premise 3, we can use disjunctive syllogism on 4 and 3 to get:\n5. D\n\nNow, since we have A \u2228 B from premise 2 and we've derived D, we can infer that if A \u2228 B is true, then D must also be true. Thus, we can derive:\n6. (A \u2228 B) \u2283 D\n\nThis makes option D the immediate one-step consequence. The other options cannot be directly derived from the given premises with just one step."
