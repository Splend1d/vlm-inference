The probability of getting a finding at least as extreme as that obtained by chance alone if the null hypothesis is true is 0.20.\n\nThis is the correct interpretation of a p-value. It is the probability of observing a result as extreme or more extreme than the one observed, given that the null hypothesis is true. In other words, it's the probability of seeing the data you have, or something more extreme, just by random chance assuming there is no effect or difference (null hypothesis)."
