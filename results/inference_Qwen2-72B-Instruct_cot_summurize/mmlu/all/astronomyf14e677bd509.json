The probability of impact is the same next year as it is for any later year.\n\nWhile the frequency of major impacts is low, the risk is not zero and the timing cannot be predicted with certainty. Impacts by asteroids or comets can happen at any time, although statistically, major impacts are rare events that occur over long timescales. However, it's important to note that smaller impacts happen more frequently, and there is ongoing monitoring and research to identify potential threats from Near-Earth Objects (NEOs)."
