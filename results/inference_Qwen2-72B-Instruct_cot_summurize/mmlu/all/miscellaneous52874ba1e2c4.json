Flat screen televisions would only be a part of this larger category, so we can't know the exact figure without more detailed data.\n\nHowever, we can make an educated guess based on the information available. If we assume that flat screen televisions make up a significant portion but not all of the electrical and electronic goods market, then option B ($1.2 billion) seems like a reasonable estimate. This is because if televisions made up even half of the market, the revenue would be around $4.3 billion, which is closer to option B than any other choice given.\n\nTherefore, while I don't have the exact figure, it's safe to say that the answer is likely close to:\n\nB. $1.2 billion annual Revenue\n\nPlease note that this is an estimate and the actual figure could vary."
