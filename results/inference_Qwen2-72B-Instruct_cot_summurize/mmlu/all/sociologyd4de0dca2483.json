While some degree of assimilation did occur over time as different ethnic groups interacted and intermingled, the statement that best reflects the historical reality is:\n\nC. Most ethnic groups were integrated into mainstream society, but the black population remained in the city's ghettos.\n\nThis period saw a significant influx of African Americans from the rural South to urban centers in the North, including Chicago, seeking better economic opportunities and fleeing the Jim Crow laws of the South. However, they faced systemic racism and segregation in housing, employment, and education. Despite the diversity that the migration brought to the city, it also exacerbated social tensions and led to the development of segregated neighborhoods, particularly for the black community, which was often confined to areas like the South Side due to discriminatory practices such as redlining and restrictive covenants. This segregation persisted long after the initial migration, shaping the social and economic landscape of Chicago for decades to come.\n\nWhile there were instances of hostility and prejudice from the white population, as suggested in option D, it is not the most comprehensive answer since it does not address the long-term effects of segregation on the black population."
