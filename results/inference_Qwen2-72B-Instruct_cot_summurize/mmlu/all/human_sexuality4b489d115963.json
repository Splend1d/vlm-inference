Erotica may lead to increases in sexual arousal for men and women.\n\nResearch suggests that exposure to sexually explicit material, including erotica, can increase sexual arousal in both men and women. However, it is important to note that the effects of erotica can vary widely depending on individual factors such as personal preferences, cultural background, and context. Some studies have also suggested that certain types of erotica may be associated with negative outcomes, such as increased aggression or decreased relationship satisfaction, but these findings are not universal and depend on various factors. Overall, the research indicates that the impact of erotica on sexual behavior and attitudes is complex and multifaceted."
