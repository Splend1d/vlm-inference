He was heavily influenced by Stoicism, which emphasized ethics and living in accordance with nature and reason. Cicero argued that understanding our moral duties was essential for leading a good life and making wise decisions.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that Cicero also valued other branches of philosophy, including logic and natural science, as they could contribute to our understanding of the world and help us make sound judgments. But ultimately, he saw ethics as the most practical and important area of philosophy. As he wrote in his work \"De Officiis\" (On Duties), \"the first and greatest goal of philosophy is to teach us to distinguish between what is right and wrong.\""
