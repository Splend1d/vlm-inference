This means there is no active muscle contraction from the person undergoing the movement.\n\nGiven the options provided:\n\nA. Movement with resistance, stretching at end of range.\nB. Movement without resistance, stretching at end of range.\nC. Movement with resistance, stopping at end of range.\nD. Movement without resistance, stopping at end of range.\n\nThe closest description for passive movements would be:\n\n**D. Movement without resistance, stopping at end of range.**\n\nThis option indicates that the movement is performed without the individual providing any resistance or effort, and it stops at the natural end of the joint's range of motion. However, it's important to note that in practice, passive movements might also involve some degree of stretching if the movement is taken to the end of the range, but the key characteristic is the lack of active muscle contraction by the individual."
