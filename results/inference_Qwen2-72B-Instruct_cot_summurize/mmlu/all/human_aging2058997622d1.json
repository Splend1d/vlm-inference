However, without specific context or direct reference to the Kingbergs' work, this answer is an inference based on common knowledge of healthy aging practices. Successful aging typically involves maintaining a balanced diet (option A), fostering strong relationships (option B), and staying engaged in life through planning and goal setting (option D). Frequent partying is not commonly cited as a factor in healthy aging."
