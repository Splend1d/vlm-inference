Subsidize the firm or its customers.\n\nWhen there is a positive externality associated with the production of a private good, it means that the benefits of the good extend beyond the immediate parties involved in the transaction. This often leads to underproduction of the good relative to the socially optimal level because the market price does not fully reflect the total social benefits. By subsidizing the firm or its customers, the government can help offset the cost of production or increase demand, thereby encouraging more production and consumption of the good up to the point where social benefits equal social costs, achieving a more efficient outcome."
