Identify bases for segmenting markets.\n\nThis is because market segmentation involves dividing a broad market into smaller groups of consumers with similar needs and demands. To do this effectively, a firm must first identify the bases (or criteria) for segmentation, such as demographic, geographic, psychographic, or behavioral factors. Once these bases are identified, the firm can then proceed with segmenting the market, forecasting market potential, forecasting market share, and selecting target market segments."
