Social constructions of 'masculinity' or 'femininity' determine the roles in which men and women are expected to act, by considering these artificial roles we can ask important questions about the ways in which we conceptualize security.\n\nGender is indeed applicable to the field of Security Studies, but not in the ways suggested by options A, B, or C. Option A implies that women and children are passive recipients of security provided by the state, which ignores the agency and active roles they can play in security matters. Option B suggests that biological differences dictate security roles, which is a flawed assumption as social and cultural factors often play a larger role. Option C is incorrect because ignoring gender issues would not create a 'gender-neutral' security arena; rather, it would perpetuate existing biases and inequalities.\n\nOption D correctly identifies that gender is a social construct that influences expectations and roles within security contexts. By examining how gender norms shape security policies and practices, scholars can challenge traditional notions of security and develop more inclusive approaches. This perspective allows for a critical analysis of how gender impacts who is considered a threat, who is protected, and who has power in security decision-making processes. It also highlights the importance of understanding the experiences of different genders in conflict and post-conflict situations, such as the impact of violence on women and girls, and the roles of women in peacebuilding and conflict resolution."
