The surgeon moved to dismiss the action for lack of personal jurisdiction. The court denied the motion and set discovery cutoff and trial dates. The surgeon has appealed the denial of the motion. Should the appellate court hear the merits of the surgeon's appeal?\n\nA. No, because the appellate court lacks jurisdiction over the appeal.\nB. No, because the district court's decision on jurisdiction is final.\nC. Yes, because a contrary appellate decision could terminate the action.\nD. Yes, because the surgeon's personal- jurisdiction challenge raises a constitutional question.\n"

Yes, because a contrary appellate decision could terminate the action.\n\nThe surgeon's appeal regarding the personal jurisdiction issue can be heard by the appellate court before the final judgment because it is an \"interlocutory\" appeal. If the appellate court rules that the district court does not have personal jurisdiction over the defendant (the surgeon), then the case would be dismissed, effectively terminating the action. This type of appeal is allowed under the collateral order doctrine, which permits appeals from certain orders that do not end the litigation but resolve important questions separate from the merits."
