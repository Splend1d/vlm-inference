This process is known as phosphorylation and is a key regulatory mechanism in many cellular processes. Conversely, phosphatase enzymes can remove phosphate groups in a process called dephosphorylation. Neither of these processes directly involves the addition or removal of a ketone group or an amino acid to a polypeptide chain, nor do they inhibit ATP breakdown; rather, they use ATP as a phosphate donor."
