Ensure that there is no autocorrelation in the test regression residuals.\n\nBy adding lagged differences of the dependent variable as additional explanatory variables, the augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test aims to address potential serial correlation in the error term of the test regression. This is crucial for ensuring that the test statistic follows its asymptotic distribution and thus for obtaining valid inference on the null hypothesis of a unit root."
