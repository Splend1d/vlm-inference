Two days ago he developed a moist, nonproductive cough and rapid breathing. He has received all scheduled childhood immunizations. He attends a large day-care center and has three schoolaged siblings. His temperature is 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F), pulse is 101/min, respirations are 38/min, and blood pressure is 85/60 mm Hg. Physical examination shows nasal flaring and rhinorrhea. Chest examination shows intercostal retractions along with bilateral, diffuse wheezes and expiratory rhonchi. The infectious agent of this patient's condition most likely has which of the following properties?\n\nA. DNA genome\nB. Double-stranded nucleic acid genome\nC. Mature virion lacking viral polymerase\nD. Mediation of cell entry via a fusion protein\n"

Given the age of the patient, his attendance at a daycare center, and the presence of school-aged siblings, it is likely that the infectious agent is a common respiratory virus. The symptoms of fever, cough, and wheezing suggest that the virus may be causing bronchiolitis or pneumonia.\n\nOption D, \"Mediation of cell entry via a fusion protein,\" is the most likely property of the infectious agent in this case. Many respiratory viruses, such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and parainfluenza viruses, use fusion proteins to enter host cells. This mechanism allows the virus to fuse its envelope with the host cell membrane, facilitating the release of the viral genome into the cytoplasm of the host cell.\n\nWhile options A, B, and C could also describe some viruses, they do not specifically point to a respiratory virus that would cause the symptoms described in the patient. For example, both DNA and RNA viruses can cause respiratory infections, and some viruses have double-stranded nucleic acid genomes while others have single-stranded genomes. Additionally, some viruses have viral polymerases within their mature virions, but this is not a distinguishing feature that would help identify the specific virus in this case."
