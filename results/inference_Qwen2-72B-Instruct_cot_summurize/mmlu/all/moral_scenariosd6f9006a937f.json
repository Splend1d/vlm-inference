This action could damage the phone and is also disrespectful and deceitful.\n\nIn Scenario 2, loaning your stepsister a fur coat knowing that PETA will be present at the event is not necessarily morally wrong. While PETA may disapprove of wearing fur, the decision to wear or not wear fur is a personal one, and lending the coat does not inherently involve harm to others. It could be seen as supporting unethical treatment of animals by some, but it does not directly harm another person in the way that Scenario 1 does."
