Animals have inherent worth which entitles them to the absolute right to live their lives with respect and autonomy.\n\nTom Regan, a philosopher known for his work on animal rights, argued that animals are \"subjects-of-a-life,\" meaning they have beliefs, desires, memories, a sense of future, and more. Because of this, he believed that animals have inherent value and therefore possess moral rights, including the right to live their lives without unwarranted human interference. This perspective contrasts with utilitarian views that might justify harm to animals if it leads to greater overall happiness. Regan's view is often described as a form of \"sentient anthropomorphism\" because it attributes to animals some of the characteristics traditionally associated with humans. However, it should be noted that Regan himself did not use the term \"sentimental anthropomorphicism\"; this term is not commonly used in discussions of his philosophy."
