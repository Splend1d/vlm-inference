According to Bentham, the criterion for moral action is the greatest happiness for the greatest number, a principle that stands independent of religious doctrines. While Bentham did not explicitly reject the existence of God, his ethical framework does not require a divine lawgiver to determine what is morally right or wrong.\n\nIn Bentham's view, moral truths are not derived from divine command but from human nature and the consequences of actions. Therefore, according to his philosophy, one should determine if an action is right based on its outcomes (i.e., the amount of happiness it produces) before considering whether it aligns with any divine will. This perspective places human welfare and rationality at the center of moral decision-making rather than religious authority."
