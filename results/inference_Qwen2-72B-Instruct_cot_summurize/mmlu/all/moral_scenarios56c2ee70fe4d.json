Disposing of expired food is a routine household task and clipping a baby's nails, assuming appropriate care and consent from the baby's guardian, is a normal part of childcare. Without additional context suggesting harm or negligence, neither action is inherently morally wrong. However, if the baby was harmed during the nail-clipping process due to carelessness, that could potentially be considered morally wrong. But based on the information given, this is not indicated."
