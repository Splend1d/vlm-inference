                    "text": "The correct answer is D. 1 \u2013 P(X = 0).\n\nThis question involves understanding the concept of binomial probability and complementary probability.\n\nGiven that the probability of a child developing cavities before turning 10 is approximately 2 in 7 (or roughly 0.286), we can use this information to calculate probabilities for a sample of 5 children using the binomial distribution formula. However, calculating the probability for each case where at least one child develops a cavity (X = 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5) would be cumbersome. Instead, it's easier to find the probability of the complementary event (no children develop cavities) and subtract it from 1.\n\nLet p be the probability of success (developing cavities) and q = 1 - p be the probability of failure (not developing cavities). Here, p \u2248 2/7 \u2248 0.286 and q \u2248 5/7 \u2248 0.714.\n\nThe probability of no children developing cavities (X = 0) in a group of 5 can be calculated as:\n\\[P(X=0) = q^5\\]\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\\[P(X=0) = (0.714)^5\\]\n\nTo find the probability of at least one child developing cavities, we use the complement rule:\n\\[P(X \\geq 1) = 1 - P(X = 0)\\]\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is D. 1 \u2013 P(X = 0)."
