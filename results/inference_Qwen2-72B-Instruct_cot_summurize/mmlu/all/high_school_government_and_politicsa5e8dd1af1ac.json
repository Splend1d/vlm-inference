I and III only\n\nExplanation: A president often experiences a reduction in political power during the final two years of his or her second term (I) due to what is known as \"lame duck\" status, where they have less influence because they will not be running for re-election. When different parties control Congress and the White House (III), it can lead to gridlock and difficulty passing legislation, thus reducing the president's political power. Circumstances II and IV do not necessarily reduce the president's political power; in fact, they could potentially increase it if the president successfully handles the crises or takes credit for a strong economy."
