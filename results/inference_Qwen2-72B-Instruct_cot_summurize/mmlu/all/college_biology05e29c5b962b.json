These conditions include:\n\nB. The population size is large.\nC. There is no natural selection acting on the alleles in question.\nD. Mating is random.\n\nHowever, one of the conditions that would disrupt Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium is gene flow, which is the exchange of genes between populations due to migration. This condition is listed as:\n\nA. Genes are exchanged with other populations.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer to the question is A, because the Hardy-Weinberg law cannot operate if there is gene flow between populations, but it requires the other conditions (B, C, and D) to be met for the law to hold true."
