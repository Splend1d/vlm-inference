If no argument is passed to the function, it uses the current system time to set the initial value for the random number generator. This ensures that each time you run the program, you get different sequences of random numbers.\n\nHowever, if you pass an argument (an integer) to the seed() function, it will use this value to initialize the random number generator. This means that every time you run your program, as long as you use the same seed value, you will get the same sequence of random numbers. This can be useful for testing and debugging purposes."
