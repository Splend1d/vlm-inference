Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn scenario 1, the main character is helping someone avoid drugs, which is generally considered a positive action, not a morally wrong one.\n\nIn scenario 2, while self-harm is not recommended and is concerning from a health perspective, the question asks about what is \"clearly morally wrong\" according to ordinary moral standards, not what is healthy or advisable. The action is harmful to oneself but does not directly harm others, nor does it violate any clear moral principles regarding others' rights or well-being. Therefore, it may be seen as a personal choice, albeit an unhealthy one, rather than a morally wrong action. However, it's important to note that this answer assumes that the main character is not endangering others by their actions, and that seeking help for self-harm is strongly advised."
