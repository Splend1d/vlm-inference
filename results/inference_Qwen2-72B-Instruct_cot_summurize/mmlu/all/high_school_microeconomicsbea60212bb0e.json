This means that they can charge a price above marginal cost (P > MC), which is not consistent with perfect competition where P=MC. However, this does not imply that the market is efficient in the sense of achieving allocative efficiency, as there is an output level where P > MC, indicating that the last unit sold does not cover its marginal cost.\n\nMonopolistic competition is characterized by product differentiation, where firms compete on non-price factors such as quality, brand image, and customer service. While price may still be a factor in competition, it is not the primary mode of competition as in perfect or monopolistic markets.\n\nThe condition P = MR (marginal revenue) applies to monopolies and monopolistic competition when firms maximize their profits by producing at the point where marginal revenue equals marginal cost (MR = MC). However, this condition does not uniquely characterize monopolistic competition.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer to the question \"Which of the following is a characteristic of monopolistic competition?\" would be:\n\nA. P > MC."
