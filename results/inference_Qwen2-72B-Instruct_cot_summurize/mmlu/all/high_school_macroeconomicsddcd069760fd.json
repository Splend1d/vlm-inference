                    "text": "The reserve ratio can be calculated by dividing the required reserves by the total deposits. In this case, the bank is required to reserve $50 out of $500 in checking deposits.\n\nReserve Ratio = Required Reserves / Total Deposits\n\nReserve Ratio = $50 / $500 = 0.1 or 10%\n\nTo find the excess reserves, we subtract the required reserves from the actual reserves held by the bank. Since we only know the required reserves ($50), we'll assume that the bank holds at least this amount. If the bank is holding exactly $50 as reserves, then it has no excess reserves because it's meeting the minimum requirement. However, if the question implies that the bank is holding more than the required reserves, we need additional information to determine the exact amount of excess reserves.\n\nGiven the options provided, it seems that the question assumes the bank is holding exactly $50 as reserves, which means there are no excess reserves beyond the $50 required. But since the question asks for excess reserves and all options include an amount, we'll interpret \"excess reserves\" here as simply the difference between total deposits and required reserves, which isn't a typical use of the term \"excess reserves.\"\n\nTherefore, the correct answer based on the information given and the options available would be:\n\nD. 10 percent $50 in excess reserves\n\nHowever, it's important to note that under normal circumstances, if a bank has exactly $50 in reserves when $50 is required, it has no excess reserves. The term \"excess reserves\" refers to reserves held above the required level."
