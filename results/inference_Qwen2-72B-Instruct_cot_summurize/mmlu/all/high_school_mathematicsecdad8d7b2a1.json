If the skater spins 2250 degrees to her right, we can find out how many full rotations she makes by dividing 2250 by 360.\n\n\\[ 2250 \\div 360 = 6.25 \\]\n\nThis means the skater completes 6 full rotations and has an additional 0.25 of a rotation left. Since 0.25 of 360 degrees is 90 degrees, the skater will have spun an extra 90 degrees beyond her final full rotation.\n\nStarting from facing north and spinning to her right:\n\n- After 1 full rotation (360 degrees), she would be facing north again.\n- After 2 full rotations (720 degrees), she would still be facing north.\n- After 3 full rotations (1080 degrees), she would still be facing north.\n- After 4 full rotations (1440 degrees), she would still be facing north.\n- After 5 full rotations (1800 degrees), she would still be facing north.\n- After 6 full rotations (2160 degrees), she would still be facing north.\n- After an additional 90 degrees, she would be facing east.\n\nTherefore, after spinning 2250 degrees to her right, the skater would be facing east.\n\nThe correct answer is B. east."
