An act is jure imperii when undertaken in an official State capacity.\n\nActs jure imperii refer to acts performed by a state in its sovereign capacity, such as legislative, administrative, or judicial actions. These acts are distinguished from acts jure gestionis, which are commercial or private law activities that a state might undertake. Acts jure imperii often enjoy immunity from the jurisdiction of foreign courts under the principle of state immunity."
