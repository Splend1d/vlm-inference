A monoclonal antiserum contains antibodies secreted from the descendants of a single B lymphocyte; a polyclonal antiserum contains antibodies secreted from the descendants of different B lymphocytes.\n\nThis distinction highlights the fundamental difference between monoclonal and polyclonal antisera. Monoclonal antisera come from a single clone of cells (typically a hybridoma), which ensures that all the antibodies produced are identical and target the same epitope on an antigen. In contrast, polyclonal antisera are generated by stimulating an animal's immune system with an antigen, leading to the activation of multiple B cell clones, each producing antibodies against different epitopes of the antigen."
