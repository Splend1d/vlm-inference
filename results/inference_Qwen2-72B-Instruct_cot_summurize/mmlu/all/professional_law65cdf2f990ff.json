A pedestrian walked through the general vicinity but he avoided the unloading area. One of the workers pulled the wrong lever and a load of commercial refrigerators crashed into the street, causing a rumbling tremor in the road. The tremor caused a heavy box to fall off of a parked truck that was about 30 yards away from the loading dock. It fell on the pedestrian, causing serious injury. The pedestrian sued the appliance store for negligence, and the store defended on the basis that it could not foresee such an accident and that the tremor and the box that fell were superseding acts. Will the pedestrian likely survive the store's motion to dismiss pedestrian's lawsuit for damages.\n\nA. No, the plaintiff clearly assumed the risk by entering a dangerous loading/unloading area.\nB. No, because the plaintiff in effect became a trespasser when he walked into a dangerous loading/unloading area.\nC. Yes, because the plaintiff pedestrian had a right to be where he was and there were no signs telling him otherwise.\nD. Yes, because the chain of causation was generally foreseeable in that it was a logical consequence of a truckload of appliances falling violently onto the road.\n"

Yes, because the chain of causation was generally foreseeable in that it was a logical consequence of a truckload of appliances falling violently onto the road.\n\nThe appliance store had a duty to ensure the safety of the public in areas adjacent to their loading dock, especially since they were using a public alley. The fact that the pedestrian was not in the immediate unloading area does not absolve the store of liability if their actions created a hazard that led to the pedestrian's injury. The store's argument that the tremor and the falling box were superseding acts may not hold up if it can be shown that these events were reasonably foreseeable consequences of improperly securing a load during unloading. The pedestrian's presence in the general vicinity, without any warning of potential danger, suggests that the store failed to take adequate precautions to prevent harm to passersby."
