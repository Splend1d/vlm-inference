Du Bois believed that progress for African Americans in the aftermath of slavery largely depended on (A) the small group of African Americans receiving the same thorough and extensive education as the most talented white Americans were able to access. He argued that this \"talented tenth\" would then lead the rest of the community to greater social and economic advancement.\n\nDu Bois was critical of Booker T. Washington's more vocational approach to education, which he felt was akin to option (C), where African Americans were trained primarily for manual labor and service jobs. Du Bois saw this as limiting the potential of African Americans and perpetuating racial inequality. Instead, he advocated for a broad and liberal education that would prepare African Americans for leadership roles in society."
