HIV/AIDS is considered a non-traditional security issue because it poses a threat to human security, economic security, and political stability. It can undermine a country's ability to maintain a healthy workforce, reduce economic productivity, increase healthcare costs, and lead to social instability. Therefore, it requires a comprehensive response that goes beyond traditional military or political approaches to security."
