His birth weight was 3500 g (7 lb 11 oz), and Apgar scores were 8 and 10 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. At the age of 15 months, physical examination showed no abnormalities, but he was not yet talking. Both of his parents had learning difficulties in school, and his mother stopped attending after the 10th grade. He has a maternal uncle with cognitive disabilities. He is at the 25th percentile for height, 15th percentile for weight, and 90th percentile for head circumference. He appears irritable, he resists making eye contact, and he is flapping his hands. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's condition?\n\nA. Frameshift mutation\nB. Missense mutation\nC. Nonsense mutation\nD. Trinucleotide repeat expansion\n"

                    "text": "The patient's symptoms, including delayed speech, irritability, avoidance of eye contact, hand flapping, and a family history of learning difficulties and cognitive disabilities, are suggestive of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). While genetic factors play a significant role in ASD, it is important to note that ASD can result from various genetic mechanisms.\n\nGiven the options provided:\n\nA. Frameshift mutation: This type of mutation occurs when there is an insertion or deletion of nucleotides in a gene that shifts the reading frame, leading to a completely different amino acid sequence downstream of the mutation. While frameshift mutations can contribute to genetic disorders, they are not specifically associated with ASD.\n\nB. Missense mutation: This type of mutation results in a single amino acid change in a protein. It can affect protein function and lead to disease, but like frameshift mutations, it is not specifically associated with ASD.\n\nC. Nonsense mutation: This type of mutation leads to a premature stop codon, causing the protein to be truncated and often nonfunctional. Again, while it can contribute to genetic disorders, it is not specifically linked to ASD.\n\nD. Trinucleotide repeat expansion: This type of mutation involves the expansion of a trinucleotide repeat within a gene beyond the normal range. Certain expansions are known to cause specific genetic disorders. One such example is the Fragile X syndrome, which is caused by an expansion of a CGG repeat in the FMR1 gene and is characterized by intellectual disability, behavioral problems, and sometimes autistic features. Considering the patient's clinical presentation and family history, this option seems the most plausible cause of his condition.\n\nTherefore, the most likely cause of this patient's condition is D. Trinucleotide repeat expansion, potentially indicating a diagnosis such as Fragile X syndrome. However, further genetic testing would be necessary to confirm this diagnosis."
