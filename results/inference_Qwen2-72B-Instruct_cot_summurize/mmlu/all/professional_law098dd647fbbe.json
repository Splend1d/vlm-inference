At trial, the manufacturer has called as an expert witness a product safety engineer, who testifies that the manufacturer retained him for a fee to test identical mowers and, if his opinion was helpful, to testify in the case. The expert then testifies that he did test the mowers, and that the blade, as designed and installed by the manufacturer, could not fly off in the manner claimed by the plaintiff. Assume that the expert has used a reliable method for reaching his conclusion. Should the court admit the expert's testimony?\n\nA. No, because it goes to an ultimate issue that only the jury can decide.\nB. No, because the manufacturer paid the expert to render a certain opinion, in violation of rules barring paid testimony. violation of rules barring paid testimony.\nC. Yes, because expert testimony on such issues of causation is relevant and helpful to the jury.\nD. Yes, provided that the plaintiff had notice and an opportunity to participate in the testing process.\n"

Yes, because expert testimony on such issues of causation is relevant and helpful to the jury.\n\nExpert testimony can be admitted if it is relevant and will assist the trier of fact (the jury) in understanding the evidence or determining a fact in issue. In this case, the expert's testimony about the reliability of the mower's design and whether the blade could fly off as claimed by the plaintiff is directly relevant to the issue of whether the mower was defectively designed and caused the plaintiff's injury. The fact that the expert was hired and compensated by the manufacturer does not automatically disqualify the testimony, as long as the methods used by the expert are scientifically valid and the expert's compensation is disclosed to the jury, which can consider it in assessing the weight and credibility of the testimony. Option D is also worth considering, but the primary reason for admitting the testimony is its relevance and helpfulness, making option C the most accurate answer."
