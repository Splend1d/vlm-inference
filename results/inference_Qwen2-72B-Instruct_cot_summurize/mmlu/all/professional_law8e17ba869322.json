One afternoon while the judge was mowing his lawn, the father decided to avenge his son's conviction. The father set up his water sprinkler behind some shrubbery separating their adjoining properties. As the judge was mowing his lawn and came within reach of the water sprinkler, the father turned on the sprinkling device. The judge did not see the water coming toward him. The water hit the judge in the back and drenched him. The judge would be able to recover against the father for which of the following tort or torts?\n\nA. Negligence and battery.\nB. Battery and assault.\nC. Negligence and assault.\nD. Battery and trespass to land.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is B. Battery and assault.\n\nBattery is the intentional and offensive contact with another person without consent. In this case, the father intentionally turned on the water sprinkler to hit the judge with water, which can be considered offensive contact.\n\nAssault, on the other hand, is the intentional creation of a reasonable apprehension of imminent harmful or offensive contact. Here, although the judge did not see the water coming, the father's action created a situation where the judge could reasonably have been apprehensive about being hit by water if he had seen the sprinkler being turned on.\n\nNegligence does not apply here because it involves unintentional harm due to a failure to exercise reasonable care, whereas the father's actions were intentional. Trespass to land also does not apply since the water hitting the judge does not constitute a trespass to the judge's property but rather an assault and battery upon the judge's person."
