The man called a towing company and told the company's manager that the car was 100 feet down the embankment. \"That's lucky,\" said the manager, \"because our winch only goes 100 feet.\" After the manager and the man agreed on a price, an employee of the company attempted to reach the car but could not because the car turned out to be 120 feet down the embankment. Is the towing company's performance excused on the grounds of mistake?\n\nA. No, because both parties were uncertain about the distance.\nB. No, because the towing company assumed the risk by the manager's failure to examine the distance himself.\nC. Yes, because at the time of contracting, both parties were mistaken about a basic assumption on which the contract was based.\nD. Yes, because the agreement did not allocate the risk of mistake to either party.\n"

Yes, because at the time of contracting, both parties were mistaken about a basic assumption on which the contract was based.\n\nIn this scenario, the basic assumption that underpinned the contract was that the car was 100 feet down the embankment, which would allow the towing company to use its winch effectively. However, it turned out that the car was actually 120 feet down the embankment, making the towing company's equipment insufficient for the task as initially understood. Both parties were mistaken about this fact at the time of contracting, which can potentially excuse the towing company's non-performance if the contract does not specifically allocate the risk of such a mistake to either party. Since option D suggests that the risk of mistake was not allocated in the agreement, option C is the more precise answer. However, it is important to note that the exact legal outcome would depend on the specific terms of the contract and applicable law."
