This means that the occurrence of event A does not change the probability of event B occurring, and vice versa. The correct statement regarding independent events is:\n\nA. P(A and B) = P(A) \u00b7 P(B)\n\nThis formula states that the probability of both A and B happening (the intersection of A and B) is equal to the product of their individual probabilities.\n\nRegarding the other options:\nB. Whether A and B are mutually exclusive or not is unrelated to their independence. Two events can be independent and mutually exclusive (though this would imply one or both have a probability of 0, which contradicts the given that they have nonzero probabilities), or independent and not mutually exclusive.\nC. Independent events are not necessarily mutually exclusive. In fact, if A and B are independent and both have a nonzero probability, they cannot be mutually exclusive because P(A and B) would not be 0.\nD. P(A|B) represents the conditional probability of A given that B has occurred, while P(B|A) is the conditional probability of B given that A has occurred. For independent events, these are equal to the unconditional probabilities P(A) and P(B), respectively, but it does not mean P(A|B) equals P(B|A) in general; it only holds true for independent events when both are equal to P(A) and P(B). However, this statement is not as directly related to the definition of independence as option A is.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A."
