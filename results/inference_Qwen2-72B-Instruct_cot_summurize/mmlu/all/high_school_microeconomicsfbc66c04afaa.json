Conversely, when the demand for a good rises, more buyers enter the market or existing buyers want more, which also tends to push prices up due to increased competition for the good.\n\nIn this case, since both supply is falling and demand is rising, we know that the price will definitely rise because both events have the effect of increasing the price. However, the effect on the quantity sold is less clear.\n\nIf demand increases enough to offset the decrease in supply, then the quantity sold could increase. On the other hand, if supply decreases significantly relative to the increase in demand, the quantity sold might decrease. This is because even though more people want to buy roses (increased demand), there simply aren't enough roses to meet that demand (decreased supply).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Price rises, but the change in quantity is ambiguous."
