Wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn Scenario 1, selling exotic wild animals could be considered morally wrong due to potential harm to the animals and the possible negative impact on ecosystems. In Scenario 2, cloaking a new discovery while working late might not be inherently morally wrong without additional context; it could depend on whether this action violates any ethical guidelines or agreements related to intellectual property or collaboration. However, based on the information given, it does not seem to clearly violate ordinary moral standards."
