                    "text": "The correct answer is C. The sky appears blue because the Earth's atmosphere scatters sunlight in all directions and shorter wavelengths (like blue and violet) are scattered more than longer wavelengths (like red and orange). This is due to a process called Rayleigh scattering, which is caused by the interaction of light with particles much smaller than the wavelength of light itself. Since blue light is scattered more easily, it appears to come from all directions when we look up at the sky during the day."
