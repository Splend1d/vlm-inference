N \u2283 P\n\nWe need to find an immediate (one-step) consequence of these premises.\n\nLet's examine each option:\n\nA. P: This cannot be an immediate consequence because none of the premises directly entail P without additional information.\n\nB. N \u2283 ~O: This could potentially be derived from premise 2 if we knew P to be true, but since we do not have that information, it cannot be an immediate consequence.\n\nC. O \u2228 Q: This can be an immediate consequence if we know that (N \u2283 ~O) is true. By looking at premise 1, we see that (N \u2283 ~O) \u2283 (O \u2228 Q). If we can establish that (N \u2283 ~O) is true, then by modus ponens, we can conclude (O \u2228 Q). To establish that (N \u2283 ~O) is true, we look at premise 2, which states that P \u2283 (N \u2283 ~O). If we can show that P is true, then by modus ponens, we can conclude (N \u2283 ~O), and thus (O \u2228 Q).\n\nTo determine whether P is true, we look at premise 3, N \u2283 P. If N is true, then by modus ponens, we can conclude P. However, we do not have any information about the truth value of N. But we don't actually need to know the truth value of N for this particular deduction. We just need to know that if N were true, then P would follow from premise 3, and then (N \u2283 ~O) would follow from premise 2, allowing us to conclude (O \u2228 Q) from premise 1.\n\nD. ~P: There is no way to derive ~P as an immediate consequence from the given premises.\n\nGiven the premises, the only immediate consequence we can derive with certainty is (O \u2228 Q), assuming we can establish (N \u2283 ~O) through P being true, which is possible given premise 3 and the potential truth of N.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC.
