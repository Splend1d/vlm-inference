R (the set of real numbers) is uncountably infinite and has a cardinality of \\(\\mathfrak{c}\\), where \\(\\mathfrak{c} = 2^{\\aleph_0}\\).\n\nB. The set of all functions from \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\) to \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\). Since both \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\) and \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\) have countably infinite cardinality (\\(\\aleph_0\\)), the set of all functions from one to the other can be represented as \\(\\mathbb{Z}^\\mathbb{Z}\\). The cardinality of this set is \\(\\aleph_0^{\\aleph_0}\\), which is equal to \\(2^{\\aleph_0}\\), the same cardinality as the continuum (\\(\\mathfrak{c}\\)).\n\nC. The set of all functions from \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) to \\(\\{0, 1\\}\\). This set is essentially the power set of \\(\\mathbb{R}\\), because for every real number, you're choosing whether to include it in a subset or not (represented by 0 or 1). The cardinality of the power set of a set with cardinality \\(\\mathfrak{c}\\) is \\(2^{\\mathfrak{c}}\\), which is strictly greater than \\(\\mathfrak{c}\\) due to Cantor's theorem.\n\nD. The set of all finite subsets of \\(\\mathbb{R}\\). This set includes all possible combinations of finite numbers of real numbers. While it might seem large, its cardinality is still \\(\\mathfrak{c}\\). To see why, consider that any finite subset of \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) can be listed in an order (even if non-unique) and thus can be represented by a finite sequence of real numbers. The set of all finite sequences of real numbers has the same cardinality as \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) itself, because you can map each finite sequence to a single real number using a method similar to the diagonal argument used to show that the rationals are countable (though adapted for real numbers and sequences).\n\nThus, comparing these cardinalities:\n\n- A and B have cardinality \\(\\mathfrak{c}\\).\n- C has cardinality \\(2^{\\mathfrak{c}}\\).\n- D also has cardinality \\(\\mathfrak{c}\\).\n\nTherefore, the set with the greatest cardinality is **C**, the set of all functions from \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) to \\(\\{0, 1\\}\\), with a cardinality of \\(2^{\\mathfrak{c}}\\)."
