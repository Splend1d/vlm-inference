This means that the state must show that its classification serves a \"compelling state interest\" and is narrowly tailored to achieve that interest. Given that the statute in question denies non-citizenship candidates for a J.D. degree access to non-interest-bearing loans, it would need to meet this high standard to be upheld as constitutional. It is likely that the court would find such a statute unconstitutional unless the state can demonstrate a very strong justification for the alienage-based discrimination."
