This is because the patient is unable to eat due to post-surgical nausea and vomiting, and thus cannot receive adequate nutrition orally or via enteral routes such as a nasogastric feeding tube (option B). Peripheral hyperalimentation can provide the necessary nutrients intravenously until the patient's gastrointestinal function recovers. Central hyperalimentation (option A) might also be an option but it carries more risks and complications compared to peripheral hyperalimentation, and is typically reserved for patients who require long-term parenteral nutrition or have conditions that preclude the use of a peripheral line. An oral fat-free modular diet (option C) would not be suitable since the patient is unable to eat."
