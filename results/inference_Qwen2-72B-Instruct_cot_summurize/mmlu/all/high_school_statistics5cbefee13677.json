Larger samples tend to provide more precise estimates, leading to narrower confidence intervals. A lower level of confidence (e.g., 95% compared to 99%) also results in a narrower interval because you're accepting a higher margin of error.\n\nGiven these factors:\n\n- A larger sample size narrows the confidence interval.\n- A lower confidence level (95% vs. 99%) also narrows the confidence interval.\n\nThus, among the options given, **C. Large sample size and 95% confidence** would result in the narrowest confidence interval."
