The ability to count or compare the number of occurrences of symbols in a string requires more memory than a finite automaton has access to. Therefore, it's not possible for a regular expression to describe all bit strings with more ones than zeros since such a description would require keeping track of the counts of both ones and zeros throughout the entire string.\n\nA, B, and C can all be described by regular expressions:\n\nA. You can create a regular expression that matches any string of zeros that is a multiple of five long, followed by any number of ones and zeros.\nB. This can be described as a zero followed by any sequence of ones and zeros, ending in a one.\nC. An even number of zeros can be described using a regular expression that matches pairs of zeros, possibly interspersed with ones."
