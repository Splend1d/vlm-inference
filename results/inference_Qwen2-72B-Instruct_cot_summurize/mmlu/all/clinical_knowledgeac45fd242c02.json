A low blood pressure (<90mmHg systolic) and a tachycardia (>100/min) are worrying features\n\nThis is true because these signs can indicate significant blood loss, which is a potential complication of haematemesis (vomiting blood). Haematemesis can be a sign of serious upper gastrointestinal bleeding, and a drop in blood pressure or an increase in heart rate can signal that the patient is becoming hemodynamically unstable. The other options are either incorrect or not universally true for all cases of haematemesis."
