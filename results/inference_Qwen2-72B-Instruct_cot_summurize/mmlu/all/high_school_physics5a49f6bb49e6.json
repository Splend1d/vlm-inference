                    "text": "The key to solving this problem is recognizing that the motion of the ball can be broken down into two components: one horizontal and one vertical. The horizontal component of the velocity will be increased by the truck's velocity, but the vertical component will not be affected.\n\nLet's break down the initial velocity of the ball into its horizontal and vertical components:\n\n- Horizontal velocity (Vx) = V * cos(\u03b8) + 5 m/s\n- Vertical velocity (Vy) = V * sin(\u03b8)\n\nwhere V is the muzzle velocity (50 m/s), \u03b8 is the angle of the cannon above the horizontal, and the additional 5 m/s comes from the truck's velocity.\n\nThe time it takes for the ball to reach its maximum height and then fall back to the ground can be calculated using the formula for the vertical component of the motion:\n\n- Time to peak height (t_peak) = Vy / g\n\nwhere g is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.8 m/s^2).\n\nThe total time in the air (t_total) is twice the time to peak height because the ball spends an equal amount of time going up as it does coming down:\n\n- t_total = 2 * t_peak\n\nThe distance the ball travels horizontally can then be calculated by multiplying the total time in the air by the horizontal velocity:\n\n- Distance (D) = Vx * t_total\n\nSubstituting the expressions for Vx, Vy, and t_total gives:\n\n- D = (V * cos(\u03b8) + 5) * (2 * (V * sin(\u03b8)) / g)\n\nTo find the angle that maximizes the distance, we need to take the derivative of D with respect to \u03b8 and set it equal to zero. However, without calculus, we can use a simpler approach by recognizing that the optimal angle for projectile motion is generally 45 degrees when there is no horizontal velocity added (i.e., when the truck is stationary). When the truck is moving, the optimal angle shifts slightly towards the horizontal, but since the truck's velocity is much smaller than the ball's muzzle velocity, the effect is small.\n\nGiven the options provided:\n\nA. 5\u00b0 - This angle is too low to maximize the range.\nB. 41\u00b0 - This angle is close to 45\u00b0, which might be correct given the added horizontal velocity from the truck.\nC. 45\u00b0 - This is the standard optimal angle for projectile motion without the additional horizontal velocity.\nD. 49\u00b0 - This angle is higher than 45\u00b0 and would likely result in a shorter range.\n\nSince the truck's velocity adds to the horizontal component of the ball's velocity, the optimal angle will be slightly less than 45\u00b0 to compensate. Without doing the full calculation, B. 41\u00b0 seems like the best choice among the given options. However, a precise calculation would require knowing how the truck's velocity affects the optimal angle, which isn't straightforward without more information or doing the full calculus-based derivation."
