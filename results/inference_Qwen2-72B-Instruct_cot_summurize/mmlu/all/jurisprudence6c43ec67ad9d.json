However, Hart also argued that the validity of a law does not necessarily imply its moral correctness, and that a legal system can exist without embodying any particular set of moral principles. He criticized Fuller's view that there are inherent moral principles that must be embodied in a legal system for it to be a genuine legal system. In Hart's opinion, the existence of a legal system is a matter of social fact, and its rules can be identified through the practices of officials who recognize them as authoritative standards."
