                    "text": "To determine how sure we can be that between 60% and 68% of the electorate were still undecided, we need to calculate the confidence interval for the proportion of undecided voters. The point estimate for the proportion of undecided voters is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\hat{p} = \\frac{x}{n}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(x\\) is the number of successes (in this case, undecided voters) and \\(n\\) is the total number of trials (registered voters surveyed). In this case, \\(x = 256\\) and \\(n = 400\\), so\n\n\\[\n\\hat{p} = \\frac{256}{400} = 0.64\n\\]\n\nThe standard error of the proportion is given by:\n\n\\[\nSE = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{p}(1-\\hat{p})}{n}}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the values we have:\n\n\\[\nSE = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.64(1-0.64)}{400}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.64*0.36}{400}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.2304}{400}} = \\sqrt{0.000576} = 0.024\n\\]\n\nNow we can construct the confidence interval using the standard normal distribution (Z-distribution) because the sample size is large (\\(n > 30\\)). We want to find out if 60% and 68% fall within the confidence interval around our point estimate.\n\nLet's say we are looking for a 95% confidence interval. The Z-score for a 95% confidence interval is approximately 1.96 (from the standard normal table).\n\nThe margin of error (ME) is then:\n\n\\[\nME = Z * SE = 1.96 * 0.024 = 0.04704\n\\]\n\nSo, the 95% confidence interval is:\n\n\\[\n\\hat{p} \\pm ME = 0.64 \\pm 0.04704\n\\]\n\nThis gives us:\n\n\\[\n0.64 - 0.04704 = 0.59296 \\approx 59.3\\%\n\\]\n\\[\n0.64 + 0.04704 = 0.68704 \\approx 68.7\\%\n\\]\n\nTherefore, with 95% confidence, we can say that the true proportion of undecided voters is between about 59.3% and 68.7%. Since 60% and 68% both fall within this interval, we can indeed be quite confident that the true percentage of undecided voters falls within that range.\n\nHowever, none of the answer choices directly correspond to the confidence level (95%). The question seems to be asking for the probability that the true proportion falls between 60% and 68%, which we have calculated indirectly by showing that these percentages fall within the 95% confidence interval based on the data provided. \n\nThe closest answer choice to indicate a high level of confidence that the true proportion falls within the specified range is D. 90.4%, but it's important to note that this choice does not precisely represent the calculation performed here, which corresponds more closely to a 95% confidence level. The options provided do not exactly match the methodology used in calculating confidence intervals based on the standard normal distribution."
