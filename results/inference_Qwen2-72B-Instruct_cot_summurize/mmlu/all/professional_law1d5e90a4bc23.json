On a busy day, three of his partners had clients waiting to see them, and all of the chairs in the office waiting room were filled. A woman had an appointment with the attorney, and the attorney came out to greet her in the crowded waiting room. As the woman saw the attorney she said, \"Am I glad to see you! I need a will made up right away, because I don't want my rotten son to get any of my money. He will just throw it away at the race track. \" The attorney replied, \"Let's go back to my office to discuss this matter. \" The attorney prepared a will for the woman.\nB. A woman arrived at a law office for an appointment and was escorted to her attorney's office. She sat down and said to the attorney, \"You know, I pay you a large retainer every year for your valued counsel. I need some advice now. There was a fire in my house yesterday. It was minor, but I'm covered for $15,000 under my fire insurance policy. I didn't have any furniture in the room where the fire took place, but I want to put in a claim for a sofa and love seat. How should I go about it?\" The attorney refused to give her any advice.\nC. A woman engaged an attorney to represent her in adoption proceedings. During the course of his representation, she told the attorney some very personal facts about her lifestyle that the attorney needed in order to prepare a petition for adoption. The adoption took place, but the woman never paid her agreed fee to the attorney. The attorney sued the woman to collect his fee.\nD. A woman consulted an attorney regarding a sale of 70% of the stock of a closely held corporation in which the woman was the majority shareholder. She explained the reason for the sale and divulged the financial condition of the corporation and its prospects for the future. The attorney determined that the transaction would be complicated. Since he felt he was inexperienced in handling such a transaction, the attorney decided to decline to represent the woman. The woman nevertheless sold her stock with the assistance of another attorney.\n"

The conversation between the woman and her attorney in the crowded waiting room is protected by the attorney-client privilege. Even though there were other people present, the communication was made in the context of seeking legal advice from the attorney.\n\nC. The personal facts disclosed by the woman to her attorney during the adoption proceedings are protected by the attorney-client privilege. This privilege continues even after the representation has ended and applies to any information shared for the purpose of obtaining legal advice or services.\n\nD. The information shared by the woman with the attorney regarding the sale of the stock of the closely held corporation is also protected by the attorney-client privilege. The fact that the attorney ultimately declined to represent her does not affect the privilege, as the communication was made for the purpose of seeking legal advice.\n\nB. The attorney-client privilege does not apply in situation B. Although the woman sought legal advice from her attorney, the attorney did not provide any advice. However, the privilege could potentially still apply to any information she may have shared before the attorney refused to give advice, as long as it was communicated for the purpose of obtaining legal advice. In this case, since no specific privileged communication is mentioned beyond the woman's request for advice, it is unclear if any privilege would apply specifically to this interaction. Nonetheless, any prior confidential communications related to seeking legal advice would still be privileged."
