There is a rearrangement \\(a_{i_k}\\) of the terms such that \\(\\sum a_{i_k} = 4\\).\n\nThis statement is **True**. The condition that \\(\\sum |a_i|\\) diverges implies that the series \\(\\sum a_i\\) is not absolutely convergent. In a non-absolutely convergent series, rearranging the terms can change the sum to any real number or even make it diverge. This property is known as Riemann's rearrangement theorem. Therefore, there exists a rearrangement of the terms such that the sum equals 4.\n\n### Statement 2\n\nThere exists metric spaces \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) with \\(X\\) closed and bounded and a continuous mapping \\(f: X \\to Y\\) such that \\(f(X)\\) is NOT \"closed and bounded\".\n\nThis statement is **True**. In general, a continuous image of a closed set may not be closed, and a continuous image of a bounded set may not be bounded in arbitrary metric spaces. However, if we consider \\(X\\) to be compact (which is equivalent to being closed and bounded in Euclidean spaces), then \\(f(X)\\) will be compact in \\(Y\\) (since the continuous image of a compact set is compact), which implies that \\(f(X)\\) is closed and bounded in \\(Y\\) if \\(Y\\) is a subset of \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\). But for more general metric spaces, this need not hold true. For instance, consider the open interval \\((0, 1)\\) as a metric space under the standard metric. Let \\(X = [0, 1]\\), which is closed and bounded in \\((0, 1)\\) equipped with the standard metric, and let \\(f: X \\to (0, 1)\\) be defined by \\(f(x) = x/2\\). Then, \\(f(X) = [0, 1/2)\\), which is not closed in \\((0, 1)\\).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. True, True"
