The June, July, and August shipments were delivered on time and duly paid for. Then, on August 16, the lumber mill informed the store that the mill would not be able to meet the September 1 delivery date, because its lumber reserve had been destroyed by a forest fire. The mill then asked the store to excuse the mill from further performance. The store refused and demanded that the remaining shipments be delivered on time. When the September shipment failed to arrive, the store immediately brought suit for breach of contract. How would the court hold?\n\nA. Judgment for the store, because the mill's duties of performance would not be excused.\nB. Judgment for the store, because the mill should have foreseen such a contingency occurring.\nC. Judgment for the mill, because their performance would be discharged by impossibility.\nD. Judgment for the mill, because their performance would be discharged by frustration of purpose.\n"

Judgment for the mill, because their performance would be discharged by impossibility.\n\nIn this scenario, the lumber mill's ability to perform under the contract was rendered impossible due to an unforeseeable event, the forest fire, which destroyed its lumber reserve. Impossibility of performance can discharge a party's duty to perform when an unforeseen event occurs that makes performance objectively impossible and was not caused by the party claiming impossibility. Since the mill could not have foreseen or prevented the forest fire, it is likely that the court would rule in favor of the mill based on the doctrine of impossibility. However, it's important to note that courts also consider whether the affected party took reasonable steps to mitigate the damages or find alternative means of performance. If the mill made no effort to find alternative sources of lumber, the court might rule differently."
