A large shipyard firm has provided the asbestos exposure records of all employees during the past 50 years. The health insurer for the workers has provided claims data that documents all chest x-rays and diagnoses of mesothelioma among current workers and retirees. The study enrolled shipyard workers who were diagnosed with mesothelioma and shipyard workers who were not diagnosed with mesothelioma. All subjects in the study had to have chest xrays. Which of the following is the best rationale for selecting a comparison group that had chest x-rays?\n\nA. Address confounding\nB. Demonstrate causality\nC. Minimize ascertainment bias\nD. Reduce recall bias\n"

Ascertainment bias occurs when there are differences in how information is collected or measured between the study groups, which can lead to incorrect conclusions about the association between exposure and outcome.\n\nIn this case, if the comparison group did not have chest x-rays, it would be possible that some cases of mesothelioma may have been missed in this group due to lack of diagnostic testing. This could lead to an overestimation of the association between asbestos exposure and mesothelioma if only the cases in the exposed group are detected. By ensuring that both the cases and the comparison group have had chest x-rays, the study can reduce the potential for ascertainment bias and provide a more accurate assessment of the relationship between asbestos exposure and mesothelioma."
