                    "text": "The defendant's actions can be analyzed under modern statutory law as follows:\n\n1. **Extortion**: This occurs when someone obtains something of value from another person through the use of force, threats, or intimidation. In this case, the defendant threatened to cause harm (\"beat you to a pulp\") unless he was paid $500 by a specific date. This act of demanding money under threat of violence meets the criteria for extortion.\n\n2. **Battery**: Battery is the intentional and unlawful physical contact with another person that results in harmful or offensive contact. The defendant punched the man in the stomach after taking the money, which qualifies as battery.\n\n3. **Robbery**: Robbery involves the unlawful taking of property from a person through force or fear. However, in this scenario, the defendant did not take the money forcibly or by surprise; the victim willingly handed over the $500 due to the previous threat. Therefore, while there was an element of coercion leading up to the transaction, the actual transfer of the $500 does not fit the typical definition of robbery since it was not taken directly against the victim's immediate will during the encounter.\n\nGiven these definitions, the most likely charges would be:\n\n**A. Extortion and battery.**\n\nThe defendant extorted money from the victim by threatening violence and then followed through with physical harm (battery) after receiving the money. There is no clear evidence of robbery as defined by the use of force or fear to immediately take property from the victim during their encounter."
