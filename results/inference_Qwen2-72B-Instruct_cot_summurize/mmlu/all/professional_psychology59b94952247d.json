Heterosexism refers to the societal privileging of heterosexual relationships as the norm, which can lead to discrimination and violence against those who do not conform to this norm. Bigotry involves prejudice and discrimination against a particular group, in this case, the LGBTQ+ community. Stigmatization involves the labeling and devaluing of individuals based on certain characteristics or behaviors, such as their sexual orientation or gender identity. All of these factors can contribute to an environment where violence against gays and lesbians is more likely to occur."
