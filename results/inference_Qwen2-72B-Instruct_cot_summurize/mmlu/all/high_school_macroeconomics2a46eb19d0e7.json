However, for these exchanges to happen smoothly without the need for a direct trade (e.g., Kevin can't trade shoes directly with Bob because Bob doesn't have what Kevin wants), they need a medium of exchange.\n\nMoney serves as a medium of exchange by allowing individuals to sell their goods or services for money and then use that money to buy what they want from others. In this scenario, if they had money, Kevin could sell his shoes for money, Lisa could sell her turnips for money, and Bob could sell his sheet metal for money. Then, each person could use the money to buy what they want from the others, making the transactions more straightforward and efficient."
