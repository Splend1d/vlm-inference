The high school was severely damaged and needed to be rebuilt. As a consequence, the city council held an emergency meeting to determine what measures should be taken to locate an appropriate alternative facility in which to conduct classes. Thereupon, the city council passed the following resolution: \"During restoration of the high school building, classes shall be conducted at the most suitable facility which submits the lowest bid. In determining a \u0080\u0098suitable' facility, the city council shall consider such factors as location and available classroom space. \"Several bids were submitted. The lowest bid was submitted by a church. The church was located on the same block as the high school and contained sufficient seating capacity for all students. In addition, there were a sufficient number of separate rooms to allow different classes to meet at the same time. The city council voted unanimously to accept the church's offer. Furthermore, the church agreed to remove all religious symbols and paraphernalia from the classrooms utilized by the students. Only the main chapel was exempt, so that it could remain open for prayer. No high school classes or activities were to be held in the main chapel. A parent of one of the high school students is upset at this arrangement. On his son's behalf, the parent has filed suit in federal district court to challenge the constitutionality of permitting public school classes to be held in a church. Judgment for whom?\n\nA. The city, because the classroom arrangement does not inhibit or advance religion.\nB. The city, because the church was the lowest bidder in accordance with the emergency ordinance.\nC. The plaintiff, because the present arrangement for conducting classes in a church-owned facility constitutes excessive entanglement with religion.\nD. The plaintiff, because the emergency measure was not necessary to further a compelling state interest.\n"

The city, because the classroom arrangement does not inhibit or advance religion.\n\nThe city has taken steps to ensure that the use of the church as a temporary educational facility does not promote or inhibit religion. By removing all religious symbols and paraphernalia from the classrooms used by the students, the city has made an effort to maintain a neutral environment. Additionally, the main chapel, where religious symbols may remain, will not be used for any high school classes or activities. This separation helps to prevent the appearance of government endorsement of religion, thus upholding the principle of church-state separation as required by the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.\n\nMoreover, the decision to accept the church's offer as the lowest bidder was based on practical considerations such as location and available classroom space, rather than any religious preference. The city's action was taken out of necessity due to the damage caused by the electrical storm, and the church's bid was determined to be the most suitable under the circumstances. Therefore, the city's actions do not constitute an unconstitutional establishment of religion, and judgment should be in favor of the city."
