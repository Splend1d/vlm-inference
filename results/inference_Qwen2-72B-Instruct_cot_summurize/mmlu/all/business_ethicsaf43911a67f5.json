Virtue ethics\n\nWhile virtue ethics does not necessarily exclude rationality from moral decision-making, it places a significant emphasis on character and emotions as central to ethical behavior. However, none of the options provided perfectly matches the description given. If we were to choose the closest fit based on the given options, virtue ethics would be the answer, but it's important to note that other ethical theories, such as existentialist ethics or some forms of consequentialism, might also emphasize the role of emotions in moral actions. Postmodern ethics typically questions the existence of universal moral truths rather than focusing on emotion or rationality specifically. Ethical egoism focuses on self-interest, and ethics of duty (deontological ethics) emphasizes adherence to rules and duties, both of which do not primarily locate morality in emotional impulses."
