The boyfriend was also an avid baseball fan and had a fanatic devotion to his favorite team. One evening, the boyfriend was watching his beloved team play their archrival on television. His favorite team lost in extra innings. After the game, the boyfriend became despondent and told his girlfriend that he was so disgusted that he was going to kill himself. The boyfriend took one of the pistols from his gun collection and shot himself in the head. As the boyfriend fell to the floor, wounded, his girlfriend couldn't believe her eyes. At first she thought that she should call 911 for an ambulance. But she was afraid that the police might think that she was responsible for the shooting. Consequently, she decided to do nothing. She proceeded to leave the apartment and spent the night at her mother's home. The boyfriend did not immediately die from the gunshot wound. A subsequent medical examiner's report concluded that the boyfriend died from loss of blood approximately two hours after the shooting. If the girlfriend had sought immediate medical assistance, the boyfriend would have lived. The girlfriend is subsequently prosecuted for her boyffiend's death. She should be found\n\nA. guilty of first-degree murder.\nB. guilty of second-degree murder.\nC. guilty of involuntary manslaughter.\nD. not guilty, because she had no legal duty to render assistance.\n"

                    "text": "The girlfriend's actions or lack thereof can be evaluated under the legal principle of \"duty to rescue.\" This principle varies by jurisdiction, but generally, it holds that a person may have a legal duty to assist someone in peril if they are in a special relationship with that person or if they created the peril.\n\nIn this case, the girlfriend and boyfriend were living together, which could potentially establish a special relationship depending on the laws of the state where they lived. Additionally, the girlfriend witnessed the boyfriend's self-inflicted injury and knew that he needed medical attention. By choosing to leave the apartment and not seek help, she failed to act when she could have reasonably provided assistance that might have saved his life.\n\nGiven these circumstances, the girlfriend's actions could be considered gross negligence, as she disregarded the substantial risk to her boyfriend's life by failing to call for help. Gross negligence can be grounds for involuntary manslaughter charges, which typically involve the unintentional killing of another person due to reckless behavior or criminal negligence.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, the most appropriate charge against the girlfriend would likely be:\n\nC. guilty of involuntary manslaughter.\n\nHowever, the actual outcome would depend on the specific laws of the jurisdiction, the evidence presented, and the arguments made by both the prosecution and defense during a trial."
