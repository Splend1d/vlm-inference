I and III only\n\nSubstance abuse during adolescence can lead to pathological changes in the developing brain, particularly in the prefrontal cortex, which is responsible for executive functions such as decision-making, impulse control, and planning. This can result in reduced behavioral impulse control and other cognitive deficits. While substance abuse can increase the risk of hallucinations, especially with certain drugs like cannabis or hallucinogens, it is not necessarily a direct symptom of diminished executive functioning due to prefrontal cortex damage. Therefore, options I and III are the most directly related to the question's context."
