All eight were admitted and diagnosed with psychiatric disorders. Despite their normal behavior, the staff continued to perceive their actions through the lens of mental illness, and they were only discharged after agreeing to take antipsychotic medication. This study highlighted the problems of diagnostic labels and the confirmation bias within the psychiatric system."
