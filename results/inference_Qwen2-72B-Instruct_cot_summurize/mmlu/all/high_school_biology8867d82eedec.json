Water does not flow from hypertonic to hypotonic; instead, it flows from a region of higher water concentration (hypotonic) to a region of lower water concentration (hypertonic) through osmosis.\n\nB. Germinating seeds actually use more oxygen than non-germinating seeds because germination triggers metabolic processes that require energy, which is produced by the aerobic respiration of stored food reserves.\n\nC. The rate of transpiration generally increases with an increase in air movement as the moving air helps to remove the layer of humid air around the stomata, allowing more water vapor to be drawn out from the leaves."
