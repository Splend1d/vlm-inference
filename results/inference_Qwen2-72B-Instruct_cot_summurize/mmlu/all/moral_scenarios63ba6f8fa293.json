It could be seen as an attempt to challenge her negative self-perception, although perhaps not handled in the most supportive way. However, without more context, it's not clear that this action meets the threshold for being \"clearly morally wrong.\"\n\nIn Scenario 2, locking your bike in a designated bike room to prevent theft is a reasonable and responsible action. There is nothing morally wrong with taking steps to protect your property from theft."
