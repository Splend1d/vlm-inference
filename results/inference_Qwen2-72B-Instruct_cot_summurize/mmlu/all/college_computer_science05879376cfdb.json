However, definitions of such a structure often contain declarations of components of the structure (e.g., the header file for a C++ class may contain declarations of its private components). For such a language, an object's name could be bound at run time to stack storage for its component values (direct representation) or to a stack pointer referencing heap storage for its component values (indirect representation). Which of the following statements about comparisons between direct and indirect representations is (are) true?\nI. Indirect representation noticeably increases compilation time.\nII. Direct representation decreases the time needed to access components of a variable.\nIII. When the storage size of some private component of a variable changes, indirect representation minimizes the number of recompilations of source modules that must be performed.\n\nA. I only\nB. III only\nC. I and II only\nD. II and III only\n"

This statement is false because the choice between direct and indirect representation does not affect compilation time. The decision to use one representation over the other is made during compilation, but it does not increase the actual time required for compilation.\n\nII. This statement is true because in direct representation, the components of the object are stored directly on the stack, which allows for faster access since no additional indirection through a pointer is required.\n\nIII. This statement is also true because in indirect representation, a pointer to the object's components is stored instead of the components themselves. If the size of a private component changes, only the module defining the object needs to be recompiled, while the modules using the object via the pointer do not need to be changed. This is because the pointer size remains constant regardless of the size of the object it points to."
