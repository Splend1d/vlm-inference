                    "text": "Rising prices, or inflation, can be a problem for several reasons, including those listed in options A, B, and D:\n\nA. Money in household savings accounts can now buy fewer goods and services. This is because inflation erodes the purchasing power of money over time. If prices are rising but the amount of money in savings remains the same, each dollar saved will buy less than it did before.\n\nB. Household incomes generally do not rise with prices. While some wages may adjust for inflation, many do not keep pace, which means that households' real (inflation-adjusted) income decreases. This can lead to reduced standards of living as the cost of living increases faster than earnings.\n\nD. Borrowers have to repay loans with more dollars. When inflation occurs, the nominal value of money decreases. So, if someone borrows money during a period of low inflation and repays the loan during a period of high inflation, they effectively pay back more in real terms because each dollar is worth less. However, from the lender's perspective, this can actually be a disadvantage since the repayment is worth less in terms of purchasing power.\n\nOption C, \"the economy could run out of money,\" is not typically a concern due to inflation. Modern economies use fiat currencies, which can be created by central banks as needed, so running out of money is not a common issue related to inflation."
