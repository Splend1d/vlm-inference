It is aimed at preventing the financial power of the developed countries being used in such a way as to impoverish the less developed.\nNon-alignment, as practiced by Ghana and many other countries, is based on co-operation with all States whether they be capitalist, socialist or have a mixed economy. Such a policy, therefore, involves foreign investment from capitalist countries, but it must be invested in accordance with a national plan drawn up by the government of the non-aligned State with its own interests in mind. The issue is not what return the foreign investor receives on his investments\u2026The question is one of power. A State in the grip of neo-colonialism is not master of its own destiny.\"\nKwame Nkrumah, Neo-Colonialism, 1965\nWhich of the following is referenced by the co-operation mentioned in the second paragraph?\n\nA. The competing ideologies of the Cold War\nB. The competing ideologies of World War II\nC. The competing empires of World War I\nD. The competing colonization companies in the Scramble for Africa\n"

However, the context of the passage suggests that the cooperation he is referring to is between Ghana (and other non-aligned states) and both capitalist and socialist countries during the period after decolonization and during the Cold War era. Therefore, if we were to choose the closest option, it would be:\n\nA. The competing ideologies of the Cold War\n\nThis is because Nkrumah is discussing a policy of non-alignment, which was a position taken by several countries during the Cold War to avoid choosing sides between the Western capitalist bloc led by the United States and the Eastern socialist bloc led by the Soviet Union. Non-aligned countries sought to maintain their independence and sovereignty while engaging in economic relations with both blocs on terms favorable to their own development."
