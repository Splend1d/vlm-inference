The POP will choose equality over power. In Rawls's theory, individuals in the original position would choose principles of justice that would ensure a fair distribution of social primary goods, such as rights, liberties, opportunities, income, and wealth. They would do so behind a \"veil of ignorance,\" not knowing their own place in society, which would lead them to choose principles that are fair and impartial. This would likely result in a preference for equality over power or other forms of social hierarchy. However, it's important to note that Rawls's theory is complex and multi-faceted, and the specific choices made in the original position depend on various factors, including the nature of the social primary goods being considered."
