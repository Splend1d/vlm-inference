Instead, social complexity in these societies appears to have been facilitated by a combination of factors including an abundant natural environment that provided a steady food surplus, and the emergence of social stratification.\n\nThe Northwest Coast region is characterized by a rich marine environment and productive forests, which provided a reliable source of food through fishing, hunting, and gathering. This abundance allowed for the accumulation of resources, which could be stored and redistributed by leaders, creating the conditions for social stratification and the emergence of a chiefly class. The potlatch ceremony, a central cultural practice in these societies, served as a mechanism for redistributing wealth and reinforcing social hierarchies.\n\nTherefore, while all of the options listed could contribute to social complexity in different contexts, in the case of Northwest Coast societies, the most critical factor indicated by the evidence is **D. a food surplus**, which in turn supported **C. social stratification**. Agriculture and irrigation technology (options A and B) were not central to the development of social complexity in these particular societies."
