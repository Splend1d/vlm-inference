According to their perspectives, this elite can be seen as a minority group that occupies the top positions of political authority (A), sometimes acting as a coalition of social forces with specific skills and abilities (B), and often circulating between high-status positions while excluding others from entering their ranks (C). Therefore, the most comprehensive answer would be D, encompassing all of the provided options. However, it's important to note that their theories do have nuances that differentiate them, but for the sake of this question, option D is the best choice."
