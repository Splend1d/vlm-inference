He has smoked 1 pack of cigarettes daily and has consumed six 12-oz bottles of beer on weekend nights during the past 30 years. His vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows a 1.5-cm mass on the apex of the tongue. Further evaluation of the mass confirms squamous cell carcinoma. It is most appropriate to evaluate which of the following lymph nodes first for evidence of metastasis in this patient?\n\nA. Inferior deep cervical\nB. Parotid\nC. Retropharyngeal\nD. Submental\n"

Submental.\n\nIn cases of squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity, such as the one described involving the tongue, the submental lymph nodes are often the first to show evidence of metastasis due to their proximity and the pattern of lymphatic drainage from the oral cavity. Therefore, it would be most appropriate to evaluate the submental lymph nodes first for evidence of metastasis in this patient.\n\nWhile other lymph node groups listed (inferior deep cervical, parotid, retropharyngeal) can also be involved in the spread of cancer from the oral cavity, the submental lymph nodes are typically the sentinel nodes for the anterior two-thirds of the tongue."
