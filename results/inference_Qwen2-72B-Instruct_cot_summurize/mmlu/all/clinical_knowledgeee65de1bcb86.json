While emphysema can contribute to an enlarged cardiac silhouette on imaging, it is not directly associated with hepatomegaly (A is incorrect). The liver does enlarge and may extend downwards, but not specifically from the left hypochondrium; typically, enlargement would be more noticeable in the right upper quadrant (B is incorrect). In terms of percussion, the liver is normally dull to percussion due to its solid nature, not resonant (D is incorrect).\n\nJaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes), spider naevi (small red or blue blood vessels that branch out like a spider web), and purpura (purple or reddish discoloration of the skin caused by bleeding) are all signs that may be present in chronic liver disease, including that caused by excessive alcohol consumption. Therefore, option C is correct."
