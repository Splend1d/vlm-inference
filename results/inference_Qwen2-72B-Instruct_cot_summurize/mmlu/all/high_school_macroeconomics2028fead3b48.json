This makes borrowing cheaper and encourages spending and investment, which can stimulate economic growth. However, one side effect of this policy is that it can lead to a depreciation of the domestic currency if it results in higher inflation or larger current account deficits.\n\nA weaker domestic currency makes imports more expensive and exports cheaper, but the immediate effect on net exports can be negative because the increase in domestic demand (due to lower interest rates) can lead to an increase in imports that outpaces the increase in exports. Over time, if the currency depreciation persists, net exports may improve due to increased competitiveness of domestic goods abroad. However, the initial impact is likely to be a decrease in net exports, especially if the economy is import-intensive.\n\nRegarding the other options:\n- A. An increase in net exports is not the immediate expected outcome of an expansionary monetary policy.\n- C. An increase in the real interest rate is unlikely under an expansionary monetary policy, as the goal is typically to decrease both nominal and real interest rates to encourage borrowing and spending.\n- D. An increase in the nominal interest rate would also go against the objectives of an expansionary monetary policy. The Fed aims to lower nominal interest rates to stimulate the economy."
