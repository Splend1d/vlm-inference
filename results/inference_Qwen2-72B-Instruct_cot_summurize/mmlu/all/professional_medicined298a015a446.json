The babysitter reports that she is 15 years old and has cared for the patient on numerous occasions during the past year. The child's mother, who is a single parent, is currently out of town for business but will return later tonight. The babysitter says, \"He has had a runny nose since I started babysitting yesterday, but this afternoon he awoke from a nap with a barking sound and he was breathing real heavy.\" She does not know the child's prior health history, nor does she know if the boy takes any medications on a regular basis. The child looks tired and sits upright on the babysitter's lap. He is obviously comfortable with his caregiver. Vital signs are temperature 38.7\u00b0C (101.7\u00b0F), pulse 110/min, respirations 28/min and labored, and blood pressure 85/50 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 89%. Physical examination discloses inspiratory stridor. Neck is supple, tympanic membranes are normal, and there is a profuse nasal discharge. Examination of the pharynx discloses no abnormalities. Auscultation of the chest discloses equal air entry on both sides and no crackles. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Treatment with 40% oxygen via venturi mask and intravenous fluids is initiated. Despite continued supplemental oxygen and hydration, the child remains tachypneic and stridorous at rest. Oxygen saturation is now 93%. In addition to administering racemic epinephrine by nebulizer, which of the following is the most appropriate next step?\n\nA. Intravenous aminophylline therapy\nB. Intravenous antibiotic therapy\nC. Intubation\nD. Oral dexamethasone therapy\n"

                    "text": "The most appropriate next step in the management of this child, given the symptoms and examination findings, is D. Oral dexamethasone therapy.\n\nThe child's symptoms and physical examination findings suggest a diagnosis of croup, which is characterized by a barking cough, stridor, and often a fever. Croup is usually caused by a viral infection and can lead to upper airway obstruction. Dexamethasone is a corticosteroid that can help reduce inflammation in the airway, thereby alleviating some of the symptoms of croup. It is commonly used in the treatment of moderate to severe croup.\n\nWhile other options might be considered depending on the progression of the child's condition, the immediate need is to address the airway inflammation. Intravenous aminophylline therapy (option A) is used for bronchodilation in conditions like asthma but is not typically indicated for croup. Intravenous antibiotic therapy (option B) would not be indicated unless there were signs of bacterial infection, which are not present in this case. Intubation (option C) is an invasive procedure reserved for cases of severe airway obstruction where less invasive measures have failed or are unlikely to succeed; it is not the first-line treatment for croup."
