Consumers may not necessarily save more now. In fact, they might spend more or invest differently in anticipation of higher prices later, which could deplete their savings.\n\nB. The velocity of money might actually increase if people expect prices to rise. This is because individuals and businesses might try to spend money before prices go up further, thus circulating money faster through the economy.\n\nC. This expectation can indeed put upward pressure on the nominal interest rate. Banks and other financial institutions may raise interest rates to compensate for the loss of purchasing power due to inflation. This helps to preserve the real value of money lent or invested.\n\nD. An increase in inflation expectations can put downward pressure on the real interest rate, but only if nominal interest rates do not rise enough to offset the inflation. Real interest rates are calculated by subtracting the inflation rate from the nominal interest rate. If inflation increases significantly while nominal interest rates remain unchanged or increase at a slower pace, the real interest rate will decline.\n\nAmong the options provided, option C most directly addresses the typical response of interest rates to anticipated inflation increases: \"This will put upward pressure on the nominal interest rate.\""
