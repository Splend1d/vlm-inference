Pendant (hanging) red-colored flowers.\n\nHummingbirds are attracted to red and orange colors, and they prefer tubular or hanging flowers that they can hover under and feed from without having to land. This type of flower shape also limits access for bees, which typically need a landing platform to collect nectar. Bees are not as sensitive to red colors as they are to ultraviolet patterns, so the red coloration of the flowers is less likely to attract them compared to other colors like blue or yellow.\n\nWhile high sugar concentration in nectar (option D) might also attract hummingbirds, it does not necessarily limit bee access, as bees are also attracted to high sugar content. Similarly, option A, patterns of ultraviolet color on the petals, might deter some bees if the pattern is not one they recognize, but it's not specifically adapted for hummingbirds. Option B, modified petals to provide a landing space, would actually facilitate bee pollination rather than discourage it."
