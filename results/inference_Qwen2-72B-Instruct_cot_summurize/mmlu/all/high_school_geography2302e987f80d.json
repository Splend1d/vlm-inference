Zero population growth\n\nIn stages 4 and 5 of the demographic transition model, birth rates and death rates are both low and roughly equal, resulting in zero or very low population growth. This stage is often associated with developed countries where economic development has led to smaller family sizes and improved healthcare, leading to lower fertility and mortality rates. In stage 5, the population may even start to decline due to birth rates falling below replacement levels."
