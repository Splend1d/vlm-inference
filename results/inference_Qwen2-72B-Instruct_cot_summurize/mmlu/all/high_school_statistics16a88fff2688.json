                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to use the properties of the normal distribution and the information given about the percentages of parts lasting more or less than certain times.\n\nGiven:\n- 60% of parts last over 3 years.\n- 70% of parts last less than 6 years.\n\nThese percentages can be related to the z-scores for a normal distribution. The z-score is calculated as:\n\n\\[z = \\frac{(X - \\mu)}{\\sigma}\\]\n\nwhere \\(X\\) is the value of interest (in this case, 3 years and 6 years), \\(\\mu\\) is the mean, and \\(\\sigma\\) is the standard deviation.\n\nWe're given two conditions, which translate into two z-scores corresponding to the cumulative probabilities of 0.4 (since 60% last over 3 years, 40% last up to 3 years) and 0.7 (since 70% last less than 6 years).\n\nUsing standard normal tables or a calculator, we find that:\n- A z-score of about -0.25 corresponds to a cumulative probability of 0.4.\n- A z-score of about 0.52 corresponds to a cumulative probability of 0.7.\n\nLet's set up equations based on these z-scores and the values they correspond to (3 years and 6 years):\n\nFor 3 years:\n\\[-0.25 = \\frac{3 - \\mu}{\\sigma}\\]\n\nFor 6 years:\n\\[0.52 = \\frac{6 - \\mu}{\\sigma}\\]\n\nSolving these equations simultaneously will give us the values of \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\sigma\\). Let's rearrange them first:\n\n\\[3 - \\mu = -0.25\\sigma\\]\n\\[6 - \\mu = 0.52\\sigma\\]\n\nMultiplying the first equation by 0.52 and the second by 0.25 gives us:\n\n\\[1.56 - 0.52\\mu = -0.125\\sigma\\]\n\\[1.5 - 0.25\\mu = 0.13\\sigma\\]\n\nAdding these equations eliminates \\(\\sigma\\):\n\n\\[3.06 - 0.77\\mu = 0\\]\n\nSolving for \\(\\mu\\) gives:\n\n\\[0.77\\mu = 3.06\\]\n\\[\\mu = \\frac{3.06}{0.77} \\approx 4.0\\]\n\nPlugging \\(\\mu = 4.0\\) back into one of the original equations to solve for \\(\\sigma\\):\n\n\\[3 - 4.0 = -0.25\\sigma\\]\n\\[-1 = -0.25\\sigma\\]\n\\[\\sigma = \\frac{-1}{-0.25} = 4\\]\n\nHowever, none of the provided options have a standard deviation of 4, which suggests there might be an error in the calculations or the interpretation of the problem. Given the options, it seems likely that minor rounding differences may have occurred during the process. Let's recheck our calculations using the closest options:\n\nOption B: \\(\\mu = 3.977, \\sigma = 3.861\\)\n\nSubstituting these values into the z-score equations:\n\nFor 3 years:\n\\[-0.25 = \\frac{3 - 3.977}{3.861}\\]\n\nFor 6 years:\n\\[0.52 = \\frac{6 - 3.977}{3.861}\\]\n\nBoth of these yield approximately correct z-scores based on the initial information, making **Option B** the most plausible answer under the given conditions. However, it's important to note that due to rounding and potential errors in translating between cumulative probabilities and exact z-scores, the precise numbers might vary slightly."
