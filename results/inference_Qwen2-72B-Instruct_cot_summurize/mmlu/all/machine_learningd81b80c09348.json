The most popular partitioning method is the K-means algorithm, which aims to minimize the sum of squared distances between points and their cluster centroids.\n2. K-means clustering: This is a type of partitioning-based clustering algorithm that aims to partition n observations into k clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean.\n3. Grid-based clustering: This method quantizes the object space into a finite number of cells that form a grid structure. It can efficiently discover clusters of arbitrary shape by merging adjacent dense cells.\n\nAll three methods are used for spatial clustering, which involves grouping together data points that are close to each other in a multi-dimensional space. Therefore, all of the options listed are correct."
