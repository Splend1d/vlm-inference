This gender disparity may be due to a combination of biological factors and differences in how symptoms manifest in boys and girls. Boys tend to display more externalizing behaviors such as hyperactivity and impulsivity, which are easier to identify, while girls may exhibit more internalizing symptoms like inattentiveness, which can go unnoticed or be mistaken for other conditions."
