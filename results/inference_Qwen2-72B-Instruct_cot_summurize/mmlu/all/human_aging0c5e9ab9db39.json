Have learned to cope with loss\n\nResearch suggests that older adults may experience less major depression than younger adults because they have had more life experiences and have developed better coping mechanisms for dealing with loss and adversity. This does not mean that older adults do not experience depression, but rather that they may be better equipped to handle the emotional challenges that come with aging. It's also worth noting that while option C (having very different brain biochemistry) is true to some extent, it is not the primary reason why older adults might show less major depression than younger adults. Options B and D are not accurate explanations for this phenomenon."
