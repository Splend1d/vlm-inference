                    "text": "Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic inflammatory condition characterized by an increased number of eosinophils, a type of white blood cell, in the lining of the esophagus.\n\nA. EoE does not typically lead to esophageal diverticula. Diverticula are outpouchings of the esophageal wall that can occur due to increased pressure or as a result of aging, but they are not associated with EoE.\n\nB. EoE may indeed cause esophageal obstruction. The inflammation and thickening of the esophageal lining can lead to narrowing (stricture formation) which can obstruct food passage and cause difficulty swallowing (dysphagia).\n\nC. EoE is often due to allergy. It is considered an allergic/immune-mediated disease where the immune system overreacts to certain foods or environmental allergens, leading to eosinophilic inflammation in the esophagus.\n\nD. Antacid therapy alone may not be sufficient for treating EoE. While proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) can help reduce acid production and may improve symptoms in some patients, especially those with reflux-like symptoms, they do not address the underlying eosinophilic inflammation. Treatment often includes dietary modifications, swallowed topical corticosteroids, and sometimes dilation for strictures.\n\nTherefore, the correct statements are B and C."
