It's located about 163,000 light-years away in the constellation Dorado and can be seen from the southern hemisphere. The LMC was not actually discovered by Ferdinand Magellan, but it was included in descriptions of the southern sky by his expedition's navigators during their circumnavigation of the globe in the 16th century."
