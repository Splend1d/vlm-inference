                    "text": "The risk of withdrawal delirium is greatest following the discontinuation of substances that have sedative-hypnotic properties, particularly those that affect the GABAergic system in the brain. Among the options given, phenobarbital (option C) fits this description. Phenobarbital is a barbiturate used as a sedative and anticonvulsant. Abrupt cessation after prolonged use can lead to severe withdrawal symptoms including delirium, seizures, and even death.\n\nHere's a brief explanation of why the other options are less likely to cause withdrawal delirium:\n\nA. Cocaine: Cocaine withdrawal does not typically result in delirium. It can lead to depression, anxiety, fatigue, and increased appetite but these symptoms are not usually associated with delirium.\n\nB. LSD: LSD does not typically lead to physical dependence or withdrawal symptoms upon discontinuation. Psychological effects might be experienced, but they do not rise to the level of delirium.\n\nD. Heroin: While heroin withdrawal can be extremely uncomfortable, causing symptoms like nausea, vomiting, muscle aches, and diarrhea, it does not typically result in delirium. However, in some cases, severe withdrawal from opioids can lead to delirium, especially in individuals with pre-existing medical conditions or in those experiencing complicated withdrawal scenarios. Still, the risk is generally lower compared to substances like phenobarbital."
