This idea is central to his ethical philosophy, particularly in his work \"Nicomachean Ethics,\" where he argues that virtues are habits developed through consistent action and that moral excellence is achieved through the cultivation of virtuous habits. Aristotle believed that individuals can become virtuous by repeatedly performing virtuous actions, which eventually become second nature to them."
