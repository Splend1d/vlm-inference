Moreover, I am cognizant of the interrelatedness of all communities and states. I cannot sit idly by in Atlanta and not be concerned about what happens in Birmingham. Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly affects all indirectly. Never again can we afford to live with the narrow, provincial 'outside agitator' idea. Anyone who lives inside the United States can never be considered an outsider anywhere in this country. . . .\"\n\u2014Martin Luther King, Jr., \"Letter from a Birmingham Jail,\" April 16, 1963\nWhich other nineteenth-century reform movement made similar arguments to those written here by Susan B.

However, if we are looking for a 19th-century reform movement that made similar arguments regarding interconnectedness and the idea that injustice in one place is a threat to justice everywhere, the most appropriate answer would be:\n\nC. The abolition movement.\n\nAbolitionists like William Lloyd Garrison and Frederick Douglass argued that the fight against slavery was a national concern, not just a regional issue. They believed that the institution of slavery corrupted American democracy and that all people, regardless of where they lived, had a moral obligation to fight against it. This sense of shared responsibility and interconnectedness mirrors the sentiments expressed by Martin Luther King Jr. in his letter."
