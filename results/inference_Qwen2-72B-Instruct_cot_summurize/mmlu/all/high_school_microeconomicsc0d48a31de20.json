                    "text": "The free rider problem typically occurs in situations where individuals or entities benefit from a good or service without contributing to its provision, often because it is difficult to exclude non-contributors from enjoying the benefits. This problem is especially prevalent with public goods, which are non-excludable and non-rivalrous.\n\nAmong the options provided:\n\nA. Enacting stricter antitrust legislation would not directly address the free rider problem. Antitrust laws are primarily concerned with preventing monopolies and promoting competition, which does not necessarily tackle the issue of individuals benefiting from a public good without contributing to its cost.\n\nB. Providing more complete information about the relevant goods might help in some cases by enabling better-informed decisions, but it does not inherently prevent the free rider problem. Information asymmetry can lead to market failures, but it does not directly cause the free rider problem.\n\nC. Supplying public goods using tax dollars is a direct way to address the free rider problem. By funding the provision of public goods through taxation, the government ensures that everyone contributes to the cost of these goods, thereby reducing the incentive for individuals to act as free riders. This approach acknowledges that public goods are often best provided collectively rather than relying on voluntary contributions.\n\nD. Taxing those creating negative externalities addresses a related but different issue. Negative externalities occur when an individual or firm's actions impose costs on others not involved in the transaction. While taxing such activities can help internalize these costs, it does not specifically address the free rider problem unless the tax revenue is used to fund public goods that benefit all.\n\nTherefore, the most effective option to avoid a free rider problem among these choices is:\n\nC. Supply public goods using tax dollars."
