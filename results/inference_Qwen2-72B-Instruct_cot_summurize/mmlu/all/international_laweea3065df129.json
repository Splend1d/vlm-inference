Obligations under international law prevail over domestic law\n\nIn the context of international law, the principle of \"pacta sunt servanda\" (agreements must be kept) under Article 26 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties stipulates that states must honor their treaty obligations in good faith. This means that countries cannot use their domestic laws as an excuse for failing to comply with their international legal obligations. If there is a conflict between a state's domestic law and its international obligations, the latter should prevail.\n\nHowever, it is worth noting that the relationship between international law and domestic law can vary depending on the country's legal system. In some countries, international law is automatically part of the domestic legal system, while in others, specific legislation may be required to incorporate international agreements into domestic law. Nonetheless, the principle remains that international obligations should be upheld, even if this requires changes to domestic law."
