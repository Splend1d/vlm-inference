Surveillance systems often use syndromic surveillance, which involves collecting and analyzing non-specific health data in real-time to detect patterns that may indicate an emerging public health threat. This approach allows for early detection and response to outbreaks or other health events. While cohort and serial cross-sectional studies are also used in public health research, they are not typically used in surveillance systems. Mortality studies focus on deaths rather than on the occurrence of disease or illness."
