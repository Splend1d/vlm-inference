Since the distribution is normal, we can use the properties of the normal distribution to find this interval.\n\nFor a normal distribution, about 68.27% of values fall within one standard deviation (\\(\\sigma\\)) of the mean (\\(\\mu\\)), about 95.45% fall within two standard deviations, and about 99.73% fall within three standard deviations. However, we're interested in an interval that covers approximately 66.67% of the data.\n\nUsing the Z-table or a calculator, we can find the Z-score that corresponds to the lower and upper bounds of this interval. The Z-score associated with the 16.67th percentile (which is half of the remaining 33.33% outside our target range) is approximately -1, and the Z-score for the 83.33rd percentile is approximately +1.\n\nThis means that approximately 66.67% of the data falls within \u00b11 standard deviation from the mean. Given that the mean (\\(\\mu\\)) is 35 minutes and the standard deviation (\\(\\sigma\\)) is 10 minutes, the interval is:\n\nLower bound: \\(\\mu - \\sigma = 35 - 10 = 25\\) minutes\n\nUpper bound: \\(\\mu + \\sigma = 35 + 10 = 45\\) minutes\n\nHowever, since the options are not exact, let's round these values to match the closest options given:\n\nClosest to 25 minutes is 25.3 minutes, and closest to 45 minutes is 44.7 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the shortest time interval associated with 100,000 riders is **C. 25.3 to 44.7 minutes**."
