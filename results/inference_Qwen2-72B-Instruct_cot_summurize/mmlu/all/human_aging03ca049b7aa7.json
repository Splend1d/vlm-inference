Attempt to explain findings and guide future research\n\nTheories in aging research, as in any scientific field, play a crucial role in understanding the mechanisms and processes associated with aging. They help researchers make sense of empirical data, predict outcomes, and guide further investigations. Without theories, the findings from various studies would be isolated pieces of information without a framework to connect them coherently. Theories provide a structure that allows scientists to develop hypotheses, design experiments, and interpret results in a meaningful way. They also facilitate communication among researchers by providing a common language and set of concepts."
