The mucogingival junction is the border between the gingival (gum) mucosa, which is keratinized and more durable, and the non-keratinized buccal mucosa. In a healthy mouth, both areas should appear light pink. The red coloration may indicate inflammation or pathology, such as gingivitis, in the gingival area."
