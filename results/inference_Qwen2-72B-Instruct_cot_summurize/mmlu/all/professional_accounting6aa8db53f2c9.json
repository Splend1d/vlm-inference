The direct labor standards indicated that each unit of finished goods requires 2.4 direct labor hours at a standard wage of $20 per hour, totaling $48.00 per finished good unit. During March, the company actually made 9,000 units of finished goods. Production used 2.5 labor hours per finished unit, and the company actually paid $21 per hour, totaling $52.50 per unit of finished product. What amount is the company's direct labor rate variance for March?\n\nA. $18,000\nB. $22,500\nC. $25,000\nD. $40,500\n"
