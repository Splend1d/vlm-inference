This action could cause harm to others by blocking their path or causing accidents.\n\nIn Scenario 2, driving very fast on a racetrack is not considered morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards, assuming that the racetrack is a designated area for such activities and all safety measures are followed. Racing on a track is generally considered an acceptable and legal activity."
