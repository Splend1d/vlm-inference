The name \"vitamin\" itself was coined by Polish biochemist Casimir Funk in 1912, who used the term to describe the essential nutrients that were then being discovered. Vitamin B12 and Vitamin E were identified later, in 1948 and 1922 respectively. \"Vitameat avegimen\" is not a recognized term or name for any vitamin; it appears to be a nonsensical phrase."
