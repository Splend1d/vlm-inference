Everything else (reading the review book, watching \"Discovering Psychology,\" and taking the tests) would be considered part of the experimental setup or possibly dependent variables if their effects were being measured independently. However, since the question focuses on contrasting attendance at lectures, the independent variable is whether or not Jared goes to the lecture classes."
