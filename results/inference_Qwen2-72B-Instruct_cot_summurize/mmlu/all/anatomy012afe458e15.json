The maxillary sinus is bounded by several important structures: its roof forms part of the floor of the orbit; its anterior wall is formed by the maxillary bone; its medial wall borders the nasal cavity; its inferior wall forms the alveolar process of the maxilla (related to the roots of the upper posterior teeth); its posterior wall separates it from the infratemporal fossa; and its floor is continuous with the hard palate."
