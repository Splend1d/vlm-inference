Experiments isolate the effects of independent variables on dependent variables.\n\nExperiments are designed to determine causality by manipulating one or more independent variables and observing the effect on a dependent variable while controlling for other potential influencing factors. This control allows researchers to establish cause-and-effect relationships that are not possible with other research methods, such as observational studies or surveys, which can only show correlations."
