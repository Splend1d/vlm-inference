                    "text": "When a company declares a stock dividend, it does not use cash or other assets but instead reallocates equity from retained earnings to common stock and additional paid-in capital. The number of new shares issued as part of the stock dividend is based on the percentage declared (in this case, 30%) of the total number of shares outstanding.\n\nGiven that the company has 1,000 shares of $1 par value common stock outstanding, a 30% stock dividend would result in an additional 300 shares being issued (30% of 1,000).\n\nThe market value of these new shares is $10 each (as given), so the total market value of the stock dividend is $3,000 ($10 * 300). However, since the par value of each share is $1, the book value added to the common stock account is $300 ($1 * 300).\n\nThe difference between the market value of the dividend and the book value recorded in the common stock account goes into the additional paid-in capital account. In this case, the difference is $2,700 ($3,000 - $300).\n\nThus, the correct adjustment to record the stock dividend is:\n\n- Retained Earnings is debited for $3,000 (the market value of the dividend).\n- Common Stock is credited for $300 (the par value of the new shares).\n- Additional Paid-In Capital is credited for $2,700 (the excess of market value over par value).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Retained earnings is debited for $3,000.\nB. Additional paid-in capital is credited for $2,700.\n\nHowever, among the options provided, only option B correctly identifies an adjustment that should be made when recording the stock dividend. Option C is partially correct regarding the debit to retained earnings but does not reflect the correct amount. Therefore, the best choice from the options given is:\n\nB. Additional paid-in capital is credited for $2,700."
