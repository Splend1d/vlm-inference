I remember the precise moment, crouching behind a crumbling mud wall, peeking into the alley near the frozen creek. That was a long time ago, but it's wrong what they say about the past, I've learned, about how you can bury it. Because the past claws its way out. Looking back now, I realize I have been peeking into that deserted alley for the last twenty-six years. The excerpt is an example of which of the following types of writing?\n\nA. Informative\nB. Persuasive\nC. Descriptive\nD. Narrative\n"

Narrative\n\nThe excerpt is an example of narrative writing because it tells a story from the perspective of a character reflecting on a significant event from their past. It includes elements such as setting (\"a frigid overcast day in the winter of 1975\"), character (the narrator), and plot (the event that shaped the narrator's life). Narrative writing often includes personal experiences and emotions, which are evident in this passage through the narrator's reflection on their past and the impact it has had on their life."
