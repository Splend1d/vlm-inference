A rightward shift in the aggregate demand curve\n\nWhen aggregate demand increases, it can lead to higher inflation if the economy is near or at full employment. This is because businesses may not be able to increase production quickly enough to meet the new demand without raising prices. At the same time, the increased demand for goods and services can lead to lower unemployment as businesses hire more workers to meet the demand. Conversely, when aggregate demand decreases, unemployment may rise (as businesses cut back on hiring or lay off workers) but inflation may fall (due to excess supply and reduced pricing power). This inverse relationship between inflation and unemployment is what the Phillips curve illustrates. However, it's important to note that the Phillips curve does not necessarily imply a stable long-term trade-off; over time, expectations and other factors can cause the relationship to shift.\n\nOptions A, B, and C do not directly describe the trade-off between inflation and unemployment as illustrated by the Phillips curve. While changes in aggregate supply or input costs can certainly affect both inflation and unemployment, they do not inherently create the trade-off depicted by the Phillips curve in the way that changes in aggregate demand do."
