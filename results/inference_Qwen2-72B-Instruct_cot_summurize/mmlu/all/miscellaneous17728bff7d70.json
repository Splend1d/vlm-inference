However, several spacecraft have flown by or orbited Jupiter, including NASA's Pioneer 10, Voyager 1 and 2, Galileo, Juno, and others. In contrast, spacecraft have landed on Venus (by the Soviet Union's Venera program), Mars (by various missions from NASA, ESA, and ISRO), and the Moon (by the United States' Apollo program and other nations' robotic missions)."
