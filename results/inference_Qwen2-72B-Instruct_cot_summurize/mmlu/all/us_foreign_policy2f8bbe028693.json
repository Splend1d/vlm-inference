Leaders might choose to lie about their nuclear capabilities for strategic advantage or to avoid international sanctions and condemnation. Revealing the existence of a nuclear program can make a country more vulnerable to attacks from adversaries seeking to neutralize the threat. Additionally, leaders may restrict access to their nuclear facilities for foreign monitors, making it difficult to verify claims about the status of their nuclear arsenal. All these factors contribute to the ambiguity surrounding the nuclear capabilities of certain states."
