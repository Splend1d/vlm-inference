Although the co-defendants had time to douse the fire without any danger to themselves, neither did so. Instead, they climbed into the truck and fled. Meanwhile, the fire quickly spread, engulfing the entire warehouse in flames.

Burglary: The co-defendants broke into a warehouse, which is a structure, with the intent to commit a crime inside (in this case, theft). This satisfies the elements of burglary.\n\n2. Larceny: The co-defendants proceeded to load large crates of appliances onto their truck, taking property that did not belong to them. This act of taking and carrying away the personal property of another with the intent to permanently deprive the owner of it constitutes larceny.\n\n3. Arson: Although the fire was initially caused accidentally by one of the co-defendants' negligent act of discarding a lit cigarette, their subsequent failure to extinguish the fire when they had the opportunity could be seen as a reckless disregard for the consequences of their actions. By fleeing instead of attempting to put out the fire, they allowed it to spread and cause extensive damage. This can be considered as an act of arson, as they knowingly or recklessly caused a fire that resulted in the destruction of a building.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. burglary, larceny, and arson."
