Immanuel Kant, an 18th-century philosopher, argued that moral principles should be based on rationality and the inherent value of actions rather than their consequences. According to Kant, certain actions are morally obligatory regardless of their outcomes, because they respect the autonomy and dignity of individuals as rational beings. In contrast, consequentialism (option A) evaluates the morality of actions based on their outcomes or consequences, while natural law theory (option B) bases morality on human nature and the laws of nature."
