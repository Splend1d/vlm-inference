He is receiving fentanyl via systemic patient-controlled analgesic pump for pain management. Medical history is remarkable for coronary artery disease, for which he takes atorvastatin, furosemide, carvedilol, lisinopril, and 81-mg aspirin. Baseline echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 0.20. Vital signs now are temperature 38.0\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F), pulse 90/min, respirations 16/min, and blood pressure 130/90 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 96%. Physical examination discloses no unexpected abnormalities. Which of the following regimens for prophylaxis of deep venous thrombosis will likely be most beneficial in this patient?\n\nA. Continuous application of bilateral lower extremity pneumatic compression devices\nB. Continuous intravenous infusion of heparin titrated to a PTT of 1.5 to 2.0 times the control value\nC. Oral warfarin\nD. Subcutaneous enoxaparin\n"

                    "text": "The best answer in this case would be D. Subcutaneous enoxaparin. Enoxaparin is a low molecular weight heparin that is commonly used for prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in postoperative patients. It has a lower risk of bleeding complications compared to unfractionated heparin and does not require monitoring of coagulation parameters like the partial thromboplastin time (PTT).\n\nOption A, continuous application of bilateral lower extremity pneumatic compression devices, can also be effective but may not provide as complete protection as pharmacological prophylaxis, especially in high-risk patients.\n\nOption B, continuous intravenous infusion of heparin titrated to a PTT of 1.5 to 2.0 times the control value, is more invasive and requires frequent laboratory monitoring, making it less practical for routine prophylaxis.\n\nOption C, oral warfarin, is typically not used immediately postoperatively due to the risk of bleeding complications and the need for several days to achieve therapeutic effect. Additionally, warfarin's anticoagulant effects are difficult to manage in the immediate postoperative period because of fluctuations in INR values due to postoperative inflammation and other factors.\n\nGiven the patient's history of coronary artery disease and recent surgery, subcutaneous enoxaparin would be the preferred choice for DVT prophylaxis in this scenario. However, the dose should be adjusted based on renal function, age, and any concurrent medications that might affect coagulation or increase the risk of bleeding."
