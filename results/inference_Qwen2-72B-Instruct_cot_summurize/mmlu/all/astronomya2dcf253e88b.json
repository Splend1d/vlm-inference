Distance at which one astronomical unit measures one arcsecond from Earth.\n\nA parsec is defined as the distance at which an object would have a parallax angle of one arcsecond when observed from two points one astronomical unit (AU) apart, such as the Earth and the Sun. This definition is based on the concept of parallax, which is the apparent shift in position of an object when viewed from different locations. The parsec is a fundamental unit of distance used in astronomy to measure distances within our galaxy and beyond."
