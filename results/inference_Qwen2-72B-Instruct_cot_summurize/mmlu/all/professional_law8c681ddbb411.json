No, because payment of the $2,000 to the creditor would undermine the statutory public policy against enforcement of stale claims.\nB. No, because the creditor's rights as an intended beneficiary are subject to any defenses available to the contracting parties between themselves.\nC. Yes, because the buyer's promise to pay $2,000 to the creditor is enforceable by the creditor regardless of whether the debtor was legally obligated to pay the creditor anything.\nD. Yes, because the buyer's promise to pay $2,000 to the creditor revived the uncollectible debt.\n"

No, because the creditor's rights as an intended beneficiary are subject to any defenses available to the contracting parties between themselves.\n\nExplanation: When a third party (in this case, the creditor) is an intended beneficiary of a contract between two other parties (the debtor and the buyer), that third party can enforce the contract. However, the third party's right to enforce the contract is subject to any defenses that the contracting parties may have against each other. In this case, the buyer could potentially argue that the underlying debt was barred by the statute of limitations, and therefore they should not be required to pay the $2,000 to the creditor. The fact that the buyer agreed to pay the creditor directly does not necessarily revive the otherwise unenforceable debt or override the statute of limitations defense."
