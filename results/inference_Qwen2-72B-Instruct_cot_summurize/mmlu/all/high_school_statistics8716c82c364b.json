                    "text": "To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. However, for simplicity and understanding, let's use a tree diagram or a straightforward approach using the given percentages.\n\nLet's assume there are 1000 dogs in total to make the math easier. According to the given information:\n\n- 10% of these dogs actually have heartworm, so 100 dogs have heartworm.\n- The test correctly identifies 96% of the dogs with heartworm, so it will correctly identify 96 out of the 100 dogs with heartworm (i.e., 96 true positives).\n- The remaining 4% of dogs with heartworm will be missed by the test, so 4 dogs with heartworm will test negative (false negatives).\n\nFor the dogs without heartworm:\n- 90% of the dogs do not have heartworm, so 900 dogs do not have heartworm.\n- The test correctly identifies 98% of the dogs without heartworm, so it will correctly identify 882 of them as not having heartworm (true negatives).\n- The remaining 2% of dogs without heartworm will test positive by the test, so 18 dogs without heartworm will test positive (false positives).\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that a dog that tested positive for heartworm actually has heartworm. This means we want to find the proportion of true positives among all the dogs that tested positive (both true positives and false positives).\n\nThe number of dogs that tested positive is the sum of true positives and false positives: 96 (true positives) + 18 (false positives) = 114.\n\nThe probability that a dog that tested positive actually has heartworm is then the number of true positives divided by the total number of dogs that tested positive:\n\\[ P(\\text{Heartworm}|\\text{Positive Test}) = \\frac{96}{114} = \\frac{16}{19} \\approx 0.8421 \\]\n\nSo, the probability is approximately 84%, which corresponds to choice C."
