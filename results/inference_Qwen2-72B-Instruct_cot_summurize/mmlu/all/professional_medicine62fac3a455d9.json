His mother feeds him cow-milk formula and a variety of strained fruits and vegetables. On physical examination, his temperature is 37.4\u00b0C (99.3\u00b0F), his mucous membranes are dry, and his abdomen is slightly distended. No other abnormalities are seen. The problem is most likely related to which of the following?\n\nA. Fructose intolerance\nB. Transient lactase deficiency\nC. Magnesium deficiency\nD. Regional enteritis\n"

                    "text": "The most likely cause of the infant's persistent watery diarrhea in this scenario is B. Transient lactase deficiency. This condition can occur after an episode of gastroenteritis, as it may lead to the loss of the brush border enzymes, including lactase, which is necessary for the digestion of lactose, a sugar found in milk and dairy products. As a result, the undigested lactose can draw water into the intestines, causing diarrhea. The fact that the infant is being fed cow-milk formula could be exacerbating this issue.\n\nOption A, fructose intolerance, typically presents with symptoms like vomiting and failure to thrive, rather than just diarrhea. Option C, magnesium deficiency, is less likely to present with isolated diarrhea and more commonly causes symptoms such as muscle weakness, tremors, and seizures. Option D, regional enteritis (also known as Crohn's disease), is uncommon in infants and would likely present with additional symptoms such as abdominal pain, rectal bleeding, and weight loss."
