It acts as a buffer for stimuli received through the senses before it is passed on to other memory systems for further processing. This information can be visual (iconic memory), auditory (echoic memory), or tactile, among others. If attention is directed to the information in sensory memory, it can then be transferred to working memory for further processing and potentially into long-term memory."
