Exclusively breastfed for six months\n\nBreastfeeding is recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) as the ideal way to feed newborns, especially in areas where safe water and sanitation are not guaranteed. Breast milk provides all the necessary nutrients for a baby's growth and development during the first six months of life, and it also contains antibodies that help protect against many common childhood illnesses. Breastfeeding can also promote bonding between mother and child and has been associated with better health outcomes for both mothers and babies.\n\nIn environments where water safety is uncertain, formula feeding can pose significant risks due to the potential for contamination when mixing powdered formula with unsafe water. Therefore, exclusive breastfeeding is generally considered the safest and most nutritious option for infants in their first six months of life. After six months, complementary foods can be introduced while continuing to breastfeed up to two years or beyond, as recommended by the WHO."
