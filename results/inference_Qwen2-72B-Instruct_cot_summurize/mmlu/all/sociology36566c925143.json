Leading questions are those that are phrased in such a way as to influence the respondent's answer, either intentionally or unintentionally. They can introduce bias into the survey results and make it difficult to draw valid conclusions from the data collected.\nExamples of leading questions include:\n- \"Don't you agree that...?\"\n- \"Isn't it true that...?\"\n- \"Wouldn't you say that...?\"\n- \"How could anyone not think that...?\"\nIt is important to phrase survey questions in an objective and neutral manner to ensure that the responses accurately reflect the respondents' opinions and experiences. Fixed-choice questions, short questions, and funnelled questions (which ask broad questions before narrowing down to more specific ones) can all be appropriate depending on the context and purpose of the survey."
