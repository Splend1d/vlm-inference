The patient had mammography and ultrasonography of the breasts 2 months ago for evaluation of increased glandularity, palpated in the upper outer quadrant of the right breast, noted at her most recent annual examination. The studies showed likely benign findings with recommended follow-up in 6 months. Medical history is otherwise unremarkable and she takes no medications. BMI is 30 kg/m2 . Vital signs are normal. Palpation of the right breast discloses glandularity in the upper outer quadrant but no other masses. There is scant, black discharge from the right nipple. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis?\n\nA. Ductography\nB. Excisional biopsy of glandular tissue\nC. Repeat mammography\nD. Repeat ultrasonography of the right breast\n"

This type of discharge should be evaluated further, and ductography can help visualize the ducts and identify any potential abnormalities such as papillomas or malignancy. This non-invasive imaging technique involves injecting contrast into the lactiferous ducts to evaluate their anatomy and look for any lesions.\n\nExcisional biopsy (option B) might be necessary if imaging studies suggest a lesion that requires removal for definitive diagnosis, but it is not the first-line diagnostic approach in this scenario.\n\nRepeat mammography (option C) and repeat ultrasonography (option D) were recently performed and did not reveal significant findings at that time. While they may be indicated eventually, particularly if there are new changes, they are not the most appropriate initial next step given the specific concern of the black nipple discharge."
