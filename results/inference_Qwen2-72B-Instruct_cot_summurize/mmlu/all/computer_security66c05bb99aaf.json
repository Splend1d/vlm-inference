This means that when you use certain functions, such as `strcpy`, `strcat`, or `sprintf`, they will copy data without checking if there is enough space in the destination buffer. If the data being copied is larger than the buffer can hold, it will overflow into adjacent memory, potentially overwriting other data or executable code. This can lead to security vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflow attacks, where an attacker can exploit this behavior to execute arbitrary code.\n\nWhile modern compilers and runtime environments can offer some mitigations against buffer overflows (such as Address Space Layout Randomization, stack canaries, or bounds-checking options), these protections are not always enabled or may not cover all potential cases. It is up to the programmer to ensure proper bounds checking and safe coding practices when working with buffers in C and C++."
