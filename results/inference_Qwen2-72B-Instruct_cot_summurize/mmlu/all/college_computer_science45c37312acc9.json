The sum of degrees of all vertices in an undirected graph is always even because each edge contributes exactly two to the total degree (one for each end vertex). This statement is true.\n\nII. In a connected graph, the number of edges |E| is always greater than or equal to |V| - 1. This is because a tree (a connected graph without cycles) has exactly |V| - 1 edges, and adding any additional edge(s) does not change this inequality. This statement is also true.\n\nIII. A connected graph may or may not have a vertex with degree 1. For example, a complete graph where every vertex is connected to every other vertex has no vertex with degree 1. This statement is false.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. I and II."
