Sexual selection and parental investment\n\nThese two evolutionary theories provide the primary conceptual frameworks for understanding the evolution of mating adaptations. Sexual selection, proposed by Charles Darwin, explains how traits that enhance an individual's ability to obtain mates can evolve, even if they do not necessarily improve survival. Parental investment theory, developed by Robert Trivers, focuses on the costs and benefits associated with investing in offspring and how these investments influence mating strategies and behaviors."
