Splitting is a defense mechanism in which an individual sees others as either all good or all bad, often shifting between the two extremes without any middle ground. In this case, the patient is treating the physician politely while berating the nurses and other staff, and he also expresses extreme negativity toward one of his children while the others are present. This black-and-white thinking and extreme categorization of people into good or bad aligns with the concept of splitting."
