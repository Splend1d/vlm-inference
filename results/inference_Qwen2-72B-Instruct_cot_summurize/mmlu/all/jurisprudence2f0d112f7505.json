A presupposition that facilitates our understanding of the legal system.\n\nKelsen's Grundnorm, or \"basic norm,\" is a hypothetical norm that serves as the foundation for the validity of all other norms within a legal system. It is not a legal norm in itself but rather a theoretical construct that helps us understand how legal norms derive their authority and validity. The Grundnorm is not something that can be found written down or explicitly stated in any legal document; it is an assumption that underpins the entire legal system. This makes option D the most accurate description of its nature and function."
