                    "text": "To find the effective annual interest cost, we need to calculate the total cost of borrowing and divide it by the actual funds received (i.e., the loan amount minus the compensating balance).\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total cost of borrowing:\n\n1. Interest on the borrowed amount: $200,000 * 10% = $20,000\n2. Compensating balance required: $500,000 * 15% = $75,000\n3. Since the company only borrows $200,000, the unused portion of the credit line is $300,000 ($500,000 - $200,000).\n4. Commitment fee on the unused amount: $300,000 * 1% = $3,000\n\nTotal cost of borrowing = $20,000 (interest) + $3,000 (commitment fee) = $23,000.\n\nHowever, the $75,000 compensating balance reduces the effective amount borrowed since these funds are not available for use. So, the actual funds available to the company are $200,000 (loan amount) - $75,000 (compensating balance) = $125,000.\n\nNow, we can calculate the effective annual interest cost:\n\nEffective annual interest cost = Total cost of borrowing / Actual funds available\n= $23,000 / $125,000\n= 0.184 or 18.4%\n\nThis exact percentage isn't listed among the options provided, which suggests there might have been a rounding or calculation difference in the provided answer choices or in our calculation. Given the options provided, the closest match to our calculation is D. 13.53 percent, but this doesn't align closely with our calculated value. \n\nIt's important to note that the options given don't exactly match what our calculations suggest, so it's possible there was an expectation for a different interpretation or rounding method. However, based on the information and calculations provided, none of the options A, B, C, or D exactly match the calculated effective annual interest cost of 18.4%. If we must choose the closest option, it would be D. 13.53 percent, but this is still a significant difference from our calculation. It's recommended to double-check the details of the question and the calculation steps to ensure accuracy."
