Simon, who argued that decision-makers have limited cognitive abilities and cannot process all available information to make perfectly rational decisions. Instead, they rely on simplifying heuristics and satisficing strategies to make decisions that are \"good enough\" given the constraints of time, effort, and information processing capacity."
