As people age, they accumulate more experiences and memories, which can make it harder to retrieve a specific memory from their vast repository of information. This is known as the \"search problem\" in memory research. Additionally, D. Memory is less well organized as we grow older and finding a memory can be quite difficult, can also contribute to difficulties in memory retrieval for older adults. However, it's important to note that not all older adults experience memory decline, and many maintain good cognitive function throughout their lifespan."
