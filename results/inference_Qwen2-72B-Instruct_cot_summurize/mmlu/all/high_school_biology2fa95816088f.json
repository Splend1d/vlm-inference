It must be present in a population before natural selection can act upon the population.\n\nThis statement is true because natural selection acts on existing genetic variation within a population. Genetic variation can arise from mutations, sexual reproduction (recombination), and gene flow. Once this variation exists, natural selection can favor certain traits over others based on their impact on an organism's survival and reproductive success in a given environment. Without genetic variation, there would be no differences for natural selection to act upon."
