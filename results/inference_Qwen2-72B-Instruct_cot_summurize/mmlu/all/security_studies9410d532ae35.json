Different natures of the adversaries complicate the use of Western coercion. Their tendency to rely on irregular or asymmetric military strategies makes it hard to threaten or even defeat their opponent's military strategy. Those actors deny forces the ability to win quickly with little cost.\nB. Increased verification capabilities brought in with the technological and communication revolution have resulted in a practical difficulty for practitioners, enabling the verification of tactical/temporary and strategic/lasting - only the latter of which constituting a compliance success. The capacity to verify processes have highlighted instances of non-compliance following inconclusive coercive diplomacy exchanges.\nC. Coalitional coercive diplomacy is the only credible means for Western democracies to gain the sincerity required to make a threat of force real in the mind of the adversary. However, past efforts of coalitional building have proved to be extremely limited. Disagreements over the means and coordination of the policy often result in splits and consequently states are reluctant to employ it. Where it has been employed it collapses under the weight of its own inadequacy.\nD. All of these options.\n"

The nature of adversaries and their reliance on irregular or asymmetric military strategies can make it difficult for Western powers to threaten or defeat their opponents effectively. This can result in prolonged conflicts that are costly in terms of resources and lives.\n\nB. The increased verification capabilities resulting from technological and communication advancements have made it easier to detect instances of non-compliance following coercive diplomacy efforts. This can undermine the credibility of Western powers and make it more difficult to achieve lasting compliance.\n\nC. Coalitional coercive diplomacy is often seen as the most credible means for Western democracies to make a threat of force real in the mind of the adversary. However, disagreements over the means and coordination of the policy can lead to splits within coalitions, making it difficult to maintain unity and effectiveness.\n\nTherefore, all three options (A, B, and C) represent practical problems associated with applying coercive diplomacy in the West."
