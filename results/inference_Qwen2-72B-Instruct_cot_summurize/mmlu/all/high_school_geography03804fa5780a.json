Ethnonationalism\n\nQuebec is a strong example of ethnonationalism, as it has a distinct cultural identity and a strong sense of nationalism that is separate from the rest of Canada. The Quebecois people have their own language (French), culture, and history, which have contributed to a desire for greater autonomy or even independence from the Canadian federal government. While there have been movements towards secession in the past, such as the 1980 and 1995 referendums, Quebec remains part of Canada. Therefore, while elements of B (Secession) might apply to some extent due to historical context, C (Ethnonationalism) is the most accurate choice."
