Therefore, \\(\\dim(V) = 6\\).\n\nThe codomain \\(W\\) is the space of all \\(4 \\times 1\\) real column vectors, so each vector has 4 entries. Therefore, \\(\\dim(W) = 4\\).\n\nSince \\(T\\) is given as a linear transformation from \\(V\\) onto \\(W\\), it means that \\(T\\) is surjective (onto). This implies that \\(\\dim(\\text{range}(T)) = \\dim(W) = 4\\).\n\nNow, applying the rank-nullity theorem:\n\n\\[ \\dim(V) = \\dim(\\text{range}(T)) + \\dim(\\ker(T)) \\]\n\n\\[ 6 = 4 + \\dim(\\ker(T)) \\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ \\dim(\\ker(T)) = 6 - 4 = 2 \\]\n\nTherefore, the dimension of the kernel of \\(T\\) is 2.\n\nThe correct answer is A. 2."
