This action is intentionally dangerous and reckless.\n\nIn scenario 2, adding your name to the back of a check that was given to you by your grandmother for your birthday is not morally wrong. This is a standard practice when cashing a check made out to you, as endorsement is required for the bank to process it. Assuming the check was intended for you and you have permission to cash it, there is no moral issue here."
