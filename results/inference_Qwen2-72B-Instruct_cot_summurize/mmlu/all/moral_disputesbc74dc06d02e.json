Therapeutic cloning involves creating an embryo through somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) for the purpose of obtaining stem cells that can be used to generate specific tissues or organs for treating various diseases or injuries. This technique has the potential to provide personalized treatments for patients with conditions such as diabetes, Parkinson's disease, spinal cord injuries, and others. It is important to note that therapeutic cloning is distinct from reproductive cloning, which aims to create a genetically identical individual."
