                    "text": "The speed of the proton does not change when it is in a magnetic field; only its direction can change. This is due to the fact that the force exerted by a magnetic field on a charged particle (the Lorentz force) is always perpendicular to both the particle's velocity and the magnetic field. As a result, the work done by the magnetic field on the proton is zero because the displacement and the force are perpendicular to each other. Since the work done is zero, there is no change in kinetic energy, and therefore no change in speed.\n\nThus, regardless of how long the proton travels through the magnetic field, its speed remains constant at \\(1.5 \\times 10^6\\) m/s.\n\nThe correct answer is C. 1.5 \u00d7 10^6 m/s."
