This happens because ice has an unusual property where its density decreases as it freezes (unlike most substances). Ice forms an open lattice structure that allows water molecules to be relatively far apart. When pressure is applied to ice, the molecules in the areas of high pressure move closer together, which requires energy. This energy comes from the ice melting locally at the points of high pressure. When the pressure is removed, the water refreezes into ice again. This process is what allows glaciers to flow and ice to slowly deform under its own weight."
