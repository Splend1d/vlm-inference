II, III, and V only.\n\nFor a firm to successfully carry out price discrimination, it must have market power (II), meaning it can influence the market price because it is not a price taker. It also needs to be able to segment the market so that buyers with differing demand elasticities can be charged different prices (III). Lastly, the firm must be able to prevent resale between different market segments (V) to avoid arbitrage, where consumers in low-price segments could buy goods and resell them to those in high-price segments at a lower price than the latter would otherwise pay, thereby undermining the price discrimination strategy. \n\nCondition I is incorrect because a firm facing a downward-sloping demand curve is actually a prerequisite for having market power. Condition IV is incorrect because profit maximization is typically the motive for firms engaging in price discrimination."
