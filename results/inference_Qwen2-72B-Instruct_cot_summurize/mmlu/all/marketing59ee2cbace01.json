Therefore, none of the options provided is correct for this question as stated. However, if I had to choose the option that is least directly related to digital marketing, it would be A.

But in reality, jurisdiction is still a significant concern for digital marketers due to the global nature of the internet and the potential for legal action from different countries or regions."
