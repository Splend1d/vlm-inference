A tri-variate VAR(p) model has three equations, with each equation including the p lags of all three variables.\n\nFor a tri-variate VAR(4) model, we have:\n\n- Three equations (one for each variable)\n- Four lags for each variable in every equation\n\nEach equation will include the current variable's own four lags and the four lags of the other two variables, which amounts to:\n\n- 4 lags of the variable itself = 4 parameters\n- 4 lags of the first other variable = 4 parameters\n- 4 lags of the second other variable = 4 parameters\n\nSo, each equation requires an estimation of \\(4 + 4 + 4 = 12\\) parameters.\n\nSince there are three equations, the total number of parameters to estimate is:\n\n\\[3 \\times 12 = 36\\]\n\nThus, the answer is D. 36 parameters."
