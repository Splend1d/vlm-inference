However, since we don't have all the necessary probabilities (like P(\u00acB|A) or P(B|A)), we will instead use the law of total probability to find P(A \u2229 \u00acB) and then use it to calculate P(A|B).\n\nFirst, let's recall some definitions:\n\n- P(A|B) is the probability that A occurs given that B has occurred.\n- P(A|\u00acB) is the probability that A occurs given that B does not occur.\n- P(A \u2229 \u00acB) is the probability that both A and \u00acB occur.\n\nWe know:\n- P(A) = 1/2\n- P(B) = 1/3\n- P(A | \u00acB) = 1/4\n\nFrom the definition of conditional probability, we have:\n\\[P(A|\u00acB) = \\frac{P(A \u2229 \u00acB)}{P(\u00acB)}\\]\n\nAnd from the law of total probability, we know that:\n\\[P(A) = P(A|B)P(B) + P(A|\u00acB)P(\u00acB)\\]\n\nFirst, we need to find P(\u00acB):\n\\[P(\u00acB) = 1 - P(B) = 1 - 1/3 = 2/3\\]\n\nThen, using the definition of conditional probability for P(A|\u00acB), we get:\n\\[1/4 = \\frac{P(A \u2229 \u00acB)}{2/3}\\]\n\nSolving for P(A \u2229 \u00acB), we find:\n\\[P(A \u2229 \u00acB) = \\frac{1}{4} * \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{1}{6}\\]\n\nNow, we can use the law of total probability to find P(A|B). We rearrange the equation:\n\\[P(A) = P(A|B)P(B) + P(A|\u00acB)P(\u00acB)\\]\nto solve for P(A|B):\n\\[P(A|B) = \\frac{P(A) - P(A|\u00acB)P(\u00acB)}{P(B)}\\]\n\nSubstituting the known values:\n\\[P(A|B) = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{4} * \\frac{2}{3}}{\\frac{1}{3}}\\]\n\\[P(A|B) = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{6}}{\\frac{1}{3}}\\]\n\\[P(A|B) = \\frac{\\frac{3}{6} - \\frac{1}{6}}{\\frac{1}{3}}\\]\n\\[P(A|B) = \\frac{\\frac{2}{6}}{\\frac{1}{3}}\\]\n\\[P(A|B) = \\frac{1}{3} * 3\\]\n\\[P(A|B) = 1\\]\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. 1."
