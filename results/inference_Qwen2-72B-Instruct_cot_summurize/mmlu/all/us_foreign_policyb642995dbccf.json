Required the United States and Russia to dismantle a significant number of their nuclear weapons\n\nThe Moscow Treaty, also known as the Treaty Between the United States of America and the Russian Federation on Strategic Offensive Reductions (SORT), was signed on May 24, 2002. It required both countries to reduce their strategic nuclear warheads to between 1,700 and 2,200 by December 31, 2012. This treaty was aimed at reducing the number of deployed strategic nuclear weapons, rather than eliminating them entirely. The reductions were achieved through the dismantlement of delivery systems and the deactivation or elimination of warheads."
