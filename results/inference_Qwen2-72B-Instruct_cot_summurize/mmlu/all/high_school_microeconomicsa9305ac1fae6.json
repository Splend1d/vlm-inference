This is because when MC = MR, the firm is maximizing its profit by ensuring that the additional cost of producing one more unit (MC) is equal to the additional revenue gained from selling that unit (MR). Producing more than this point would result in lower profits because the cost of producing an extra unit would exceed the revenue it brings in."
