I believe that the rights of the free colored persons need only to be vindicated before the U.S. Supreme Court, to be obtained; that no prejudice or sophistry . . . can prevent their acknowledgement . . . and that the present laws, affecting your condition, are clearly unconstitutional. The fact that you have been treated, by common consent and common usage, as aliens and brutes, is not proof that such treatment is legal, but only shows the strength, the bitterness, and the blindness of prejudice.\"\n\u2014William Lloyd Garrison, \"To the Free People of Color of the United States,\" The Liberator, January 15, 1831\nThe argument put forth by William Lloyd Garrison in the passage was later contradicted in which of the following Supreme Court decisions?\n\nA. Dred Scott v. Sanford (1857)\nB. Ex parte Milligan (1866)\nC. Plessy v. Ferguson (1896)\nD. Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka (1954)\n"

Sanford decision, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that African Americans, whether enslaved or free, could not be considered American citizens and therefore could not sue in federal court. This directly contradicts the argument put forth by William Lloyd Garrison, who believed that free people of color were indeed American citizens entitled to all the rights and privileges thereof."
