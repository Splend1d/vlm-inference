Each state represents one of these remainders. When reading a 0, we transition to another state based on how this affects the remainder when divided by \\(k\\).\n\nFor the second condition, tracking whether the number of 1s is odd or even, we need 2 states: one for an even number of 1s and one for an odd number of 1s. When reading a 1, we toggle between these two states.\n\nHowever, these conditions must be met simultaneously, which means we need a combination of both types of states. This results in a total of \\(k \\times 2 = 2k\\) states if we consider each condition independently and assume they can be combined linearly.\n\nBut, the correct way to combine these conditions is to create a product automaton where each state keeps track of both the number of 0s modulo \\(k\\) and whether the number of 1s is odd or even. Since there are \\(k\\) possible states for the number of 0s modulo \\(k\\) and 2 possible states for the parity of the number of 1s, the total number of states needed is \\(k \\times 2\\). However, since the question asks for the minimum number of states in a DFA, we should consider the full Cartesian product of the two sets of states, which is indeed \\(k \\times k = k^2\\) states.\n\nThus, the correct answer is D. \\(k^2\\)."
