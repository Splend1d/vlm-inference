It eventually collapsed due to climate change and drought.\n\nThe analysis of oxygen isotope ratios in the shells of gastropods (freshwater snails) can provide information about past environmental conditions, including temperature and precipitation patterns. In the context of the Indus Valley Civilization, studies of such isotopes in lake sediments have indeed suggested that the region experienced a decline in monsoon intensity and increased aridity around 4,000 years ago. This shift in climate is believed to have contributed to the decline of the Indus Valley Civilization by reducing water availability for agriculture and supporting the theory that the civilization eventually collapsed due to climate change and drought."
