This fallacy occurs when an argument is made that a proposition must be true because many or most people believe it, regardless of the actual evidence for or against the proposition.\n\nHere's a brief explanation of the other options for clarity:\n\nA. Poisoning the well: This fallacy involves preemptively discrediting someone's argument by attacking the arguer's character or circumstances instead of addressing the argument itself.\n\nC. Ad Numerum: This is similar to the common person appeal and refers to the fallacy of arguing that something is true because many people believe it or because it has been believed for a long time. It's often considered synonymous with the appeal to popularity.\n\nD. Suppressed Evidence: This fallacy occurs when someone deliberately withholds relevant information or evidence that would weaken their argument or strengthen the opposing argument."
