There were no palaces, public architecture, and little evidence for status differentiation.\n\nCatalhoyuk is considered a large village rather than a city because it lacks some of the characteristics typically associated with urban centers. The site does show signs of early agriculture and domestication, so option B is incorrect. Option C is also incorrect since there is evidence of art and ritual activities at the site. Option D is partially correct, but option A better captures the essence of why Catalhoyuk is not classified as a city, as the absence of palaces and public architecture suggests a lack of centralized authority or social stratification that is often present in cities."
