They typically consist of a weak acid and its conjugate base, or a weak base and its conjugate acid. When you mix a strong base with a strong acid, the reaction goes to completion, resulting in the formation of water and a salt. The resulting solution will not have the properties of a buffer because it lacks the necessary components to resist changes in pH."
