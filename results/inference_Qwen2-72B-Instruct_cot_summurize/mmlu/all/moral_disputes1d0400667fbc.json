Doctors are as qualified as any other mature adult to decide whether a life is worth living.\nB. Doctors are normally required to make life-and-death decisions, and this is no exception.\nC. The argument is self-defeating because it was proposed by medical doctors.\nD. The law only requires doctors to make medical decisions about the patient's life expectancy and prognosis.\n"

The law only requires doctors to make medical decisions about the patient's life expectancy and prognosis.\n\nThis statement suggests that the role of the doctor in the Oregon physician-assisted law is limited to making medical assessments rather than moral or existential judgments about the value of a patient's life. This would address the concern that doctors might not be qualified to determine if a life is worth living by clarifying that their role is specifically defined within the scope of medical expertise."
