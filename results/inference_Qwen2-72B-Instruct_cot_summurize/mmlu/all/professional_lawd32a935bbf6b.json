The promotional material claimed patented methods and nutritional supplements that were a \"miraculous discovery\" that would work for anyone within 24 months. The cost was $1,000 per month; the woman paid a total of $24,000 for two years but she lost only 6 pounds and remained excessively obese. A former program employee told her that there was no patent, no miraculous discovery, and the supplements were the same as a common vitamin brand. She sued the program for misrepresentation. Will she likely prevail?\n\nA. No, because statements that are mere \"puffing\" or opinions cannot be the basis for misrepresentation.\nB. Yes, because the program had a fiduciary duty to make full disclosure to her of all of the facts.\nC. No, because she did not justifiably rely on the incredible representations that were made.\nD. Yes, because the program knowingly made false factual representations that the customer relied on.\n"

Yes, because the program knowingly made false factual representations that the customer relied on.\n\nThe woman is likely to prevail in her lawsuit because the weight loss program made specific factual claims that turned out to be false. These included the existence of a patented method, a miraculous discovery, and unique nutritional supplements. When these claims were found to be untrue (the methods were not patented, the discovery was not miraculous, and the supplements were just common vitamins), it can be argued that the program engaged in misrepresentation. The woman relied on these false representations when she decided to pay for the program, which resulted in financial loss for her since the promised results were not achieved."
