Lamarck proposed that organisms could inherit characteristics acquired during their lifetimes\u2014a concept known as Lamarckism or the theory of the inheritance of acquired characteristics. According to Lamarck, if an organism used a particular part of its body or adapted to environmental conditions during its life, these adaptations would be passed on to its offspring.\n\nIn contrast, Charles Darwin's theory of natural selection (Option D) suggests that traits that are advantageous for survival and reproduction become more common in a population over time not because they are acquired during an individual's lifetime but because individuals with those traits are more likely to survive and pass them on genetically to their offspring. This does not involve the direct acquisition and inheritance of traits developed during an organism's life.\n\nNeither Georges Cuvier (Option A), who was a proponent of catastrophism and did not support evolutionary ideas, nor James Hutton (Option B), often called the \"father of modern geology\" and known for his theory of uniformitarianism, had theories that directly related to Lysenko's methods for creating cold-tolerant wheat."
