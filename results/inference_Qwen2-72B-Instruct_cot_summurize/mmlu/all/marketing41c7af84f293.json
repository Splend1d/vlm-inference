Because they are costly and intended to last for several years, they often involve a higher level of consumer risk than non-durable goods, which are typically less expensive and have a shorter lifespan. Impulse goods are purchased on a whim without much thought or planning, while luxury goods are high-end products that may not necessarily be used frequently or be essential. Non-durable goods are consumed quickly and need to be replaced often, such as food or toiletries."
