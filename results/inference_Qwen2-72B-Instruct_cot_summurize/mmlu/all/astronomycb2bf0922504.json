In science, theories are not proven to be correct, but rather they are supported by evidence until they are disproven or replaced by a better explanation. This is known as the scientific method, which involves making observations, forming hypotheses, testing those hypotheses through experiments, and revising or rejecting them based on the results. So, even if you and many others have tested the hypothesis and found support for it, it still remains open to further testing and potential refutation."
