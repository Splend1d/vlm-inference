He knew that the Russian troops could reach the southern tip of Korea before American troops could arrive. He also knew that the Russians were on the verge of moving into Korea, or were already there. The nearest American troops to Korea were on Okinawa, 600 miles away. His problem, therefore, was to compose a surrender arrangement which, while acceptable to the Russians, would at the same time prevent them from seizing all of Korea. If they refused to confine their advance to north Korea, the United States would be unable to stop them. . . . He decided to use the 38th parallel as a hypothetical line dividing the zones within which Japanese forces in Korea would surrender to appointed American and Russian authorities.\n\u2014Adapted from U.S. Army Lt. Paul C. McGrath's account of Colonel Bonesteel's decision in the 1940s\nHow did the events depicted here affect Koreans?\n\nA. They became a part of Japan\u2019s territory.\nB. The Americans established freedom for all Koreans.\nC. The Korean economy never recovered.\nD. Korea remains divided into two nations near the 38th parallel.\n"

Korea remains divided into two nations near the 38th parallel.\n\nColonel Bonesteel's decision to use the 38th parallel as a dividing line for the surrender of Japanese forces in Korea ultimately resulted in the division of the country. This division was initially intended as a temporary administrative measure but became permanent due to the geopolitical tensions of the Cold War. As a result, Korea has remained split into two separate nations: North Korea (officially the Democratic People's Republic of Korea) and South Korea (officially the Republic of Korea), with the border running close to the 38th parallel. This division has had profound consequences for the Korean people, including political, economic, and social differences between the two countries, as well as the ongoing issue of reunification."
