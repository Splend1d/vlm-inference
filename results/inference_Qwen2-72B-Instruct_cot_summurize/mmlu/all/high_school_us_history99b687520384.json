It is well to notice this advantage\u2014the advantage of complete organization. They are organized; and yet were not at the pains of creating their organizations. The State governments, where the system of slavery exists, are complete slavery organizations. The church organizations in those States are equally at the service of slavery; while the Federal Government, with its army and navy, from the chief magistracy in Washington, to the Supreme Court, and thence to the chief marshalship at New York, is pledged to support, defend, and propagate the crying curse of human bondage. The pen, the purse, and the sword, are united against the simple truth, preached by humble men in obscure places.\"\nFrederick Douglass, 1857\nFrederick Douglass was most influenced by which of the following social movements?\n\nA.

However, considering the context and the time period, it's most likely that Douglass was influenced by the **Second Great Awakening** (Option B). This religious revival movement emphasized personal salvation, the importance of individual moral integrity, and was a catalyst for various reform movements in the United States during the early to mid-19th century, including the abolitionist movement against slavery.\n\nDouglass himself was a prominent leader in the abolitionist movement and used his powerful oratory skills and publications to advocate for the end of slavery. His criticism of the government and societal institutions aligns with the reformist spirit of the Second Great Awakening, which sought to improve society through moral and religious transformation.\n\nThe other options do not fit as well:\n\n- A. First Great Awakening: While also a religious revival, it occurred earlier and did not have as significant an impact on the abolitionist movement as the Second Great Awakening.\n- C. Manifest Destiny: This was the belief that American settlers were destined to expand across North America. It is not directly related to Douglass's work against slavery.\n- D. Popular Sovereignty: This concept allowed residents of a territory to decide whether to permit slavery within their borders, a contentious issue that contributed to the lead-up to the Civil War but was not a primary influence on Douglass's anti-slavery efforts."
