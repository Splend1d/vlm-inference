All the numbers in the pattern can be divided equally by 10.\n   - This is not necessarily true. For example, 28 is not divisible by 10, so this statement is false.\n\nB. All the numbers in the pattern can be divided equally by 4.\n   - Let's check if the numbers are divisible by 4. \n     - 28 \u00f7 4 = 7 (True)\n     - 42 \u00f7 4 = 10.5 (False)\n     - 56 \u00f7 4 = 14 (True)\n     - 70 \u00f7 4 = 17.5 (False)\n   Since not all numbers are divisible by 4, this statement is false.\n\nC. All the numbers in the pattern can be divided equally by 8.\n   - Let's check if the numbers are divisible by 8.\n     - 28 \u00f7 8 = 3.5 (False)\n     - 42 \u00f7 8 = 5.25 (False)\n     - 56 \u00f7 8 = 7 (True)\n     - 70 \u00f7 8 = 8.75 (False)\n   Since not all numbers are divisible by 8, this statement is false.\n\nD. All the numbers in the pattern can be divided equally by 7.\n   - Let's check if the numbers are divisible by 7.\n     - 28 \u00f7 7 = 4 (True)\n     - 42 \u00f7 7 = 6 (True)\n     - 56 \u00f7 7 = 8 (True)\n     - 70 \u00f7 7 = 10 (True)\n   Since 14 is a multiple of 7, and we're adding 14 to each subsequent number, all numbers in this pattern will indeed be divisible by 7.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **D**. All the numbers in the pattern can be divided equally by 7."
