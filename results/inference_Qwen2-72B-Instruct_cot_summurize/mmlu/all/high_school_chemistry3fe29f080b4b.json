                    "text": "Resonance structures occur when there is more than one valid way to draw the Lewis structure of a molecule with the same connectivity but different positions of electrons (double bonds or lone pairs). Let's analyze each of these molecules:\n\nA. **CO2** - Carbon dioxide has a linear structure with carbon in the center and two oxygen atoms at either end. Each oxygen atom is double-bonded to carbon. There are no additional ways to draw this structure while keeping the same connectivity and maintaining octet rules, so it does not have resonance structures.\n\nB. **CO3^2-** - Carbonate ion has a central carbon atom bonded to three oxygen atoms. Two of the oxygens are singly bonded, and one is doubly bonded. However, due to the symmetry of the molecule, the double bond can be considered to \"shift\" between any of the three oxygen atoms, creating three equivalent resonance structures. This means that carbonate ion does indeed have resonance structures.\n\nC. **NO2^-** - Nitrite ion has nitrogen as the central atom bonded to two oxygen atoms. One oxygen atom is singly bonded, and one is doubly bonded. The nitrogen atom also carries a negative charge. Similar to the carbonate ion, the double bond and the negative charge can shift between the two oxygen atoms, creating two resonance structures.\n\nD. **NO3^-** - Nitrate ion has nitrogen as the central atom bonded to three oxygen atoms. All three oxygen atoms are singly bonded to nitrogen, but one of them also has a negative charge. Like carbonate, nitrate has resonance structures where the negative charge and the extra electron can shift among the three oxygen atoms, creating three equivalent resonance structures.\n\nBased on this analysis, the molecules that are best represented by multiple resonance structures are **CO3^2-**, **NO2^-**, and **NO3^-**.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. CO32-, NO2-, and NO3-"
