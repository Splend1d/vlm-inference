Although\\he driver immediately applied his brakes and swerved to avoid the girl, the cat hit the girl, fracturing her legs. As the girl was lying in the street awaiting an ambulance, the driver rushed over to her and said: \"Im terribly sorry. This is the first time I ever drove this car. I don't know what happened, but it must have been my fault. Send me all your hospital bills. I'fl pay for everything. \"When the girl was later released from the hospital, her parents contacted the driver who refused to pay anything. The driver told the girl's mother, \"Since your daughter ran into the street, it was her fault. I have witnesses who saw what she did. If I weren't such a nice guy, I'd sue you for the damage to my new car. \"If the girl's parents, on her behalf, sue the driver in tort, which of the following is the most accurate statement regarding the driver's post-accident statements?\n\nA.

The driver's statement regarding his operation of the car is admissible on the issue of negligence, but his statement concerning payment of the hospital bills is not admissible in accordance with public policy considerations.\n\nThe driver's statement about his operation of the car can be considered an admission that may be relevant to establishing negligence. However, the offer to pay the hospital bills is typically not admissible as evidence of liability because of public policy considerations that discourage penalizing individuals for attempting to settle claims or compensate victims without admitting legal responsibility. This rule is intended to promote settlement and avoid discouraging parties from making offers to pay medical expenses out of humanitarian concerns."
