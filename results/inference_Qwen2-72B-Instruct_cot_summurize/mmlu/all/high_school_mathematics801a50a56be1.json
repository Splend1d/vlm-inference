Since he divided them into two equal piles, each pile has \\(\\frac{P}{2}\\) pins.\n\nHe then gave away one-half of one-third of one pile, which is \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{P}{2} = \\frac{P}{12}\\).\n\nAfter giving away that portion, John has \\(P - \\frac{P}{12}\\) pins left. But we know that after giving away these pins, he has 66 pins left. Therefore,\n\n\\[P - \\frac{P}{12} = 66\\]\n\n\\[12P - P = 792\\]\n\n\\[11P = 792\\]\n\n\\[P = 72\\]\n\nSo, John originally had 72 pins.\n\nThe correct answer is B. 72. However, it's important to note that this solution assumes John only had 72 pins initially, and after giving away \\(\\frac{72}{12} = 6\\) pins, he was left with 66 pins. This fits the given conditions perfectly. But if we were looking for the total number of pins before dividing them into two piles (which could be interpreted from the question), we'd need to double our answer since the problem implies he divided all his pins equally into two piles. In that case, the answer would be \\(72 \\times 2 = 144\\), but since this option isn't provided, the closest correct answer based on the information given is B. 72."
