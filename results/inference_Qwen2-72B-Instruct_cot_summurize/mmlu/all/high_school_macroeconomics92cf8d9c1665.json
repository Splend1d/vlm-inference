Structural unemployment\n\nStructural unemployment occurs when there is a mismatch between the skills that workers have and the skills needed for the jobs available, or when industries decline or disappear due to technological change, globalization, or other structural changes in the economy. In this case, the dark room technician's job became obsolete due to the shift from film cameras to digital photography, leading to structural unemployment."
