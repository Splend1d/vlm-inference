                    "text": "The correct answer is A. They have a relative evolutionary fitness of zero.\n\nExplanation:\nMules are sterile hybrids resulting from the mating of a male horse (stallion) and a female donkey (jenny). They typically have 63 chromosomes, an odd number, which makes it impossible for them to undergo successful meiosis and produce viable gametes. As a result, mules cannot reproduce sexually and pass on their genes to the next generation. This means they have a relative evolutionary fitness of zero because they do not contribute genetically to future generations.\n\nB. Their offspring have less genetic variation than the parents - This statement is incorrect because mules cannot produce offspring due to their sterility.\n\nC. Mutations cannot occur in their genomes - Mutations can still occur in the genomes of mules, but since they cannot reproduce, these mutations will not be passed on to future generations.\n\nD. If crossing-over happens in mules, then it must be limited to prophase of mitosis - Crossing-over occurs during prophase I of meiosis, not mitosis. Since mules cannot undergo successful meiosis, crossing-over does not happen in mules."
