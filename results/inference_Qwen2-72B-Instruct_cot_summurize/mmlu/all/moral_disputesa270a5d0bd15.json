It holds that true social harmony can only be achieved when individuals voluntarily internalize and act upon shared values and norms. Coercion, in this view, may produce temporary compliance but cannot lead to genuine changes in attitudes and beliefs. Therefore, the Confucian model rejects coercion in favor of persuasion, example, and the cultivation of virtue."
