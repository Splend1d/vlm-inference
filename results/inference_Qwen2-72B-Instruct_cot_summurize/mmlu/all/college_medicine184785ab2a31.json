They can be covalently or non-covalently bound but are typically not removed under normal conditions. Prosthetic groups include heme, flavin, and metal ions, among others, which play critical roles in various enzymatic reactions. Not all enzymes require prosthetic groups, so option A is incorrect. Option B is incorrect because prosthetic groups are not loosely bound; they are tightly bound to the enzyme. Option C is incorrect because allosteric sites are different from prosthetic groups; allosteric sites are regions on an enzyme where regulatory molecules bind to modulate the enzyme's activity."
