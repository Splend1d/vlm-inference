The Minstrel, B. The Archer, and C. The Bookworm) all made appearances as guest villains in various episodes. However, it's worth noting that these characters were not part of the core group of villains that included the likes of the Joker, the Penguin, Catwoman, and the Riddler. They were more obscure characters created specifically for the show. \"The Squeegee Guy\" is not a known character from the Batman universe and did not appear in the series."
