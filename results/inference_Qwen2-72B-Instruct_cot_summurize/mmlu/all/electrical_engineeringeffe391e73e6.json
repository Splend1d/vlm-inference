This is because they measure the point at which two quantities are equal (the null point), which eliminates many sources of error that can affect deflection type instruments. However, it's worth noting that null type instruments may not necessarily have a faster response or lower sensitivity; these characteristics depend on the specific design and application of the instrument."
