Hold onto the goods and make the best of them because a business cannot reject goods already approved by a written agreement signed by both parties.\nB. Try the goods out for several months; if they are not going to be satisfactory, then ship them back to the seller who must provide a refund.\nC.

According to the Uniform Commercial Code (U.C.C.), when a buyer receives nonconforming goods, they have the right to reject the goods if the nonconformity substantially impairs their value. The buyer should identify and document the nonconformity and promptly notify the seller of the rejection. The buyer can then return the goods to the seller at the seller's expense. Holding onto the goods without notifying the seller or trying them out for an extended period before returning them would not be in accordance with the U.C.C. provisions regarding nonconforming goods."
