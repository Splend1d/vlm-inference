At trial, the widow offered the testimony of a coworker of the husband. The coworker testified that he had seen the rail car on which the husband was riding slow down and the cars behind it gain speed. The coworker also stated that he later heard a loud crash, but did not turn around to look because loud noises were common in the yard. Three other railroad employees testified that no collision had occurred. At the close of the evidence, the railroad moved for judgment as a matter of law, which was denied, and the case was submitted to the jury. The jury returned a verdict for the widow. The railroad has made a renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law. What standard should the court apply to determine how to rule on the motion?\n\nA. Whether the evidence revealed a genuine dispute of material fact supporting the widow's claim.\nB. Whether the verdict is against the weight of the evidence.\nC. Whether the widow presented a scintilla of evidence to support the verdict.\nD. Whether there is substantial evidence in the record to support the verdict, resolving all disputed issues in the widow's favor.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is D. In considering a motion for judgment as a matter of law (JMOL) after a jury verdict, the court must determine whether there is substantial evidence in the record to support the verdict, resolving all disputed issues in favor of the non-moving party. This means that if there is any substantial evidence to support the jury's finding, the motion should be denied. Substantial evidence is more than a mere scintilla but can be somewhat less than a preponderance of the evidence. It is evidence adequate to support the conclusion of a rational factfinder.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while a genuine dispute of material fact may exist if there is substantial evidence, the standard for JMOL focuses specifically on whether the evidence presented is sufficient to support the verdict, not just whether there is a dispute.\n\nOption B is incorrect because a motion for JMOL is not concerned with the weight of the evidence but rather with whether there is a legally sufficient evidentiary basis for the jury's verdict.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the \"scintilla of evidence\" standard is too low; a party must present more than a mere scintilla of evidence to survive a motion for JMOL. There must be substantial evidence to support the verdict."
