The surface area \\(S\\) of a cube with side length \\(a\\) is given by:\n\\[S = 6a^2\\]\n\nFor the cube with side length 2 feet:\n\\[S = 6(2)^2 = 24 \\text{ square feet}\\]\n\nWe know that 16 quarts of paint are required to cover 24 square feet of the cube's surface area. We can use this information to find out how much surface area 169 quarts of paint will cover, assuming the same rate of coverage per quart.\n\nLet \\(x\\) be the side length of the cube that can be covered with 169 quarts of paint. Then, its surface area is \\(6x^2\\). We can set up a ratio based on the given information:\n\\[\\frac{16 \\text{ quarts}}{24 \\text{ sq ft}} = \\frac{169 \\text{ quarts}}{6x^2 \\text{ sq ft}}\\]\n\nCross-multiplying gives us:\n\\[16 \\cdot 6x^2 = 169 \\cdot 24\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\\[96x^2 = 4056\\]\n\nDividing both sides by 96:\n\\[x^2 = 42.25\\]\n\nTaking the square root of both sides:\n\\[x = \\sqrt{42.25} = 6.5\\]\n\nHowever, none of the options match 6.5, but looking at the answer choices and the question again, we might have missed converting or interpreting something correctly. Given the options, the correct interpretation should lead us to an option, which is:\n\n\\[x = \\frac{13}{2}\\]\n\nThis matches choice C. So, the correct answer is:\n\nC. \\(\\frac{13}{2}\\)"
