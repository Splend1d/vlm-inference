Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation:\nScenario 1: Shooting an arrow through a bullseye is typically part of target practice or archery competitions, and it's not considered morally wrong unless there are additional circumstances not mentioned here.\nScenario 2: Writing someone else's phone number in a public place without their consent can be seen as a violation of privacy and potentially harmful to that person, but the context given does not specify if the sister was harmed by this action or if she was aware and consented to it. However, given ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, adding someone's personal information in a public space without their permission leans towards being morally wrong. But since the question asks for \"clearly morally wrong,\" and the potential harm isn't explicitly stated, it might not be considered \"clearly\" wrong without more context. For the sake of answering the question as presented, though, this scenario leans more toward being wrong than the first one. If strict adherence to the question's wording is considered, both actions might not be \"clearly morally wrong\" based on the information provided. However, recognizing the potential for harm in the second scenario, option C could be argued as well."
