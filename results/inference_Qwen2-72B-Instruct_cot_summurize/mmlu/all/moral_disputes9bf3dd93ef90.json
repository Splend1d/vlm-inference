This is often based on the belief that humans have a higher moral status than animals because of their ability to reason, think abstractly, and make ethical decisions. However, this argument is controversial and has been challenged by many philosophers and animal rights advocates who argue that animals are capable of experiencing pain and suffering in a way that is comparable to humans, and therefore deserve to be treated with respect and compassion. Option B is the correct answer."
