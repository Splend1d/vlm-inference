Two unequal partners become one after a buyout.\n\nAn acquisition typically takes place when one company (the acquirer) purchases another company (the target or acquiree) and gains control over it, often by buying the majority or all of its shares. This results in the two companies becoming one, with the acquirer being the surviving entity. The other options describe different types of business relationships, such as partnerships or collaborations, but they do not specifically define an acquisition."
