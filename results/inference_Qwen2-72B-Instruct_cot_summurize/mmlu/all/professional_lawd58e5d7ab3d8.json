Assume that each person listed below as the grantee in a deed paid value and took without actual notice of any facts that would defeat her title and without knowledge of any facts that would put her on inquiry, both at the time she took her deed and at the time she recorded it. The following conveyances, each by a general warranty deed, take place in the order listed: An artist conveys to a bartender; the developer conveys to the artist; the artist conveys to a counselor; the bartender conveys to a dentist; the counselor conveys to an engineer. No deed was recorded until after the artist-to- counselor deed was executed and then before the execution of any other deed, the order of recording was as follows: developer to artist; artist to bartender; artist to counselor. The bartender-to-dentist deed and counselor-to- engineer deed were each recorded immediately after their respective executions.

In this case, we have a series of conveyances and recordings, and we need to determine who has the best claim to the property based on these facts.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the conveyances and recordings:\n\n1. Developer to Artist (Deed A): This deed was executed and later recorded.\n2. Artist to Bartender (Deed B): This deed was executed and recorded after Deed A was recorded but before any other deeds.\n3. Artist to Counselor (Deed C): This deed was executed after Deed B and recorded immediately after Deed A was recorded.\n4. Bartender to Dentist (Deed D): This deed was executed and recorded after all previous deeds were recorded.\n5. Counselor to Engineer (Deed E): This deed was executed and recorded after all previous deeds were recorded.\n\nThe key issue here is the fact that the Artist conveyed the property twice: once to the Bartender (Deed B) and once to the Counselor (Deed C). Since the Bartender's deed (Deed B) was recorded before the Counselor's deed (Deed C), the Bartender would have priority over the Counselor under a notice statute because the Counselor would be deemed to have constructive notice of the Bartender's prior recorded deed upon executing Deed C.\n\nHowever, the Dentist's claim comes into play next. The Dentist's deed (Deed D) was recorded after all previous deeds, but since the Dentist would not have had notice of the Artist's conveyance to the Counselor (as it was recorded after Deed D's execution), the Dentist would have priority over the Engineer based on the fact that the Dentist's deed was recorded before the Counselor's conveyance to the Engineer (Deed E).\n\nThus, the owner of the parcel of land in a notice jurisdiction is **C. the dentist**."
