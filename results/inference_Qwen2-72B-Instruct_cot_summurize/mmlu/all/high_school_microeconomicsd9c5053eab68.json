When the supply curve shifts to the right, it means that more of the product is being supplied at all prices, which also puts downward pressure on the price. When both happen simultaneously, the equilibrium price will certainly fall because the quantity demanded will be lower at every price, while the quantity supplied will be higher at every price, leading to an excess supply situation that drives down the price."
