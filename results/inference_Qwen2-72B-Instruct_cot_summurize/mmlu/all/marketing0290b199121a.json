Social pressure to develop more fuel-efficient vehicles with fewer dangerous emissions.\n\nThe development of hybrid vehicles like Toyota's Prius and Honda's hybrid Civic was largely inspired by growing concerns over fuel efficiency, environmental impact, and emissions. These vehicles were designed to address social pressures for more sustainable transportation options in response to issues such as climate change, air pollution, and the finite nature of fossil fuels."
