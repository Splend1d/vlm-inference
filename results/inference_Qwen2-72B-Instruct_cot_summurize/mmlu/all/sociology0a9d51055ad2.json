Among the options you've given, the policy that New Labour did not generally support was:\n\nC. supporting LEAs (Local Education Authorities) that appeared to be failing\n\nInstead, New Labour's approach to failing schools and LEAs was typically interventionist rather than supportive. They introduced measures such as the \"Education Action Zones,\" \"City Academies\" (later just \"Academies\"), and \"Trust Schools\" to reform failing institutions, often bypassing or replacing the role of LEAs. These interventions often involved bringing in private sector partners, changing school governance structures, and increasing central government control over failing schools.\n\nHere's a brief overview of the other policies you mentioned:\n\nA. Setting and streaming pupils by ability - New Labour did support setting (grouping students by ability for certain subjects), although this was not universally applied across all schools. The policy of streaming (grouping students by ability for all subjects throughout their school career) was less favored, but some schools continued to practice it.\n\nB. Parental choice of school - This was a key policy of New Labour, who wanted to increase competition among schools and give parents more say in where their children were educated. This included expanding the number of specialist schools, academies, and free schools, which parents could choose based on the school's strengths and their child's interests.\n\nD. State regulation and control of the curriculum - New Labour significantly increased state regulation and control over the curriculum, including the introduction of national tests (SATs) at ages 7, 11, 14, and 16, and the expansion of the National Curriculum to include more subjects and detail. They also introduced performance tables and league tables to hold schools accountable for their results."
