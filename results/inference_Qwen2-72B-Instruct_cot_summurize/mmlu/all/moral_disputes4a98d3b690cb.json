According to philosopher Carl Cohen, animals cannot be bearers of rights because they lack the capacity for rationality and autonomy that he believes is necessary for moral agency and the possession of rights. In his view, only beings who can make moral judgments and act on them can have rights, and animals do not meet this criterion. However, it's worth noting that this view is controversial and many philosophers disagree with Cohen's position, arguing that animals can and should be granted certain rights based on their capacity for suffering and well-being."
