Each of these factors has contributed to the exclusion of women from the public sphere at various points in history and continues to do so in different ways today.\n\nA. Industrial capitalism separated the middle-class home from the workplace, creating a division between the private (domestic) and public (work) spheres. This division often relegated women to the private sphere as caretakers and homemakers, while men were expected to participate in the public sphere as breadwinners and decision-makers.\n\nB. Women who entered paid employment were often steered into certain fields that were considered more \"feminine\" or suitable for women, such as teaching, nursing, or secretarial work. These fields were often lower paying and less prestigious than those dominated by men, which helped to maintain gender inequality in the workforce.\n\nC. It can be challenging for women to succeed in male-dominated fields like politics without being perceived as compromising their femininity. Women politicians may face criticism for not being feminine enough if they display assertiveness or toughness, or they may be criticized for being too feminine if they display traits traditionally associated with women. This double standard makes it difficult for women to find a balance that will allow them to succeed in these malestream environments without facing backlash.\n\nAll of these factors have contributed to the historical and ongoing exclusion of women from the public sphere."
