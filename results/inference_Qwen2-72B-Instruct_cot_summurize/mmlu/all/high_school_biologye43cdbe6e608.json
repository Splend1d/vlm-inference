This form of natural selection favors the average phenotype and reduces variation, leading to a decrease in the frequency of extreme phenotypes. In this case, starlings that produce four to five eggs have higher fitness, while those producing fewer or more eggs have lower fitness. This results in a stabilization around the average clutch size of four to five eggs."
