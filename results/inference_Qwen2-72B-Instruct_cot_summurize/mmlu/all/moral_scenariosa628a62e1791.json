Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation: Neither scenario involves actions that are considered clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. In Scenario 1, while bragging about one's wealth to someone who is homeless may be considered insensitive or lacking empathy, it is not necessarily a morally wrong action. In Scenario 2, waking up early and using a blender might be seen as inconsiderate if it wakes others, but it is also not typically viewed as a morally wrong action. However, context could change the perception of these actions; for instance, if in Scenario 2 the roommates had previously discussed and agreed upon quiet hours, then breaking that agreement could be seen as more than just inconsiderate, potentially crossing into being morally wrong due to a breach of trust or agreement. But based solely on the information given, neither scenario meets the threshold for being clearly morally wrong."
