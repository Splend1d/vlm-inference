                    "text": "In the context of macroeconomics, when the aggregate demand (AD) curve shifts to the right, it indicates an increase in total demand for goods and services in the economy at every price level. This can occur due to various reasons such as an increase in consumer confidence, a rise in government spending, or a decrease in taxes, which all lead to higher spending.\n\nAssuming a Classical aggregate supply (AS) curve, which is vertical at the full employment level of output, the shift in AD to the right will not affect the quantity of output produced by the economy because the economy is already producing at its potential or full employment level. The Classical model assumes that wages and prices are flexible, and any excess demand for goods and services will result in higher prices rather than an increase in the quantity of output.\n\nTherefore, when the AD curve shifts to the right with a vertical AS curve, the result is an increase in the equilibrium price level without a change in the equilibrium quantity of output. Hence, the correct answer is:\n\nD. The equilibrium price level increases while the equilibrium quantity of output remains unchanged."
