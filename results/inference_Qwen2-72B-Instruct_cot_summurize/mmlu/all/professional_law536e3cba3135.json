They bought a house together but the deed went in the man's name alone due to better credit and ability to obtain a mortgage in his name. He worked as a school vice-principal. She gave up her night law school classes to stay home and be a homemaker. She worked as a waitress and paid for all household expenses, food, laundry and other items. He paid for the mortgage, taxes, utilities, insurance, repairs and other expenses. After several years, they became estranged and the man ordered the woman out of the house. She moved out and brought an action to obtain one-half of the home's equity value and a share of the other property and accounts built up in the man's name during the marriage. Which of the following is the best and strongest argument that the woman may assert to obtain a fair share of the property?\n\nA. There is an express contract between them to share the property equally.\nB. He has been unjustly enriched and he owes her restitution under a quasi-contract legal theory.\nC. She is entitled to damages based on a legal theory of fraudulent conversion.\nD. She is may be remunerated under the federal civil rights laws prohibiting gender discrimination.\n"

The doctrine of unjust enrichment allows a person to recover the value of benefits conferred upon another when there is no formal contract or agreement in place. In this case, since the woman gave up her education and career opportunities to contribute to the household, and the man benefited from her contributions by being able to afford the mortgage and other expenses, she may be able to argue that it would be unfair for him to retain all of the property without compensating her for her contributions.\n\nAdditionally, the court may recognize a quasi-contractual obligation between the parties, which is a legal construct used to prevent unjust enrichment when there is no actual contract. This could allow the woman to seek restitution for the value of her contributions to the household and the property.\n\nIt's important to note that the specific laws and legal theories applicable in this scenario will depend on the jurisdiction where the case is being heard. However, the concept of unjust enrichment and quasi-contractual obligations are widely recognized legal principles that could provide the woman with a strong argument for obtaining a fair share of the property."
