The number of chromosomes is reduced.\n\nMeiosis is a type of cell division that results in four daughter cells each having half the number of chromosomes of the parent cell, making it a reduction division. This process is essential for sexual reproduction as it ensures that when two gametes (sperm and egg) fuse during fertilization, the resulting zygote will have the correct number of chromosomes. \n\nA. Is incorrect because the daughter cells produced by meiosis are not genetically identical to the parent cell due to genetic recombination and independent assortment.\n\nB. Is incorrect because homologous chromosomes pair during prophase I, not prophase II.\n\nC. Is incorrect because DNA replication only occurs once, before meiosis I, not before meiosis II."
