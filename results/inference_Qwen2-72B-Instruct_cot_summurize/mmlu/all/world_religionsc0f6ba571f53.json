Confucianism, which emphasizes moral values, social order, and the cultivation of wisdom, has had a profound impact on both Chinese and Korean cultures. Taoism, another major Chinese philosophy, focuses on living in harmony with the Tao (the Way), which is often associated with wisdom and ethical conduct. Buddhism, which entered China from India and spread to Korea, also places a strong emphasis on wisdom and ethical behavior as paths to enlightenment. These traditions have shaped the moral and philosophical landscape of both countries, influencing everything from governance to personal conduct."
