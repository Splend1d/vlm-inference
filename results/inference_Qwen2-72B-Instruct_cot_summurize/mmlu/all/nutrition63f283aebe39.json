This statement is incorrect because pepsinogen is not secreted by the pancreas, but rather by the stomach's chief cells. It also does not require removal of a peptide sequence from the active cleft before it can work; instead, it needs to be converted into its active form, pepsin, by cleavage at the N-terminus.\nB. This statement is incorrect because pancreatic \u03b1-amylase will hydrolyze starch to produce maltose, not free glucose.\nD. This statement is incorrect because the pancreas does not secrete hydrochloric acid. Hydrochloric acid is secreted by the stomach lining and is needed to provide the correct pH for enzymes like pepsin. The pancreas actually secretes bicarbonate to neutralize the acidic chyme entering the duodenum from the stomach, creating an optimal pH for the activity of pancreatic enzymes."
