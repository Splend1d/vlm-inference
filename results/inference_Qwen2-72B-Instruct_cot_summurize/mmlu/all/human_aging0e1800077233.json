We are all growing older: Aging is an inevitable part of life, and understanding how it affects our bodies and minds can help us live healthier and more fulfilling lives.\n\nB. The number and proportion of older adults is increasing: As the global population ages, there will be a greater demand for healthcare services, social support, and retirement planning. Understanding aging can help policymakers develop effective strategies to address these challenges.\n\nC. More job opportunities are available for those with some knowledge of aging: With the growing demand for services related to aging, there are many career opportunities in fields such as gerontology, healthcare, social work, and long-term care. Having knowledge about aging can enhance one's employability in these areas."
