Plants of the same genetic variety have flowers that range in color from blue to pink with the color varying due to the type of soil in which they are grown. Which of the following statement best explains this phenomenon?\n\nA. The alleles for flower color show incomplete dominance where neither trait is dominant; expression of the genes shows a blending of traits.\nB. The alleles for flower color are codominant; both traits show depending on the environment.\nC. In this case, the environment alters the expression of a trait.\nD. The genes for flower color show polygenic inheritance.\n"

In this case, the environment alters the expression of a trait.\n\nThe color of hydrangea flowers can be influenced by the pH level of the soil, which is an environmental factor. In acidic soils (pH below 7), hydrangeas typically produce blue flowers, while in alkaline soils (pH above 7), they produce pink flowers. This is because the pH affects the availability of aluminum ions in the soil, which in turn influences the color of the flowers. Thus, the expression of the flower color trait is altered by the environmental conditions rather than being determined solely by the plant's genetics."
