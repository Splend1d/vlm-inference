Participants in the Seneca Falls Convention.\n\nThe Married Women's Property Act of 1848, which granted married women the right to own, control, and dispose of their property independently of their husbands, aligns with the principles advocated by early feminists and women's rights activists. The Seneca Falls Convention, held in 1848, was the first women's rights convention and was organized by women such as Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Lucretia Mott, who sought to address various injustices faced by women, including property rights. Therefore, participants in the Seneca Falls Convention would be most likely to support the perspective of the Married Women's Property Act."
