This includes not only human genetic variation but also that of pathogens and other organisms. NGS allows for the detailed analysis of genomes at an unprecedented scale and speed, enabling researchers to identify mutations, polymorphisms, and other genetic differences that might be associated with diseases, drug responses, or evolutionary traits.\n\nThat being said, NGS can indeed be used for speedy vaccine development (A), giving details on virus excretion in symptomless carriers (C), and quickly identifying new viruses (D). However, these applications are secondary to its core function of identifying genetic variation. For example, in vaccine development, NGS can help in understanding the genetic makeup of a pathogen, which is crucial for designing targeted vaccines. In identifying new viruses, NGS can sequence the genetic material of unknown pathogens rapidly, aiding in outbreak response. And in studying virus excretion in symptomless carriers, NGS can reveal the genetic factors that influence viral shedding and transmission."
