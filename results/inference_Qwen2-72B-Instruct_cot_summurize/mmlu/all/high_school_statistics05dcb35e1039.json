In an experiment, the researcher manipulates some variable to observe its effect on a response variable; in an observational study, he or she simply observes and records the observations. This is the primary difference between an experiment and an observational study. In an experiment, the researcher has control over certain variables and can manipulate them to see how they affect other variables. In an observational study, the researcher does not manipulate any variables, but rather observes and records data as it naturally occurs."
