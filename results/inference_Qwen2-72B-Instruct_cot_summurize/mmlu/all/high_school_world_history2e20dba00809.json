Rules of royal succession\n\nThe song refers to the \"Winter King,\" a title given to Frederick V, who was briefly the King of Bohemia during the Thirty Years' War (1618-1648). The lyrics suggest that Frederick has acted wrongly by taking the crown (\"snatch the kaiser's crown\") and that he should seek forgiveness from Ferdinand, who is described as \"Bohemia's lawful king.\" This implies that there is a dispute over the rightful ruler of Bohemia, which is a matter of royal succession."
