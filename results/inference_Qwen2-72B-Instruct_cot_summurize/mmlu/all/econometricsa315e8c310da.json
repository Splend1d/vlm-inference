Multinomial Logit Model**.\n\nA multinomial logit model is used when the dependent variable is nominal (i.e., has no natural ordering) and consists of more than two categories. In this case, the choices between equity funds, bond funds, and cash investments can be considered nominal categories, making the multinomial logit model suitable for this type of analysis."
