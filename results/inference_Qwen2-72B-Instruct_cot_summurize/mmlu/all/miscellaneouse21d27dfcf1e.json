However, it did have limitations; the exposure times were relatively long (often several minutes), making it difficult to photograph moving subjects or take portraits without some motion blur. Additionally, each daguerreotype was a unique image on a silver-plated copper sheet, so they could not be easily reproduced like modern photographs. The process did not use paper negatives but instead relied on the direct exposure of the metal plate to light."
