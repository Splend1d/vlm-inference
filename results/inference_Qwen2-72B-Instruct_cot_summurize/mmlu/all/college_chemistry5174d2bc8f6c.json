Each chemical bond or group of atoms in a molecule can vibrate in a specific way, and these vibrations correspond to particular frequencies of infrared light. Different functional groups, such as alcohols, amines, esters, etc., have characteristic absorption bands in the infrared spectrum due to their unique vibrational modes. By analyzing the pattern of absorption peaks, chemists can identify the presence of various functional groups in an unknown organic compound, which helps in deducing its structure."
