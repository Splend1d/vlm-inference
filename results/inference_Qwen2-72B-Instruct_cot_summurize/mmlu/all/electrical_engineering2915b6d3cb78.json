This means that you can replace any combination of AND, OR, and NOT gates with an equivalent circuit made only from NOR or only from NAND gates. The other options listed (XOR, XNOR, OR, AND) are not considered universal on their own since they cannot implement all possible logical functions without the help of additional gate types."
