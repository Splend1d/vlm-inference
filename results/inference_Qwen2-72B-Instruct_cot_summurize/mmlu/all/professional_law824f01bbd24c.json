The CEO of the new business told the widget maker's manager that a substantial profit hinged on receiving the widgets. The manufacturer discovered it could not produce the widgets due to equipment failures. The business sued the manufacturer for breach of contract, claiming lost profits of $10 million. The CEO testified to the company's projected sales in detail. A qualified expert supported his lost profit projections; there was no expert testimony by the manufacturer. Will the court allow the company to collect its claimed lost profit damages?\n\nA. No, despite the expert testimony, anticipated profits for a new company are too speculative and are not awarded.\nB. No, because the equipment failures were an excusable occurrence that the manufacturer could not foresee.\nC. Yes, the lost profits damages were sufficiently proven by the evidence, including expert testimony.\nD. Yes, a new company can usually collect its lost profits because it is easier to prove than if the company had many accounts to complicate its projections.\n"

Yes, the lost profits damages were sufficiently proven by the evidence, including expert testimony.\n\nIn this scenario, the new business has provided detailed projected sales information and has supported these projections with expert testimony. This makes their claim for lost profits more credible and less speculative. The court will consider whether the lost profits were reasonably foreseeable at the time the contract was made and whether they have been proven with reasonable certainty. Since there was no contradictory expert testimony from the manufacturer, the court may find that the lost profit damages were sufficiently proven by the evidence presented. However, it's important to note that courts generally scrutinize lost profits claims closely, especially for new businesses, but based on the information given, option C seems most appropriate."
