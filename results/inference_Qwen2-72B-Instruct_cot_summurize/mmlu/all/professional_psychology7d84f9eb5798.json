Investment theory\n\nInvestment theory, in the context of psychology and economics, refers to the idea that people invest their time and resources into activities that they believe will maximize their returns or benefits. This concept is not directly related to developmental models of intelligence, which focus on how cognitive abilities develop over time and the factors that influence this development. The other options (the positive manifold, G theory, and primary mental ability theory) are all constructs that are relevant to theories of intelligence."
