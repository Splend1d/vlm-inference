This is because if G is generated by an element g, then \u03c6(G) is generated by \u03c6(g). Hence, the homomorphic image of a cyclic group is cyclic.\n\nStatement 2: If G is an Abelian group and \u03c6: G \u2192 H is a homomorphism, then the image \u03c6(G) is also Abelian. This is because for any two elements a, b in G, we have \u03c6(ab) = \u03c6(a)\u03c6(b) = \u03c6(b)\u03c6(a) = \u03c6(ba), since G is Abelian. Hence, the homomorphic image of an Abelian group is Abelian."
