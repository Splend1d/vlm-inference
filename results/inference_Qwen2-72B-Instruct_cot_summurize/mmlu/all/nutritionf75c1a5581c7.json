N-3 fatty acids\n\nResearch suggests that omega-3 fatty acids, specifically eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), may play a role in maintaining brain health and potentially preventing age-related cognitive decline. These nutrients are important components of cell membranes in the brain and have been associated with various aspects of cognitive function. While other nutrients and compounds may also be beneficial, the evidence for omega-3 fatty acids is among the strongest."
