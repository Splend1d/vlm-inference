The packets must be reassembled upon receipt.\n\nThis is the correct answer because data transmitted over the internet, including files requested from a web server, is broken down into smaller units called packets for efficient transmission. These packets travel through various networks and are eventually reassembled by the receiving device (in this case, the user's browser) to recreate the original file."
