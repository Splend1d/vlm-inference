Credit cards.\nMI, or M1, is a measure of the money supply that includes the most liquid components of the money supply, which are used directly as a medium of exchange. It typically includes physical currency such as coins (A) and paper money (B), as well as demand deposits like checking accounts and other highly liquid assets like travelers' checks (C). Credit cards (D), however, are not part of the money supply because they represent debt and not actual cash on hand or immediately available funds."
