H3PO4 (Phosphoric acid) - This is a moderate-strength acid.\n\nGiven that strong acids ionize almost completely in solution, and weaker acids ionize only partially, the acid that will have the highest percentage ionization under the given conditions is HClO4 (perchloric acid), which is a strong acid.\n\nSo, the correct answer is **B. HClO4**."
