This design allows them to open a wide variety of locks that use a similar pin tumbler mechanism. The term \"skeleton key\" refers to the fact that the key has been reduced to its most basic form, leaving only the essential parts needed to operate the lock. These keys were commonly used in the past when lock designs were less complex, and they could potentially open multiple locks within a building or estate."
