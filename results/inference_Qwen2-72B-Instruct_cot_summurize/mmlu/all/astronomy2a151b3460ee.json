Greenhouse gases transmit visible light allowing it to heat the surface but then absorb infrared light from Earth trapping the heat near the surface.\n\nThis is how the greenhouse effect works: Sunlight passes through the atmosphere and reaches the Earth's surface, where it is absorbed and converted into heat (infrared radiation). Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, such as carbon dioxide, water vapor, methane, and others, absorb this infrared radiation and re-emit it in all directions. Some of this re-emitted radiation returns to the Earth's surface, warming it further. This process keeps the Earth warm enough to support life."
