Photoperiod\n\nPlants often rely on photoperiod, or day length, as a dependable environmental signal for initiating flowering because it is a more consistent cue than others like temperature or hormone levels. Day length changes predictably with the seasons and can reliably indicate the appropriate time for flowering in temperate ecosystems. This mechanism ensures that plants flower during the optimal time of year for pollination and seed dispersal."
