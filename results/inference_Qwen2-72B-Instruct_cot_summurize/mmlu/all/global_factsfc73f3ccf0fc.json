India had a long tradition of higher education and had produced a significant number of graduates even before its independence from British rule in 1947. In contrast, Congo (then known as Belgian Congo) had very few university graduates at the time of its independence from Belgium in 1960 due to the lack of investment in education by the colonial administration."
