Option contract.\n\nAn option contract is a type of derivative financial instrument because its value is derived from an underlying asset, such as a stock, index, commodity, or other types of financial instruments. The holder of an option has the right, but not the obligation, to buy (call option) or sell (put option) the underlying asset at a predetermined price within a specified time frame.\n\nThe other choices listed are not derivatives:\n\nB. A municipal bond is a debt security issued by a state, municipality, or county to finance capital expenditures, such as infrastructure projects. Its value is based on the creditworthiness of the issuer and interest rate levels, not on the performance of another financial instrument.\n\nC. A bank certificate of deposit (CD) is a time deposit with a fixed term and a fixed interest rate. It is a debt instrument issued by a bank, not a derivative.\n\nD. A money market fund is a type of mutual fund that invests in short-term debt securities, such as commercial paper, treasury bills, and certificates of deposit. Its value is based on the performance of the underlying securities, but it is not a derivative itself."
