Two years later, the woman conveyed the ranch to a farmer by quitclaim deed. The woman then defaulted on the mortgage, and the niece brought an in personam action against the farmer to recover the amount of the mortgage due. Assume that the woman's quitclaim deed to the farmer made no reference to the mortgage.

The mortgagee will probably\n\nA. succeed, because an implied delegation of duties resulted from the woman's conveyance to the farmer.\nB. succeed, because the niece was a third-party beneficiary under the conveyance between the woman and the farmer.\nC. not succeed, because the farmer did not promise to pay the mortgage debt.\nD. not succeed, unless the farmer had constructive notice of the existence of the mortgage.\n"

Since the mortgage was recorded immediately after it was given, it is likely that the farmer would have constructive notice of the mortgage if a proper search of public records was conducted before purchasing the property. However, without such notice, the farmer cannot be held liable for the woman's debt, as she did not promise to pay the mortgage debt when she received the quitclaim deed. Therefore, the niece will probably not succeed in her in personam action against the farmer unless the farmer had constructive notice of the mortgage."
