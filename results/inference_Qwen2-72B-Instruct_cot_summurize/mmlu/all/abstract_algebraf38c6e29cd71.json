This is because the correct manipulation of inverses in a group should yield:\n\n\\[\n(ab)^{-1} = b^{-1}a^{-1}\n\\]\n\nGiven that \\((ab)^{-1} = a^{-1}b^{-1}\\) instead suggests an additional property: commutativity, since for this to hold true for all \\(a, b \\in G\\), it must be that \\(ab = ba\\) for all \\(a, b \\in G\\). This means that the group \\(G\\) is also commutative.\n\nA group where the group operation is commutative is called an Abelian group. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. abelian group"
