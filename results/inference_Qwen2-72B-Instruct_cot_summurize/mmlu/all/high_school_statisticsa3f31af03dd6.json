A correlation coefficient (r) measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables, while the coefficient of determination (R^2) is the square of the correlation coefficient and represents the proportion of the variance for a dependent variable that's explained by an independent variable.\n\nGiven a correlation of 0.6, the coefficient of determination would be \\(0.6^2 = 0.36\\), or 36% of the variation in y can be explained by the variation in x.\n\nFor a correlation of 0.3, the coefficient of determination would be \\(0.3^2 = 0.09\\), or 9% of the variation in y can be explained by the variation in x.\n\nTo find out how many times larger the percentage of variation explained by a correlation of 0.6 is compared to a correlation of 0.3, you divide 36% by 9%, which equals 4.\n\nThus, the correct answer is C. 4."
