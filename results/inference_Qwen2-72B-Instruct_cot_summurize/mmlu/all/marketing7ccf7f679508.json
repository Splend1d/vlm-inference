Discount retailers.\n\nDiscount retailers focus on offering products at lower prices than traditional retailers by minimizing overhead costs, such as operating in less expensive locations, keeping inventory levels low, and often requiring customers to self-serve. This strategy appeals to price-sensitive consumers who prioritize value over other shopping experiences. Examples of discount retailers include Walmart, Target, and Aldi."
