It only contains information on the quantity available, so if the quantity available is zero, then the item is not currently in stock.\n\nB. The database does not contain any information on gender or who purchased the shoes. Therefore, it is impossible to determine which colors are more popular among men than women.\n\nC. The database does not contain any information on age or who purchased the shoes. Therefore, it is impossible to determine which type of footwear is most popular among adults.\n\nD. The database does not contain any information on when the shoes were sold or how many were sold in a particular month. Therefore, it is impossible to determine the total number of shoes sold in a particular month. \n\nIn summary, the given database can only provide information on the current inventory and its details, such as the item identification number, footwear type, selling price, size, color, and quantity available."
