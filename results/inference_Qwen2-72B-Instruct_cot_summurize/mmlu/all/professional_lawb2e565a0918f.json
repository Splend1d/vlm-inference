Under the Secretary's interpretation, the new brochures contained obscene photographs and sexually suggestive language. The Secretary was acting under authority given to him by Section 1123(b) of state statute, which provided:\"Whenever the Secretary of Commerce shall determine that a commercial mailing to residents of the state is inappropriate for minors, the Secretary shall have the authority to prohibit such mailing. \"The case reached the highest court in the state, which held that the statute was unconstitutional, being in violation of both the commerce clause and the supremacy clause.

This means that the parties involved can petition the Supreme Court to hear their case, but the Court has discretion over whether or not to grant certiorari and take up the case. The Supreme Court typically grants certiorari to resolve important questions of federal law, including constitutional issues like those raised by the state statute in question here.\n\nA. by appeal is incorrect because there is no automatic right of appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court from a state supreme court decision; the Supreme Court's jurisdiction is discretionary.\n\nC. if five justices vote to review it is partially correct in terms of what happens internally once certiorari is granted, but it does not accurately describe how cases reach the Supreme Court from lower courts. It takes four justices to vote to grant certiorari for a case to be heard.\n\nD. despite the doctrine of adequate and independent state grounds would apply if the state supreme court had based its decision solely on state law grounds without raising any federal questions. However, since the state supreme court decision in this scenario is based on violations of the commerce clause and the supremacy clause of the U.S. Constitution, the doctrine of adequate and independent state grounds does not preclude the U.S. Supreme Court from reviewing the case. Nonetheless, the fact that federal constitutional issues were raised means that the U.S. Supreme Court could still review the case via certiorari."
