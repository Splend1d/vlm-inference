Income reflects a person's economic position in society, while occupation often indicates their level of education, skill, and prestige associated with their job. These two factors are often intertwined, as certain occupations tend to command higher incomes and confer greater status. Age and verbal fluency can influence perceptions of status in specific contexts, but they are not primary measures of social status in the broader societal sense."
