All babies should be exclusively breastfed until around 6 months. This means no other food or drink, not even water, except on the advice of a healthcare provider.\n\nB. Solids should NOT be introduced at 4 months of age. The recommendation is to start introducing solid foods when the baby is developmentally ready, which is generally around 6 months of age. Before this age, most babies do not have the motor skills or digestive maturity to handle solid foods.\n\nC. Cow's milk is NOT appropriate for all children from 6 months. Whole cow's milk should not be given to infants under 12 months of age because it does not provide the right kinds of nutrients for an infant. Breast milk or formula is recommended during this time.\n\nD. Bottle feeding is NOT more appropriate for babies than breastfeeding. Breastfeeding is recommended as the optimal way of feeding infants due to its health benefits for both the baby and the mother. However, if breastfeeding is not possible or not chosen, bottle-feeding with formula is an acceptable alternative.\n\nIt's important to follow these guidelines for the best health outcomes for your baby. Always consult with a healthcare provider for personalized advice."
