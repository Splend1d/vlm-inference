All of these options.\n\nA comprehensive national defence trade control system includes various elements to ensure effective oversight and regulation of the arms trade. These elements include:\n\nA. Governments should include in their arms trade rules, laws, penalties for their violation: This involves establishing a legal framework that governs the import, export, and brokering of defence items. It also includes provisions for licensing, record-keeping, and enforcement, as well as penalties for non-compliance or illegal activities.\n\nB. Governments should ensure that weapons producers mark their defence items with a unique marking: Marking requirements help in tracing the origin and movement of weapons, which is crucial for preventing illicit trafficking and ensuring accountability.\n\nC. Government police and military forces should establish appropriate weapons stockpile security measures and national authorities should collect and destroy old, outdated, and excess weaponry: Proper management of national weapon stockpiles prevents theft, loss, or diversion of weapons to unauthorized users. Additionally, destroying surplus or obsolete weapons reduces the risk of them falling into the wrong hands.\n\nThese elements work together to create a robust system that helps prevent the proliferation of arms to unauthorized or destabilizing actors while supporting legitimate national security needs."
