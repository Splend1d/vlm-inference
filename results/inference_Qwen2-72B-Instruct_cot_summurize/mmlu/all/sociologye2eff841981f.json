Therefore, the closest description would be:\n\nC. voluntary membership, (though this does not always imply democracy in leadership) and high levels of emotional commitment.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the description provided in option C isn't entirely accurate for all sects, especially regarding \"democratic leadership,\" which is not a common characteristic of sects. Sects often have authoritarian leadership structures. So, while C is the closest option given, an even more accurate description might include a strong, possibly authoritarian leader and less emphasis on democratic processes."
