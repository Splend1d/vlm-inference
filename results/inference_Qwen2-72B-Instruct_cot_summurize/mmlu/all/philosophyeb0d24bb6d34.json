He believes that the laws and the state have conferred benefits upon him, and therefore, he owes them obedience. Socrates argues that breaking the law would harm the state, which is akin to harming one's parents, and is thus unjust.\n\nIn this context, the answer to the question is:\n\nD. just.\n\nSocrates holds that he should only act in a way that is just, and since breaking out of prison would be an act of injustice against the state, he should not do so. He maintains that one must uphold justice even in the face of personal harm or death."
