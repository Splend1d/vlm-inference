All of the above.\n\nThe relationship between dietary cholesterol and plasma LDL cholesterol levels in humans is indeed complex and influenced by several factors, including:\n\nA. The complexity of the mechanisms regulating the absorption of cholesterol and its export in lipoproteins: Only about 50% of ingested cholesterol is absorbed by the body, and this process can be influenced by other dietary components such as fiber and plant sterols.\n\nB. The complexity of the mechanism controlling the clearance of intestinally derived lipoproteins by the liver: After absorption, dietary cholesterol is incorporated into chylomicrons, which are then taken up by the liver. The efficiency of this uptake can vary based on individual differences.\n\nC. The multiple intrahepatic responses to increased cellular cholesterol: When cellular cholesterol levels rise, there are various compensatory mechanisms that can occur within the liver, such as decreased synthesis of endogenous cholesterol and increased conversion of cholesterol to bile acids.\n\nThese factors contribute to the variability observed in individuals' responses to dietary cholesterol, making it difficult to draw clear conclusions about its effects on plasma LDL cholesterol levels."
