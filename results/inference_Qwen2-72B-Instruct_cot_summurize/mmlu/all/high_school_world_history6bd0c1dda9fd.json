It is aimed at preventing the financial power of the developed countries being used in such a way as to impoverish the less developed.\nNon-alignment, as practiced by Ghana and many other countries, is based on co-operation with all States whether they be capitalist, socialist or have a mixed economy. Such a policy, therefore, involves foreign investment from capitalist countries, but it must be invested in accordance with a national plan drawn up by the government of the non-aligned State with its own interests in mind. The issue is not what return the foreign investor receives on his investments\u2026The question is one of power. A State in the grip of neo-colonialism is not master of its own destiny.\"\nKwame Nkrumah, Neo-Colonialism, 1965\nWhich of the following would most directly result from the foreign investment from capitalist countries mentioned in the second paragraph?\n\nA. The establishment of formal control over previous colonies by colonial powers\nB. The establishment of successful democratic regimes in targets of foreign investment\nC. The development of globalization and the spread of culture through consumerism\nD. The reduction of political instability and unrest in former colonies\n"

Given this context, the most direct result of such foreign investment would be:\n\nD. The reduction of political instability and unrest in former colonies\n\nBy investing according to a national plan designed by the government of the non-aligned state, foreign capital could potentially support economic growth and development, which might lead to greater political stability and reduced unrest. This outcome aligns with the goals of non-alignment as described by Kwame Nkrumah, which aim to prevent the use of financial power in ways that would impoverish less developed countries and maintain their sovereignty."
