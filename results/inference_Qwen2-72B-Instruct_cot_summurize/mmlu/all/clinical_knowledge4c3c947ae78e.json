It is a cause of ophthalmoplegia.\n\nGraves' disease is an autoimmune disorder that results in overactivity of the thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism). It can lead to various symptoms, including eye problems such as ophthalmoplegia, which is weakness or paralysis of the muscles controlling eye movement. This can result in symptoms like bulging eyes (exophthalmos), double vision, and retraction of the eyelids.\n\nOption B is incorrect because Graves' disease typically does not cause a multi-nodular goiter. Instead, it often leads to a diffuse enlargement of the thyroid gland.\n\nOption C is incorrect because Graves' disease is more common in females than in males.\n\nOption D refers to a historical term for a goiter, but \"Derbyshire Neck\" is not specifically associated with Graves' disease. The term was used to describe the endemic goiters seen in certain areas due to iodine deficiency, which is not a feature of Graves' disease."
