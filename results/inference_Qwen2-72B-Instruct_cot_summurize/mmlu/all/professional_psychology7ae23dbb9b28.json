Lack of control and insufficient reward\n\nBurnout is often linked to situations where individuals feel they have little control over their work or lack the resources necessary to meet job demands. Insufficient reward, which can be financial, recognition, or simply appreciation for one's efforts, also contributes significantly to burnout. This lack of control and reward can lead to feelings of frustration, helplessness, and eventually, exhaustion.\n\nA. External locus of control and insufficient praise can also contribute to burnout as individuals with an external locus of control believe that events in their lives are due to luck or chance rather than their own actions. This can lead to feelings of powerlessness and decreased motivation, especially when combined with insufficient praise or recognition for their efforts.\n\nC. While age and quality of life can influence an individual\u2019s resilience to stress, they are not direct factors that increase the likelihood of burnout. Burnout is more closely associated with specific workplace conditions and personal stressors.\n\nB. A positive environment generally reduces the risk of burnout. However, micro-management, which involves excessive supervision and control over employees, can contribute to burnout by reducing autonomy and increasing stress. Therefore, this option contains a contradiction, as a positive environment would typically not include micro-management."
