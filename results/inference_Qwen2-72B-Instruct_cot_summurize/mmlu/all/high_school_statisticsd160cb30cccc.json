                    "text": "The power of a statistical test is the probability that it correctly rejects the null hypothesis when the alternative hypothesis is true. It is affected by several factors: the significance level (\\(\\alpha\\)), the sample size (n), the difference between the hypothesized value under \\(H_0\\) and the true value under \\(H_a\\), and the variability of the data.\n\nWhen comparing two tests with different \\(\\alpha\\) levels but the same sample size, the one with the higher \\(\\alpha\\) will have greater power because it has a larger rejection region. When comparing two tests with the same \\(\\alpha\\) level but different sample sizes, the one with the larger sample size will have greater power because it reduces the standard error and thus makes the test more sensitive to deviations from the null hypothesis.\n\nGiven the options:\n\nA. \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\), \\(n = 15\\)\n\nB. \\(\\alpha = 0.01\\), \\(n = 15\\)\n\nC. \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\), \\(n = 30\\)\n\nD. \\(\\alpha = 0.01\\), \\(n = 30\\)\n\nBetween A and B, option A has a higher \\(\\alpha\\) level, which leads to a greater power of the test. Between C and D, option C has a higher \\(\\alpha\\) level and a larger sample size, both of which contribute to a greater power of the test.\n\nHowever, we also need to consider the effect of increasing sample size alone, as seen when comparing A to C. Increasing the sample size from 15 to 30 while keeping \\(\\alpha\\) at 0.05 will increase the power of the test further, as the larger sample size provides more information about the population and reduces the sampling error.\n\nThus, out of the given options, **C. \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\), \\(n = 30\\)** results in the greatest power of the test when \\(\\mu = 65\\)."
