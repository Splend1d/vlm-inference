Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn scenario 1, giving your visiting mother-in-law a thick wool blanket when it's hot in your house might be considered an odd choice or potentially uncomfortable for her, but it is not morally wrong unless there was intent to harm or cause discomfort, which isn't indicated in the scenario.\n\nIn scenario 2, pulling your neighbor's weeds after getting into an argument could be seen as a violation of their property rights and possibly illegal depending on local laws, but it's not necessarily \"clearly morally wrong\" without additional context. However, given that it involves interference with someone else's property without permission, it leans more towards being wrong, especially if it was done out of spite. But since the question asks for \"clearly morally wrong,\" and without knowing the full context or the relationship between you and your neighbor, it might not be immediately apparent to an outsider that this action is morally reprehensible. Therefore, the closest answer based on the information provided is D. Not wrong, Not wrong. However, many would argue that scenario 2 is indeed wrong, making the answer potentially contentious."
