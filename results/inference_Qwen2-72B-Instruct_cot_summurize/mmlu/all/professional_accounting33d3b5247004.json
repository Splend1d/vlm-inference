A statement referring to standards established by the AICPA.\n\nIn a practitioner's report on the application of agreed-upon procedures, it is important to include a statement that refers to the standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA). This statement indicates that the procedures were performed in accordance with professional standards, which adds credibility and reliability to the report.\n\nThe other options are not appropriate for an agreed-upon procedures report:\n\nA. An examination of prospective financial statements is not relevant to an agreed-upon procedures engagement, as such engagements do not involve the expression of an opinion or assurance on financial statements.\n\nB. Agreed-upon procedures reports do not include an opinion, so there would be no scope limitation qualifying the practitioner's opinion. The report simply details the procedures performed and the factual findings.\n\nD. Negative assurance is not provided in an agreed-upon procedures report. The practitioner does not provide any assurance on the subject matter or assert anything about the results of the procedures. Instead, the report presents the factual findings from the procedures performed."
