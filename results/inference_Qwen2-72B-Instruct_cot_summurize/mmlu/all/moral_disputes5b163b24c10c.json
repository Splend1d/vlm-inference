Pence uses Kant's humanity formulation to argue that human cloning would be immoral because it would treat the cloned individual merely as a means to an end, rather than as an end in themselves. This would violate Kant's principle that we should always treat humanity, whether in oneself or in another, as an end and never merely as a means to an end."
