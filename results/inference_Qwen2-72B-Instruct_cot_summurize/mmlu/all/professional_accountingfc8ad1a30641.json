Consider the policies that prohibit the internal auditor from auditing areas where relatives are employed in key management positions.\n\nWhen assessing an internal auditor's objectivity, an independent auditor should consider the policies and practices in place that help ensure the internal auditor's independence and lack of bias. This includes evaluating whether there are any conflicts of interest, such as auditing areas where relatives hold key management positions, which could compromise the internal auditor's objectivity. While A, B, and C are all important tasks for an independent auditor in different contexts (testing controls, analyzing risks, and reviewing internal audit reports), they do not directly address the assessment of the internal auditor's objectivity."
