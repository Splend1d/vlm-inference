An alpha particle consists of two protons and two neutrons, bound together, which makes it significantly more massive than a single proton or neutron, and much more so than a beta particle (which is typically an electron or positron). However, it's important to note that in reality, particles like the top quark can be much more massive than an alpha particle, but they are not considered subatomic particles in the traditional sense as they do not form part of the nucleus of an atom."
