It is a scanner which works by injecting packets to a range of addresses, and inferring what hosts and services might be at those addresses, based on the responses.\n\nNmap (Network Mapper) is a free and open source utility for network discovery and security auditing. It was designed to rapidly scan large networks, although it works fine against single hosts. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what hosts are available on the network, what services (application name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems (and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It was created by Gordon Lyon (also known as \"Fyodor Vaskovich\")."
