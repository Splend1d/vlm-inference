Voters have become more focused on individual candidates.\n\nSince the 1970s, there has been a trend toward personality-driven politics, where the personal qualities and images of candidates play a significant role in how voters make their decisions. This shift is often attributed to changes in media coverage, with the rise of television and, later, the internet, which have allowed for greater focus on the individual personalities of candidates rather than just their policies or party platforms. This does not mean that other factors such as party platforms, special interest groups, and news sources are irrelevant; it simply suggests that the focus on individual candidates has become more pronounced over time."
