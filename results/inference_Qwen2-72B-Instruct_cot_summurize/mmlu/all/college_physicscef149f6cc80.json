The uncertainty in this measurement can be estimated using the Poisson distribution, which applies to processes characterized by random, independent events (like radioactive decay). For a large number of counts \\(N\\), the standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\) of the counts is approximately equal to the square root of \\(N\\).\n\nGiven that we want to measure the rate with an uncertainty of 1%, we can set up the relationship between the standard deviation and the mean (\\(N\\)) as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\sigma}{N} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}} = 0.01\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\(N\\):\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{N} = 100 \\\\\nN = 100^2 \\\\\nN = 10,000\n\\]\n\nThis means we need to have a total of 10,000 counts to achieve a 1% uncertainty.\n\nFrom the data provided, the average number of counts per second is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Average} = \\frac{3 + 0 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 5}{10} = \\frac{20}{10} = 2 \\text{ counts/second}\n\\]\n\nTo accumulate 10,000 counts at an average rate of 2 counts/second, the student would need to count for:\n\n\\[\nt = \\frac{10,000 \\text{ counts}}{2 \\text{ counts/second}} = 5,000 \\text{ seconds}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **D. 5,000 s**."
