From year 1 to year 2, the spending multiplier increased from 4 to 5.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe spending multiplier can be calculated using the formula:\n\\[Multiplier = \\frac{1}{1 - MPC}\\]\n\nIn year 1, with an MPC of 0.75, the multiplier is:\n\\[Multiplier_{Year\\ 1} = \\frac{1}{1 - 0.75} = \\frac{1}{0.25} = 4\\]\n\nIn year 2, with an MPC of 0.80, the multiplier is:\n\\[Multiplier_{Year\\ 2} = \\frac{1}{1 - 0.80} = \\frac{1}{0.20} = 5\\]\n\nThus, the spending multiplier indeed increased from 4 to 5 when the marginal propensity to consume (MPC) increased from 0.75 to 0.80.\n\nAs for the other options:\n- Option A is incorrect because it suggests that the entire $100 billion increase in government spending would only result in a $75 billion increase in real output, which doesn't account for the multiplier effect.\n- Option C is incorrect because a higher MPC means that a given change in government spending would have a more powerful effect on real output due to the greater multiplier effect.\n- Option D is incorrect because the marginal propensity to save (MPS) actually decreased from year 1 to year 2 (from 0.25 to 0.20), as the marginal propensity to consume increased."
