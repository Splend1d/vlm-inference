While it can be considered a social setting or organizational structure within a larger societal context, it does not represent a distinct level of society in the same way that households, nation-states, and the global village do. Levels of society typically refer to broader structural units such as families, communities, organizations, states, and international systems. An office is more accurately described as a part of an organization, which itself fits into one of these broader societal levels."
