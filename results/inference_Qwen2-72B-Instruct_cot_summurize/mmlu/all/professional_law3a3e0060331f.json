At trial, the plaintiff was asked questions on direct examination about the days on which she had observed large amounts of dust in the air and how long the condition had lasted. She testified that she could not remember the specific times, but that she maintained a diary in which she had accurately recorded this information on a daily basis. When her attorney sought to refresh her recollection with her diary, she still could not remember. The plaintiff's attorney seeks to have the information in the diary admitted at trial. Is the information admissible?\n\nA. No, because reviewing it did not refresh the plaintiff's recollection.\nB. No, unless it is offered by the defendant.\nC. Yes, and the plaintiff should be allowed the option of reading it into evidence or having the diary received as an exhibit.\nD. Yes, and the plaintiff should be allowed to read the diary into evidence.\n"

                    "text": "The information from the plaintiff's diary may be admissible under certain circumstances, but it depends on the rules of evidence applicable in the jurisdiction where the trial is taking place. Generally, under the Federal Rules of Evidence (FRE) and many state evidentiary rules, a party may use a writing to refresh a witness's memory for the purpose of testifying. If the writing was made when the events were fresh in the witness's mind and the witness cannot recall the details despite reviewing the writing, the writing itself is not admissible as substantive evidence unless it falls under an exception to the hearsay rule.\n\nHowever, if the diary entry qualifies as a \"then-existing mental, emotional, or physical condition\" under FRE 803(3), it may be admissible as a non-hearsay statement. This exception allows statements of then-existing conditions, including sensations and bodily conditions, to be admitted. The plaintiff's observations of dust in the air could potentially fall under this category as a description of a contemporaneous environmental condition affecting her health.\n\nAdditionally, under FRE 612, if a witness has previously reviewed a writing to refresh their memory before testifying, the opposing party is entitled to have the writing produced at the hearing to examine it and to cross-examine the witness about it. If the witness's memory is not refreshed by the writing, the writing may still be admissible for the truth of the matter asserted if it meets an exception to the hearsay rule.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most accurate answer would be:\n\nC. Yes, and the plaintiff should be allowed the option of reading it into evidence or having the diary received as an exhibit, provided that the diary entry qualifies under an exception to the hearsay rule, such as the then-existing mental, emotional, or physical condition exception. However, the specifics of how the diary can be used will depend on the judge's discretion and the applicable rules of evidence."
