Each of these points provides insight into the evolution of academic institutions and their impact on security studies.\n\nA. The distinct phenomenon of strategic studies emerged as an imported American specialty. This highlights how the United States played a significant role in shaping the field of security studies, which was later exported to Europe. European scholars often engaged with American theories and concepts, leading to a perception that \"theory has already been done,\" meaning that foundational work had already been established in the US, and European contributions were more about applying or adapting existing theories.\n\nB. Think tanks became routine producers of narrow technical problem-solving, succumbing to 'hectic empiricism.' This refers to the tendency of think tanks to focus on solving specific, immediate problems rather than engaging in broader theoretical or conceptual debates. The internal logic of key contributions, such as deterrence theory, may have broken down over time, leading to a need for reevaluation and critique within the field.\n\nC. Peace research developed on a parallel but separate track, and particularly the distinct critical branch was seen neither by its representatives nor by security studies as part of the latter. This highlights the division between traditional security studies, which often focused on state-centric military threats, and peace research, which emphasized non-military aspects of conflict and cooperation. The critical branch of peace research, which often challenged mainstream security paradigms, was not always recognized as a legitimate part of the broader security studies field.\n\nD. All of these options provide a comprehensive assessment of the period of academic institutionalization in security studies. By considering the influence of American strategic studies, the role of think tanks, and the development of peace research, one can gain a deeper understanding of the historical context and intellectual landscape that shaped the field during this period."
