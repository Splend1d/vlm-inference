This experimental design includes two experimental groups and two control groups, with one of each being pretested before the treatment. By comparing the results from these groups, researchers can determine whether pretesting has any effect on the outcome of the experiment.\n\nWhile the Solomon four-group design may incidentally help address issues related to history, maturation, carryover effects, and demand characteristics (options A, B, and D), its primary purpose is to assess the influence of pretesting on the results. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. evaluate the impact of pretesting."
