All of the options given are correct\n\nSevere Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID) is a group of rare, genetic disorders characterized by a near-total lack of a functional immune system. This condition can present with various signs and symptoms, including:\n\nA. Recurrent severe infections: Infants with SCID may suffer from frequent, severe, and potentially life-threatening infections due to their inability to fight off even relatively benign pathogens.\n\nB. Family history of unexplained death in infancy: A family history of unexplained infant deaths might suggest an inherited disorder like SCID, especially if there is a pattern or other related health issues in the family.\n\nC. Generalised spread of the Tuberculosis strain BCG after vaccination: The Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) vaccine is used to protect against tuberculosis, but in infants with SCID, this live attenuated vaccine can cause disseminated disease due to the child's inability to contain the vaccine strain.\n\nAll of these signs can be highly suggestive of SCID and should prompt further investigation and medical intervention."
