Orlistat\n\nOrlistat is approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for long-term use in the treatment of obesity. It works by inhibiting the absorption of dietary fats in the gastrointestinal tract. The other drugs listed (Phentermine/Topiramate, Lorcaserin, and Naltrexone/Bupropion) are approved for weight management in the United States but not in Europe. As of my last update, Lorcaserin has been withdrawn from the US market due to safety concerns regarding an increased risk of cancer. Always consult with a healthcare professional for the most up-to-date information on approved medications and their usage."
