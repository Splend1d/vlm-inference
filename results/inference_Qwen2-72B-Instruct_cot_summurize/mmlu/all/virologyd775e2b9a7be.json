In this type of study, a group of individuals who differ in exposure to a suspected risk factor are followed over time to determine the incidence of an outcome of interest. Here, the group of people exposed to the environmental toxin would be the exposed cohort, and they would be observed over time to determine any potential effects of the toxin. A clinical trial typically involves the administration of a treatment or intervention, while a double-blind study is a specific type of clinical trial where neither the participants nor the researchers know who is receiving the treatment or placebo. A longitudinal study follows the same subjects over a long period of time, which can also describe a prospective cohort study, but \"longitudinal\" does not specifically imply the comparison of different exposure groups."
