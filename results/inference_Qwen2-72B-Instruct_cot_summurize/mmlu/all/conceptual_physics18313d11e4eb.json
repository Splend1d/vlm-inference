                    "text": "Temperature is generally proportional to a substance's C. average translational kinetic energy.\n\nWhile all the options you've listed (thermal energy, vibrational kinetic energy, average translational kinetic energy, and rotational kinetic energy) can contribute to the overall internal energy of a substance, temperature is most directly related to the average translational kinetic energy of the particles in a substance. This is because temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles in a system, and for gases and liquids, this kinetic energy is primarily due to the translational motion of the particles.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that in solids, temperature can also be related to the vibrational kinetic energy of the atoms or molecules, and in more complex systems, rotational and other forms of kinetic energy can play a role as well. But in the context of your question, the most accurate answer is C. average translational kinetic energy."
