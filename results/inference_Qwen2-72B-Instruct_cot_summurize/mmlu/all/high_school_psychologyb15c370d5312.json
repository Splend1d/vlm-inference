Schizophrenia.\n\nWhile other disorders may include symptoms that resemble delusions of grandeur, they are most commonly associated with schizophrenia. However, it is important to note that not all individuals with schizophrenia experience delusions of grandeur, and other disorders can also present with similar symptoms. For example, bipolar disorder can sometimes include periods of mania where delusions of grandeur might occur. But among the options given, schizophrenia is the most closely associated with this symptom."
