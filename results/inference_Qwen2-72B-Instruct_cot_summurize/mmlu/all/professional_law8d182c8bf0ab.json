This is because the defendant did not intend to kill or cause grievous bodily harm to the neighbor, but rather intended to use the penknife to intimidate or frighten him. The death occurred as a result of an unintended consequence of the defendant's actions. Involuntary manslaughter typically involves a death caused by criminal negligence or recklessness, where there was no intention to cause death or serious harm. The fact that the neighbor was a hemophiliac and died from what would otherwise have been a minor injury is an unforeseen circumstance that could lead to a charge of involuntary manslaughter.\n\nHowever, the specific charges and outcomes can vary widely depending on the jurisdiction and the interpretation of the law by the court. Other factors such as the defendant's state of mind, previous history, and the exact circumstances surrounding the incident could also influence the final charge and conviction."
