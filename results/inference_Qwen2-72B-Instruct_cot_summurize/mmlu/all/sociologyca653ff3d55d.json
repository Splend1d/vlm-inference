Calvinists who engaged in ascetic practices to gain signs of salvation\n\nAccording to sociologist Max Weber, the 'spirit of capitalism' was closely linked with the religious beliefs and practices of certain Protestant groups, particularly the Calvinists. They believed in predestination and sought signs of their salvation through hard work, frugality, and success in business. This led to the accumulation of capital and the development of modern capitalism."
