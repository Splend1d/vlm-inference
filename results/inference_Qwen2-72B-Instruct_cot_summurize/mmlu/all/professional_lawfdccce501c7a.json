Thereafter, the skier sued the ski resort alleging negligent maintenance of the ski lift machinery. The ski resort's skier's attorney took a discovery deposition of a witness who was seated behind the skier at the time of the accident. The witness died shortly after the deposition. At trial, the skier offers the witness's deposition testimony into evidence. Upon objection by the ski resort's attorney, the deposition is\n\nA. admissible as former testimony.\nB. admissible, provided that the witness's statements are more probative on the point than any other evidence the skier can procure through reasonable efforts and that the skier has given the ski resort reasonable notice that she would offer the deposition.\nC. inadmissible, because it violates the ski resort's right to confront the witnesses against itself.\nD. inadmissible, because it is hearsay not within any recognized exception.\n"

This exception allows for the admission of testimony given at a previous legal proceeding (in this case, the discovery deposition) when the witness is now unavailable to testify. The fact that the witness has since died makes them unavailable, which is one of the requirements for this exception to apply. Additionally, the opposing party (the ski resort) had an opportunity to cross-examine the witness during the deposition, which satisfies another requirement of the former testimony exception.\n\nIt should be noted that option B also touches upon a valid consideration but is less accurate than A because the former testimony exception does not require the proponent of the evidence (the skier) to show that the witness's statements are more probative than any other evidence or that they have given notice to the opposing party beyond what is required for taking the deposition in the first place. Notice is typically part of the deposition process, and the probative value of the testimony is generally determined by its relevance to the issues in the case, not by comparison with other available evidence. Therefore, while these factors might be considered in the context of admitting evidence, they are not specific requirements for the former testimony exception. Option C is incorrect because the confrontation clause does not prohibit the use of former testimony under certain circumstances, such as when the witness is unavailable and had been subject to cross-examination. Option D is incorrect because the former testimony exception to the hearsay rule applies in this scenario."
