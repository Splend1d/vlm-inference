She immediately contacted the seller and asked about the quality of the coin. The seller assured her that the coin was in mint condition. The collector then agreed to purchase the coin for $10,000. The contract stipulated that delivery would be \"F. O. B. at the collector's establishment,\" with payment to be made one week after delivery. The seller stated that the coin would be shipped out at the end of the week. When the collector received the coin, she noticed that the coin had a large scratch across the face. Nonetheless, the collector accepted delivery. Two weeks later, the collector sold the coin to another collector for $12,000. The collector has refused to pay anything to the seller. The seller brought a breach of contract action against the collector, who, in turn, has filed a counterclaim against the seller. Who is most likely to prevail, and in what amount?\n\nA. The collector is entitled to nominal damages, because the coin was received in a damaged condition.\nB. Neither party should prevail, because the risk of loss was on the seller, but the collector did not incur any loss, since she sold the coin for a profit.\nC. The seller is entitled to $10,000, because the collector accepted delivery of the coin.\nD. The seller is entitled to $12,000, because the collector's resale constituted a conversion.\n"

                    "text": "The most likely outcome is that the collector will prevail, and she may be entitled to recover the difference between the price she paid for the coin and its value in its damaged condition. This is because the seller breached the contract by delivering a coin that was not in the condition promised. The fact that the collector accepted delivery does not necessarily mean that she waived her right to sue for breach of contract. The collector may also have a claim for misrepresentation if the seller knowingly misrepresented the condition of the coin.\n\nHowever, the exact amount the collector can recover will depend on various factors, such as the cost of repairing the coin or the decrease in its value due to the damage. It is possible that the collector may be able to recover the full $10,000 she paid for the coin if it is determined that the damage significantly reduced its value. On the other hand, if the damage did not significantly affect the coin's value and the collector was still able to sell it for a profit, she may only be entitled to recover the difference between the price she paid and the coin's value in its damaged condition.\n\nTherefore, none of the options provided (A, B, C, or D) is the correct answer. A more accurate answer would be something like:\n\nE. The collector is entitled to recover the difference between the price she paid for the coin and its value in its damaged condition, subject to proof of the extent of the damage and its impact on the coin's value."
