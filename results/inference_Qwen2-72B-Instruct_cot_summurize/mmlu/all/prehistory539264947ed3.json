A relative date is derived from radiometric dating techniques, while an absolute date is only associated with written documents.\nC. A relative date refers to a year or a range of years, while an absolute date indicates a chronological order.\nD.

An absolute date refers to a year or a range of years, while a relative date indicates a chronological order.\n\nAbsolute dating provides a specific age or date for an object or event, often in years. This type of dating can be determined through various methods such as radiometric dating, dendrochronology (tree-ring dating), or using historical records.\n\nRelative dating, on the other hand, does not provide a specific age but instead places events or objects in a chronological sequence. It determines whether one event or artifact is older or younger than another, but not necessarily how old they are in years. Relative dating can be done through stratigraphy (layered sedimentary rock), cross-cutting relationships, or faunal succession, among other methods."
