However, for those who can tolerate it without side effects, a target of less than 130/80 mmHg may be appropriate.\n\nLow-Density Lipoprotein (LDL): Less than 70 mg/dL for those at very high risk of cardiovascular disease (such as those with existing cardiovascular disease), and less than 100 mg/dL for those at high risk.\n\nTriglycerides: Less than 150 mg/dL is desirable, but this is not always possible to achieve while targeting other more critical lipid parameters.\n\nBased on these guidelines, the closest option would be:\n\nD. BP < 130/80, Trig <150, LDL < 100\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the BP goal of <130/80 mmHg is an aspirational target for some patients, particularly those at very high risk, but the BP goal of <140/90 mmHg is more widely applicable. The LDL goal of <100 mg/dL is also appropriate for many patients, especially those at high risk of cardiovascular events. The triglyceride goal is generally less emphasized compared to LDL cholesterol control in the context of cardiovascular disease prevention in diabetes. Always consult with a healthcare provider for individualized treatment goals."
