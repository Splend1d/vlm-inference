His testimony is that he detected traces of succinic acid and choline, the components of succinylcholine, in the victim's brain tissues. Over defense objections, he testified further that, in his opinion, the victim's cause of death was succinylcholine poisoning. On cross-examination, the toxicologist admitted that up until his findings, it had been universally accepted in the medical community that succinylcholine would be undetectable in the brain within a few minutes of its injection. He also admitted that his methods of detecting succinylcholine were experimental and that his results were not presently publishable because they were not complete enough. The defense attorney then makes a motion to strike the toxicologist's testimony regarding the cause of death. The court will most likely\n\nA. grant the motion, because the toxicologist's opinion could not be substantiated.\nB. grant the motion, because the toxicologist was not properly qualified as an expert.\nC. deny the motion, because the toxicologist was qualified as an expert in medical matters.\nD. deny the motion, because he was qualified to give an opinion on the ultimate issue of the case.\n"

The reason for this is that the toxicologist's methods of detecting succinylcholine were described as experimental and not yet publishable due to incomplete results. Additionally, his findings contradicted what had been universally accepted in the medical community, which further undermines the reliability of his testimony. In legal proceedings, expert testimony must be based on reliable principles and methods, and the expert must have applied these principles and methods reliably to the facts of the case (Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 509 U.S. 579 (1993)). Given the issues with the toxicologist's methods and findings, his testimony may not meet the standards for admissibility of expert evidence."
