In covert sensitization, an individual is asked to imagine the consequences of acting on their unacceptable fantasy (in this case, necrophilia) and then shift their thoughts to a more acceptable sexual scenario right before orgasm. The goal is to associate the pleasurable feelings of orgasm with the new, healthier fantasy instead of the original deviant one. Therefore, the answer is C. covert sensitization. However, it's important to note that this is a complex issue and should be handled by a licensed mental health professional in a safe and ethical manner. It's also worth mentioning that any sexual interest involving non-consenting individuals is illegal and morally wrong."
