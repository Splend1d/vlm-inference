This symptom is often associated with lesions in the cerebellum, which plays a crucial role in coordinating voluntary movements and maintaining balance and posture. Intention tremors are not typically observed at rest (option A) and are not primarily associated with Parkinson's disease (option B). Dyscalculia (difficulty with math) is not commonly associated with intention tremors (option D)."
