It is often calculated as the sum of consumption, investment, government spending, and net exports. However, it also reflects the income earned by the factors of production (labor, capital, land, and entrepreneurship) in the process of producing those goods and services, plus depreciation and indirect business taxes (option C). This comprehensive measure provides an indication of the size and health of an economy. Note that GDP does not necessarily account for production by a nation's citizens if that production occurs outside of the nation's borders (option B)."
