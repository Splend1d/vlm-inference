Viruses are primarily classified based on their nucleic acid content, which can be either DNA or RNA, and whether the RNA is single-stranded (ssRNA) or double-stranded (dsRNA), as well as the sense of the RNA (positive or negative). Additionally, the presence of an envelope or the type of capsid symmetry can also play a role in classification, but the nature of the genetic material is the primary determinant."
