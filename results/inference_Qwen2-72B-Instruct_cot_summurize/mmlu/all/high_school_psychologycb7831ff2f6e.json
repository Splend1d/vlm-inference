The first stage she described is denial. People may have difficulty believing the reality of their situation and may feel numb or in shock. This can be a protective mechanism that allows them time to adjust to the news. The other stages, in order, are anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. It's worth noting that not everyone will go through all of these stages, and they may not follow this sequence."
