One mechanism by which it might work is by promoting the release of endogenous opioids, also known as endorphins, which are natural painkillers produced by the body. These substances bind to opioid receptors in the brain and spinal cord, reducing the perception of pain.\n\nWhile option B is not incorrect, as norepinephrine does play a role in pain modulation and could potentially be involved in the mechanisms of electrical brain stimulation for pain relief, the primary mechanism typically associated with this treatment is the release of endorphins.\n\nOption C is not accurate; while there can be potential side effects and risks associated with any medical procedure, including brain stimulation, it is not generally considered medically ill-advised due to aversive properties. In fact, for certain patients with severe chronic pain who have not responded to other treatments, brain stimulation can be a viable and beneficial option.\n\nOption D is also incorrect, as electrical stimulation for pain management has been studied and applied in humans, not just in rats. There is substantial clinical evidence supporting its use in treating chronic pain conditions in human patients."
