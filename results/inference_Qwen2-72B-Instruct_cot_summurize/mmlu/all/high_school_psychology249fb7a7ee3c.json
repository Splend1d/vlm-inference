Timbre is affected by factors such as the harmonics produced by the instrument, the way the instrument produces sound (e.g., bowed strings vs. struck keys), and the materials used in the instrument's construction. Middle C on a violin and middle C on a piano have the same frequency (about 261.63 Hz), but their timbres are distinct due to differences in the harmonic content and how the notes are produced."
