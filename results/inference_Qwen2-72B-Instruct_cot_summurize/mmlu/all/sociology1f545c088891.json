This allowed them to accumulate capital and influence, often surpassing the wealth and power of the traditional aristocracy who derived much of their status from land ownership. While they may have also participated in high society events (A), emulated aristocratic lifestyles (B), or owned physical assets like land and businesses (D), it was their corporate wealth that most clearly defined their place in the upper echelons of society during this period."
