The multiplier effect shows how an initial change in spending leads to further rounds of spending that magnify the impact of the initial change.\n\nGiven:\n- Full-employment GDP = $1.3 trillion\n- Actual GDP = $1.2 trillion\n- Marginal propensity to consume (MPC) = 0.8\n\nFirst, let's find the size of the output gap:\nOutput Gap = Full-employment GDP - Actual GDP = $1.3 trillion - $1.2 trillion = $100 billion\n\nThe multiplier formula is given by:\nMultiplier (k) = 1 / (1 - MPC)\n\nSubstituting the given MPC into the formula gives:\nk = 1 / (1 - 0.8) = 1 / 0.2 = 5\n\nThis means that each dollar spent by the government will lead to $5 worth of total economic activity due to the multiplier effect.\n\nNow, to find out how much the government needs to spend to close the $100 billion output gap, we divide the output gap by the multiplier:\n\nGovernment Expenditure Required = Output Gap / Multiplier = $100 billion / 5 = $20 billion\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. $20 billion."
