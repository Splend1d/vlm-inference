After exhausting his appeals, he filed for post-conviction relief, alleging that he had been deprived of his Sixth Amendment right to the effective assistance of counsel. He established that his counsel had not advised him of the benefits of plea bargaining, and had withheld several offers for guilty pleas from the government. The offers expired for lack of a response. The sentence he received was at least seven to eight years more than if he had entered a guilty plea. Will the court likely decide that the defendant was denied the effective assistance of counsel?\n\nA. Yes, because plea bargaining is a critical stage of a criminal case and an attorney who ignores that process is constitutionally ineffective.\nB. No, because plea bargaining is not a critical necessity in a criminal case and counsel has no duty to discuss such options with the defendant.\nC. When the defendant indicates he wants to fight the charges, there is no need for counsel to relay plea offers or discuss the options with him.\nD. Because this defendant was convicted at a fair trial he didn't lose any rights and was not prejudiced by his lawyer's mistakes.\n"

Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984), the Supreme Court held that to establish ineffective assistance of counsel under the Sixth Amendment, a defendant must show that counsel's performance was deficient and that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense. In the context of plea bargaining, the Court later clarified in Padilla v. Kentucky, 559 U.S. 356 (2010), and Missouri v. Frye, 566 U.S. 134 (2012), that plea negotiations are a critical stage of the proceedings where the right to effective counsel attaches. Counsel must therefore communicate all plea offers to their clients and provide competent advice regarding the advantages and disadvantages of accepting or rejecting them. Failure to do so can result in a finding of ineffective assistance of counsel if the defendant can demonstrate prejudice, which in this case would be the difference between the sentence actually received and the sentence that would have resulted from the plea offer."
