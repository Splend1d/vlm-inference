The UL is the highest level of daily nutrient intake that is likely to pose no risk of adverse health effects to almost all individuals in the general population. Consuming nutrients at levels above the UL increases the likelihood of experiencing adverse effects, which can range from mild symptoms like nausea or diarrhea to more serious conditions such as organ damage or toxicity."
