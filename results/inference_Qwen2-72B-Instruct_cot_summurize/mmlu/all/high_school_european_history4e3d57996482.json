This aligns with the Enlightenment's emphasis on reason, progress, and individual liberty, including religious tolerance. Voltaire's statement does not indicate that he was an atheist (A), nor does it suggest that he believed tolerance violated the laws of nature (C) or that it was uniquely English (D). Instead, it reflects his advocacy for mutual forgiveness and understanding among people of different beliefs, which was a key Enlightenment principle."
