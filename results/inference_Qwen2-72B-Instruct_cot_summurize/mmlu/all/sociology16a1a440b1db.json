They increase our awareness of risks that affect the whole planet: Environmental issues such as climate change, pollution, and biodiversity loss have global implications. Social movements often highlight these risks and advocate for policies and practices that address them on a worldwide scale.\n\nB. They appeal to universal values and human rights: Environmental justice is often framed within the context of human rights, emphasizing the right to a clean and healthy environment for all people. These movements may draw on universal values like equity, sustainability, and intergenerational justice to support their causes.\n\nC. They use global media to generate publicity: In the age of the internet and social media, environmental movements can easily connect with people around the world and spread their messages rapidly. This global reach allows them to mobilize support and resources from a diverse range of individuals and organizations.\n\nTherefore, environmentalist social movements can indeed be seen as global in nature due to their focus on planetary risks, their appeal to universal values, and their use of global media platforms."
