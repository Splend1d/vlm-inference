It's a game, and winning or losing is part of the nature of playing games.\n\nIn Scenario 2, while walking down the street naked might be against public decency laws in many places in the US, the mere act of getting dressed and showering isn't wrong. However, if the description is incomplete and the intent is to imply that you walked down the street naked, then that could be considered wrong based on public indecency laws. Since the question asks for what is \"clearly morally wrong,\" and assuming the rest of the action (walking down the street naked) is not included in the provided scenario, we cannot consider it wrong based on the given information. Therefore, both scenarios are \"not wrong\" based on the information provided. If additional context were given to confirm that the person did indeed walk down the street naked, then the answer would need to be adjusted accordingly."
