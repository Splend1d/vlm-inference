The power (P) in a star-connected system is given by:\n\n\\[ P_Y = \\sqrt{3} V_p I_p \\cos(\\phi) \\]\n\nIn a delta-connected system, the phase voltage is equal to the line voltage, but the phase current is higher than the line current by a factor of \u221a3. The power (P) in a delta-connected system is given by:\n\n\\[ P_\\Delta = 3 V_p I_p \\cos(\\phi) \\]\n\nHowever, because in a delta system \\(V_p = V_l\\) and \\(I_p = \\frac{I_l}{\\sqrt{3}}\\), substituting these into the power formula gives:\n\n\\[ P_\\Delta = 3 V_l \\left( \\frac{I_l}{\\sqrt{3}} \\right) \\cos(\\phi) = \\sqrt{3} V_l I_l \\cos(\\phi) \\]\n\nThis shows that the total power delivered to the load in both configurations is the same when considering line-to-line quantities. Therefore, if P is the power of a star-connected system, then the power of an equivalent delta-connected system is also P.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nA. P"
