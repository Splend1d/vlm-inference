                    "text": "The signs and symptoms indicative of circulatory overload are those that suggest an excessive volume of blood or fluid in the circulatory system. This condition can lead to heart failure if not addressed promptly.\n\nAmong the options provided:\n\nA. Hypothermia, hypotension, and bradycardia - These symptoms are more commonly associated with conditions like hypovolemia (low blood volume) or shock rather than circulatory overload.\n\nB. Hypotension, oliguria, and urticaria - Hypotension (low blood pressure) is not typically seen in circulatory overload; it's more common in states of low blood volume. Oliguria (reduced urine output) could be a sign of renal impairment secondary to heart failure but isn't specific to circulatory overload. Urticaria (hives) is usually related to allergic reactions and not directly linked to circulatory issues.\n\nC. Shivering, pyrexia, and thirst - These symptoms are more likely to be associated with infections or febrile illnesses rather than circulatory overload.\n\nD. Dyspnoea, tachycardia, and distended neck veins - These are classic signs of circulatory overload. Dyspnoea (shortness of breath) occurs because the heart struggles to pump enough oxygenated blood to meet the body's needs. Tachycardia (a fast heart rate) is the body's compensatory mechanism to try to increase cardiac output. Distended neck veins indicate increased central venous pressure, which is a direct consequence of the heart having difficulty pumping against the excess volume.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. Dyspnoea, tachycardia, and distended neck veins."
