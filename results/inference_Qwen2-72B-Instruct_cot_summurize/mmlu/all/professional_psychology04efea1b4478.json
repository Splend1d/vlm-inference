As an educator, it is important to maintain up-to-date knowledge and skills in one's field to ensure that students receive accurate and relevant information. Failure to update lecture notes or textbook selections for seven years suggests a lack of effort to stay current in the field, which could result in students receiving outdated or incorrect information. This could potentially harm the students' education and future practice as counselors, as well as reflect poorly on the university's academic standards. Therefore, the psychologist's behavior raises questions about their competence as an educator."
