The ICJ was not hostile to the accumulation theory\n\nIn the context of international law, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) has indeed considered the possibility that an armed attack could result from a series of lower-intensity acts of violence that cumulatively amount to an armed attack under Article 51 of the UN Charter. This is sometimes referred to as the \"accumulation theory.\" In the Nicaragua Case (Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua), the ICJ did not dismiss the accumulation theory outright but rather assessed whether the specific circumstances amounted to an armed attack. The court held that a series of attacks could, in principle, be considered an armed attack if they collectively meet the requisite threshold of severity and scale. However, in that particular case, the ICJ concluded that the threshold had not been met."
