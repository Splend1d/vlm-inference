When you infer the behavior of a larger population based on the behavior of a sample, you are concerned with the external validity of your findings. This is different from internal validity, which concerns whether the research design allows for a causal inference between variables, and reliability, which refers to the consistency of measurement. Inter-rater reliability is specifically about the degree of agreement among different raters when measuring something."
