They will not go away in days, weeks, or months, but they will go away. They will go away because we as Americans have the capacity now, as we've had in the past, to do whatever needs to be done to preserve this last and greatest bastion of freedom. In this present crisis, government is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem. . . .\n\"It is my intention to curb the size and influence of the Federal establishment and to demand recognition of the distinction between the powers granted to the Federal Government and those reserved to the States or to the people. All of us need to be reminded that the Federal Government did not create the States; the States created the Federal Government.\"\n\u2014Ronald Reagan, First Inaugural Address, January 21, 1981\nWhich of the following ongoing debates in U.S. history is expressed in the quotation?\n\nA. Debates over the powers of the president.\nB. Debates over participation in elections.\nC. Debates over federal power over the economy.\nD. Debates over federal power over international affairs.\n"

Debates over the powers of the president.\n\nBut the primary focus in the excerpt provided is on the role of the federal government in the economy and its overall size and influence, which is why option C is the closest match. Reagan's statement reflects a belief in limiting federal intervention in the economy and emphasizing state sovereignty, which has been a recurring theme in American political discourse, particularly among conservative and libertarian factions."
