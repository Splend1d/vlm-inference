Choose the suits: Since the order doesn't matter and you need 3 different suits out of 4 possible suits, you can use combinations to find the number of ways to choose the suits. The formula for combinations is \\(C(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\\), where \\(n\\) is the total number of items to choose from, \\(k\\) is the number of items to choose, and \"!\" denotes factorial, which means multiplying all positive integers up to that number.\n\nSo, choosing 3 suits out of 4 is \\(C(4, 3) = \\frac{4!}{3!(4-3)!} = \\frac{4*3*2*1}{(3*2*1)*(1)} = 4\\).\n\n2. Choose the cards within each suit: For each of the chosen suits, you have 13 cards to choose from, and you need to pick 1 card per suit. Since the order of these cards doesn't matter, for each suit, you have 13 options. And since you're doing this for 3 suits, the number of ways to do this is \\(13^3 = 2197\\).\n\n3. Multiply the results from steps 1 and 2 to get the total number of ways to choose 3 cards of different suits: \\(4 * 2197 = 8788\\).\n\nThus, the answer is A. 8788."
