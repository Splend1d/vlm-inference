This operation is typically O(DN) because it requires computing a gradient for each feature across all training examples.\n\nHowever, the overall computational complexity of gradient descent is not only determined by a single iteration but also by the total number of iterations required for convergence. The number of iterations can vary significantly depending on the specific problem, the initial conditions, the learning rate, and the convergence criteria.\n\nTherefore, while a single iteration has complexity that is linear in both D and N, the overall complexity is more accurately described as being dependent on the number of iterations, making option D correct. However, it's important to note that in practice, the dependency on N and D within each iteration means that the actual runtime can be considered to have a higher-order complexity when considering multiple iterations, potentially scaling quadratically or worse with respect to these parameters if many iterations are needed.\n\nIn summary, the computational complexity of gradient descent can be stated as:\n- Per iteration: O(DN)\n- Overall: O(T * DN), where T is the number of iterations, which makes the answer D. Dependent on the number of iterations, acknowledging that the complexity per iteration is influenced by both D and N."
