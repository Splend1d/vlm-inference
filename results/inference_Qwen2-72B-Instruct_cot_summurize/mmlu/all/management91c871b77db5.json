Information passes between different departments and functions.\n\nLateral communication, also known as horizontal communication, refers to the flow of information across the same hierarchical level within an organization. This type of communication typically occurs between departments or teams that have no direct reporting relationship with each other but need to collaborate on various projects or share information to achieve common goals. It can take many forms, including meetings, emails, phone calls, and informal conversations. Effective lateral communication can improve coordination, enhance problem-solving, and foster a more collaborative organizational culture."
