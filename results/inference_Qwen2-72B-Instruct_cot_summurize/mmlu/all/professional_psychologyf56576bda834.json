In this context, our beliefs act as a mediator variable, influencing how we react emotionally and behaviorally to the events we experience. Mediator variables explain the relationship between an independent variable (the event) and a dependent variable (our reaction) by revealing the underlying mechanism or process through which the relationship occurs."
