Charles Lyell\n\nCharles Lyell was a Scottish geologist who greatly influenced Charles Darwin with his work \"Principles of Geology.\" This work presented the concept of uniformitarianism, which posits that the same geological processes we observe today have been occurring throughout Earth's history at similar intensities. This idea supported the notion of an immensely old Earth, providing the time span necessary for Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection to take place over generations."
