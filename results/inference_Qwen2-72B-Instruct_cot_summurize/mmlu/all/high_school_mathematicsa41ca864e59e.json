Prime factorization of 120: \\(120 = 2^3 \\times 3 \\times 5\\)\n2. Prime factorization of 40: \\(40 = 2^3 \\times 5\\)\n\nThe common prime factors are \\(2^3\\) and \\(5\\), but since the factor of 5 is not common in both (it appears in 120 but not in the same way in 40), we only consider \\(2^3\\) for the GCD.\n\nSo, GCD(120, 40) = \\(2^3 = 8\\).\n\nNow, we need to find all the positive factors of 8, which will be our answer.\n\nThe positive factors of 8 are:\n- \\(1\\)\n- \\(2\\)\n- \\(4\\)\n- \\(8\\)\n\nTherefore, there are 4 positive integers that are factors of both 120 and 40.\n\nThe correct answer is A. 4."
