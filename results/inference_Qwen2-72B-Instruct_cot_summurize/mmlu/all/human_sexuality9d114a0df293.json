The quote \"The state has no business in the bedrooms of the nation\" is attributed to Pierre Elliott Trudeau, who served as the 15th Prime Minister of Canada from 1968 to 1979 and again from 1980 to 1984. This statement reflects his belief in the importance of individual rights and privacy, and it is often cited in discussions about personal freedoms and government intervention."
