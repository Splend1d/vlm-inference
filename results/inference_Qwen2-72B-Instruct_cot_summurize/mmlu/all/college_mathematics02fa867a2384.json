This structure is not a group since the operation is not associative.\n\nTo check if the operation is associative, we need to see if (m \u2022 n) \u2022 p = m \u2022 (n \u2022 p) for all m, n, p in Z.\n\n(m \u2022 n) \u2022 p = (m + n + mn) \u2022 p = (m + n + mn) + p + (m + n + mn)p = m + n + mn + p + mp + np + mnp\n\nm \u2022 (n \u2022 p) = m \u2022 (n + p + np) = m + (n + p + np) + m(n + p + np) = m + n + p + np + mn + mp + mnp\n\nSince both expressions are equal, the operation is indeed associative. Thus, statement I is false.\n\nII. This structure is not a group since there is no identity element.\n\nAn identity element e must satisfy m \u2022 e = m = e \u2022 m for all m in Z.\n\nm \u2022 e = m + e + me = m\n\nThis implies that e(1 + m) = 0. For this to hold for all m, we must have e = 0.\n\nNow, let's check if 0 is indeed the identity element:\n\nm \u2022 0 = m + 0 + m * 0 = m\n\n0 \u2022 m = 0 + m + 0 * m = m\n\nThus, 0 is indeed the identity element. Therefore, statement II is false.\n\nIII. This structure is not a group since not all elements have an inverse.\n\nFor an element m to have an inverse, there must exist an element n such that m \u2022 n = 0 (the identity element).\n\nm \u2022 n = m + n + mn = 0\n\nWe can rewrite this as:\n\nmn + m + n + 1 = 1\n\n(m + 1)(n + 1) = 1\n\nNow, we have two cases:\n\nCase 1: m + 1 = 1 and n + 1 = 1\nThis gives us m = 0 and n = 0. However, 0 is already the identity element, so it doesn't have an inverse in the usual sense.\n\nCase 2: m + 1 = -1 and n + 1 = -1\nThis gives us m = -2 and n = -2. In this case, (-2) \u2022 (-2) = 0, which means -2 has an inverse.\n\nIn general, for any integer m \u2260 0, there exists an integer n such that (m + 1)(n + 1) = 1. This implies that n = (1 / (m + 1)) - 1. Since m \u2260 0, m + 1 \u2260 1, and thus n is well-defined and unique. Therefore, every non-zero integer has an inverse under this operation.\n\nHowever, since 0 does not have an inverse (as it is the identity element), statement III is true.\n\nIV. This structure is a group.\n\nAs we have shown, the operation is associative, there is an identity element (0), but not all elements have inverses (specifically, the identity element 0). Therefore, this structure is not a group.\n\nThe correct answer is D. III only."
