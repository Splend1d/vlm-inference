The firm may earn positive, negative, or normal profits.\n\nIn the short run, a perfectly competitive firm can experience various outcomes depending on the market price and its costs. If the price is above average total cost (ATC), the firm will earn positive economic profit. If the price is equal to ATC, the firm will earn a normal profit (zero economic profit). If the price falls below ATC but remains above average variable cost (AVC), the firm will incur an economic loss but continue operating to cover some of its fixed costs. However, if the price falls below AVC, the firm will shut down because it cannot cover its variable costs and continuing operations would only increase losses."
