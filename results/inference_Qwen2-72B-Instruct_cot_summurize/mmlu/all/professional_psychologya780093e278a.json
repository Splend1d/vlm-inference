Systematic desensitization typically involves gradual exposure to the feared stimulus paired with relaxation techniques, but the key component here is the graduated exposure, which aligns with reinforced practice where behaviors are strengthened through repeated exposure and reinforcement.\n\nFlooding (A) would involve immediate and intense exposure to the feared situation without any prior preparation or gradual buildup, which is not what is described in the question.\n\nModeling (B) involves learning by observing others, which does not fit the description given.\n\nImplosion (D) is a form of imagined exposure therapy, often used in hypnotherapy, where the individual imagines the worst-case scenario repeatedly until the fear diminishes, which is also not what is described."
