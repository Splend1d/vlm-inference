This can be determined using the right-hand rule for currents: if you curl your fingers in the direction of the current, your thumb points in the direction of the magnetic field.\n\nThe magnetic field lines generated by a current-carrying loop are concentric circles that lie in planes perpendicular to the plane of the loop. At any point on the circumference of the loop, the magnetic field is perpendicular to the circumference and lies in a plane tangent to the loop at that point."
