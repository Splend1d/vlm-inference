A Union of African states will project more effectively the African personality. It will command respect from a world that has regard only for size and influence. The scant attention paid to African opposition to the French atomic tests in the Sahara, and the ignominious spectacle of the U.N. in the Congo quibbling about constitutional niceties while the Republic was tottering into anarchy, are evidence of the callous disregard of African Independence by the Great Powers.\"\nKwame Nkrumah, Ghanian leader, 1961\nNkrumah's argument in the passage most clearly supports which of the following ideologies?\n\nA. Pan-Africanism\nB. Communism\nC. African socialism\nD. Neocolonialism\n"

It advocates for the cooperation and unification of African countries to promote their collective interests and to assert their influence on the global stage. Nkrumah mentions the creation of a \"Union of African states\" that would serve as an example to the rest of the world and would command more respect due to its size and influence. This aligns with the goals of Pan-Africanism.\n\nThe other options do not accurately reflect Nkrumah's argument:\n\nB. Communism - While Nkrumah was a socialist and his government had some socialist policies, the passage does not specifically advocate for a communist system or the abolition of private property.\n\nC. African socialism - Although Nkrumah was a proponent of African socialism, the passage focuses more on the idea of African unity and the establishment of a political union rather than detailing the economic principles of African socialism.\n\nD. Neocolonialism - Neocolonialism refers to the indirect control or influence that former colonial powers exert over independent nations, often through economic means. Nkrumah's argument is against the callous disregard of African independence by the Great Powers, making neocolonialism an unlikely choice."
