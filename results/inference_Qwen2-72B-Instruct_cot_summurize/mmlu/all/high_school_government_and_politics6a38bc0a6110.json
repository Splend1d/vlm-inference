A collection of essays arguing the merits of the Constitution\n\nThe Federalist Papers were a series of 85 essays written by Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay under the pseudonym \"Publius.\" They were published in newspapers in New York in the late 1780s to persuade the people of the state to ratify the United States Constitution. These essays have become one of the most important sources for understanding the original intent of the Constitution."
