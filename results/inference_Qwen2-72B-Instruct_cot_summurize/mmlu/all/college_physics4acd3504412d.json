                    "text": "The correct answer is D. The orbits would remain unchanged.\n\nThe force of gravity that keeps the planets in orbit around the Sun is determined by the mass of the Sun and the distance between the Sun and the planet. According to Einstein's theory of general relativity, a black hole with the same mass as the Sun would have the same gravitational pull at distances greater than its Schwarzschild radius (which is approximately 3,000 meters for a solar-mass black hole). Therefore, as long as the planets remained outside this radius, they would continue to follow their current orbits as if the Sun had not been replaced. This is because the mass distribution inside the Schwarzschild radius does not affect the gravitational field outside it."
