This is because muscle glycogen can be rapidly broken down into glucose and used for energy production through glycolysis and the Krebs cycle in the mitochondria. The liver glycogen also plays a role, but it primarily helps to maintain blood glucose levels, which can be used by other tissues, including muscles, when muscle glycogen stores are depleted. Intramuscular lipids and adipose tissue lipids are also utilized, but they are slower to mobilize and therefore play a more significant role in lower intensity or longer duration exercises."
