This means that the height of the spherical cap on either side of the solid is \\(1\\) unit.\n\nLet's calculate the volume of one of these caps. First, find \\(a\\):\n\\[a = \\sqrt{r^2 - (r-h)^2} = \\sqrt{2^2 - (2-1)^2} = \\sqrt{4 - 1} = \\sqrt{3}\\]\n\nSo, the volume of one cap is:\n\\[V_{cap} = \\frac{1}{6}\\pi h(3a^2 + h^2) = \\frac{1}{6}\\pi \\cdot 1(3(\\sqrt{3})^2 + 1^2) = \\frac{1}{6}\\pi(3 \\cdot 3 + 1) = \\frac{10\\pi}{6} = \\frac{5\\pi}{3}\\]\n\nSince there are two such caps, their combined volume is:\n\\[2V_{cap} = 2 \\cdot \\frac{5\\pi}{3} = \\frac{10\\pi}{3}\\]\n\nThe volume of the whole sphere is:\n\\[V_{sphere} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3 = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi \\cdot 2^3 = \\frac{32\\pi}{3}\\]\n\nFinally, subtract the volumes of the two caps from the volume of the whole sphere to get the volume of the solid:\n\\[V_{solid} = V_{sphere} - 2V_{cap} = \\frac{32\\pi}{3} - \\frac{10\\pi}{3} = \\frac{22\\pi}{3}\\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. 22\u03c0/3."
