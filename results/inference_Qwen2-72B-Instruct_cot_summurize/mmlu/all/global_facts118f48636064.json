Diabetes\n\nDiabetes was responsible for approximately 1.6 million deaths in 2016 (the closest year with available data), while diarrheal diseases caused around 1.5 million deaths, dementia led to about 0.8 million deaths, and road injuries resulted in approximately 1.3 million deaths in 2016. However, it's important to note that these numbers can vary slightly depending on the sources and the specific years. Diabetes has been on the rise globally due to factors such as population growth, aging, urbanization, and increasing levels of obesity and physical inactivity."
