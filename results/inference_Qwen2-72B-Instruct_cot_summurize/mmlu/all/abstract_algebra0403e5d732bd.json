Remember that \\( \\mathbb{Z}_{26} \\) is the set of integers modulo 26.\n\nFirst, let's multiply 20 and -8 in the integers:\n\\[ 20 \\times (-8) = -160 \\]\n\nNow, we need to find the equivalent value of -160 in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_{26} \\). We do this by finding the remainder when -160 is divided by 26.\n\nTo find the remainder of a negative number divided by a positive divisor, you can add multiples of the divisor until the result is non-negative, then take the remainder as usual. In our case:\n\n\\[\n-160 \\equiv r \\ (\\text{mod } 26)\n\\]\n\nWe can find \\( r \\) by adding multiples of 26 to -160 until we get a non-negative result. Since dividing -160 by 26 gives us approximately -6.15, we know we need to add around 7 times 26 to get back into the positive numbers:\n\n\\[\n-160 + 7 \\times 26 = -160 + 182 = 22\n\\]\n\nSo, \\( -160 \\equiv 22 \\ (\\text{mod } 26) \\).\n\nTherefore, the product of 20 and -8 in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_{26} \\) is 22.\n\nThe correct answer is D. 22."
