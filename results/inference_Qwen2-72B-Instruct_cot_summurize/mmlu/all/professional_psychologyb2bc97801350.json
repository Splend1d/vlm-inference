These individuals might be experiencing intense emotional distress or functional impairment as a direct result of a recent crisis, and crisis group intervention can provide them with immediate support, coping strategies, and a sense of community.\n\nWhile the other options may also benefit from crisis group intervention, they do not necessarily indicate an acute need for such services:\n\nA. Individuals who have gone from one life crisis to another might benefit from more long-term therapy or counseling rather than a crisis group intervention, which is typically designed to address immediate needs following a specific event.\n\nB. Those who have obtained secondary gratification from normal life stresses might benefit more from cognitive-behavioral therapy or other forms of therapy that help them understand and change maladaptive patterns of behavior.\n\nC. Being particularly in touch with social reality could actually make it easier for someone to seek out appropriate resources when needed, but it does not inherently indicate a need for crisis group intervention."
