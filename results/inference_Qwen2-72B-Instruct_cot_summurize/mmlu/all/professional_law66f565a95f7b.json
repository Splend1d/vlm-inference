As part of an elaborate plan to increase the city's tourist trade and revive the local economy, the city planned to sell the beach houses to a company that would demolish the houses and build a luxury hotel in their place. The owners of the beach houses have challenged the city's exercise of eminent domain, contending only that the city's plan is unconstitutional. Will the owners of the beach houses be likely to prevail?\n\nA. No, because a property owner can challenge an exercise of eminent domain only on the ground of the sufficiency of the compensation.\nB. No, because the planned sale to the private developer to increase the tourist trade qualifies as a public use.\nC. Yes, because a public entity cannot seize the property of one person in order to transfer that property intact to other private parties.\nD. Yes, because the city's action would deprive the owners of all economic use of their property.\n"

No, because the planned sale to the private developer to increase the tourist trade qualifies as a public use.\n\nIn this scenario, the city's exercise of eminent domain is for the purpose of revitalizing the local economy and increasing tourism, which courts often consider as serving a public purpose or public use. This is consistent with case law, such as Kelo v. City of New London (2005), where the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the transfer of land from one private owner to another for the purpose of economic development could qualify as a public use under the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment.\n\nThe owners' argument that the city cannot seize property to transfer it to another private party does not hold up if the ultimate purpose is considered a public benefit, such as economic development. Additionally, the owners do not contest the amount of compensation offered, which is typically the basis for challenging eminent domain proceedings.\n\nIt's important to note that while the owners might not prevail based on the grounds they've stated, there could be other legal challenges they might pursue, such as arguing that the specific project doesn't meet the criteria for public use or that the compensation offered is inadequate. However, those arguments are not presented in the information given."
