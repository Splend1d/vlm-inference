If a student studies for 2 hours, we can calculate the increase in her grade by plugging 2 into the equation for h.\n\nGrade with 2 hours of study = 50.25 + 10.2 * 2\n\nLet's do the calculation:\n\nGrade with 2 hours of study = 50.25 + 10.2 * 2\n                             = 50.25 + 20.4\n                             = 70.65\n\nThe increase in grade is simply the amount added due to studying, which is 20.4 points.\n\nSo the correct answer is B. Her grade will go up by 20.4 points."
