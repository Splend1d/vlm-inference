The patient was at home at the time of the seizure. In the emergency department, she is given an additional 0.5 mg/kg dose of diazepam intravenously and the convulsion terminates. Within 2 minutes, her oxygen saturation drops to 75% and she appears cyanotic. Respirations are 10/min and shallow. She receives bag-valve-mask ventilation, followed by intubation and mechanical ventilation. Medical history is unremarkable. She takes no medications. Temperature is 39.1\u00b0C (102.5\u00b0F). Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of the patient's respiratory insufficiency?\n\nA. Airway occlusion\nB. Encephalitis\nC. Medication-induced suppression of central respiratory drive\nD. Meningitis\n"

Medication-induced suppression of central respiratory drive.\n\nDiazepam, which was administered both rectally and intravenously, is a benzodiazepine that acts as a central nervous system depressant. It can cause respiratory depression, especially when given in high doses or when there is cumulative effect from repeated dosing. The symptoms described, including decreased oxygen saturation, cyanosis, and shallow respirations, are consistent with respiratory depression resulting from the sedative effects of diazepam on the brainstem centers that control respiration."
