The knee is not a ball and socket joint, it's a hinge joint that allows flexion and extension.\n\nB. A Baker's cyst (also known as a popliteal cyst) can sometimes be found posterior to the knee, not anterior.\n\nD. \"Knock knee\" deformity is actually due to bilateral genu valgum, not varum. Genu varum refers to bow-leggedness."
