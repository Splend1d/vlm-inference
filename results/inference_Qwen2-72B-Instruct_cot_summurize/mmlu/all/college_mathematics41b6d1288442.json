The equation is:\n\n\\[x \\, dy + (y - xe^x) \\, dx = 0\\]\n\nRewrite this in standard form:\n\n\\[M(x,y)dx + N(x,y)dy = 0\\]\n\nwhere\n\n\\[M(x,y) = y - xe^x\\]\n\nand\n\n\\[N(x,y) = x\\]\n\nFor the equation to be exact, we need:\n\n\\[\\frac{\\partial M}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial N}{\\partial x}\\]\n\nCalculating the partial derivatives:\n\n\\[\\frac{\\partial M}{\\partial y} = 1\\]\n\n\\[\\frac{\\partial N}{\\partial x} = 1\\]\n\nSince both are equal, the equation is exact.\n\nThe general solution of an exact differential equation is found by integrating either \\(M\\) with respect to \\(x\\) or \\(N\\) with respect to \\(y\\), treating the other variable as constant. Let's integrate \\(M\\) with respect to \\(x\\):\n\n\\[\\int(y - xe^x) \\, dx = xy - xe^x + \\int e^x \\, dx = xy - xe^x + e^x + g(y)\\]\n\nwhere \\(g(y)\\) is the function of integration.\n\nDifferentiating this with respect to \\(y\\) should give us \\(N\\):\n\n\\[\\frac{d}{dy}(xy - xe^x + e^x + g(y)) = x + g'(y)\\]\n\nWe know that \\(N = x\\), so:\n\n\\[x + g'(y) = x\\]\n\nThis implies that \\(g'(y) = 0\\), meaning \\(g(y)\\) is a constant. So the general solution is:\n\n\\[xy - xe^x + e^x + C = 0\\]\n\nor\n\n\\[xy - xe^x + e^x = -C\\]\n\nGiven that \\(y = 0\\) when \\(x = 1\\), we can find \\(C\\):\n\n\\[0 - 1 \\cdot e + e = -C\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[C = 0\\]\n\nThus, the particular solution becomes:\n\n\\[xy - xe^x + e^x = 0\\]\n\nTo find \\(f(2)\\), substitute \\(x = 2\\):\n\n\\[2y - 2e^2 + e^2 = 0\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[2y - e^2 = 0\\]\n\n\\[y = \\frac{e^2}{2}\\]\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n\\[f(2) = \\frac{e^2}{2}\\]\n\nwhich corresponds to option **C**."
