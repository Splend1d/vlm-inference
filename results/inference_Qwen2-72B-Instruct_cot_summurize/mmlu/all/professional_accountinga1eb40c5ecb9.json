The inventory received from Gamma Co. does not count as part of Stone's inventory because Stone is acting as the consignee for those goods and thus does not own them.\n\nSo, Stone's consigned inventory would be:\n\nInventory shipped on consignment to Omega Co. = $36,000\nFreight paid by Stone = $1,800\n\nTotal = $36,000 + $1,800 = $37,800\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. $37,800."
