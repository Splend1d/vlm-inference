The first cousin put up his interest in the joint tenancy as security for a $20,000 loan and signed a judgment note. It was later entered as a judgment against the first cousin's interest in the real estate. The first cousin died a year later. The second cousin decided to sell the property, but the mortgagee filed an action to prevent the sale and to enforce his interest in the property. The second cousin defended on the basis that any lien on the first cousin's interest in the property was extinguished on the first cousin's death. Will the court enforce the lien of the mortgagee against the sale of the property by the surviving second cousin?\n\nA. Yes, because the second cousin's assent to the judgment lien was presumed by law and that assent destroyed the joint tenancy.\nB. Yes, because a mortgage or judgment lien against one joint tenant destroys the tenancy and destroys the right of survivorship.\nC. No, because a joint tenant cannot legally file a judgment note on just that joint tenant's interest because it would be an unconstitutional interference with the other's property rights.\nD. No, because when the first cousin died the second cousin became the sole owner due to the right of survivorship, as per the joint tenancy which was still fully intact.\n"

No, because when the first cousin died the second cousin became the sole owner due to the right of survivorship, as per the joint tenancy which was still fully intact.\n\nIn a joint tenancy with the right of survivorship, upon the death of one joint tenant, their interest automatically passes to the surviving joint tenant(s) without going through probate. This means that any liens or encumbrances against the deceased tenant's interest in the property are extinguished at death. Therefore, the mortgagee's lien against the first cousin's interest in the property does not survive the first cousin's death and cannot be enforced against the property owned solely by the second cousin."
