While some temporary workers may be less experienced or committed than full-time employees, this is not always the case. The important consideration in hiring temporary workers is that they:\n\nE. should be treated fairly and in compliance with labor laws, which may include providing certain benefits or protections depending on the length of their employment and the nature of their work.\n\nOption C is partially correct, as some temporary workers may be entitled to benefits if they meet certain criteria, such as working a minimum number of hours or being employed for a certain length of time. Option D is also partially correct, as temporary workers should receive pay that is commensurate with their skills and experience, although it may not necessarily be equal to that of regular full-time employees doing the same job. Option B is incorrect, as there is no universal rule limiting temporary workers to 30 days on the job before they must be offered a permanent position."
