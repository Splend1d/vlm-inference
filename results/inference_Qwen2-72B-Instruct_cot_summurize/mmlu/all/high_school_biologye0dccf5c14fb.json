Free oxygen was not abundant on early Earth; instead, it was a reducing atmosphere with gases like methane (CH4), ammonia (NH3), and hydrogen (H2) that could have facilitated the formation of organic molecules. Oxygen did not become a significant component of the atmosphere until about 2.5 billion years ago during the Great Oxygenation Event, long after the first cells had already formed."
