This law was passed in response to the kidnapping of free Blacks and their sale into slavery, which was a significant issue at the time, especially in border states. The existence of such a law highlights the tensions between states' rights and federal authority, as well as the ongoing struggle with the institution of slavery in the United States.\n\nThe framers of the Constitution did not directly address the issue of slavery, instead opting for compromises like the Three-Fifths Compromise and the Fugitive Slave Clause that allowed the institution to persist without explicitly endorsing it. This avoidance of a direct confrontation with slavery set the stage for future conflicts, including those surrounding state laws like the one from Pennsylvania."
