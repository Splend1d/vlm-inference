They lower the activation energy, thereby speeding up the conversion of reactants to products.\n\nEnzymes are biological catalysts that work by lowering the activation energy required for a chemical reaction to occur. This allows the reaction to proceed faster without altering the equilibrium constant or the overall energy content of the reactants and products. By reducing the activation energy, enzymes enable reactions to happen at biologically feasible rates under normal body conditions."
