Either England's importing beef is a sufficient condition for France's subsidizing agriculture, or...\n2. ...China doesn't promote human rights when and only when South Africa supplies diamonds.\n\nPart 1 can be symbolized as: E \u2283 F (If England imports beef, then France subsidizes agriculture).\nPart 2 can be symbolized as: ~C \u2261 S (China doesn't promote human rights if and only if South Africa supplies diamonds).\n\nThe \"either...or\" structure of the sentence means that we need to use the disjunction operator (\u2228). So the complete symbolization of the sentence would be: (E \u2283 F) \u2228 (~C \u2261 S), which corresponds to option D. \n\nOption A has the first part correct but the second part is incorrect. Option B has the direction of implication reversed in the first part. Option C uses the negation operator (~) incorrectly in the second part."
