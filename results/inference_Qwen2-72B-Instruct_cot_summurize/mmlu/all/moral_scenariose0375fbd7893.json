Wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn scenario 1, holding a party during a pandemic when health guidelines recommend social distancing and avoiding gatherings could be considered morally wrong because it disregards public health advice and potentially endangers the health of others. In scenario 2, tearing down birthday decorations before the event might be seen as inconsiderate or thoughtless, but it is not necessarily morally wrong unless doing so violates an explicit agreement or causes significant harm or distress to someone. Without additional context, it may simply be a breach of etiquette rather than a moral transgression."
