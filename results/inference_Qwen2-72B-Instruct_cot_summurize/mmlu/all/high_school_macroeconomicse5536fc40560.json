                    "text": "When demand falls and supply increases, the effect on the equilibrium price is indeterminate because two opposing forces are at play: the decrease in demand tends to lower prices, while the increase in supply also tends to lower prices. However, without knowing the relative magnitude of the changes in demand and supply, we cannot determine the exact effect on the equilibrium price.\n\nThe effect on the equilibrium quantity, however, is more straightforward. An increase in supply shifts the supply curve to the right, indicating that more units are available at every price level. A decrease in demand shifts the demand curve to the left, indicating that fewer units will be purchased at every price level. These two movements tend to move in the same direction regarding quantity, so we can say with certainty that the equilibrium quantity will rise when supply increases more than demand decreases, or it will fall when demand decreases more than supply increases. Without knowing the relative magnitudes of these changes, we cannot determine the exact effect on equilibrium quantity either, but we know it's not necessarily going to fall.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. The equilibrium price is indeterminate while the equilibrium quantity is also indeterminate. However, given the options provided, the closest choice that reflects this uncertainty is C, which indicates that the equilibrium quantity will rise. This would be accurate if the increase in supply outweighs the decrease in demand. For the most precise answer reflecting the scenario described, an option stating \"both the equilibrium price and quantity are indeterminate\" would be ideal, but since that option is not provided, C is the best choice among the given options."
