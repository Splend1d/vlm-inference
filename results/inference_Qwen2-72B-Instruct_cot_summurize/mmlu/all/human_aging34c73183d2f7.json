However, it's important to note that this is not a universal truth and many factors can influence sexual activity in older adults. Higher education and self-esteem may also contribute to better overall health and well-being, which can positively impact one's sex life. Options B, C, and D may or may not apply to older adults with higher education and self-esteem, depending on individual circumstances."
