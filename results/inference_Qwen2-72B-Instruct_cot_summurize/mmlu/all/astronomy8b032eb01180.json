                    "text": "The total energy released during the impact of a comet with the Earth can be calculated by considering both its kinetic energy and its gravitational potential energy at the point of impact.\n\nThe kinetic energy \\( K \\) of an object is given by:\n\\[ K = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 \\]\n\nwhere \\( m \\) is the mass of the comet, and \\( v \\) is its velocity.\n\nThe gravitational potential energy \\( U \\) of an object at a distance \\( r \\) from a planet with mass \\( M \\) is given by:\n\\[ U = -\\frac{GMm}{r} \\]\n\nwhere \\( G \\) is the gravitational constant, \\( M \\) is the mass of the Earth, and \\( r \\) is the distance from the center of the Earth to the comet. At the surface of the Earth, \\( r = R \\), where \\( R \\) is the radius of the Earth.\n\nFor an object impacting the Earth at the minimum impact speed (which is the escape velocity of the Earth, since it is just enough to reach the Earth's surface from infinity), its initial kinetic energy equals its negative gravitational potential energy at infinity. Thus, when the comet reaches the Earth's surface, all its gravitational potential energy has been converted into kinetic energy. Therefore, the total energy released during the impact is twice the kinetic energy at the Earth's surface, because the kinetic energy at the surface includes the conversion of the initial gravitational potential energy into kinetic energy.\n\nThe escape velocity \\( v_e \\) from the Earth's surface is given by:\n\\[ v_e = \\sqrt{\\frac{2GM}{R}} \\]\n\nThus, the kinetic energy at the surface due to this velocity is:\n\\[ K = \\frac{1}{2}mv_e^2 = \\frac{1}{2}m\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{2GM}{R}}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{2}m\\left(\\frac{2GM}{R}\\right) = m\\frac{GM}{R} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total energy released during the impact is:\n\\[ E_{total} = 2K = 2m\\frac{GM}{R} = m\\frac{2GM}{R} \\]\n\nSo the correct answer is:\n\nC. \\( 0.5 \\cdot m \\cdot (2GM/R) \\)\n\nHowever, this expression should not have the \\( 0.5 \\) factor since we've already accounted for the doubling of the kinetic energy to account for the conversion of gravitational potential energy to kinetic energy. The correct simplified expression would be \\( m(2GM/R) \\). But based on the provided options, C is the closest match, assuming there was a misunderstanding or typo in the formulation of the option."
