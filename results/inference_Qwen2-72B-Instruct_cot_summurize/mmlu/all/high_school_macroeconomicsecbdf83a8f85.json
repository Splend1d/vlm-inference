This optimism leads to an increase in their willingness to consume out of current income, which is captured by the marginal propensity to consume (MPC). However, the MPC itself does not directly determine the slope of the consumption function; rather, it is the ratio of the change in consumption to the change in disposable income.\n\nA more optimistic outlook typically results in an increase in consumption at any given level of income, shifting the consumption function upward. This is because people feel wealthier or expect higher future incomes and thus decide to consume more today than they would have under less optimistic expectations. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. The entire consumption function would shift upward. \n\nThis reflects an increase in autonomous consumption (consumption at zero income) and/or an increase in consumption at every level of income due to improved expectations about the future."
