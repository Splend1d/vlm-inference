An artist who specialized in making delicate glass sculptures had a studio two blocks away from the laboratory's plant. Late one evening, there was an explosion at the laboratory's plant. The force of the explosion caused the artist's studio to be shaken, which resulted in the destruction of valuable artwork in the studio. The artist now asserts a tort action against the laboratory to recover damages. Which of the following, if established, would furnish the laboratory with its best possible defense?\n\nA. The laboratory used extraordinary care in the manufacture and storage of nitroglycerin and was not guilty of any negligence that was causally connected with the explosion.\nB. The laboratory has a contract with the federal government whereby all the nitroglycerin manufactured at its plant is used in U. S. military weapons systems.\nC. The explosion was caused when lightning (an act of God) struck the plant during an electrical storm.\nD. The harm that the artist suffered would not have resulted but for the abnormal fragility of the artist's work.\n"

                    "text": "The best possible defense for the laboratory in this scenario would be C. The explosion was caused when lightning (an act of God) struck the plant during an electrical storm. This is because an act of God is generally considered a superseding cause that relieves the defendant of liability, as it is an unforeseeable natural event that could not have been prevented by any amount of care or caution on the part of the laboratory.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that even if the laboratory can prove that the explosion was caused by an act of God, they may still be liable if they did not take reasonable precautions to prevent such an event from causing damage. For example, if the laboratory did not have adequate lightning protection or failed to follow safety protocols for storing explosive materials, they may still be found negligent and liable for the damages caused by the explosion.\n\nOption A, while potentially helpful, may not provide a complete defense on its own, as the artist may argue that the laboratory should not have been manufacturing and storing such dangerous materials so close to residential areas or other buildings that could be damaged in the event of an explosion.\n\nOption B is unlikely to be relevant to the case, as the fact that the nitroglycerin was being used for military purposes does not absolve the laboratory of liability for any damages caused by an explosion.\n\nOption D is also unlikely to be a strong defense, as the fragility of the artist's work does not absolve the laboratory of liability for causing the damage through their actions (or inactions)."
