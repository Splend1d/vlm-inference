Greater than the initial investment.\n\nIn finance, the decision to accept or reject a project based on its cash flows is often made using the net present value (NPV) method. The NPV is calculated by subtracting the present value of the initial investment from the present value of the future cash flows. If the NPV is positive, this means that the present value of the cash flows is greater than the initial investment, indicating that the project is expected to add value to the firm and should be accepted."
