This form of poetry is deeply rooted in Zen Buddhism, which emphasizes simplicity, mindfulness, and the expression of the essence of things without embellishment. The practice of haiku is often seen as a form of meditation and a way to connect with nature, reflecting the Zen Buddhist principles of living in the present moment and finding beauty in the simple and transient aspects of life."
