Wrong, Wrong\n\nIn both scenarios, the actions taken by the main character can be considered clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nScenario 1 involves physical aggression (throwing an apple pie) and intimidation (\"vote differently next time\") toward a politician for their voting record. This kind of behavior is not only disrespectful but also potentially illegal, depending on the circumstances. It is not an appropriate way to express political disagreement or influence political decisions.\n\nScenario 2 involves intentionally invading someone's privacy by aiming a high-watt security light into a neighbor's bedroom window. This action can cause significant discomfort and disturbance, affecting the neighbor's right to privacy and peaceful enjoyment of their home. It is generally considered unethical to deliberately intrude on someone's private space in this manner."
