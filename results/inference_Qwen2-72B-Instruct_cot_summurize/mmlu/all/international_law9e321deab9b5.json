Treaties may 1) codify customary law, 2) 'crystallise' customary law, 3) lead to the emergence of customary law\n\nTreaties and customary law are two major sources of international law. They are not mutually exclusive but can interact in various ways:\n\n1. Codification: Treaties can codify existing customary law by putting it into written form. This makes the law clearer and more accessible.\n\n2. Crystallisation: Treaties can also 'crystallise' customary law, meaning they can solidify and stabilise evolving norms so that they become firmly established as part of international law.\n\n3. Emergence: Treaties can lead to the emergence of new customary law. If a treaty provision is widely accepted and followed by states over time, it can become a part of customary international law.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Treaties may 1) codify customary law, 2) 'crystallise' customary law, 3) lead to the emergence of customary law."
