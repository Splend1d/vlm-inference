This shift occurs because the opportunity cost of spending time on other tasks (which could potentially earn less money) rises as the wage rate for lawn mowing increases. Thus, the supply curve for lawn-mowing services slopes upward, indicating that suppliers are willing to provide more services at higher prices due to the increasing opportunity cost of their time."
