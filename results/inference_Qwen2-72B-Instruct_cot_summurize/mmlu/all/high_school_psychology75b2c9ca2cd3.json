This is typically done through experimental designs where the independent variable is manipulated and the effect on the dependent variable is observed. However, it's important to note that A, B, and C are also crucial steps in conducting research and establishing causal relationships. Manipulating how a participant responds (A) can be part of the experimental design, operationalizing variables (B) helps ensure clear definitions for what is being measured, and developing a hypothesis (C) provides a prediction that guides the research."
