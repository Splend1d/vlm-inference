It is not out of mere arrogance and perversity that I, an individual poor man, have taken upon me to address your lordships. The distress and misery that oppress all the Christian estates, more especially in Germany, have led not only myself, but every one else, to cry aloud and to ask for help. . . . These Romanists have, with great adroitness, drawn three walls around themselves, with which they have hitherto protected themselves, so that no one could reform them, whereby all Christendom has fallen terribly. . . . That the Temporal Power Has no Jurisdiction over the Spirituality . . . That No One May Interpret the Scriptures but the Pope . . . That No One May Call a Council but the Pope. . . . Let us now consider the matters which should be treated in the councils, and with which popes, cardinals, bishops, and all learned men should occupy themselves day and night. . . . It is a distressing and terrible thing to see that the head of Christendom, who boasts of being the vicar of Christ and the successor of St. Peter, lives in a worldly pomp that no king or emperor can equal. What is the use in Christendom of the people called \"cardinals\"? I will tell you. In Italy and Germany there are many rich convents, endowments, fiefs, and benefices, and as the best way of getting these into the hands of Rome, they created cardinals, and gave them the sees, convents, and prelacies, and thus destroyed the service of God.\n\u2014Martin Luther, Address to the Christian Nobility of the German Nation\nWhich of the following reformers expressed views similar to those expressed by Martin Luther in his letter above?\n\nA. Ulrich Zwingli\nB. Sir Thomas More\nC. Erasmus\nD. John Wycliffe\n"

Ulrich Zwingli\n\nUlrich Zwingli was a Swiss Reformer whose ideas and actions paralleled those of Martin Luther in several ways. Both rejected the authority of the Pope and advocated for the right of individuals to interpret the Bible without the need for papal approval. They also criticized the wealth and corruption of the Church hierarchy and supported the idea that the temporal authorities had a role to play in church matters.\n\nSir Thomas More (B) was an English statesman and humanist who initially opposed the Protestant Reformation and later became a martyr for his Catholic faith under Henry VIII. Erasmus (C) was a Dutch Renaissance humanist, Catholic priest, and scholar who critiqued the Church but did not advocate for a break from its authority. John Wycliffe (D) was an English scholastic philosopher, theologian, biblical translator, reformer, and seminary professor at Oxford University in the 14th century. Although he also criticized the Church and translated the Bible into English, his movement predated Luther's by about 200 years. \n\nThus, the closest match in terms of time period and theological perspective would be Ulrich Zwingli."
