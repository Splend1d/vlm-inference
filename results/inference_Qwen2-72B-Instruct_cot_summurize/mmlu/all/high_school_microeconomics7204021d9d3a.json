Nations should concentrate their resources on producing wholesome consumer goods as opposed to the weapons of war.\n\nThis statement makes a normative claim about what nations \"should\" do, suggesting that it is better for nations to focus on consumer goods rather than weapons. It reflects a preference or moral stance, which is characteristic of positive statements in economics when they include value judgments.\n\nStatements A and D also contain elements of value judgments, but B is the clearest example of a positive statement in this context. Statement C is a factual statement describing a property of the production possibilities frontier and does not contain a value judgment, making it an example of a positive statement in the economic sense, but not in the sense of expressing a favorable opinion or preference."
