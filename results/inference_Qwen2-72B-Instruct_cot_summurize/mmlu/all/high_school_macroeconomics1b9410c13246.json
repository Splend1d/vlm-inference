This is because high levels of debt can lead to concerns about the government's ability to repay its debts or the potential for inflation, which can erode the purchasing power of the currency. Therefore, the correct answer would be:\n\nD. Decreased demand   Depreciating\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the relationship between national debt and currency value is complex and influenced by many factors, including interest rates, economic growth, and global economic conditions. In some cases, an increase in national debt might not immediately lead to a depreciation of the currency if, for example, the economy is growing strongly and investors still see the country as a safe place to invest."
