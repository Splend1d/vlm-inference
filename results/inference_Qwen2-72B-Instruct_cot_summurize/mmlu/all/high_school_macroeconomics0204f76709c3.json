These biases can cause the CPI to overstate the true increase in the cost of living. For example, if the price of one good rises, consumers may substitute another good that is relatively cheaper, but the CPI does not fully reflect this substitution. Similarly, improvements in product quality or the introduction of new products may provide additional value to consumers that is not captured by the CPI."
