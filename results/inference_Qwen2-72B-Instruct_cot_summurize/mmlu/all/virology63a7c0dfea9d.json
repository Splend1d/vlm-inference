However, in most cases, results of surveillance are primarily distributed to decision makers (A) who have the authority and responsibility to act on the information gathered. This could include government officials, business leaders, or other stakeholders.\n\nSometimes, the results may also be shared with the public (B), especially if there is a public interest or need for transparency. For instance, public health surveillance data might be shared with the public during an outbreak to inform them about the spread of the disease and preventive measures.\n\nSharing results with the data collectors (C) is also important for quality control and feedback purposes. They may need the results to improve their methods or understand the impact of their work.\n\nTherefore, while the primary recipients are usually decision makers, depending on the situation, it might be appropriate to share the results with all of the above (D). However, sharing with the public and data collectors must be done in compliance with data protection laws and ethical guidelines to ensure confidentiality and privacy are maintained."
