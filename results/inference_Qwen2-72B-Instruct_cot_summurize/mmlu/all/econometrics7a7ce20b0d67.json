If the initial model is mis-specified, all subsequent steps will be invalid.\n\nIn the GETS approach, you start with a large model that includes many potential explanatory variables and then systematically remove those that are not significant or do not contribute to the model's explanatory power. However, if the initial model is mis-specified\u2014meaning it does not correctly represent the underlying data generating process\u2014the process of simplifying the model may lead to the retention of irrelevant variables or the removal of relevant ones, which can result in an invalid final model.\n\nWhile A, B, and C can also be issues in econometric modeling, they are not exclusive to the GETS approach and can occur in both GETS and SETS (specific-to-general) approaches. In particular, A and C can be addressed through careful model specification and testing, and B can often be mitigated by incorporating prior knowledge and theory into the model-building process."
