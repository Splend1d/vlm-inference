This means that neither the quantity demanded nor the quantity supplied will be affected as the price determined by the market forces of supply and demand is still allowed to prevail. Therefore, there will be no shortage, surplus, or loss of revenue for the producers due to a decrease in price. So the correct answer is:\n\nA. There would be no change in the amount of corn demanded or supplied."
