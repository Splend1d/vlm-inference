A bounding box with an IoU (intersection over union) equal to $3\\%$ would likely be considered a false negative.\n\nIn object detection tasks, a bounding box with an IoU of only $3\\%$ would generally be considered a false positive rather than a false negative. A false positive occurs when the model incorrectly predicts an object where there is none or where the prediction has very little overlap with the actual object. A false negative, on the other hand, would occur if the model fails to detect an object that is present in the image. The low IoU indicates poor overlap, which suggests the model is incorrectly identifying a location as containing an object, hence it should be classified as a false positive."
