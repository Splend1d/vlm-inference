Barbara neglected to record the deed, and three years later, Alice conveyed the same property to Charlene who immediately filed the deed she received from Alice. Greyacre's jurisdiction has a race-notice statute and a tract index system. If an action is filed for title to the property, the likely outcome would be for\n\nA. Alice, since her ownership was first in time and she was of record.\nB. Barbara, because Charlene had notice of the prior conveyance between Alice and Barbara.\nC.

                    "text": "Under a race-notice statute, the first party to record the deed has priority, provided that they were a bona fide purchaser without notice of any other claims. In this case, Charlene recorded her deed first and would have priority if she was a bona fide purchaser without notice of Barbara's claim.\n\nHowever, Charlene may not have been a bona fide purchaser if she should have known about Barbara's claim. Since Greyacre's jurisdiction has a tract index system, Charlene or her attorney could have searched the public records for any prior conveyances involving the property. If Charlene or her attorney failed to conduct a proper search, Charlene may have had constructive notice of Barbara's claim.\n\nIf Charlene did have constructive notice of Barbara's claim, then Barbara would have priority as the first party to take possession of the property, even though she did not record her deed. Therefore, the likely outcome would be for Barbara to prevail in an action for title to the property.\n\nSo the correct answer is:\n\nB. Barbara, because Charlene had notice of the prior conveyance between Alice and Barbara. \n\nHowever, it is worth noting that the question does not provide enough information to determine whether Charlene had actual or constructive notice of Barbara's claim. In practice, the outcome would depend on the specific facts of the case and the evidence presented in court."
