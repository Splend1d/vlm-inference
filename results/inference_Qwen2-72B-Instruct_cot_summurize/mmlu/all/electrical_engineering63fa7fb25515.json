Carbon.\n\nCarbon is often considered the most detrimental impurity in magnetic materials, particularly in steels used for magnetic applications. It can segregate at grain boundaries and dislocations, causing local stresses that can reduce the material's magnetic permeability and increase hysteresis losses. This effect is particularly pronounced in high-purity iron and low-carbon electrical steels used in transformers and electric motors."
