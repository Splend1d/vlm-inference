They are not considered essential nutrients like vitamins and minerals, but they have been linked to various health benefits due to their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Some of them, like flavonoids and isoflavones, also act as phytoestrogens, which can mimic the effects of estrogen in the body. Inositol phosphates (phytates) are found in seeds, grains, and legumes, while isothiocyanates and indoles are found in cruciferous vegetables. Phenols and sulphides and thiols are found in a variety of fruits, vegetables, and spices. None of these compounds are considered sources of fiber or vitamins."
