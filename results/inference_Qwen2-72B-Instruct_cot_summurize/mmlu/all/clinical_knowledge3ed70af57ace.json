The body has limited stores of ATP and creatine phosphate, which can be quickly depleted. Once these immediate energy sources are used up, the body must rely on other metabolic pathways to produce ATP, such as anaerobic glycolysis and aerobic respiration.\n\nAnaerobic glycolysis produces ATP without the need for oxygen but also generates lactic acid as a byproduct, which can accumulate and contribute to muscle fatigue. Aerobic respiration is more efficient at producing ATP but requires oxygen, which may not be available in sufficient quantities during high-intensity exercise due to the limitations of the cardiovascular system.\n\nAs a result, the rate of ATP production often fails to keep up with the increased demand during high-intensity exercise, leading to fatigue."
