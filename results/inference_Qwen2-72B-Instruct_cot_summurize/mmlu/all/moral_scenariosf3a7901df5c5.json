Not wrong, Wrong\n\nIn Scenario 1, calling the police on a friendly man without any context provided might not necessarily be considered morally wrong if there was a valid reason for doing so, such as if the man was actually posing a threat or breaking the law in some way that wasn't apparent from the description. However, if the man was indeed friendly and harmless, calling the police could be seen as an overreaction or unjustified, but it's not inherently clear-cut without more context.\n\nIn Scenario 2, pushing an old lady in a wheelchair into a busy highway is clearly morally wrong as it puts her life in immediate danger and shows a disregard for her safety and well-being. This action violates basic moral principles of not harming others and is universally condemned."
