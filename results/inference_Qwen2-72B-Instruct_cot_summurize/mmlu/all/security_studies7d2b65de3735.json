The fear that cooperation may be recurring.\nD. Adherence to liberalism does not guarantee the favoured treatment of state regimes over its citizens; other states may threaten regime security in their efforts to secure societal security.\n"

Recurring cooperation isn't typically seen as a negative aspect, especially in international relations where consistent and reliable partnerships are often beneficial. The other options present valid concerns that some regimes might have about adopting liberalist policies or aligning with liberalist countries."
