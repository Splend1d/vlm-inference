In this excerpt, Clemenceau attributes responsibility for \"the catastrophe of 1914\" to Germany, referring to the beginning of World War I in 1914. He criticizes Germany's nationalistic attitude embodied in the phrase \"Deutschland \u00fcber alles\" (Germany above everything), which he sees as indicative of a dangerous and extreme ideology that led to the outbreak of war."
