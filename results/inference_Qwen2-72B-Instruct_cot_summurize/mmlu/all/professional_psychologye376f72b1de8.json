Participants should be given enough information about the study to make an informed decision about their participation. However, in cases where full disclosure could compromise the research objectives (e.g., by influencing participants' behavior), researchers may withhold certain details. Nevertheless, they must still obtain consent and later debrief the participants, explaining all aspects of the study that were previously withheld. This ensures that participants are treated ethically and with respect for their autonomy."
