                    "text": "To solve this problem, we first need to understand what the median is. The median is the middle value in a set of numbers when they are arranged in order. If there's an even number of values, the median is the average of the two middle numbers.\n\nLet's start by listing Sarah's times in ascending order:\n\n\\[86, 88, 94, 96, 97\\]\n\nAfter her sixth attempt, her median time becomes 92 seconds. This means that when her new time is added and all times are arranged in ascending order, the middle value will be 92 seconds. Since there will now be six attempts, the median (the middle value) will be the average of the third and fourth values in the ordered list.\n\nThe only way for the median to be 92 is if the third and fourth values in the list are 92 and 92 or one value is less than 92 and the other is more than 92 but close enough so their average is 92. However, since we know the initial list's middle value (median before the sixth attempt) is 94, the new time must be less than 94 but not so low as to pull the average below 92.\n\nGiven the options:\n\nA. 92  \nB. 90  \nC. 87  \nD. 10  \n\nAdding any of these values to the existing list and arranging it in ascending order, we want the average of the third and fourth values to be 92. The only option that allows the third and fourth values to have an average of 92 is option B: 90 seconds. When we add 90 to the list, we get:\n\n\\[86, 88, 90, 94, 96, 97\\]\n\nNow, the median is the average of the third and fourth terms:\n\n\\[\\frac{90 + 94}{2} = \\frac{184}{2} = 92\\]\n\nThus, the answer is B. 90 seconds."
