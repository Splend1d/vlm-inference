So, 22 is not divisible by 4.\n\nB. 26 divided by 4 is 6 with a remainder of 2. So, 26 is not divisible by 4.\n\nC. 28 divided by 4 is 7 with no remainder. So, 28 is divisible by 4.\n\nD. 30 divided by 4 is 7 with a remainder of 2. So, 30 is not divisible by 4.\n\nThe only number from the given options that can be evenly divided into groups of 4 (i.e., the number of batteries that could have been bought in packs of 4) is 28.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. 28."
