Human security has put particular emphasis on the nexus between conflict and development, a concept which is very useful. The significance of the nexus between development and conflict is not just that it raises ethical issues about human suffering and inequalities, but that its frequent outcomes, so called state future, has dire local, regional, and global effects.\nB. From a normative perspective, the concept serves to highlight good global norms. Human security often serves as an umbrella norm. Developing good global norms is not only important for moral and ethical reasons but also because they serve to enhance state and international society.\nC. The development of the human security concept highlights the view that the threats to humans as well as to state entities are changing and increasing. These changes have spurred debates about the meaning of security and the arguments for its broadening and deepening. Like internal violence, these transnational issues have serious local, regional, and global effects.\nD. All of these options.\n"

It emphasizes the connection between conflict and development, which is crucial for understanding how instability and underdevelopment can fuel each other, leading to dire consequences at various levels.\n\nB. From a normative standpoint, human security promotes the establishment of positive global norms, which are essential not only from a moral and ethical perspective but also for strengthening states and the international community.\n\nC. The evolution of the human security concept reflects the changing nature of threats faced by individuals and states alike. This has led to discussions about the need to broaden and deepen the traditional concept of security to include non-traditional threats such as environmental degradation, pandemics, and cyber attacks.\n\nThus, all three aspects contribute to the significance of human security as a concept."
