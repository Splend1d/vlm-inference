A dying declaration is a statement made by a declarant who believes they are about to die, concerning the cause or circumstances of what they believe to be their impending death. For such a statement to be admissible, the court must determine that the declarant believed death was imminent at the time the statement was made. This determination is usually made by the judge based on the evidence presented, and the standard of proof is typically a preponderance of the evidence. If the judge finds that the conditions for a dying declaration are met, the statement can be admitted into evidence for the jury to consider."
