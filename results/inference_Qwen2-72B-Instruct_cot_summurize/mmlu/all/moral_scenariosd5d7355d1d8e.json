This behavior can make the student feel uncomfortable and unsafe, and it violates the trust inherent in the teacher-student relationship.\n\nIn Scenario 2, intentionally leaving the soap in the tub knowing that it could cause someone to slip and potentially harm themselves is considered morally wrong because it involves causing deliberate harm or risking the safety of another person, especially a vulnerable individual like a grandparent."
