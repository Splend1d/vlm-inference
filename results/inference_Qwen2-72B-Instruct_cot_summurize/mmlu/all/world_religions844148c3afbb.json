Therefore, the correct answer would be:\n\nA. Toward the end of the first millennium BCE\n\nHowever, this answer choice does not precisely reflect the most accurate time frame since Ashurbanipal lived specifically in the late 7th century BCE, but within the given options, A is the closest. The actual modification and compilation of the Standard Version occurred around the 7th century BCE."
