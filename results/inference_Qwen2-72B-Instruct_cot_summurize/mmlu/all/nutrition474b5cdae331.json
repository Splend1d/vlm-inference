Folate deficiency in older people is less prevalent in countries with mandatory fortification of flour with folic acid.\n\nThis statement is supported by scientific evidence. Folate (vitamin B9) plays a crucial role in DNA synthesis and repair, as well as homocysteine metabolism. Deficiency can lead to anemia and has been linked to increased risk of cardiovascular disease and cognitive decline in older adults. In countries where flour is fortified with folic acid, folate deficiency is indeed less common, which can help maintain good health in older populations. For example, studies have shown that mandatory folic acid fortification programs have significantly reduced the prevalence of folate deficiency and related health issues."
