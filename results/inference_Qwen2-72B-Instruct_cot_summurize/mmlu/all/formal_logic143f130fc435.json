M: This is the premise that M is true.\n3. N: This is the conclusion we want to reach based on the given premise and the negated biconditional.\n\nWe can see from the truth table that:\n- When M is true and N is true (row 1), the argument holds because the conclusion N is also true.\n- When M is true and N is false (row 2), the argument does not hold because the conclusion N is false, but the premise M is true, violating the given ~(M \u2261 ~N).\n- When M is false and N is true (row 3), the argument does not hold because the premise M is false, and the conclusion N is true, which is not in contradiction with ~(M \u2261 ~N).\n- When M is false and N is false (row 4), the argument does not apply since the premise M is false.\n\nThe only case where the premise M is true and the argument fails to conclude N is when M is true and N is false (row 2). In this case, the argument does not hold because the conclusion N should be true if the premise M is true, but it is not.\n\nTherefore, the argument is **invalid**, and the correct answer is:\n\n**C.
