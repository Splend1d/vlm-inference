Females have two X chromosomes, while males have one X and one Y chromosome. A woman who appears to have normal color vision but carries the gene for color blindness on one of her X chromosomes can transmit that gene to her son. Since the son receives only one X chromosome (from his mother) and has no second X chromosome to potentially carry a dominant \"normal\" color vision allele, he will express the color blindness trait if he inherits the affected X chromosome from his mother. This scenario illustrates how a woman's genotype (the genetic makeup that includes the recessive allele for color blindness) can influence the phenotype (observable traits) of her offspring without affecting her own phenotype."
