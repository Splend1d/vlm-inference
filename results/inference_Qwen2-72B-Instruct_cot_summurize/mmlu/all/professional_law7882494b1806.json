Because all of the seats were occupied, the rider stood in the subway car and grabbed a pole to secure his balance. As the subway car was proceeding downtown, the rider glanced at a girl standing next to him. Suddenly, the subway car made an unexpected stop. The rider momentarily lost his balance and grabbed the girl around the waist (to avoid falling). Once the rider regained his balance, he removed his hands from the girl's waist and grasped the pole again. In a civil action instituted by the girl against the rider, he will most likely be found\n\nA. liable for battery.\nB. liable, because the rider believed that the girl consented to the contact under the circumstances.\nC. not liable, because the rider's conduct was socially acceptable under the circumstances.\nD. not liable, because the girl was not harmed by the contact.\n"

Given that there was no apparent intent to cause harm or offense, and considering the context of crowded public transportation where such incidental contacts may occur, the rider's actions could be deemed socially acceptable under these circumstances. It is important to note that the rider immediately removed his hands once balance was regained, which further supports the lack of intent to harass or harm. However, the specifics of the law in the jurisdiction where the incident occurred would need to be considered to make a definitive determination."
