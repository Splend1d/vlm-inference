All cells are surrounded by a plasma membrane.\n\nThe presence of a plasma membrane is a fundamental characteristic shared by all living cells, from bacteria to human cells. This feature highlights the unity of all life as it is essential for maintaining the integrity of the cell and regulating the exchange of materials with the environment. While not all cells have a nucleus (prokaryotes lack a nucleus), or mitochondria (again, prokaryotes do not have mitochondria, they perform respiration differently), and the surface-to-volume ratio can vary depending on the size and shape of the cell, the plasma membrane is a universal component of all cells."
