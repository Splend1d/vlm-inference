In his work on immigration, he argues that states have a right to control their borders but also have obligations to treat immigrants fairly and to consider the impact of immigration policies on social cohesion and distributive justice within their societies. Thus, he approaches the ethical issue of immigration from the perspective of distributive justice, which concerns how resources, rights, and responsibilities should be distributed among members of a society."
