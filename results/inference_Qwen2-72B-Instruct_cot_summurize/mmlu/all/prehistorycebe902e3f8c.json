Conflict theories focus on how internal strife, class struggle, or competition for resources leads to social change and the rise of complex political structures. Integration models, on the other hand, suggest that societies become more complex as they adapt to external pressures, such as threats from neighboring groups or environmental challenges, which require greater cooperation and organization."
