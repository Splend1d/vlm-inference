African-Americans who felt excluded from the 'ethnic melting pot' in the USA\n\nThe Nation of Islam, founded in the 1930s, primarily appealed to African-Americans who felt marginalized and excluded from mainstream American society, often referred to as the \"melting pot.\" The group offered a sense of identity, empowerment, and community to its members, advocating for black self-sufficiency and sometimes separatism. Its teachings combined elements of Islam with black nationalism, providing a platform for civil rights activism and social change, particularly during the 1950s and 1960s. Prominent figures like Malcolm X and Elijah Muhammad were associated with the movement."
