Dark-colored ones inhabit the lava formations, while light-colored mice inhabit the desert. Which of the following statements is correct about this scenario?\n\nA. The two varieties of mice descended from a recent common ancestor.\nB. The mouse population was originally one population that diverged into two species because of mutations.\nC. Selection favors some phenotypes over others.\nD. Originally the mice were all dark colored. As the lava decomposed into sand, the color of some mice changed because that color was favored in that environment.\n"

Selection favors some phenotypes over others.\n\nThis scenario illustrates natural selection, where the environment acts as a selective pressure on the phenotype (observable traits) of the pocket mice. In this case, the darker-colored mice are better camouflaged against the black lava formations, and the lighter-colored mice are better camouflaged against the light-colored sandy desert. This camouflage provides a survival advantage, as predators will have more difficulty spotting the mice that match their respective environments. Over time, this can lead to a higher proportion of mice with the advantageous coloration in each habitat, demonstrating how natural selection can favor certain phenotypes over others."
