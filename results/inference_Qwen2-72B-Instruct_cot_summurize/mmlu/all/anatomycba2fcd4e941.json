Stimulation of this area can trigger the cough reflex, which helps to clear the airway. The external laryngeal nerve, also a branch of the superior laryngeal nerve, primarily provides motor innervation to the muscles of the larynx that control the tension and pitch of the voice. The gag reflex, on the other hand, is mediated by the pharyngeal plexus, involving the glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves."
