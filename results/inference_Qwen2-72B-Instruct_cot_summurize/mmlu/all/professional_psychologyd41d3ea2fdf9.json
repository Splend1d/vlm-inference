Within the past 6 weeks, this formerly socially active young man has quit his job as a restaurant manager, has become withdrawn, and now spends most of his time in his room watching TV.

However, to meet the criteria for schizophrenia, symptoms must persist for at least six months. Since the symptoms have only been present for six weeks, the most appropriate diagnosis at this stage would be:\n\nA. Schizophreniform Disorder\n\nSchizophreniform disorder is characterized by symptoms similar to schizophrenia but with a duration of at least one month but less than six months. If the symptoms continue beyond six months, the diagnosis may be changed to schizophrenia."
