An abuse of this power in order to wage state-interested wars: Critics argue that the concept of humanitarian intervention might be misused by powerful states as a pretext for advancing their own geopolitical interests under the guise of humanitarian concerns.\n\nB. A depletion of military resources pursuing wars on ethical grounds, leading to a loss of military security: Engaging in frequent humanitarian interventions could strain a country's military capabilities and resources, potentially compromising its national security and defense readiness.\n\nC. Whilst some states have proven their ability to conduct 'just' wars in order to protect sound values of democracy and neoliberalism, not all states would use force to pursue such globally beneficial ends: There is concern that not all intervening states would act with the best intentions or adhere to international norms and principles, potentially leading to actions that harm rather than help the affected populations.\n\nD. A lack of implementation of these rights by state actors, leading to a failure to address human rights abuses: There is also a risk that the right to intervene might not be consistently applied, leaving some humanitarian crises unaddressed due to political considerations or lack of will among the international community. This inconsistency could undermine the credibility and effectiveness of humanitarian intervention as a tool for protecting human rights."
