In fact, during the COVID-19 pandemic, wearing masks was recommended and sometimes mandated to prevent the spread of the virus. However, if the intention behind wearing the mask is to commit a crime or avoid legal identification for nefarious purposes, then it would be considered morally wrong. Since the scenario does not provide context suggesting illegal activity, the action is not inherently wrong."
