During a potlatch, a host distributes gifts to guests as a way of displaying wealth and social status. This often involves the giving away of possessions, including food, blankets, tools, and other valuable items. The redistribution of wealth through the potlatch serves to reinforce social bonds and hierarchies within these communities."
