Wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn scenario 1, using violent and potentially lethal force against someone is generally considered morally wrong, especially if it is not in self-defense or defense of others. The language used (\"stuck a knife in his black heart\") implies premeditation and malice, which would be considered morally reprehensible.\n\nIn scenario 2, taking away privileges such as games as a form of discipline when a child has misbehaved (in this case, skipping school) is a common parenting technique and is generally not considered morally wrong. It is seen as a way to teach consequences and responsibility."
