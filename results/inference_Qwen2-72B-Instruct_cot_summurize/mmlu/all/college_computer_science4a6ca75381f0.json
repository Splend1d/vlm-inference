While they can display many details and realistic lighting/shading effects (option B), and polygons can indeed be filled with solid colors and textures (option D), they do not guarantee that all line segments will appear perfectly straight (option C). This is because lines in bitmap graphics may be subject to aliasing or jagged edges due to the discrete nature of the pixel grid, especially when lines are at angles other than horizontal, vertical, or multiples of 45 degrees. Fast hardware does exist to move blocks of pixels efficiently (option A), which is an advantage for manipulating bitmap graphics."
