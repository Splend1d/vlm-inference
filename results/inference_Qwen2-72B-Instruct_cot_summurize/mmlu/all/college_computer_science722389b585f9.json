If D expands to E, expand E to z.\n\nLet's see which of these sentences can be generated:\n\nA. xyz\n- A -> BC\n- B -> x (choose this for now)\n- C -> D\n- D -> y\n- E -> z\nSo, \"xyz\" can be generated.\n\nB. xy\n- A -> BC\n- B -> x (choose this for now)\n- C -> D\n- D -> y\nSo, \"xy\" can be generated.\n\nC. xxzy\n- A -> BC\n- B -> Bx\n- B -> x (again)\n- C -> D\n- D -> y\n- E -> z\nSo, \"xxzy\" can be generated.\n\nD. xxxxy\n- A -> BC\n- B -> Bx\n- B -> Bx (again)\n- B -> x (again)\n- C -> D\n- D -> y\nHowever, at this point, we cannot generate any more characters because there is no rule to expand a terminal symbol (in this case, y).
