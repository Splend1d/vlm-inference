                    "text": "The correct answer is B. In meiosis, separation of sister chromatids occurs during the second division (Anaphase II), whereas in mitosis separation of sister chromatids occurs during the first division (Anaphase). This distinction is crucial because it leads to different outcomes in terms of genetic material in the resulting cells. In meiosis, this process helps create four genetically unique haploid cells, which is essential for sexual reproduction. In contrast, mitosis produces two genetically identical diploid cells, important for growth, repair, and asexual reproduction."
