                    "text": "Bill, a single man, owned pasture land in Deerwoods, Florida, which he leased to a tenant. He also owned a condominium in Miami, which he held for investment. In his will, he devised the pasture land to his son Tommy and the condominium to his daughter Julie. All other assets would pass equally to Tommy and Julie. Bill met Kathy and married her after she executed a valid prenuptial agreement relinquishing all rights she might otherwise enjoy by marrying Bill. On their Miami honeymoon they drove by the condominium and Kathy declared she'd love to live there. Bill was so happy with Kathy that after the honeymoon he signed and delivered to Kathy a deed conveying the condominium to himself and Kathy as an estate by the entirety and made plans to live in the condominium as soon as the tenant vacated. Bill died the next day. How are the foregoing assets distributed?\n\nA. Kathy gets the condominium regardless of the prenuptial agreement, Tommy takes the pasture land and Tommy and Julie split the rest of the estate.\nB. Due to Kathy's prenuptial agreement, Tommy receives the pasture land, Julie gets the condominium and Tommy and Julie split the rest of the estate.\nC. Kathy gets the condominium, but because Bill had originally indicated his intent to devise equally to his children, Tommy and Julie will split the remaining estate.\nD. Regardless of the prenuptial agreement, Kathy is a pretermitted spouse. Since Bill leaves surviving lineal descendants who are not Kathy's, Kathy receives 50% of the estate, Tommy gets the pasture land, and Tommy and Julie split the residue of the estate.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is A. Kathy gets the condominium regardless of the prenuptial agreement, Tommy takes the pasture land and Tommy and Julie split the rest of the estate.\n\nWhen Bill signed and delivered a deed conveying the condominium to himself and Kathy as an estate by the entirety, this effectively transferred ownership of the condominium to both Bill and Kathy jointly with right of survivorship. Upon Bill's death, Kathy automatically becomes the sole owner of the condominium due to the nature of an estate by the entirety. This overrides any provisions in the will or prenuptial agreement regarding the condominium.\n\nAs for the rest of the estate, since the prenuptial agreement remains valid except for the specific asset (the condominium) that was explicitly transferred to Kathy during Bill's lifetime, the remainder of the estate should be distributed according to the terms of the will. Therefore, Tommy receives the pasture land, and Tommy and Julie split the rest of the estate equally.\n\nIt's important to note that the answer D is incorrect because a pretermitted spouse claim does not apply here. A pretermitted spouse claim typically applies when a person marries after making a will and the will does not provide for the new spouse. However, since Bill specifically deeded the condominium to Kathy, she is not a pretermitted spouse with respect to the condominium. Additionally, the prenuptial agreement likely covers any other assets, preventing Kathy from claiming more than what was specifically given to her during Bill's life."
