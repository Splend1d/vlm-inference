The state felt that the increased fee for out-of-staters was a reasonable contribution toward the protection they received from the state. Assume that the federal court decided to hear the case.

Charging out-of-state residents significantly more for the same product as in-state residents can be seen as a form of economic protectionism that discriminates against interstate commerce. This type of discriminatory pricing could potentially violate the Dormant Commerce Clause, which is an interpretation of the Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution that prohibits states from passing legislation that improperly burdens or discriminates against interstate commerce."
