Neandertals used caves in Europe where their remains were preserved.\n\nNeandertals lived primarily in Europe and western Asia during the last Ice Age, and many of their remains have been found in cave sites that provided natural protection from the elements. These conditions helped preserve their bones and artifacts for tens of thousands of years, allowing scientists to study them in detail. This is in contrast to other premodern human species whose remains may not have been as well-preserved or discovered in such large numbers."
