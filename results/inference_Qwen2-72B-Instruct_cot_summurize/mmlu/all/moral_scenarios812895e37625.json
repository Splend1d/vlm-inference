In Scenario 1, picking up litter is considered a good deed, and in Scenario 2, swinging a child around gently for play is a common and generally acceptable form of physical interaction between a parent and child, assuming it is done safely and the child enjoys it. Getting slightly dizzy from such play is not necessarily harmful or morally wrong. However, it's important to note that safety should always be considered, and if the action could potentially cause harm, it would be inappropriate."
