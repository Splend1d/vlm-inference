His studies suggested that there were differences in the size of a specific part of the hypothalamus called the INAH-3 (the interstitial nucleus of the anterior hypothalamus, area 3) between heterosexual and homosexual men. This region is involved in sexual behavior and has been found to be significantly smaller in homosexual men compared to heterosexual men.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. the cell structure in the hypothalamus of these two groups\n\nIt's important to note that while LeVay's findings have contributed to the scientific understanding of potential biological factors related to sexual orientation, they do not explain all aspects of sexual orientation, nor do they imply causation. The study of sexual orientation is complex and involves multiple factors including genetics, environment, and psychology."
