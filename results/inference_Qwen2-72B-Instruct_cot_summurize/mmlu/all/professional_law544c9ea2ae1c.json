He immediately sent a purchase order which stated \"our law firm accepts your $1,000 offer for 10,000 envelopes for $1,000 CIF.\"\u009d Costco then sent Rainmaking an order confirmation which stated \"Envelope order acceptance conditional upon a loading charge of $50 per thousand envelopes.\" If the parties disagree on the proper contract relationship, a court would likely rule:\n\nA. A contract at $1,000 because the offer terms CIF means cost, insurance and freight including all loading charges.\nB. A contract at $1,500 because the loading charges are to be included.\nC. No contract because the order confirmation was a counteroffer which was not accepted.\nD. No contract because the purchase order was the offer and, under the mirror image rule, can not be deviated from.\n"

No contract because the order confirmation was a counteroffer which was not accepted.\n\nWhen Marty Manager sent the purchase order, he was making an offer to Costco based on the terms in the catalog. Costco's order confirmation, however, included additional terms (the loading charge) that were not part of the original offer. This constitutes a counteroffer since it does not match the terms of the initial offer. For a contract to form, the acceptance must mirror the terms of the offer exactly unless there is a pre-existing business relationship between the parties that allows for some flexibility in the terms (which is not mentioned in this scenario). Since Rainmaking did not accept Costco's counteroffer, there is no contract."
