However, if I have to choose one that is less commonly criticized, it would be option B: \"When the securitizing actor is not the state, it can be unclear what would constitute an extraordinary measure.\" This criticism is still valid, but it is less frequently mentioned compared to the others. The most common criticisms usually focus on the lack of clarity and coherence in the concept of security (option A), the difficulty in distinguishing between political and security realms (option C), and the overall coherence and utility of the theory for analytical purposes (option D)."
