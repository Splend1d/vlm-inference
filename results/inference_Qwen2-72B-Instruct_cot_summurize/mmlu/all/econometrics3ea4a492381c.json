The sum of the RSS for the first and second sub-samples.\n\nWhen we talk about an \"unrestricted\" residual sum of squares (RSS), we refer to the RSS obtained from estimating the model without any constraints on the coefficients. In this case, if the sample is split into two halves and the model is estimated separately for each sub-sample, then the unrestricted RSS would be the sum of the RSS from both sub-samples. This is because each sub-sample regression is estimated independently without imposing any constraints that would restrict the estimates of the coefficients.\n\nThe RSS for the whole sample would be considered the \"restricted\" RSS if you were testing for structural stability, as it assumes that the coefficients are the same across the entire sample. However, since the question asks specifically for the \"unrestricted\" RSS, the correct answer is the sum of the RSS for the first and second sub-samples, which allows for potentially different coefficients in each sub-sample."
