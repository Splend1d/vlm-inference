Materialism refers to HM's focus on class and the productive basis of societies, as well as the ways in which social structures have the capacity to change and produce change.\n\nHistorical materialism, often associated with Karl Marx, posits that material conditions and economic factors are the primary drivers of historical development and societal change. This includes the relationships between different classes based on their positions within the means of production. Therefore, the definition of materialism in this context is most accurately described by option A."
