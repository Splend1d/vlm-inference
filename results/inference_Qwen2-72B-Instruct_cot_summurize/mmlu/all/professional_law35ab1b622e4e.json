The friend didn't like guns and decided to use a toy gun, which looked like a real gun, but only shot water. The defendant was aware that the gun was not real. Their plan fixed, they walked into the liquor store late one afternoon when few customers were in the store. The friend produced the toy pistol and pointed it at the customers and the clerk. The defendant ordered everyone to the floor, and the clerk began to rummage behind the counter for the key to the register. While his head was ducked, the clerk pulled a shotgun from behind the counter and fired it at the defendant and his friend. The defendant dived to the side, but his friend was shot and killed. If the defendant is subsequently charged with his friend's death he should be found\n\nA. guilty of felony murder.\nB. guilty of voluntary manslaughter.\nC. guilty, because a felon may be convicted of the murder of a co-felon.\nD. not guilty, because the clerk was justified in killing the friend.\n"

In this case, the felony being committed was armed robbery, even though the gun used was a toy. Therefore, the correct answer would be:\n\nA. guilty of felony murder.\n\nIt is important to note that the specifics of the law can vary by jurisdiction, and other factors such as self-defense claims by the clerk might also be considered in court. However, based on the information provided, option A is the most likely charge given the legal principle of felony murder."
