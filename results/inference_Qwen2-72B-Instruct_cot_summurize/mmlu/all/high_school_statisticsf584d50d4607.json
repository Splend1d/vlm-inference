According to the given data:\n\n- After the first year, 20% of these workers will have left, so 80% will remain.\n- Of those who remain, 5% will leave during the next year, meaning 95% will stay.\n\nSo, at the end of the first year, we expect \\(100 \\times 0.8 = 80\\) workers from the first batch to remain.\n\nThen, at the start of the second year, another 100 workers are hired. At the end of the second year:\n\n- For the first batch (hired at the start of the first year), 80% remained at the end of the first year, and now 95% of those will remain: \\(80 \\times 0.95 = 76\\).\n- For the second batch (hired at the start of the second year), 80% are expected to remain at the end of the second year: \\(100 \\times 0.8 = 80\\).\n\nAdding these together, the total number of workers expected to be on the job at the end of the second year is \\(76 + 80 = 156\\).\n\nThus, the correct answer is D. 156."
