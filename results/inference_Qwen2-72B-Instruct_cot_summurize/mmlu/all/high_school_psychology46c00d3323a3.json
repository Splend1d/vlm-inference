Standard deviation: This is a measure of dispersion, not central tendency.\n- B. Range: This is also a measure of dispersion and is highly sensitive to outliers as it is calculated as the difference between the largest and smallest values in a dataset.\n- C. Median: This is a measure of central tendency that represents the middle value of a dataset when it is ordered from least to greatest. The median is less affected by outliers because it only depends on the middle position(s) of the dataset.\n- D. Mean: This is a measure of central tendency but is sensitive to outliers because it takes into account every value in the dataset.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **C. median**."
