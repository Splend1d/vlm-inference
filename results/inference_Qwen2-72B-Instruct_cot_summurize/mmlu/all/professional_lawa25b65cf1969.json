The statute will be applicable to all leasehold contracts hereafter entered into between landlords and tenants involving residential and commercial properties. The new federal statute is intended to protect tenants from spiraling rents and \"profiteering\" by landlords without curtailing the supply of rental units or depriving landlords of substantial constitutional rights. The new federal statute would be most clearly constitutional as applied to\n\nA. the rental of a state-owned office building by a state to a privately owned business.\nB. the rental of residential property located in the District of Columbia by an individual landlord to a family of six.\nC. the rental of an apartment located by a real estate company to an individual tenant.\nD. the rental of an office building to a city by an individual landlord.\n"

                    "text": "The question asks for the scenario where the new federal statute would be most clearly constitutional. Given that Congress has the authority to regulate interstate commerce, and considering the scope of the statute which is aimed at stabilizing rents nationwide, the application of this statute would likely be most constitutionally sound in situations that clearly involve interstate commerce or fall under Congress's other enumerated powers.\n\nA. The rental of a state-owned office building by a state to a privately owned business is less likely to be subject to federal regulation because it involves a state government entity, and there may be concerns about states' rights and the Tenth Amendment.\n\nB. The rental of residential property located in the District of Columbia by an individual landlord to a family of six might be covered by the statute since the District of Columbia is directly under the jurisdiction of Congress, which has full legislative authority over the District (as per Article I, Section 8, Clause 17 of the U.S. Constitution).\n\nC. The rental of an apartment located by a real estate company to an individual tenant could be subject to federal regulation if it can be shown that the rental market affects interstate commerce, which is often the case with large-scale real estate companies.\n\nD. The rental of an office building to a city by an individual landlord might not be as clearly within Congress's regulatory power unless it can be demonstrated that this specific transaction significantly impacts interstate commerce.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most clearly constitutional application of the statute would be:\n\n**B. the rental of residential property located in the District of Columbia by an individual landlord to a family of six.**\n\nThis choice is based on the fact that Congress has direct legislative authority over the District of Columbia, making the application of a federal statute in this context less likely to be challenged on constitutional grounds compared to the other options."
