It is surrounded by mountains and can be approached from one side only; it has no crops, trees, or water, but has reservoirs in which rainwater is collected. The Arabs often cut off the inhabitants from their supply of drinking-water until the they buy them off with money and pieces of cloth. It is an exceedingly hot place. It is the port of the Indians, and to it come large vessels from Kinbayat [Cambay], Kawlam [Quilon], Calicut and many other Malabar ports [on the south-west coast of India]. There are Indian merchants living there, as well as Egyptian merchants. Its inhabitants are all either merchants, porters, or fishermen. Some of the merchants are immensely rich, so rich that sometimes a single merchant is sole owner of a large ship with all it contains, and this is a subject of ostentation and rivalry amongst them. In spite of that they are pious, humble, upright, and generous in character, treat strangers well, give liberally to devotees, and pay in full the tithes due to God.\"\nIbn Battuta, ca. 1325\u20131354 C.E.\nWhich of the following led directly to the development of the economic system described in the journal?\n\nA. Military campaigns\nB. Meteorological phenomena\nC. Competition with European trade networks\nD. The presence of highly developed port cities\n"

The economic system described is characterized by trade and commerce, with merchants from various regions, including India and Egypt, coming to the city to conduct business. The presence of large vessels from different ports in India and the existence of Indian and Egyptian merchants living in 'Aden indicate that trade was a significant factor in the development of the city's economy.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is D. The presence of highly developed port cities. The strategic location of 'Aden as a port city on the coast of the ocean, surrounded by mountains, made it an important center for trade and commerce. The city's location on major trade routes connecting the East and West allowed it to become a hub for merchants and traders from various regions, leading to the development of a thriving economic system based on trade and commerce."
