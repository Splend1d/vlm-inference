The number of computers launching the attack\n\nA Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack involves multiple computers or devices launching an attack on a target system, often coordinated by malware that turns these devices into a botnet. In contrast, a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack typically involves a single attacker using one computer to overwhelm a target system with traffic or requests. The key difference is the scale and distribution of the attack sources."
