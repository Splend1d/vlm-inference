Relationships between DNA sequences among the species did not match relationships between skeletal patterns.\n\nThe consistency between genetic and morphological data is crucial for supporting the accuracy of an evolutionary tree. If the DNA sequence relationships do not align with the skeletal pattern relationships, it would cast significant doubt on the validity of the tree's depiction of evolutionary relationships. This could indicate that there has been convergent evolution, gene flow between species, or other factors that have led to misleading morphological similarities or differences."
