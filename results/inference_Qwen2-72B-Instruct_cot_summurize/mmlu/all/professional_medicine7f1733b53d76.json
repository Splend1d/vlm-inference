He has a 15-year career history of sandblasting old buildings. He has smoked two packs of cigarettes daily for the past 30 years. The patient is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 59 kg (130 lb); BMI is 21 kg/m2 . Vital signs are temperature 36.8\u00b0C (98.2\u00b0F), pulse 94/min, and blood pressure 150/92 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 70%. On physical examination he is in moderately severe distress with pursed lips and cyanotic nail beds. Chest has an increased anteroposterior diameter. Auscultation of the chest discloses scattered wheezes and rhonchi over all lung fields. Cardiac examination discloses muffled heart sounds and an S4. Fingers are clubbed. Chest x-ray shows hyperinflated lungs, flattened diaphragm, large, irregular opacities in the upper lobes, and eggshell calcifications of the hilar lymph nodes. In addition to antibiotic therapy, which of the following is the most appropriate intervention?\n\nA. Azathioprine therapy\nB. Bronchoscopy\nC. Continuous humidified oxygen\nD. Nocturnal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)\n"

Given the patient's symptoms of severe dyspnea, low oxygen saturation, and the physical exam findings consistent with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbated by a possible respiratory infection, providing supplemental oxygen is critical to improve his oxygenation and alleviate his respiratory distress.\n\nWhile azathioprine therapy (option A) might be considered in certain conditions like autoimmune diseases, it is not indicated in this scenario where the primary issue is respiratory compromise due to COPD and possibly an acute exacerbation from infection.\n\nBronchoscopy (option B) could be useful for diagnostic purposes, such as obtaining samples for culture or visualizing the airways for any obstructions, but it is not the immediate treatment needed for this patient's acute respiratory distress.\n\nNocturnal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) (option D) is typically used for sleep apnea and is not the primary treatment for a patient in acute respiratory distress due to COPD exacerbation. It may be considered later if there is evidence of sleep-disordered breathing after the acute situation is stabilized.\n\nGiven the severity of the patient's condition, continuous humidified oxygen is the most immediate and appropriate intervention to address his hypoxemia and respiratory distress. Additional interventions may include bronchodilators, corticosteroids, and close monitoring in an intensive care setting. Antibiotic therapy should also be initiated based on the clinical suspicion of a bacterial infection contributing to the exacerbation."
