These can include:\n- A diagnostic algorithm: This is necessary to identify and classify cases accurately.\n- Staff members: These individuals are responsible for collecting, analyzing, and interpreting data, as well as taking appropriate action based on the results.\n- A sampling frame: This refers to the specific population or subset of a population from which data will be collected. It ensures that the data collected is representative and can be used to make valid inferences about the larger population.\n\nTherefore, all of the options listed (A, B, and C) are important requirements for an effective surveillance system."
