This can create ethical dilemmas because it may be difficult to determine which contemporary Native American group has the strongest claim to the remains or cultural items. Additionally, some Native American groups may object to any archaeological research on their ancestors' remains, regardless of the age of the burial.\n\nHowever, options A, B, and C can also present challenges in the context of archaeological research involving indigenous sites and human remains, but they are not directly related to the specific issue posed in the question regarding the impossibility of establishing connections with modern groups due to the antiquity of the remains. \n\nA. Both non-indigenous archaeologists and Native Americans being allowed onto the site at the same time can lead to tensions if there are differing views on how the site should be treated or what research should be conducted.\n\nB. The lack of Native American archaeologists can result in a lack of understanding or sensitivity towards indigenous perspectives and practices, potentially leading to disrespectful or inappropriate handling of remains and artifacts.\n\nC. Disagreements over the location of burials can delay or prevent proper archaeological investigation and repatriation efforts, leading to frustration and conflict between archaeologists and Native American communities."
