Displaced apex beat; soft first heart sound; pan-systolic murmur; short mid-diastolic murmur\n\nThis combination of physical examination findings is most consistent with mixed mitral valve disease with a predominance of mitral regurgitation. A displaced apex beat suggests an enlarged left ventricle, which can occur in response to the volume overload associated with mitral regurgitation. A soft S1 may be present due to reduced closure of the mitral valve leaflets during systole. A pan-systolic murmur is characteristic of mitral regurgitation and occurs throughout systole. The short mid-diastolic murmur could represent an opening snap or a diastolic rumble, both of which can occur in the setting of mitral stenosis, which often coexists with mitral regurgitation in mixed mitral valve disease."
