This results in a higher equilibrium level of real GDP as the economy moves along the short-run Aggregate Supply (AS) curve. The price level also increases because of the higher demand for goods and services. As real GDP rises above its natural level, unemployment tends to decrease because firms need to hire more workers to meet the increased demand for their products."
