In Scenario 1, guiding someone to the cosmetics aisle when they ask for advice is helpful and not harmful. In Scenario 2, giving someone a push on a swing when they are presumably playing and no one is being hurt is also not considered morally wrong. However, it's important to note that in Scenario 2, the action should only be done with consent and under conditions where it is safe to do so. If either condition is not met, the action could potentially become morally questionable. But based on the information given, neither scenario involves any harm or wrongdoing."
