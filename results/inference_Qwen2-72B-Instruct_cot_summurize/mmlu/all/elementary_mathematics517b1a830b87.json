Add 4 each time to get the next number.\n\nExplanation: The given sequence starts at 5 and increases by 4 for each subsequent term (5, 9, 13, 17, 21, 25, 29). This matches option C's description. Options A and B do not fit because they start from 0, which does not match the first term of the sequence. Option D starts correctly but adds 5 instead of 4, which also doesn't match the sequence."
