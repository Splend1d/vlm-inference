Are informed about our study and give their consent to participate.\n\nBefore collecting data from human subjects, it is essential to ensure that they are fully informed about the nature of the study, its purpose, procedures, risks, benefits, and their rights as participants. This process is known as obtaining informed consent. It is a critical ethical requirement in research involving human subjects to protect their autonomy, dignity, and welfare. Additionally, it is important to note that D is also relevant, as most studies involving human subjects require approval from an Institutional Review Board (IRB) or equivalent ethics committee to ensure that the research is conducted ethically and with appropriate safeguards for participants. However, the question specifically asks for what must be ensured before collecting data, making C the most directly applicable answer."
