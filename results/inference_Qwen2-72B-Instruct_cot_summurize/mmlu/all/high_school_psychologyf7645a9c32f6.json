While SSRIs may also be used to treat other conditions such as anxiety disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), the most common use is for treating depressive disorders. They are not typically used for manic episodes, dissociative identity disorder, or conversion disorder."
