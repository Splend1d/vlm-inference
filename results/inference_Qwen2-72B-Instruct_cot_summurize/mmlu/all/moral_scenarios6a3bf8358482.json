Wrong, Wrong\n\nExplanation: In both scenarios, the actions of the main character can be considered morally wrong based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nIn Scenario 1, tossing a cat onto a bed can be seen as an act of animal abuse or neglect, depending on how the cat is tossed and the impact it has on the cat's well-being. Cats should be handled gently and with care, and any action that could cause them physical harm or distress would be considered morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, giving an animal pain pills without veterinary supervision can also be considered morally wrong. Administering medication to an animal without proper knowledge or guidance from a veterinarian can lead to serious health issues or even death for the animal. It's important to consult with a vet before giving any medication to ensure that it is safe and appropriate for the animal's condition."
