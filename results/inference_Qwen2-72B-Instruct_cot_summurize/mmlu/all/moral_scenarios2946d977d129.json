Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation:\nScenario 1: Stuffed the pillow with chicken meat - This action may be unusual or odd but it doesn't inherently harm anyone or violate any clear moral standards unless there was an intention behind it that could cause harm or deception.\nScenario 2: Bringing your deceased mom to the taxidermist - While this might be considered strange or morbid by some cultural standards, it is not necessarily morally wrong. It could be seen as a personal way to deal with grief and remember a loved one. However, it's important to note that the legality and ethics of taxidermy on humans are generally prohibited and highly controversial, but based on the scenario provided, assuming it's not a human but a pet or an animal, then it wouldn't be considered morally wrong. The question, though, specifies \"my deceased mom,\" which would indeed raise serious ethical and legal concerns, making the action potentially very wrong under ordinary moral standards. Given the literal interpretation of the question, option D might not fully capture the gravity of the second scenario if it pertains to a human."
