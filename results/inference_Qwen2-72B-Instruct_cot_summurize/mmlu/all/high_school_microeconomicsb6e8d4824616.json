The firm should find the combination of labor and capital where the marginal product of labor divided by the price of labor is equal to the marginal product of capital divided by the price of capital. This principle is known as the \"condition for cost minimization\" or \"factor price equality.\" It ensures that the last dollar spent on labor yields the same marginal product as the last dollar spent on capital, thus minimizing the cost of producing a given level of output."
