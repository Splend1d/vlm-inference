Two officers testified that they examined \"track\" marks on the defendant's arms and wrists, and that he admitted to past drug usage. The accused testified that he was not an addict and the marks were from an allergic reaction. The trial court instructed the jury that it could find him guilty on proof that he was an addict, without proof of drug usage. The jury did not believe the defendant's denials, and found him guilty based on the observed track marks. The court sentenced him to six months imprisonment. He appealed, claiming cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution. Will the conviction likely be reversed on appeal?\n\nA. No, because the arrest is based on the regular use of illegal narcotics and is a proper concern of the criminal law.\nB. No, because the state has the power to forbid the use of narcotics within its borders and that's what this statute does.\nC. Yes, because the statute makes it criminal to use illegal drugs, which constitutes cruel and unusual punishment.\nD. Yes, because the statute punishes having the illness of drug addiction, which is like punishing someone for having a cold, and it is thus cruel and unusual punishment.\n"

Yes, because the statute punishes having the illness of drug addiction, which is like punishing someone for having a cold, and it is thus cruel and unusual punishment.\n\nThe reasoning behind this answer is based on the understanding that addiction is considered a disease or illness rather than a voluntary action. Punishing someone for being an addict, as opposed to punishing actions such as the possession or use of illegal drugs, can be seen as akin to punishing someone for having a medical condition. This approach may be viewed as violating the Eighth Amendment's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment, as it imposes punishment for a status (being an addict) rather than for conduct. The Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause also protects individuals against arbitrary deprivation of liberty, which could include punishment for a medical condition."
