After losing a large amount of money, the defendants accused the victim of cheating. When the victim tried to leave, the defendants beat him with their fists and, as the victim fell to the ground, they continued by kicking him in the head. The victim suffered a fractured skull in the beating and died as a result of severe head trauma. Thereafter, the defendants reached into the victim's pocket and stole his wallet. The defendants were arrested and charged with the murder of the victim. Prior to trial, the prosecutor admitted that it was impossible to determine which defendant was responsible for actually fracturing the victim's skull. If the defendants are prosecuted for felony murder, which of the following would provide their best defense?\n\nA. The jurisdiction adheres to the inherently dangerous felony requirement.\nB. The jurisdiction follows the independent felony murder rule.\nC. The jurisdiction follows the proximate cause theory.\nD. The jurisdiction follows the agency theory.\n"

                    "text": "The best defense for the defendants would be if the jurisdiction follows the \"agency theory\" (Option D). Under the agency theory of felony murder, the prosecution must prove that the death occurred as a result of the actions of the defendants or their co-felons during the commission of the felony. Since the prosecutor cannot determine which defendant was responsible for fracturing the victim's skull, it could be argued under the agency theory that neither defendant can be held responsible for the actual death if it was caused by the other.\n\nHowever, this defense is not foolproof, as courts often apply the agency theory in a way that holds all participants in a felony responsible for any deaths that occur during its commission, regardless of who directly caused the fatal injury. This is because each participant is considered an agent of the others when committing the crime together.\n\nHere's a brief explanation of the other options:\n\nA. The inherently dangerous felony requirement means that only certain felonies (like robbery, arson, rape, etc.) that are deemed inherently dangerous can trigger felony murder liability. While assault might qualify as such a felony in many jurisdictions, this defense does not address the issue of who actually caused the fatal injury.\n\nB. The independent felony murder rule would not be helpful in this scenario. This rule states that if the felony is complete before the killing occurs, the felony murder rule does not apply. In this case, the killing occurred during the commission of the felony (assault), so this rule would not exonerate the defendants.\n\nC. The proximate cause theory holds that the defendants can be liable for any foreseeable consequences of their actions, including the death of the victim. This would likely not be a strong defense for the defendants since the death was a direct and foreseeable result of the assault."
