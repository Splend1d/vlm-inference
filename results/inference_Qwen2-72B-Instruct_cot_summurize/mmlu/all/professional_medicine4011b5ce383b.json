Acting out is a defense mechanism where the individual expresses their feelings and conflicts through actions rather than words. In this case, the patient is expressing her feelings about her parents' separation through risky sexual behavior, smoking, disobedience, and truancy. These behaviors are often seen as attempts to cope with emotional distress or to gain attention and control in situations where the individual feels powerless."
