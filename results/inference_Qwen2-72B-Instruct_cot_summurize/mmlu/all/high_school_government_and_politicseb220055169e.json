This trend has led to fewer and larger media conglomerates controlling more of the news outlets, which can result in a homogenization of viewpoints and a narrowing of the range of stories that are covered. This concentration of ownership can also lead to conflicts of interest, as media companies may be reluctant to report negatively on other companies within their corporate umbrella."
