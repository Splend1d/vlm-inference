Aman took possession of the land in 1987 as an adversepossessor and remained on the land from 1987 to 1997;he then left the property to care for his sick mother forone year, returning the following year, 1999. Assume that the statutory period for adverse possession in this state is 20 years. In 2010, the farmer wanted to move back to the tract because he desired to return to the country. Finding the man in possession, the farmer initiated a suit in ejectment against the man. The most probable judicial determination would be\n\nA. the farmer would lose, because the man's possession was open, hostile, and continuous.\nB. the farmer would lose, because the man had fulfilled the required statutory period to become an adverse possessor.\nC. the farmer would win, because the man's possession was not continuous.\nD. the farmer would win, because he is the titleholder of record.\n"

Here, the man left the property for one year to care for his sick mother, breaking the continuity of his possession. Since the statutory period for adverse possession is 20 years and the man only possessed the property for 19 continuous years (from 1987 to 1997) before leaving for a year, he did not fulfill the required statutory period to become an adverse possessor. When the man returned in 1999, he would have needed to start the clock running again for another 20-year period of continuous possession. As of 2010, he still would not have met the full statutory requirement for adverse possession."
