Roosevelt initially favored an isolationist stance because he believed that internal reform, particularly addressing the Great Depression through his New Deal programs, was more important than engaging in international affairs. This stance was also influenced by the widespread public sentiment against involvement in another European war following the devastation of World War I. Isolationism was a popular political position in the United States at the time, as many Americans wanted to avoid entanglement in foreign conflicts and focus on domestic issues. However, it's worth noting that Roosevelt's views evolved over time, and he eventually led the country into active participation in World War II after the attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941."
