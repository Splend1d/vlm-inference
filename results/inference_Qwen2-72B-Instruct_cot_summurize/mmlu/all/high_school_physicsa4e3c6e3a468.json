The velocity and height of the elevator do not directly affect the tension in the cables unless they influence the acceleration. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Mass and acceleration\n\nThis is because the force required to lift the elevator (and thus the tension in the cables) can be calculated using Newton's second law of motion: F = ma, where F is the net force (tension minus weight), m is the mass of the elevator and its contents, and a is the acceleration. If the elevator is accelerating upwards, the tension will be greater than the weight; if it is moving at constant velocity, the tension will equal the weight; and if it is decelerating, the tension will be less than the weight."
