However, if we have to choose one that is of less value compared to others, it would be:\n\nC. Maternal serum screening\n\nWhile maternal serum screening can indicate an increased risk for NTDs by measuring alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels, which are often elevated in pregnancies affected by NTDs, it is not as definitive as other methods. Amniocentesis and CVS allow for direct analysis of fetal cells or fluid, providing more concrete genetic information. Ultrasonography can visually confirm the presence of an NTD during the second trimester. Therefore, maternal serum screening is more of a screening tool rather than a definitive diagnostic technique."
