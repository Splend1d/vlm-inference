Due care.\n\nThis defense involves demonstrating that the CPA acted with the level of skill and diligence that a reasonable professional in the same field would have exercised under similar circumstances. Essentially, it means the CPA adhered to the standard of care expected in their profession.\n\nB. Ignorance of the law is not typically a viable defense in cases of professional negligence, as professionals are expected to know and comply with relevant laws and regulations.\n\nC. Lack of intent is not relevant in a negligence case, as negligence does not require intent to cause harm; it only requires a failure to meet the standard of care.\n\nD. Lack of mental capacity could potentially be a defense if it can be shown that the CPA was unable to understand the nature and consequences of their actions due to a mental incapacity at the time of the alleged negligence. However, this is a high bar to clear and would require substantial evidence.\n\nTherefore, option A, \"Due care,\" is the most likely successful defense in a negligence suit against a CPA."
