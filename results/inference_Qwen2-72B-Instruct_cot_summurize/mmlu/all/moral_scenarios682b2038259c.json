In scenario 1, calling in sick to work when you are not actually ill is generally viewed as dishonest and potentially harmful to one's employer and coworkers who may have to cover for the absence. In scenario 2, leaving litter, such as a hamburger wrapper, in the ocean is environmentally irresponsible and can harm marine life, which is also widely regarded as wrong."
