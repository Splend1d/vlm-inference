The Human Rights Act 1998 incorporates the European Convention on Human Rights into UK law\n\nThis act indeed brought the rights and freedoms in the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) into UK law, allowing individuals to seek remedies in UK courts rather than having to go to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.\n\nStatement B is incorrect because the HRA does not allow UK courts to invalidate primary legislation; instead, they can issue a declaration of incompatibility if a piece of legislation is found to be incompatible with the ECHR.\n\nStatement C is partially correct but not entirely accurate as phrased. While the HRA does provide a mechanism for individuals to challenge actions that they believe violate their human rights, it's not quite accurate to say \"any person with a reasonable case\" can bring a case before a court. There are certain procedural requirements and standing rules that must be met.\n\nStatement D is incorrect because the Human Rights Act 1998 does not incorporate the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights into UK law. The EU Charter was only binding on the UK while it was a member of the European Union, and its incorporation into UK law would have required separate legislation."
