Family History - If one or both of your parents or siblings have type 2 diabetes, your risk is higher.\n\nB. Being Overweight - The more body fat you carry, especially around your abdomen, the more resistant your cells become to insulin.\n\nC. High Intake of Dietary Fat - A diet high in saturated fats and trans fats can lead to obesity and increase your risk of developing type 2 diabetes. However, it's worth noting that the relationship between dietary fat and diabetes is complex and depends on the type of fat consumed.\n\nAdditionally, other risk factors include physical inactivity, age (risk increases with age), ethnicity (certain ethnicities like African Americans, Hispanics/Latinos, American Indians, and some Asian Americans are at higher risk), and having prediabetes or gestational diabetes during pregnancy."
