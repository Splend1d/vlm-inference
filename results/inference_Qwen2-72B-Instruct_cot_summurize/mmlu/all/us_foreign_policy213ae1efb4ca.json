Local developments were viewed through a geopolitical lens\n\nDuring the Cold War, the United States often perceived events and developments in the Third World (countries that were not aligned with either the Western or Eastern blocs) through the lens of the global ideological struggle between capitalism and communism. This context led to a heightened interest in regions previously considered peripheral to U.S. interests, as the country sought to contain the spread of Soviet influence and promote its own political and economic systems.\n\nThe U.S. often intervened in Third World countries, sometimes covertly and other times overtly, to support governments or factions that opposed communist ideologies or movements. This was evident in various proxy wars and coups throughout Latin America, Africa, and Asia. Additionally, the U.S. provided aid and support to countries that aligned with its anti-communist stance as part of its strategy to prevent the domino effect of countries falling under communist control.\n\nDecolonization was a complex process during this period, and while the U.S. generally supported the principle of self-determination, it also frequently prioritized strategic interests over democratic principles when choosing which leaders or movements to support. For example, the U.S. often backed authoritarian regimes if they were anti-communist, even if they were undemocratic or repressive."
