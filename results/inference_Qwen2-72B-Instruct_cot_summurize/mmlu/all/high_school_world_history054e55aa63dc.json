On the other hand, many poor peasants are still living in poverty for lack of sufficient means of production, with some in debt and others selling or renting out their land. If this tendency goes unchecked, the polarization in the countryside will inevitably be aggravated day by day. Those peasants who lose their land and those who remain in poverty will complain that we are doing nothing to save them from ruin or to help them overcome their difficulties. Nor will the well-to-do middle peasants who are heading in the capitalist direction be pleased with us, for we shall never be able to satisfy their demands unless we intend to take the capitalist road. Can the worker-peasant alliance continue to stand in these circumstances? Obviously not! There is no solution to this problem except on a new basis. And that means to bring about, step by step, the socialist transformation of the whole of agriculture simultaneously with the gradual realization of socialist industrialization and the socialist transformation of handicrafts and capitalist industry and commerce; in other words, it means to carry out co-operation and eliminate the rich-peasant economy and the individual economy in the countryside so that all the rural people will become increasingly well off together. We maintain that this is the only way to consolidate the worker-peasant alliance.\"\nMao Zedong, On the Question of Agricultural Co-operation, 1955\nMao's quotation is best understood in the context of which of the following?\n\nA. Governments in communist countries implementing liberal political and economic reforms to mitigate social unrest\nB. Governments promoting collectivization of the land to reduce inequality between sectors of the population\nC. Governments promoting policies intended to hasten industrialization\nD. Governments promoting capitalist policies to reduce inequality between sectors of the population\n"

Governments promoting collectivization of the land to reduce inequality between sectors of the population\n\nMao's quotation is advocating for the socialist transformation of agriculture through cooperation, which is a reference to collectivization. He argues that the only way to address the growing disparities in the countryside and consolidate the worker-peasant alliance is by eliminating the rich-peasant economy and individual economy, and bringing about socialism in agriculture. This approach was part of Mao's broader policy of collectivizing agriculture in China to reduce inequality and support the development of a socialist society."
