Denial (which includes arguments that the crisis does not exist, or that the organization is not responsible)\n2. Evasion of responsibility (which includes strategies like scapegoating and minimization)\n3. Reduction of blame (which includes strategies like apology, compensation, and bolstering)\n\nThe specific strategies you listed in your question correspond to the following:\n\nA. Ingratiation is a form of bolstering, where the organization attempts to improve its image by reminding stakeholders of its good qualities.\nB. Downplaying is a form of minimization, where the organization tries to make the crisis seem less serious than it actually is.\nC. Distancing is a form of evasion of responsibility, where the organization tries to separate itself from the crisis.\n\nNonexistence is not one of the four categories identified by Coombs, although it could be considered a form of denial. However, since denial is already one of the three main categories, \"nonexistence\" would not be considered a separate category."
