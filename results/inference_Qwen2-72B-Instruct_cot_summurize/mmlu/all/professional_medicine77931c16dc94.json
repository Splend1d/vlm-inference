Therefore, the correct answer is D.\n\nTNF-\u03b1 inhibitors have been shown to be effective in reducing inflammation and improving symptoms in patients with ankylosing spondylitis who have failed to respond to other treatments. Examples of TNF-\u03b1 inhibitors include etanercept, infliximab, adalimumab, certolizumab pegol, and golimumab.\n\nIn contrast, drugs that inhibit cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4), epidermal growth factor (EGF), or interleukin-1 (IL-1) are not typically used in the treatment of ankylosing spondylitis."
