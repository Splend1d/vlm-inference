If \\(v\\) is an eigenvector of \\(A\\), then by definition there exists a scalar \\(\\lambda\\) such that:\n\\[Av = \\lambda v\\]\n\nFor \\(2A\\), we have:\n\\[(2A)v = 2(Av) = 2(\\lambda v) = (2\\lambda)v\\]\n\nThus, \\(v\\) is also an eigenvector of \\(2A\\) with eigenvalue \\(2\\lambda\\). So, statement I is true.\n\nII. For \\(A^2\\), we have:\n\\[A^2v = A(Av) = A(\\lambda v) = \\lambda(Av) = \\lambda(\\lambda v) = \\lambda^2v\\]\n\nThus, \\(v\\) is also an eigenvector of \\(A^2\\) with eigenvalue \\(\\lambda^2\\). So, statement II is true.\n\nIII. Since \\(A\\) is invertible, it has an inverse \\(A^{-1}\\). For \\(A^{-1}\\), we have:\n\\[A^{-1}v = A^{-1}(\\lambda v) = \\lambda(A^{-1}v)\\]\n\nTo find the correct form, note that multiplying both sides by \\(A\\) yields:\n\\[v = \\lambda(A^{-1}v)\\]\n\nThis implies:\n\\[A^{-1}v = \\frac{1}{\\lambda}v\\]\n\nThus, \\(v\\) is also an eigenvector of \\(A^{-1}\\) with eigenvalue \\(\\frac{1}{\\lambda}\\).
