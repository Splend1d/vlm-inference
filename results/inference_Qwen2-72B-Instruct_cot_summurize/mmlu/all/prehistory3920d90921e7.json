However, it's important to note that the Natufian culture, based in the Levant (which includes modern-day Israel), started gathering wild cereals around 12,000 B.P., but the earliest evidence of actual cultivation of grains might be closer to 10,000 B.P. So depending on the specific context or study being referred to, either B or C could be correct, but the most common answer would be C. 10,000 B.P."
