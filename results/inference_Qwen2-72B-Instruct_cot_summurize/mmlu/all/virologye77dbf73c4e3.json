In 1892, Iwanowsky was investigating the cause of a disease in tobacco plants that came to be known as tobacco mosaic disease. He found that the infectious agent could pass through a filter that was fine enough to stop bacteria, suggesting that it was much smaller than a bacterium. This discovery paved the way for the later identification of viruses as a distinct class of pathogens."
