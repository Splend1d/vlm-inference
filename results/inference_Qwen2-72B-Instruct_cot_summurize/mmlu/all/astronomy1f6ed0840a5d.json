These increases are largely due to human activities such as burning fossil fuels for energy, deforestation, and industrial processes. While forest fires can contribute to CO2 emissions, they are not the primary cause of the observed long-term warming trend. The release of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) is responsible for ozone depletion but is not the main driver of global warming. Politicians' rhetoric does not have a physical impact on the climate."
