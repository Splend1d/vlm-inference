She plans a middle school experiment in which an SRS of 30 eighth graders will be assigned four extra hours of reading per week, an SRS of 30 seventh graders will be assigned two extra hours of reading per week, and an SRS of 30 sixth graders with no extra assigned reading will be a control group. After one school year, the mean GPAs from each group will be compared. Is this a good experimental design?\n\nA. Yes.\nB. No, because while this design may point out an association between reading and GPA, it cannot establish a cause-and-effect relationship.\nC. No, because without blinding, there is a strong chance of a placebo effect.\nD. No, because grade level is a lurking variable which may well be confounded with the variables under consideration.\n"

No, because grade level is a lurking variable which may well be confounded with the variables under consideration.\n\nThis experimental design does not take into account that grade level itself might affect GPA independently of the amount of reading time. Sixth, seventh, and eighth graders may have different GPAs due to differences in the difficulty of their classes or other factors related to being in different grades, not just the amount of reading they do. Therefore, grade level is a potential confounding variable that could obscure any true effect of reading on GPA. A better design would involve random assignment of all students (from the same grade) to different levels of reading intervention."
