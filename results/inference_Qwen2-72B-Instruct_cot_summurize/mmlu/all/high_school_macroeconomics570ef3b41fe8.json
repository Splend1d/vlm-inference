Some of the things included in M2 are not as liquid as the things in M1.\n\nExplanation:\n\nM1 and M2 are both measures of the money supply, but they include different types of assets with varying degrees of liquidity. M1 includes the most liquid forms of money, such as physical currency, demand deposits (checking accounts), and other highly liquid assets that can be quickly converted into cash without significant loss of value. M2, on the other hand, includes all of the components of M1 plus less liquid assets like savings accounts, small time deposits (certificates of deposit under $100,000), and retail money market funds. These additional components of M2 take longer to convert into cash and may incur penalties for early withdrawal.\n\nStatement B is incorrect because M2 is typically larger than M1 since it includes more components.\n\nStatement C is incorrect because neither M1 nor M2 is backed by gold or silver. The U.S. dollar is fiat money, which means its value is derived from government decree rather than being pegged to a physical commodity.\n\nStatement D is partially correct, but it doesn't address the question directly. It is true that currency is a big part of M1, but this statement does not differentiate between M1 and M2 or address their relative sizes or liquidity."
