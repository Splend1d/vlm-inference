In Scenario 2, if you are a dentist or dental professional who has the appropriate consent and medical justification to pull the frightened patient's teeth after administering novocaine (a local anesthetic), then this action would not be considered morally wrong as it is part of providing necessary medical care. However, if you are not a qualified medical professional or did not have proper consent, then it would be wrong. Assuming standard conditions where the person is acting within their professional capacity, the second scenario is not wrong."
