Thiamin deficiency in alcoholics is a common cause of Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, a serious neurological disorder characterized by confusion, memory loss, and difficulties with eye movements and coordination. This condition can be fatal if left untreated but can be reversed with prompt thiamin replacement therapy."
