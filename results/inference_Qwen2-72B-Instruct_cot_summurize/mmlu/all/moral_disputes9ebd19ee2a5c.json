He argues that if a person's suffering is so great that it outweighs any potential benefits of continuing to live, then euthanasia may be justified as a way to maximize overall happiness and minimize suffering. This perspective contrasts with Kantian ethics, which emphasizes duty and the intrinsic value of human life, and existentialist ethics, which focuses on individual freedom and authenticity. Feminist considerations typically relate to issues of gender equality and power dynamics, and do not directly pertain to Velleman's argument for euthanasia."
