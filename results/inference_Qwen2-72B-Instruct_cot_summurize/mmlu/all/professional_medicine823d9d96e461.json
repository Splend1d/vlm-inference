His temperature is 38.3\u00b0C (101\u00b0F). Examination of the right forearm shows edema around a fluctuant erythematous lesion at the site of trauma. The area is extremely tender to palpation. Which of the following is most likely the primary mechanism of the development of edema in this patient?\n\nA. Disruption of vascular basement membranes\nB. Increased hydrostatic pressure\nC. Release of thromboxane\nD. Separation of endothelial junctions\n"

Separation of endothelial junctions.\n\nWhen there is an inflammatory response, such as that occurring in this patient's injured and infected arm, the endothelial cells lining the blood vessels become more permeable. This can occur through several mechanisms, including separation of the tight junctions between endothelial cells, which allows fluid and proteins to leak out of the vasculature into the surrounding tissue, causing edema. The other options listed do not directly relate to the mechanism of edema formation in this scenario:\n\nA. Disruption of vascular basement membranes would lead to leakage but is less common in acute inflammation.\nB. Increased hydrostatic pressure can contribute to edema but is not the primary cause in acute inflammatory responses.\nC. Release of thromboxane is related to platelet aggregation and vasoconstriction rather than edema formation."
