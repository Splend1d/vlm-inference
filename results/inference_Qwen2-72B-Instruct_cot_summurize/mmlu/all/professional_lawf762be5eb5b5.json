The man said out loud, \"Oh God, look what that truck driver did. The man driving that truck was racing and going about 100 mph.! Someone call 911!!\" A woman, who was sitting on the beach nearby, but facing the other way, heard the man's outcry. When the case comes to trial, will the court allow both the man and the woman to testify about the man's utterances?\n\nA. Yes, both the woman and the man can testify because it is an excited utterance exception to the hearsay rule that goes to the material issue of the case.\nB. Yes, because this is not hearsay and it is not being entered for the truth of the statement by either witness so that they can both testify.\nC. No, neither of them can testify because the man was impaired due to being too relaxed from his meditation, and the woman cannot repeat the utterances of an impaired witness.\nD. No, neither can testify because the utterances do not fit any of the exceptions to the hearsay rule.\n"

Yes, both the woman and the man can testify because it is an excited utterance exception to the hearsay rule that goes to the material issue of the case.\n\nThe man's statement would likely be admissible under the excited utterance exception to the hearsay rule. An excited utterance is a statement made while the declarant is under the stress of excitement caused by a startling event or condition and before there has been time to reflect and fabricate. The fact that the man was in a relaxed meditative state prior to witnessing the accident does not necessarily mean he was impaired; rather, the startling event of the accident could have induced a sufficient level of excitement to qualify his statement as an excited utterance.\n\nThe woman, who heard the man's statement, can also testify about what she heard. Her testimony is not considered hearsay because she is not testifying to the truth of the matter asserted (i.e., that the truck was indeed going 100 mph), but rather to the fact that the man made the statement. This is relevant to the emotional state of the man at the time of the accident and may be used to support the argument that the accident was sudden and unexpected, which could be relevant to the case."
