                    "text": "D. All options given are correct\n\nLet's break down each statement:\n\nA. Consumption of a meal leads to suppression of lipase activity within adipose tissue leading to a decrease in plasma NEFA (non-esterified fatty acids) concentrations: This is correct. After eating, insulin levels rise, which inhibits hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) in adipose tissue. HSL is responsible for breaking down stored triglycerides into free fatty acids (FFAs), also known as NEFAs. When HSL is inhibited, less NEFA is released into the bloodstream.\n\nB. Adipose tissue lipoprotein lipase is activated by insulin and therefore is most active following meal consumption: This is also correct. Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) in adipose tissue is indeed activated by insulin. LPL plays a critical role in the postprandial state by hydrolyzing triglycerides from circulating lipoproteins (such as chylomicrons and VLDL), allowing for the uptake of fatty acids by adipose tissue and muscle cells.\n\nC. During the postprandial period the VLDL synthesis pathway is suppressed in favour of hydrolysis of chylomicrons: This statement is accurate. After a meal, the liver reduces the synthesis of very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) because dietary fats are being absorbed and transported via chylomicrons. The body prioritizes the use of these dietary lipids over endogenously produced lipids during the postprandial phase.\n\nTherefore, all three statements A, B, and C are correct, making option D the right choice."
