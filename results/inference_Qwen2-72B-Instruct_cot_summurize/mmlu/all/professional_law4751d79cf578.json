A contractor who was unaware of the fee requirement agreed to perform home repairs for a city resident. After the contractor completed the work, the resident discovered that the contractor had not paid the licensing fee, and she refused to pay for the repairs, which were otherwise satisfactory. If the contractor sues the resident for breach of contract, how is the court likely to rule?\n\nA. Although the contract violates the law and is void, the court will require the homeowner to pay the contractor the reasonable value of the work accepted.\nB. Although the contract violates the law, the court will find that public policy does not bar enforcement of the contract, because the purpose of the fee is merely to raise revenue.\nC. Because the contract violates the law and is void, the court will not enforce it.\nD. Because the purpose of the fee is merely to raise revenue, the court will find that the contract does not violate the law but will allow the contractor to recover his costs only.\n"

Because the contract violates the law and is void, the court will not enforce it.\n\nCourts generally do not enforce contracts that are illegal or against public policy. In this case, the contractor's failure to pay the required licensing fee means that the contract for home repairs is illegal and therefore void. As such, the court is unlikely to enforce the contract and allow the contractor to recover payment from the homeowner.\n\nHowever, it is possible that the court may allow the contractor to recover the reasonable value of the work accepted under a theory of quantum meruit (as stated in option A), if the contractor can demonstrate that the work performed had value and the homeowner has benefited from it. This would depend on the specific laws and legal precedents in the jurisdiction where the case is being heard. Option B and D are incorrect as they incorrectly state that the contract does not violate the law, when in fact it does due to the contractor's failure to pay the required licensing fee."
