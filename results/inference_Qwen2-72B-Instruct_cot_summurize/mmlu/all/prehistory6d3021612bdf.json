However, if I must choose one that is least likely to be associated with widespread findings of Clovis points based on current archaeological knowledge, it would be:\n\nA. Alaska.\n\nWhile there have been some Paleoindian finds in Alaska, the Clovis culture is primarily associated with the southern part of North America, including the contiguous United States, parts of Canada, and even extending into Mexico. The Clovis culture is named after artifacts found near Clovis, New Mexico, and dates back approximately 13,000 years. It's important to note that the distribution of Clovis points could change as new discoveries are made and our understanding of prehistoric cultures evolves."
