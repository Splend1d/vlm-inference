                    "text": "The concept of 'de facto' organs in international law refers to individuals or entities that, though not officially recognized or appointed, exercise elements of governmental authority or act on behalf of the state. Under the International Law Commission's (ILC) Articles on State Responsibility, the actions of these entities can be attributed to the State if they meet certain criteria. The correct answer(s) would be:\n\nB. 'De facto organs' are the persons, which are, in fact, acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, that State in carrying out the conduct attributable to the State.\n\nThis is because under Article 8 of the ILC's Articles on State Responsibility, the conduct of any person or group of persons shall be considered an act of a State under international law if the person or group of persons is in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, that State in carrying out the conduct. This includes situations where a State exercises effective control over military or paramilitary operations carried out by non-state actors.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the concept of 'de facto' organs can also encompass situations described in option A, where individuals are empowered by law to exercise elements of governmental authority, even if they are not formally recognized as such. This might occur in situations of internal conflict or when a government is not functioning normally.\n\nOption C could also be considered correct in some interpretations, as de jure organs acting ultra vires (beyond their legal authority) may still have their actions attributed to the State. This is covered under Article 7 of the ILC's Articles on State Responsibility.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the whole point of attributing actions to a State under international law is to hold the State responsible for those actions. If the acts or omissions of an organ cannot be attributed to the State, then they do not fall under the State's responsibility.\n\nIn summary, both options A and B accurately describe circumstances under which individuals or entities can be considered 'de facto' organs of the State, with option B being the most direct definition according to the ILC's Articles on State Responsibility. Option C can also be relevant under certain conditions, while option D does not fit the criteria for attribution of conduct to a State."
