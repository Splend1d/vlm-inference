The lateral pterygoid muscle, on the other hand, is mainly responsible for depression and protrusion of the mandible.\n\nSo, from the options given:\n\nA. Masseter - Correct, it elevates the mandible.\nB. Temporalis - Correct, it also elevates the mandible.\nC. Lateral pterygoid - Incorrect, it does not elevate the mandible.\nD. Medial pterygoid - Correct, it contributes to the elevation of the mandible.\n\nTherefore, the correct answers are A, B, and D. However, since the question seems to ask for the primary muscle that initiates the action, the masseter (A) is often considered the most powerful chewing muscle and thus plays a significant role in elevating the mandible."
