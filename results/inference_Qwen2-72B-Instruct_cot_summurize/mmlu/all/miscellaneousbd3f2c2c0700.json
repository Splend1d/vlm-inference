Plentiful discursive experience is what really teaches grammar, for it exercises judgment and provides language intake, whereas formal grammar study has been proved irrelevant. Politics more than pedagogy retards the changing of the curriculum to fit this truth. The author of the passage above argues that\n\nA. using language in a wide variety of situations improves grammar\nB. good judgment can be improved by studying the rules of formal grammar\nC. analyzing and diagramming provide exercise in logical thinking\nD. formal study of grammar improves writing ability\n"
