He contacted several companies and asked them to submit bids for the installation work. An alarm company decided to submit a bid and, in turn, requested bids from several wholesalers for the burglar alarms it planned to use if it was awarded the job. A supplier submitted a bid to the alarm company that the latter used in computing the bid that it was preparing for the builder. On September 1, the alarm company sent the builder its bid, in which it proposed to install the security systems for $100,000. On September 9, the supplier notified the alarm company that it would be unable to supply any burglar alarms to them. On September 11, the builder sent the following fax to the alarm company: \"I hereby accept your offer to install the security systems for $100,000. \"The alarm company had to pay another wholesaler $10,000 above the price quoted by the supplier for the burglar alarms. As a result, the alarm company advised the builder that the total price for the job would have to be increased to $10,000. The builder replied that he would hold the alarm company to the initially agreed price of $100,000. The alarm company installed the security systems, but the builder has not yet paid them anything. In an action by the alarm company against the builder for services rendered, the alarm company will probably be able to recover\n\nA. $100,000, because that was the contract price.\nB. $110,000 because of an unanticipated changeof circumstances after the parties had entered into their contract.\nC. only in quantum meruit, because of the doctrine of commercial frustration.\nD. only in quantum meruit, because by demanding $110,000 the alarm company repudiated its contract with the builder.\n"

The contract price was set at $100,000. While it is true that the alarm company experienced an increase in costs due to the supplier's failure to provide the burglar alarms at the originally quoted price, this does not automatically entitle the alarm company to pass those increased costs onto the builder.\n\nThe principle of freedom of contract generally holds that once a contract is formed, the parties must perform according to its terms, regardless of any subsequent changes in circumstances that may make performance more burdensome or expensive. Without a contractual provision allowing for price adjustments under certain conditions, the alarm company is likely bound by the original contract price.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that in some jurisdictions or under certain legal theories, the alarm company might argue for equitable relief or seek to modify the contract price based on principles like commercial impracticability or frustration of purpose if the increased cost was truly unforeseeable and extraordinary. But such arguments would typically require a significant showing that the circumstances were beyond what could reasonably have been anticipated by either party at the time of contracting. Given the information provided, it seems unlikely that these defenses would apply, as the risk of supplier non-performance is generally foreseeable in business transactions."
