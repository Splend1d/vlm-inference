This is because the binding energy per nucleon for lighter elements is generally lower than that for heavier elements around the iron peak (elements with atomic numbers around 56). Iron has one of the highest binding energies per nucleon, making it very stable. When it fissions, the resulting fragments will have lower total binding energy and thus a higher mass per nucleon. However, it's important to note that the total mass-energy of the system before and after the reaction remains constant due to the conservation of energy. The difference in binding energy appears as kinetic energy of the fragments and radiation released during the process."
