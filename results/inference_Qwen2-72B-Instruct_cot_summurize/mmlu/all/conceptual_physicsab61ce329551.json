This is an exponential decay process, and we can model it using the formula:\n\n\\[ Q(t) = Q_0 \\times (\\frac{1}{2})^{t/T} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\(Q(t)\\) is the charge at time \\(t\\),\n- \\(Q_0\\) is the initial charge,\n- \\(T\\) is the time constant (in this case, 1 second since the charge halves every second),\n- \\(t\\) is the time elapsed.\n\nGiven that after 5 seconds (\\(t = 5\\)) the charge is \\(q\\), we have:\n\n\\[ q = Q_0 \\times (\\frac{1}{2})^{5/1} \\]\n\nSolving for \\(Q_0\\), we get:\n\n\\[ Q_0 = q / (\\frac{1}{2})^5 = q / \\frac{1}{32} = 32q \\]\n\nTherefore, the initial charge was 32 times the charge after 5 seconds.\n\nThe correct answer is D. 32q."
