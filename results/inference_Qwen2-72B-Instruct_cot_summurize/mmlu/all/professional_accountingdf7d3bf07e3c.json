The bond pays an annual coupon of 8% of its face value ($100), which amounts to $8 per year.\n\nThe total amount received from the coupon payments over three years would be:\n\\[3 \\times \\$8 = \\$24\\]\n\nThe purchase price of the bond was $104.1, and it was sold for $82. Thus, the capital loss is:\n\\[\\$104.1 - \\$82 = \\$22.1\\]\n\nHowever, since you received $24 in coupon payments, your net gain from the investment is:\n\\[\\$24 - \\$22.1 = \\$1.9\\]\n\nTo find the holding period return, we divide the net gain by the initial investment and multiply by 100 to convert it into a percentage:\n\\[\\frac{\\$1.9}{\\$104.1} \\times 100 = 1.825167\\%\\]\n\nThus, the closest answer to the holding period return on this investment is D. 2%."
