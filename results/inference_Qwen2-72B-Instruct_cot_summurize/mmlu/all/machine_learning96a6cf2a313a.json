All the examples that have a non-zero weight \u03b1k in a SVM.\n\nIn the context of Support Vector Machines (SVMs), support vectors are the data points that lie closest to the decision boundary and have a direct impact on its position and orientation. These are the only data points that matter when determining the optimal decision boundary, as they define the margin. All other points do not affect the decision boundary and can be removed without changing the outcome. The weight \u03b1k is zero for all points that are not support vectors, so only support vectors have a non-zero weight in the SVM model."
