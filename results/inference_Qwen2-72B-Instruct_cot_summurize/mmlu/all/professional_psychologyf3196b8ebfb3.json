This can result in a delay or lack of response from any one person. In contrast, when there is only one bystander, they are more likely to feel personally responsible for taking action. However, it's important to note that the effectiveness of help can also depend on various other factors such as the competence, training, and confidence of the bystander(s) in handling emergencies."
