While the boy walked through the store, the cashier watched him on a hidden camera located behind the cashier's counter. Thereupon, the cashier saw the boy pick up two packs of baseball cards and place them in his coat pocket. The boy then walked to the rear of the store, where he picked up a package of cupcakes. The boy took the cupcakes to the front counter and paid the cashier for the cupcakes only. The boy started to walk out of the store when the cashier said, \"Hey, kid, I'm not charging you for the baseball cards because you paid for the cupcakes. But next time I'm not going to let you get away with it. \" The baseball cards sold for $5 per pack. The boy has committed which, if any, crimes?\n\nA. Larceny.\nB. Larceny by trick.\nC. False pretenses.\nD. No crime.\n"

In this case, the boy took two packs of baseball cards without paying for them, intending to keep them without the store's permission. Although the cashier did not charge the boy for the baseball cards this time, the act of taking them without paying constituted larceny. The other options (B, C) do not apply as there was no trick or false pretenses involved in this scenario."
