This is done to prevent excessive volatility or to achieve certain economic objectives, such as maintaining competitiveness for exports or controlling inflation. Unlike a pure floating exchange rate system where the currency value is determined solely by market forces, and unlike a fixed exchange rate system where the government must constantly intervene to maintain a specific exchange rate, a managed float allows for some degree of government intervention when deemed necessary."
