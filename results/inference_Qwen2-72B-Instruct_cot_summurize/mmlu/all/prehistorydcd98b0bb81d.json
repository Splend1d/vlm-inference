According to a recent study published in the journal Nature, the separation between native Siberians and the earliest Native Americans occurred sometime between 20,000 and 23,000 years ago. This study compared the genomes of modern people with ancient skeletal remains in North and South America and found that the genetic divergence between Native Americans and their Siberian ancestors occurred during the Last Glacial Maximum when the Bering land bridge was exposed. The study also found that there were at least two distinct migrations of people into the Americas, one by about 15,000 years ago and another by about 10,000 years ago. Option A is partially correct but not entirely accurate as it suggests that Native Americans in North and South America genetically diverged from each other, which is not supported by the study. Options B and C are incorrect as they suggest a single migration of Austral-Melanesians or Inuit into the Americas, which is not supported by the evidence."
