Injection attacks, particularly SQL injection, occur when an attacker can insert malicious code into a query, command, or request that is executed by a database. This typically happens when user input is directly included in a SQL query without proper validation or sanitization. This can allow attackers to manipulate the query to perform unintended actions, such as exposing sensitive data, modifying data, or executing unauthorized operations on the database.\n\nWhile other options (A, B, and C) might also be targets for various types of attacks, they are not specifically vulnerable to injection attacks in the same way that SQL queries based on user input are."
