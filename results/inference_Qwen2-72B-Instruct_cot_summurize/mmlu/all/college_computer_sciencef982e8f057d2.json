This is particularly important in multiprogrammed systems where resources are shared among multiple processes or users. Reentrant code maintains its integrity even when it is interrupted and resumed, making it safe for concurrent use by different users or processes. Neither being a macro nor being recursive directly implies that a program can be safely shared by several users; these properties are unrelated to reentrancy."
