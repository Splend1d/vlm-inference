The surgeon was assisted by an intern, who was assigned to the operation by the hospital, and a nurse, who was on the staff of the hospital. During the patient's convalescence, the patient complained of pain not explicable as an ordinary post-operative symptom. On investigation, it turned out that the intern and nurse, who had worked together in bandaging him, had done so in such a way as to constrict certain blood vessels. The faulty bandaging had caused acute pain and retarded the patient's recovery. After the patient's eventual recovery, he sued the intern, claiming $20,000 in damages. Before the case went to trial, the patient and intern agreed to a settlement in which the intern paid the patient $12,000, and the patient released the intern from all further claims for liability arising out of the incident. If the intern brings suit against the nurse for contribution, the most likely result is that the intern will\n\nA. prevail, because one who settles without judgment can recover contribution.\nB. prevail, because the nurse's liability is established under res ipsa loquitur\nC. not prevail, because one who settles without judgment cannot recover contribution.\nD. not prevail, because the intern's proper remedy is indemnification, not contribution.\n"

This is not universally true across all jurisdictions, but it is a common rule. In many places, a person who settles must obtain a finding of liability or fault against the other party(ies) to be able to seek contribution.\n\nIt's also worth noting that option D could potentially be correct depending on the specific laws of the jurisdiction regarding indemnification versus contribution. Indemnification typically applies when one party is entirely at fault and should bear the full responsibility for damages, while contribution is used when multiple parties share liability. However, since the question asks for the \"most likely result,\" and assuming the jurisdiction follows the general principle that settling without a judgment bars contribution, C would be the more accurate choice."
