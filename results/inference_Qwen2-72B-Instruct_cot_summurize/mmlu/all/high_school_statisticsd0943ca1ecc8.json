The goal is to reduce the unexplained variation in the data so that any differences observed between treatment groups (in this case, the new drug vs. the old drug) can be more confidently attributed to the treatments themselves.\n\nGiven that the pharmaceutical company anticipates no significant association between cholesterol levels and gender, blocking on gender would not serve to reduce unexplained variation in cholesterol levels. Therefore, options A and B are not appropriate.\n\nBlocking on the type of drug (option C) would not make sense in this context because the purpose of the experiment is to compare the effects of the two drugs; blocking on the factor being tested would defeat the purpose of the experiment.\n\nThe correct answer is D: Block on exercise level because it is associated with cholesterol level. By blocking on exercise level, the experiment will better control for the effect of exercise on cholesterol levels, allowing for a more accurate comparison of the cholesterol-lowering effects of the new drug versus the previous drug. This approach ensures that any differences in cholesterol levels observed between the two treatment groups can be more confidently attributed to the drugs rather than to differences in exercise levels among participants."
