CSR refers to a company's efforts to operate in an ethical and sustainable manner, taking into account the impact of its actions on society and the environment. Price-fixing, on the other hand, involves illegally coordinating prices with competitors, which is anticompetitive and violates fair trade laws. It goes against the principles of CSR, which promote fair practices, transparency, and ethical conduct."
