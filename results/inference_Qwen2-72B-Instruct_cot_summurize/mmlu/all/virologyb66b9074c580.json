However, based on his research and publications, particularly in the context of substance use disorders and HIV prevention, the closest match would be:\n\nC. Drug replacement therapy, community intervention, and needle exchange\n\nProfessor Shoptaw has conducted extensive research on the effectiveness of methadone maintenance therapy (a form of drug replacement therapy) for opioid addiction and its role in reducing HIV transmission. He has also studied community-based interventions and harm reduction strategies such as needle exchange programs.\n\nIt's important to note that Professor Shoptaw's work encompasses a broad range of interventions aimed at addressing substance use disorders and their related health consequences, including HIV/AIDS. His research often integrates behavioral, pharmacological, and structural approaches to achieve optimal outcomes."
