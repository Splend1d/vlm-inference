For example, if the two vectors are scalar multiples of each other (i.e., they are collinear), they are linearly dependent. Hence, any set of two vectors in R^2 can be linearly dependent or independent depending on the specific vectors.\n\nStatement 2 is true. By definition, if a set of vectors {v1, ..., vk} spans a vector space V and is linearly independent, then that set forms a basis for V. The number of vectors in a basis is equal to the dimension of the vector space. Therefore, if {v1, ..., vk} is a linearly independent set that spans V, then dim(V) = k.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. False, True."
