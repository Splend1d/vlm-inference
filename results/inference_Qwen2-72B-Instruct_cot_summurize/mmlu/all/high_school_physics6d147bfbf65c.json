The electric force, because the protons in the nuclei of the top atomic layer of the table repel the nuclei in the bottom atomic layer of the wood.\nB. The gravitational force, because by F = GMm/r^2, the force of the table on the wood at that close range is sufficient to balance the force of the Earth on the wood.\nC. The electric force, because the outer electrons in the top atomic layer of the table repel the outer electrons in the bottom atomic layer of the wood.\nD.

The electric force, because the outer electrons in the top atomic layer of the table repel the outer electrons in the bottom atomic layer of the wood.\n\nThis is due to the fact that atoms are mostly empty space with a small nucleus at the center and electrons orbiting around it. When two solid objects come into contact, their outer electrons come very close to each other and the repulsive electric force between them prevents them from occupying the same space. This is known as the Pauli exclusion principle, which states that no two electrons can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. Therefore, the table and the wooden block do not actually touch each other at the atomic level; instead, they are held apart by the repulsion between their outer electrons."
