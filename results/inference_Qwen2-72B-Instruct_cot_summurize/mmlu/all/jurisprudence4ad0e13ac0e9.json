It demonstrates the difference between the internal and the external aspect of a rule.\n\nHart's distinction between 'being obliged' (external aspect) and 'having an obligation' (internal aspect) is meant to highlight how legal rules are understood and followed within a society. The external aspect refers to the observable behavior of individuals who follow the rules, while the internal aspect involves the acceptance and recognition of those rules by the members of the society. This distinction is crucial for understanding the concept of a rule and the functioning of a legal system."
