Shareholders do have the right to inspect certain books and records of a corporation, but this right is not absolute and is typically subject to the requirement that the inspection must be for a \"proper purpose.\" This means that the shareholder must have a legitimate reason related to their interest as a shareholder for wanting to inspect the records. Options A, B, and D are incorrect because they either overstate the rights (A), impose an incorrect condition (B), or limit the rights to specific circumstances (D) that are not generally required under corporate law for a shareholder to inspect corporate books and records."
