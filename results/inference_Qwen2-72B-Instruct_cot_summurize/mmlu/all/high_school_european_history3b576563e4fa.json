Germany did not, according to the now prevailing opinion, differ from the great European nations to an extent that would justify speaking of a \"unique German path.\" And, in any case, no country on earth ever took what can be described as the \"normal path.\"\nHeinrich August Winkler, Germany: The Long Road West, Volume 1, 2006\nFrom this passage, one may infer that\n\nA. the notion of a unique German path in history has never been the prevailing public opinion in Germany\nB.

It also notes that today, the negative view is predominant, suggesting that opinions have shifted over time but the debate continues. There is no indication that the question has been definitively answered or that Winkler advocates a Marxist view of history. While option A is partially true, it does not fully capture the complexity of the issue as presented in the passage."
