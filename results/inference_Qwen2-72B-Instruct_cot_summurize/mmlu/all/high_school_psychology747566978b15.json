The retina\n\nThe retina is the part of the eye that contains photoreceptor cells (rods and cones) which convert light into electrical signals that can be interpreted by the brain as visual images. This process is known as transduction. The other options listed (the cornea, pupils, and cochlea) do not play a direct role in the transduction of visual images. The cornea helps to focus light onto the retina, the pupils control the amount of light entering the eye, and the cochlea is involved in hearing, not vision."
