Large-scale deforestation of the Amazon or Congo basin tropical forests\n\nDeforestation, especially in biodiversity hotspots like the Amazon and Congo basins, has a significant impact on biodiversity. These regions are home to a vast array of species, many of which are found nowhere else on Earth. When these forests are cleared for agriculture, logging, or other human activities, it leads to habitat loss, fragmentation, and degradation, which can result in a decline in species populations and even extinction. This, in turn, can affect ecosystem processes and reduce the overall resilience of the environment."
