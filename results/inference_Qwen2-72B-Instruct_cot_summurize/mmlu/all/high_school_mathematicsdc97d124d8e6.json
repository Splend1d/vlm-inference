To find out how long it takes her to read the entire book, we divide the total number of words by her reading speed:\n\n\\[ \\text{Time} = \\frac{\\text{Total Words}}{\\text{Reading Speed}} = \\frac{80,000 \\, \\text{words}}{250 \\, \\text{words/minute}} = 320 \\, \\text{minutes} \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. 320 minutes."
