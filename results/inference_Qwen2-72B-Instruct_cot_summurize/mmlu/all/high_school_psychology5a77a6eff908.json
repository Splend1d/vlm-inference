However, it's important to note that Type A behavior is a combination of several traits, including competitiveness, hostility, and a sense of time urgency, and all these traits can contribute to an increased risk of heart disease. But among them, research has shown that a sense of time urgency is the most critical factor. This trait is characterized by a constant feeling of being rushed and impatient, which can lead to chronic stress and ultimately increase the risk of heart disease."
