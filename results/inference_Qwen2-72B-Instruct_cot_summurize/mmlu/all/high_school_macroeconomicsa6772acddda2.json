M1 is a narrow measure of the money supply that includes the most liquid components, such as physical currency, demand deposits (checking accounts), and other highly liquid assets that can be quickly converted into cash. M2 is a broader measure of the money supply that includes all of the components of M1 plus less liquid assets such as savings deposits, small time deposits (such as certificates of deposit under $100,000), and retail money market funds.\n\nTherefore, the key difference between M1 and M2 is that M2 includes additional types of assets that are less liquid than those included in M1, including savings deposits."
