They decided on strychnine poisoning, which the friend told them how to get and they went and got it. When they asked the friend to go forward in poisoning the victim, he refused, saying, \"I'm was only here for planning and advice, but I never intended to commit murder.\" The man and his brother took the poison to a meeting with the neighbor, but he wouldn't drink. They were caught and arrested. The statute requires an overt act for criminal conspiracy. Which of the following most accurately states the criminal responsibility of each of the three men?\n\nA. The man and his brother have committed criminal conspiracy and attempted murder.\nB. The man and his brother are guilty of conspiracy but not attempted murder.\nC. The man and his brother are guilty of conspiracy and attempted murder, but the friend is guilty of nothing.\nD. The man and his brother are guilty of conspiracy and attempted murder, and the friend is guilty of criminal conspiracy.\n"

The man and his brother are guilty of conspiracy and attempted murder, and the friend is guilty of criminal conspiracy.\n\nExplanation: All three individuals discussed and agreed upon a plan to murder the neighbor, which constitutes a conspiracy. The overt act requirement for conspiracy is met when any party takes a substantial step towards completing the crime, such as acquiring the strychnine. The friend's involvement in planning and advising on how to obtain the poison makes him equally culpable for conspiracy, even if he did not intend to personally carry out the murder. The man and his brother attempted to carry out the murder by taking the poison to a meeting with the neighbor, which constitutes attempted murder."
