However, given the options you've provided, choice B (20 mph) seems most plausible for many vehicles under average conditions.\n\nIt's important to note that flipping a car doesn't necessarily require extremely high speeds, especially in situations involving loss of control or impacts with stationary objects like curbs. Lower-speed collisions can result in rollovers if the forces are applied in just the right (or wrong) way.\n\nChoice D (80 mpg) is likely a typo, as \"mpg\" stands for miles per gallon, which is a measure of fuel efficiency, not speed. Assuming it was meant to be mph, such a speed would certainly increase the likelihood of a rollover upon hitting a curb, but it's not necessarily the minimum speed required for a car to flip. \n\nIn real-world scenarios, it's possible for a car to roll over at even lower speeds under certain circumstances, but 20 mph could be a reasonable estimate for the conditions described. Always remember that driving safely and maintaining control of your vehicle are key to preventing accidents and potential rollovers."
