Separation of powers\n\nThe principle of separation of powers is designed to ensure that no single branch of government becomes too powerful by dividing governmental authority among the executive, legislative, and judicial branches. If the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) were to issue, enforce, and adjudicate all disputes regarding a new regulation, it would be exercising powers that are typically reserved for all three branches of government: the legislative power to make laws (in this case, regulations), the executive power to enforce them, and the judicial power to interpret and adjudicate disputes arising from their application. This concentration of power in one agency would potentially violate the principle of separation of powers."
