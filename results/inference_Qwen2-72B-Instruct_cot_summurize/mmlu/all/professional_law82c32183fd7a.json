Billy thought Jack was a weakling, but Jack had been working out with weights and knew karate. Ike Intervenor, a large 25-year-old who knew neither party, strolled around the corner of the block in time to see Jack strike Billy twice. Billy fell back and Jack stepped forward to strike him again. Ike thought Jack was the aggressor and to protect Billy, Ike threw Jack into the bushes, accidentally breaking Jack's arm. Jack brought suit against Ike for his damages. Ike's best defense is\n\nA. He thought Jack was the initial aggressor.\nB. Billy had a valid defense if Jack sued him.\nC. The force Ike used was not excessive.\nD. He had no intention of injuring Jack, only to stop his beating of Billy.\n"

This defense invokes the concept of \"reasonable force\" used in self-defense or defense of others. Ike can argue that he intervened to prevent what he perceived as an ongoing attack by Jack on Billy. Although he accidentally caused injury to Jack, he did so without the intent to harm but rather to protect another from what appeared to be an assault. This defense aligns with the principle of using necessary and proportional force to prevent harm to oneself or others.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the legality of Ike's actions could depend on various factors including jurisdictional laws, whether Ike reasonably believed that Billy was being assaulted, and whether the force he used was proportionate to the perceived threat."
