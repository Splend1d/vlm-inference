Increased use of fertilizers\n\nThe Green Revolution, which began in the 1960s, was characterized by the development and adoption of high-yielding varieties of cereal grains, expansion of irrigation infrastructure, improved agricultural management practices, and the use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides. This led to significant increases in global food production, particularly in developing countries. Therefore, option B is correct as it describes one of the primary effects of the Green Revolution. However, it's important to note that while increased use of fertilizers was a key component, there were also other significant changes such as those described in option A (increased varieties of each crop planted), but not in options C or D."
