Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn scenario 1, it is not morally wrong for the main character to throw punches at the other boxer during a fight, assuming that this is a regulated boxing match where such actions are part of the sport and are consensual.\n\nIn scenario 2, bringing a 13-year-old son to a show featuring exotic animals is also not necessarily morally wrong. It could be considered wrong if the treatment of the animals at the show was unethical or cruel, but based on the information given, there is no indication of this. Attending such a show could even be educational, depending on the context. However, it's important to note that opinions on this can vary greatly depending on the specifics of how the animals are treated and displayed."
