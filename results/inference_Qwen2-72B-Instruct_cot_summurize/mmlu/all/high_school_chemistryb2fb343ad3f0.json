The compound that is easiest to separate via distillation will have a significantly different boiling point from the others, ideally much lower so it can be vaporized and condensed without affecting the other components.\n\nA. KCl(aq): Potassium chloride does not have a boiling point because it decomposes before reaching a boiling state when dissolved in water.\nB. Fe(NO3)3(aq): Ferric nitrate also decomposes before boiling when dissolved in water.\nC. MgSO4 (aq): Magnesium sulfate similarly decomposes rather than boils when dissolved in water.\nD. N2H4(aq): Hydrazine, or N2H4, has a boiling point of around 113.5 \u00b0C, which is higher than water's boiling point but lower than the decomposition temperatures of the salts mentioned above.\n\nGiven the choices, **N2H4(aq)** (Option D) would be the easiest to separate via distillation because it has a defined boiling point that is lower than the decomposition temperatures of the salts, allowing it to be vaporized and condensed without decomposing the salts. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. N2H4(aq)"
