In Scenario 1, the main character is trying to support their wife's goal of losing weight by giving her a gift that aligns with that goal. While the gift might not be the most effective or appropriate way to support her, it does not constitute a morally wrong action. In Scenario 2, planning to meet up after a graduation is a benign and common social activity and does not involve any moral wrongdoing."
