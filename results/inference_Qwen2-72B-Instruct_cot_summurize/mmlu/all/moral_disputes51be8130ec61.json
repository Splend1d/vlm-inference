This is because respecting others as autonomous beings with their own goals and desires is essential to any moral framework, including one that values rights and desert. Therefore, the answer is C. However, it is also possible that Arthur believes that all three values (justice, fairness, and respect for other persons) are equally fundamental, in which case the answer would be D. Without additional context or information about Arthur's beliefs, it is impossible to know for certain."
