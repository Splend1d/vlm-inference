Leakage of effluent onto peristomal skin.\n\nSkin excoriation, especially in the context of ostomy care, is most commonly caused by leakage of effluent (stool or urine) from the stoma onto the surrounding skin. This can lead to irritation, redness, and breakdown of the skin due to the caustic nature of the effluent. A poorly fitting pouch or appliance can contribute to this problem by allowing effluent to escape and come into contact with the skin."
