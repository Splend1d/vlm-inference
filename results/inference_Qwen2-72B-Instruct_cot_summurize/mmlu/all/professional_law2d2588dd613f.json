The wife obtained a divorce from the husband after learnitg that he was engaging in an extramarital love affair with one of his co-workers. Following the divorce, the husband was arrested and charged with embezzling funds from his employer during a two- year period. In preparing for trial, the prosecuting attorney interviewed the wife, who stated that during their marriage, the husband admitted committing the embezzlement. This jurisdiction has adopted both the common-law marital and spousal privileges. At the husband's trial, the wife is called to testify regarding statements the husband made to her during the marriage regarding commission of the crime.

The marital communications privilege protects private communications between spouses made during the marriage, while the spousal testimonial privilege allows one spouse to refuse to testify against the other in most criminal cases.\n\nIn this case, the wife wishes to testify about statements the husband made to her during their marriage regarding his alleged crime. Under the marital communications privilege, these statements would typically be protected from disclosure in court without the consent of both parties. However, some jurisdictions make an exception to this rule when the communication relates to a crime committed by one spouse against the other or a third party. This exception does not appear to apply here since the crime was not against the wife herself.\n\nThe spousal testimonial privilege allows a spouse to refuse to testify against the other in a criminal proceeding. However, once the couple is divorced, this privilege generally no longer applies. Some jurisdictions may allow the former spouse to testify if the crime occurred during the marriage, even though the couple is now divorced. However, the question specifies that the jurisdiction has adopted both the common-law marital and spousal privileges, which suggests that the protections of these privileges remain intact post-divorce for the purposes of this scenario.\n\nGiven the information provided, the wife's testimony would likely be considered inadmissible under both the marital and spousal privileges unless there is an applicable exception that overrides these privileges. Since no such exception is mentioned, the correct answer is D. inadmissible, under either the marital or spousal privileges."
