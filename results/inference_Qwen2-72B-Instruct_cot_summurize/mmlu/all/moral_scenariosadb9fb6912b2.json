In Scenario 2, agreeing with your daughter when she expresses self-harmful thoughts about her appearance can be considered emotionally harmful and neglectful, which is against ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. As a parent, it would be expected to provide support, reassurance, and encouragement rather than agreement with such negative self-perceptions."
