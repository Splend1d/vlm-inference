According to the American Psychological Association's Ethical Principles of Psychologists and Code of Conduct, psychologists should make arrangements for payment or fee schedules at the outset of therapy and obtain the client's consent regarding the fee arrangements. If a client fails to pay, psychologists may take reasonable steps to collect payment, including the use of legal measures such as a collection agency, but only after attempting to resolve the issue with the client and informing them of the potential consequences of non-payment. Therefore, it is ethical to use a collection agency to collect unpaid fees, but only if the client was informed of this possibility at the beginning of therapy. Option C is also a good practice, but it is not required by ethical guidelines. Option D is not relevant to the question."
