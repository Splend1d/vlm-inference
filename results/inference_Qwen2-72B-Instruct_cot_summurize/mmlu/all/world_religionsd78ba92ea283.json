He was a Spanish mystic, poet, and Carmelite friar who wrote extensively about the process of purification through trials and suffering, which he saw as a means to experience God's love more deeply. This concept is central to his work \"The Dark Night of the Soul.\" However, it should be noted that this idea is not unique to him and can be found in various forms across different mystical traditions."
