Aluminum has a very negative standard reduction potential (-1.66 V), meaning it readily gives up electrons and acts as a reducing agent. Sodium has a less negative standard reduction potential (-2.71 V), so it would not be reduced by aluminum in this scenario. Thus, this reaction is unlikely to proceed spontaneously.\n\nB. Zinc has a standard reduction potential of -0.76 V, while silver has a positive standard reduction potential (+0.80 V). This means that zinc can act as a reducing agent to reduce silver ions to silver metal. This reaction is thermodynamically favorable and is likely to occur.\n\nC. Lead has a standard reduction potential of -0.13 V, and calcium has an even more negative standard reduction potential (-2.87 V). Lead cannot reduce calcium to its metallic state; instead, calcium could potentially oxidize lead, but that reaction is not shown here. Therefore, this reaction is unlikely to occur as written.\n\nD. Lead has a standard reduction potential of -0.13 V, and lithium has an extremely negative standard reduction potential (-3.04 V). Lithium will not be reduced by lead; instead, lithium could potentially oxidize lead, but again, that reaction is not what's depicted here. Thus, this reaction is also unlikely to occur as written.\n\nBased on these considerations, the most likely reaction to occur spontaneously is:\n\nB. Zn(s) + 2 Ag(NO3)2(aq) \u2192 2 Ag(s) + Zn(NO3)2(aq)\n\nThis is because zinc has a lower standard reduction potential than silver, allowing zinc to act as a reducing agent and silver to act as an oxidizing agent."
