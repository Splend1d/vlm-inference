To create an n-type semiconductor, you need to dope with an element that has more valence electrons than the semiconductor material, which for germanium would be elements from group V of the periodic table, such as Arsenic (As), Phosphorus (P), or Antimony (Sb). Boron, being from group III, would donate fewer electrons and create holes, making it a p-type dopant instead."
