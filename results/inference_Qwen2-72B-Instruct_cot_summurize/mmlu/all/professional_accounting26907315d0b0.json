Since Goll Co. does not have the ability to exercise significant influence over either Rose Co. or Jave Co., it should not use the equity method for either investment. Instead, Goll would likely account for these investments under the cost method or as available-for-sale securities, depending on the circumstances and the intent regarding the investments."
