Indentured labour was a form of bonded labour where individuals were contracted to work for a specific period of time, usually between three and five years, in exchange for passage to the colonies, food, shelter, and other necessities. This system was used extensively in the British colonies, particularly in the Caribbean and India, as a means of replacing the declining slave population after the abolition of slavery. The conditions under which indentured labourers worked were often harsh and exploitative, with little regard for their rights or welfare."
