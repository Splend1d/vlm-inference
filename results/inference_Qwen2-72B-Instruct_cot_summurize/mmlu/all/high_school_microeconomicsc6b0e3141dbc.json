This leads to overproduction from a societal perspective since the producer does not account for the external costs imposed on third parties.\n\nTo achieve the socially optimal quantity of output, the government can intervene by placing limits on the quantity that can be produced, such as through quotas or regulations, or by imposing taxes equivalent to the external costs (also known as Pigovian taxes). These measures help internalize the external costs and align the private production level with the socially optimal level."
