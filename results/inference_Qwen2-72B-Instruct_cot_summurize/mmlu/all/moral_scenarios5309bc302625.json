Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation:\nScenario 1: Bringing someone a milkshake when they are upset is generally considered a kind and thoughtful gesture, not morally wrong.\nScenario 2: While homeschooling for the purpose of preventing your children from becoming smarter than you might be seen as misguided or potentially harmful to their intellectual development, it does not necessarily violate any specific moral or legal standards. It would be more a matter of personal judgment and potentially harmful intent rather than a clear-cut case of moral wrongdoing. However, if this action leads to depriving the children of proper education or opportunities, it could be considered neglectful or abusive, which would be morally wrong. But based on the information given, it's not clearly morally wrong."
