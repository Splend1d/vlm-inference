It's particularly useful for jobs that require a high degree of skill and safety, where mistakes can be costly or dangerous.\n\nGiven this definition, an organizational psychologist would most likely recommend the use of vestibule training for:\n\nA. Airline pilot\n\nThis is because piloting an aircraft requires a high level of skill, precision, and safety. Pilots need to be trained on complex systems and procedures without risking lives or property during the learning phase. Vestibule training allows pilots to practice in a simulated cockpit, using realistic flight simulators, before they take to the skies in real aircraft. This ensures that they have mastered the necessary skills and can handle various scenarios safely before they operate an actual plane."
