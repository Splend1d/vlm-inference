Food allergies usually occur only after an individual has been sensitized by prior exposure. \n\nFood allergies are an immune system response to a specific food protein that the body mistakenly identifies as harmful. The first time a person is exposed to the allergen, their immune system may become sensitized to it. Upon subsequent exposure, the immune system releases chemicals such as histamine, which can cause symptoms ranging from mild (such as hives or itching) to severe (such as anaphylaxis, a life-threatening reaction). \n\nIt's worth noting that food allergies are not the same as food intolerances, which do not involve the immune system and are typically less severe. And while some food allergies can be managed by avoiding the allergen, there are no specified limits for how much of an allergen can be present in food before it becomes a problem for someone with a food allergy. Finally, food allergies can be very serious and should always be taken seriously by both individuals with allergies and those who prepare or serve food."
