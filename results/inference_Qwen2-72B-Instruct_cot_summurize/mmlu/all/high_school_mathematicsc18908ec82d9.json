This implies that the equation we get when setting $y_1 = y_2$ must have exactly one solution for $x$. Setting the two equations equal gives:\n\n\\[x^2 + 2x + 7 = 6x + b\\]\n\nRearranging this equation gives us:\n\n\\[x^2 - 4x + (7-b) = 0\\]\n\nFor this quadratic equation to have exactly one solution, its discriminant must be zero. The discriminant of a quadratic equation in the form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ is given by $\\Delta = b^2 - 4ac$. In our case, $a=1$, $b=-4$, and $c=(7-b)$, so:\n\n\\[\\Delta = (-4)^2 - 4(1)(7-b) = 0\\]\n\nSolving for $b$:\n\n\\[16 - 4(7-b) = 0\\]\n\\[16 - 28 + 4b = 0\\]\n\\[4b = 12\\]\n\\[b = 3\\]\n\nTherefore, the value of $b$ is **B. 3**."
