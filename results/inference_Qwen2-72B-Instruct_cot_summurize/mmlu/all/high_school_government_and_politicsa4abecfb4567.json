The Civil Rights Act of 1964 hastened school desegregation by cutting off federal funds to discriminatory school systems.\n\nWhile the Civil Rights Act of 1964 did not directly address school desegregation, Title VI of the act prohibited discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin in programs and activities receiving federal financial assistance. This provision was used as leverage to push for desegregation in public schools, especially in the South, where many schools were still segregated despite the Supreme Court's ruling in Brown v. Board of Education (1954). The threat of losing federal funds encouraged school districts to comply with desegregation orders."
