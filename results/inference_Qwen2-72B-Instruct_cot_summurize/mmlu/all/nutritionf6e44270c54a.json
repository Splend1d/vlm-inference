The content of vitamin D in foods depends on the soil in which the food was grown so is not related to wealth or age.\nC. Most vitamin D in the body does not come from food so access to food is not an important determinant of vitamin D status.\nD. Diets containing sufficient other nutrients to promote growth can increase the requirement of vitamin D so that it becomes limiting.\n"

This is the primary source of vitamin D for most people, rather than dietary intake. Therefore, factors such as limited sun exposure due to lifestyle, geographic location, season, time of day, skin pigmentation, sunscreen use, and clothing can significantly impact vitamin D levels, regardless of overall nutritional status."
