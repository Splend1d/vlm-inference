Supreme Court Justices are nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate. Historically, most Justices have been appointed by Presidents of the same political party, although this does not necessarily dictate how they will rule on cases once on the bench.\n\nB. is incorrect because most Supreme Court Justices do have prior judicial experience, often having served as judges on lower federal courts or state supreme courts.\n\nC. is incorrect because Supreme Court Justices do not switch party affiliation during their term. They are appointed based on their judicial philosophy and political leanings at the time of appointment, which typically remain consistent throughout their tenure.\n\nD. is incorrect because Supreme Court Justices serve lifetime appointments, subject to good behavior, meaning they can serve much longer than a decade. Many justices serve for several decades."
