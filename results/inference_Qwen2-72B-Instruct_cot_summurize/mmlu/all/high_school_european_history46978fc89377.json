Rudyard Kipling's poem reflects the imperialist and ethnocentric view prevalent during the late 19th century, where the British and other European powers believed it was their duty to civilize and Christianize those they deemed as \"half-devil and half-child.\" This attitude was used to justify colonial expansion and control over native populations."
