This means that TNCs will typically locate manufacturing facilities in countries where labor and production costs are lower, conduct accounting and research services where there is a skilled workforce and lower costs, and establish headquarters in countries that offer strategic advantages such as access to markets, financial stability, or legal protections. However, among the options given, \"based on comparative advantage\" most accurately reflects the general strategy of TNCs."
