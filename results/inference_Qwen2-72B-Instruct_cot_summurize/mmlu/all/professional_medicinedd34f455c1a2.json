Despite therapy, the tumor progressively increases in size, and he dies 6 months later. His tumor cells contain a point mutation in the p53 gene (TP53), leading to an inactive gene product. Based on this finding, the progressive tumor growth despite irradiation therapy is most likely to be related to a defect in cell cycle arrest in which of the following phases of the cell cycle?\n\nA. G0\nB. G1\nC. G2\nD. M\n"

When DNA damage occurs, such as that induced by radiation therapy, p53 is activated and can halt the cell cycle in the G1 phase to allow for DNA repair or trigger apoptosis if the damage is too severe. In the case of a point mutation in the TP53 gene leading to an inactive p53 protein, the cell cycle arrest mechanism at the G1 phase would be impaired, allowing cells with damaged DNA to continue through the cell cycle and potentially divide, contributing to tumor progression."
