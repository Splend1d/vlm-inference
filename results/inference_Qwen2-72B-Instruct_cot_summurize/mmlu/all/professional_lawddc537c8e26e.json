His neighbor wants to buy it so he can make his yard bigger and use the structure as a storage space, so he agrees to buy the bungalow in a written agreement. The sale is to be complete on October 14. On October 10, the neighbor realizes he cannot pay $10,000, and offers to pay $8,000 instead. The man agrees, and the exchange takes place on October 14. The man then sues for the remaining $2000. Would he likely prevail in getting the additional $2,000 that is part of the signed contract?\n\nA. No, the modification of the sales price was accepted and therefore both parties are bound to the $8000 price.\nB. Yes, there was a lack of additional consideration under the pre-existing duty rule so that the modification was invalid and the original price was still valid.\nC. No the original contract was a unilateral contract that could not be modified and had to be performed at the original price.\nD. No, there was full performance of the contract.\n"

No, the modification of the sales price was accepted and therefore both parties are bound to the $8000 price.\n\nIn this scenario, the original contract was modified by mutual agreement between the two parties. When the seller agreed to accept $8,000 instead of $10,000, he effectively waived his right to the higher amount. Since both parties agreed to the new terms and the buyer paid the $8,000 as agreed, the modification is valid and enforceable. The seller cannot later sue for the additional $2,000 based on the original contract because he consented to the change in price."
