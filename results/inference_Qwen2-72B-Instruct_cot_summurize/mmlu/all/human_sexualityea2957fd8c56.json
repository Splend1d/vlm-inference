This method is rarely used for abortion due to its high cost and significant risks, including heavy bleeding, infection, damage to internal organs, and anesthesia complications. It is typically only considered in later stages of pregnancy when other methods are not viable or when there are severe health risks to the mother. However, it should be noted that all abortion methods carry some level of risk, and the choice of method should be made in consultation with a healthcare provider based on individual circumstances and medical considerations."
