Characteristics acquired during an organism's life are generally not passed on through genes.\nB. Spontaneous mutations can result in the appearance of new traits.\nC. Only favorable adaptations have survival value.\nD. Disuse of an organ may lead to its eventual disappearance.\n"

Characteristics acquired during an organism's life are generally not passed on through genes.\n\nThis statement corrects the misconception by explaining that the giraffe's offspring did not inherit longer necks because their parent stretched its neck during its lifetime. This is a common misunderstanding related to Lamarckism, which proposed that organisms could pass on traits acquired during their lifetimes to their offspring. However, modern evolutionary theory, based on Darwinian principles and genetic understanding, shows that such acquired characteristics are not heritable. Traits are determined by genetic information, and any changes must occur at the genetic level to be passed on to the next generation."
