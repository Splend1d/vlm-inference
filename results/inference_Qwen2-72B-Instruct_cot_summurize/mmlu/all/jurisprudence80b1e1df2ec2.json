The focus is on the product itself and whether it was defective and unreasonably dangerous. Therefore, option B is incorrect.\n\nHowever, the plaintiff would need to prove that the product was defective and unreasonably dangerous, which could include proving that there were dead insects in the can. Additionally, the plaintiff would need to prove that the defect caused his injury or damages, and that he used the product in a reasonably foreseeable way.\n\nOption A is likely true, as Ajax would need to be a merchant selling Sipep for Bill to have purchased it from them. Option C may also be relevant if it can be shown that Ajax had prior notice of similar problems with Sipep products, as this could indicate that they should have taken steps to prevent such defects from occurring. Option D is unlikely to be true, as it is more likely that the insects entered the can during the manufacturing or distribution process rather than being intentionally placed there by Ajax. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer would be:\nA. Ajax is a merchant selling Sipep. \nC. Ajax had prior notice of other similar problems with Sipep products (if this can be proven)."
