If the marginal propensity to consume (MPC) is high, it means that households will spend a large portion of their additional income, which will further increase demand and lead to more production and income. This process can create a multiplied effect on real output. Conversely, if the MPC is low, households will save a larger portion of their additional income, leading to a smaller impact on aggregate demand and real output.\n\nThe velocity of money (options B and C) does not directly determine the short-run impact of a change in government spending on real output, although it can influence the overall economy's performance. The velocity of money is the frequency at which one unit of currency is used to purchase domestically-produced goods and services within a given time period. It can be influenced by factors such as the availability of credit, interest rates, and consumer confidence, but its direct relationship with the impact of government spending on real output is less straightforward than that of the MPC."
