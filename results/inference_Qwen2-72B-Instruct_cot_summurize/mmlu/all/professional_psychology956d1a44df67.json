The effectiveness of treatment can depend on a variety of factors, including the severity and duration of the addiction, the individual's personal circumstances and preferences, and the availability of resources and support. Additionally, many successful treatments do incorporate techniques developed by Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), such as peer support and group therapy, but this does not mean that all successful treatments rely solely on AA techniques."
