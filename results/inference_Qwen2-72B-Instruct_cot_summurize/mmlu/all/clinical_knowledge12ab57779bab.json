Primary hyperparathyroidism is usually asymptomatic\n\nCalcitonin actually lowers plasma calcium levels, vitamin D is not secreted by the parathyroid glands but is produced in the skin and activated in the liver and kidneys, and polyuria (not oliguria) can be a symptom of hypercalcaemia as the body tries to excrete excess calcium through urine. Primary hyperparathyroidism often presents with no symptoms, especially in its early stages."
