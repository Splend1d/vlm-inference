Images produced by concave lenses are always virtual, not real.\nB. This statement is false. Images produced by concave mirrors can be either real or virtual, depending on the position of the object relative to the mirror.\nC. This statement is true. Convex lenses can produce both real and virtual images, depending on the object's distance from the lens.\nD. This statement is false. Images produced by convex mirrors are always virtual."
