We are asked to find the sum of all integer solutions to the inequality $|n| < |n-3| < 9$. \n\nThe inequality $|n| < |n-3|$ means that the distance from $n$ to $0$ is less than the distance from $n$ to $3$. This implies that $n$ is closer to $0$ than to $3$, so $n$ must be less than $1.5$. \n\nHowever, we also have the inequality $|n-3| < 9$, which means that the distance from $n$ to $3$ is less than $9$. This implies that $n$ is within $9$ units of $3$, so $n$ must be in the interval $(3-9, 3+9) = (-6, 12)$.\n\nCombining these two conditions, we find that $n$ must be in the interval $(-6, 1.5)$. Since $n$ must be an integer, the possible values of $n$ are $-5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1$.\n\nThe sum of these integers is $-5 - 4 - 3 - 2 - 1 + 0 + 1 = \\boxed{-14}$.\n\nSo, the answer is $\\boxed{B}$."
