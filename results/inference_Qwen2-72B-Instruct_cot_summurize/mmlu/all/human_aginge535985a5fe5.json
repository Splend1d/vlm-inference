Education about older adults\n\nEducation about older adults can help improve attitudes toward aging and older adults by increasing understanding, dispelling myths, and promoting positive stereotypes. This can include learning about the diverse experiences of older adults, their contributions to society, and the challenges they may face as they age. Education can also help reduce ageism, which is the stereotyping and discrimination against individuals based on their age.\n\nWhile traveling to older communities (option C) and watching portrayals of older adults in movies and on TV (option D) might provide some exposure to older adults, these experiences can be superficial or potentially reinforce negative stereotypes if not approached with critical thinking and awareness. Staying away from older adults (option A) would likely have the opposite effect of worsening attitudes toward aging and older adults due to lack of direct contact and understanding."
