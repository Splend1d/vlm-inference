Hasty Generalization\n\nAnecdotal evidence often leads to hasty generalizations, which is a type of logical fallacy where a conclusion is made based on insufficient or biased evidence. Anecdotal evidence is personal stories or isolated examples that are not necessarily representative of the whole. It can be misleading when used to make broad conclusions without proper statistical analysis or consideration of other factors."
