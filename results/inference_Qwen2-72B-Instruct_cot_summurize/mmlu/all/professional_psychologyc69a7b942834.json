While all of the options listed could potentially be influenced during this initial stage, the most likely to be affected is:\n\nD. feelings of hopelessness\n\nThis is because one of the primary goals during the early sessions is to establish rapport, provide support, and begin to instill hope in the client that therapy can help them. This focus on hope and support is often more immediate than the development of coping skills, reduction in symptom severity, or deepening of insight, which typically occur later in the therapeutic process as the client becomes more engaged and the therapeutic relationship strengthens."
