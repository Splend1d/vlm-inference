However, since this answer is not provided in the options, the closest answer would be:\n\nB. they are not soluble in water\n\nSolubility in water is not directly related to our ability to taste or smell substances, but it can affect whether compounds can dissolve and interact with our taste buds or olfactory receptors. Sand (silica) is an inert substance that does not readily dissolve in water or saliva, and platinum is a noble metal that does not readily form volatile compounds that could be detected by our sense of smell. Therefore, option B is the most appropriate choice among the given options. However, it's important to note that the real reason we can't taste or smell these substances is not because they're not soluble in water, but rather because they don't produce detectable stimuli for our taste or olfactory senses."
