Conservative\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the movement started by Zacharias Frankel in 19th-century Germany was a precursor to what we now know as Conservative Judaism in North America. The term \"Conservative\" as applied to Judaism was not used until later. Frankel's approach emphasized historical development and change within Jewish law and tradition, which aligns with the principles of Conservative Judaism."
