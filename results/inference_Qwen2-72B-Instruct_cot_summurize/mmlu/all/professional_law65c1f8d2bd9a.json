They paced back and forth, walked around the store, and periodically looked in the window. The experienced officer feared that these individuals were most likely \"casing\" the place prior to robbing it. He approached, identified himself, and patted down the outer clothing of each. He found a hand gun in each man's pocket and arrested them for carrying concealed weapons. Will the court suppress the guns on the basis that there was no probable cause and the search was unconstitutional?\n\nA. Yes, because there was no probable cause to believe that a crime was being committed.\nB. No, because the officer had reasonable suspicion to believe that there might be criminal activity afoot.\nC. No, because the officer did have probable cause to believe that a crime was being attempted.\nD. Yes, because the officer is not allowed to take anything out of the men's pockets while conducting a pat-down.\n"

No, because the officer had reasonable suspicion to believe that there might be criminal activity afoot.\n\nIn this scenario, the police officer observed behavior that could indicate criminal intent, such as the men pacing back and forth, walking around the store, and looking into the window repeatedly. These actions could suggest that they were \"casing\" the store, which is often a precursor to committing a robbery. Based on these observations, the officer had reasonable suspicion to conduct a stop-and-frisk (Terry stop) to ensure his safety and investigate further. During the pat-down, he discovered the handguns, which provided probable cause for arrest. Therefore, the court is unlikely to suppress the guns as evidence because the officer's actions were justified under the circumstances."
