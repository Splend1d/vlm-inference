The supplier offered to do so at a price of $300 per motor (a total price of $90,000). The manufacturer's representative said, \"Deal.\" The next day the manufacturer's representative sent the supplier an unsigned note on company letterhead that stated, \"I am happy that you are going to supply us with the motors. I will call you soon to talk about another order.\" The manufacturer then sent catalogs to its regular customers advertising washing machines that included the specified motors. The manufacturer did not hear from the supplier until July 1, when the supplier called to say that it would be unable to supply the motors because it was no longer carrying that model. At that time, the manufacturer had received no orders for the machines with the specified motors. The manufacturer sued the supplier for breach of contract, and the supplier raised the statute of frauds as a defense. Is the supplier's statute of frauds defense likely to succeed?\n\nA. No, because the manufacturer distributed the catalogs in reliance on the contract, making the contract enforceable under the statute of frauds.\nB. No, because the supplier failed to object to the contents of the note sent by the manufacturer.\nC. Yes, because the manufacturer's note failed to contain a signature.\nD. Yes, because there is no writing that contains the quantity term of the contract.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is D. Yes, because there is no writing that contains the quantity term of the contract.\n\nUnder the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), which governs the sale of goods, a contract for the sale of goods priced at $500 or more must be in writing to be enforceable. This is known as the statute of frauds. The writing must include certain essential terms, including the quantity of goods being sold. In this case, while there was a verbal agreement between the manufacturer and the supplier, there was no written document that included the quantity term (300 motors) of the contract. Therefore, the supplier's statute of frauds defense is likely to succeed.\n\nOption A is incorrect because reliance on the contract does not automatically make it enforceable under the statute of frauds if the necessary requirements are not met. Option B is incorrect because the supplier's failure to object to the contents of the note does not satisfy the requirements of the statute of frauds. Option C is also incorrect because while the lack of a signature is a potential issue, the absence of the quantity term is the primary reason the statute of frauds defense is likely to succeed."
