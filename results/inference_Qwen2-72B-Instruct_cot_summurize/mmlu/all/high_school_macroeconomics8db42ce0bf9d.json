It gives a more accurate picture of purchasing power over time because it takes into account the erosion of value due to inflation. The formula for calculating the real interest rate is:\n\nReal Interest Rate = Nominal Interest Rate - Inflation Rate\n\nIn some cases, particularly in economic models and forecasts, the real interest rate might be calculated using anticipated (expected) inflation rather than actual inflation rates. This allows economists and investors to make predictions about future returns on investments or costs of borrowing based on expected changes in prices."
