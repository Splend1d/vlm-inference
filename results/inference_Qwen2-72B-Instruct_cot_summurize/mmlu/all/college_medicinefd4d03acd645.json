Crossing the street, the pedestrian notices that the young woman appears both much wealthier than he is and is of a different ethnicity. Seeing no one else present, the pedestrian renders aid. According to the bystander effect, which of the following would change how the pedestrian reacts?\n\nA. The person requiring aid appearing to be of a lower socioeconomic class rather than a higher one\nB. The presence of another group of people one block up the street\nC.

The bystander effect suggests that individuals are less likely to offer help when other people are present because they feel less personal responsibility for taking action. Therefore, option B, the presence of another group of people one block up the street, could potentially decrease the likelihood of the pedestrian rendering aid due to the diffusion of responsibility.\n\nOption D, the presence of one other person who is already approaching the girl, could also impact the pedestrian's reaction by either increasing the likelihood of assistance if the other person is actively helping (as it may encourage the pedestrian to join in) or decreasing it if the pedestrian assumes that the other person will take care of the situation.\n\nOptions A and C might influence the pedestrian's reaction based on personal biases or perceptions but are not directly related to the bystander effect. However, in the context of this question, the bystander effect is most closely associated with the presence or absence of other people who might also take action, making option B the most relevant answer to the question posed."
