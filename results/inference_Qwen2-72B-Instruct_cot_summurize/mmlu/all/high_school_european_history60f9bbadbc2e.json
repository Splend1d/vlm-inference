This song reflects the sentiments of the Luddites, who were groups of textile workers in the early 19th century that protested against the use of machinery in the textile industry, which they believed threatened their jobs and livelihoods. The lyrics express a strong sense of class identity and resistance against the perceived tyranny of industrialization and the elites who supported it. The reference to breaking \"shear frames\" indicates their opposition to the mechanization of the woolen industry, which had replaced skilled artisans with unskilled machine operators, leading to job losses and lower wages for traditional craftsmen."
