He consumes an 800-calorie meal consisting of protein, fat, and carbohydrates. He then sleeps through the night without additional food or drink. Twelve hours later, his serum glucose concentration remains within the reference range. Which of the following mechanisms is most likely involved in maintaining this man's serum glucose concentration?\n\nA. Continued gut absorption of calories from the ingested meal\nB. Glucose release from skeletal muscle\nC. Glycogenolysis in the liver\nD. Increased leptin release from adipose tissues\n"

Glycogenolysis in the liver.\n\nAfter a meal, glucose is absorbed from the gut into the bloodstream, and the liver stores some of this glucose as glycogen. During periods of fasting, such as overnight, the liver breaks down its stored glycogen (glycogenolysis) to release glucose back into the bloodstream to maintain blood glucose levels within the normal range. This process ensures that the body has a continuous supply of glucose for vital functions, especially for the brain, which relies heavily on glucose for energy."
