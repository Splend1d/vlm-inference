So, Statement I is true.\n\nII. **A and B have the same trace.**\n\nThe trace of a matrix is defined as the sum of its diagonal entries. Since trace is a linear operation and it commutes with matrix multiplication (i.e., \\(\\text{tr}(XY) = \\text{tr}(YX)\\)), we can see that:\n\\[\\text{tr}(B) = \\text{tr}(P^{-1}AP) = \\text{tr}(APP^{-1}) = \\text{tr}(A)\\]\n\nTherefore, A and B do indeed have the same trace. So, Statement II is true.\n\nIII. **\\(A^{-1}\\) and \\(B^{-1}\\) are similar matrices.**\n\nGiven \\(B = P^{-1}AP\\), we want to show that \\(B^{-1} = P^{-1}A^{-1}P\\). We can do this by taking the inverse of both sides of the original similarity equation:\n\\[B^{-1} = (P^{-1}AP)^{-1} = P^{-1}A^{-1}(P^{-1})^{-1} = P^{-1}A^{-1}P\\]\n\nThis shows that \\(A^{-1}\\) and \\(B^{-1}\\) are similar matrices. So, Statement III is true.\n\nSince all three statements are true, the correct answer is:\n\n**D. I, II, and III**"
