As a nurse employed by the hospital was pushing the wheelchair through a set of automatic doors at a normal pace, the doors closed on the patient's foot, injuring it. The nurse attempted to pull the wheelchair back through the doors. This action caused the doors to close more tightly on the patient's foot, injuring it further. The patient sued the hospital, alleging improper maintenance of the doors. The patient has produced no evidence of specific conduct or neglect on the part of the hospital that would have caused the automatic doors to malfunction. The hospital has moved for summary judgment. Should the court grant the hospital's motion?\n\nA. No, because a jury could find that there was a latent defect in the doors.\nB. No, because a jury could find the hospital liable for negligence based on res ipsa loquitur.\nC. Yes, because proof of an accident, by itself, does not establish that an injured person was a victim of negligence.\nD. Yes, because the nurse's action was a superseding cause of the injury. \u0080\u0083\n"

No, because a jury could find the hospital liable for negligence based on res ipsa loquitur.\n\nRes ipsa loquitur is a legal doctrine that allows a plaintiff to infer negligence from the very nature of an accident or injury in the absence of direct evidence on how any defendant behaved. In this case, the patient can argue that the hospital had control over the automatic doors and that the doors' malfunctioning resulted in his injury. Since the injury occurred under circumstances that typically do not happen without negligence, the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur may apply, and the court should not grant the hospital's motion for summary judgment. However, it's important to note that the applicability of res ipsa loquitur depends on the jurisdiction and the specific facts of the case."
