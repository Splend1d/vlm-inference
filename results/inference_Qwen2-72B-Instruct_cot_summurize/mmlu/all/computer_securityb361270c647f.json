Yes, if the PRG is really \u201csecure\u201d\n\nA stream cipher can theoretically achieve perfect secrecy if it uses a truly random and secret key that is as long as the message (a one-time pad) and if the key is never reused. However, in practice, achieving perfect secrecy with a stream cipher requires a secure pseudorandom number generator (PRG) that produces output indistinguishable from true randomness to an attacker. If the PRG is secure and the key is properly managed, then the stream cipher can provide strong security properties that approximate perfect secrecy under practical constraints."
