The order of an element \\( g \\) in a group \\( G \\), denoted \\( o(g) \\), is the smallest positive integer \\( n \\) such that \\( g^n = e \\), where \\( e \\) is the identity element of the group.\n\nIn \\( \\mathbb{Z}_{30} \\), the operation is addition modulo 30, and the identity element is 0. So we're looking for the smallest positive integer \\( n \\) such that \\( 25n \\equiv 0 \\mod 30 \\).\n\nLet's solve for \\( n \\):\n\n\\[\n25n \\equiv 0 \\mod 30 \\\\\n\\]\n\nThis means:\n\n\\[\n25n = 30k \\quad \\text{for some integer } k.\n\\]\n\nSince 25 and 30 share a common factor of 5, we can divide both sides of the equation by 5:\n\n\\[\n5n = 6k.\n\\]\n\nFor \\( n \\) to be minimal, \\( 5n \\) must be the smallest multiple of 6 that is also a multiple of 5. The least common multiple (LCM) of 5 and 6 is 30, so we set \\( 5n = 30 \\). Solving for \\( n \\) gives:\n\n\\[\n5n = 30 \\\\\nn = 6.\n\\]\n\nThus, the order of 25 in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_{30} \\) is 6, which means the cyclic subgroup generated by 25 has 6 elements.\n\nThe correct answer is C. 6."
