The kernel width**.\n\nThe kernel width (also known as the bandwidth or smoothing parameter) controls the size of the neighborhood around each data point that contributes to the prediction at a given point. A small kernel width means that only very nearby points contribute significantly to the prediction, potentially leading to high variance (overfitting) as the model may be too sensitive to local fluctuations in the data. Conversely, a large kernel width means that more distant points also contribute to the prediction, potentially leading to high bias (underfitting) as the model may not capture local patterns well enough.\n\nThe choice of kernel function (A), metric (B), and the maximum height of the kernel function (D) can influence how predictions are made and the computational efficiency of the method, but they do not have as direct an impact on the underfitting-overfitting trade-off as the kernel width does. The kernel function and metric affect the shape of the influence region and the distance calculations, respectively, while the maximum height of the kernel function is typically normalized and does not affect the relative contributions of different data points to the prediction."
