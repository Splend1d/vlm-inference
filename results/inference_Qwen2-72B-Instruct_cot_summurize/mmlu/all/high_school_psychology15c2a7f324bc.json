However, since you have to pick only one answer, the closest would be:\n\nB. Crystallized intelligence\n\nCrystallized intelligence refers to the knowledge that comes from past experiences and learning, such as vocabulary, facts, and knowledge about the world. Jeopardy! tests this type of intelligence by requiring contestants to recall specific pieces of information across various categories.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that Jeopardy! also tests fluid intelligence, which is the ability to solve new problems, use logic in new situations, and identify patterns. This aspect is evident when contestants must quickly understand clues and apply reasoning to come up with correct responses. So while crystallized intelligence is more dominant, both types of intelligence are indeed demonstrated on the show."
