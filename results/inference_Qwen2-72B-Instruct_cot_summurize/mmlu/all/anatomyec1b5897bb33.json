Damage to the cervical sympathetic chain can result in a condition known as Horner's syndrome. This syndrome includes features such as pupillary constriction (miosis), ptosis (drooping of the eyelid), and anhidrosis (absence of sweating) on the affected side. However, in the context of your question, the most likely signs and symptoms due to damage to the cervical sympathetic chain would be pupillary constriction and vasodilation of facial vessels. Increased facial sweating is not typically associated with Horner's syndrome, and decreased lacrimation (tear production) may occur but is not directly related to the options provided."
