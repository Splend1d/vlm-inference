Wrong, Wrong\n\nExplanation: In both scenarios, the main character is doing something that is considered morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. In Scenario 1, encouraging infidelity is generally viewed as morally wrong because it involves deceit and betrayal in a marriage or committed relationship. In Scenario 2, not cleaning up after one's dog while walking it is also considered morally wrong because it shows disregard for public health and cleanliness, which can lead to unpleasant conditions and potential health hazards for others in the community."
