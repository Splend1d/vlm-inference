A corporation who provides cable television services successfully persuaded the state legislature to grant it an exclusive right to install cable television lines in all multiple family dwellings in the state, in exchange for the corporation's promise to freeze cable television rates for the next four years. An owner of several large multifamily apartment buildings in the state brought an action in federal district court challenging the constitutionality of the state legislation. The suit claimed that the space used by the corporation when it subsequently installed cable television lines in one of his apartment buildings amounted to a taking without compensation. In this action, the owner will be awarded\n\nA. no relief, because easements for utility lines are presumed to be beneficial to the servient estate.\nB. no relief, because the legislation is merely a regulation of the use of property and not a taking.\nC. no relief, because the corporation is not a government entity.\nD. damages for the value of property used by the corporation.\n"

This is a regulatory action rather than a physical appropriation or invasion of property, which would be necessary for a claim of \"taking\" under the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.\n\nThe owner of the apartment buildings argues that the space used by the corporation amounts to a taking without compensation. However, courts generally hold that regulations that do not involve a physical invasion or direct appropriation of property, but instead regulate its use, do not constitute takings unless they go so far as to deprive the owner of all economically viable use of the property. This is known as a regulatory taking.\n\nSince the legislation does not appear to deprive the owner of all economically viable use of the property, it is more likely to be considered a valid exercise of the state's police power to regulate the use of property for the public welfare, particularly given the benefit to consumers from frozen cable television rates. Therefore, the owner is unlikely to be awarded relief on the basis of a taking claim."
