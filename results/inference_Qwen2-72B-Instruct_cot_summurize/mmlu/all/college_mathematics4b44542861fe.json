When \\(V\\) has a basis consisting entirely of eigenvectors of \\(T\\), it means that \\(T\\) is diagonalizable. In this case, any matrix \\(X\\) that commutes with \\(T\\) (i.e., \\(TX = XT\\)) must also be diagonal in the eigenbasis of \\(T\\). Since every diagonal matrix in the eigenbasis of \\(T\\) will commute with \\(T\\), and since the space of all such diagonal matrices is \\(n^2\\)-dimensional (as there are \\(n\\) diagonal entries, each potentially taking on any real value), we have that \\(U = M(V)\\).\n\n**II. dim(U) + dim(W) = n^2**\n\nThis statement is true as well. The space \\(M(V)\\) has dimension \\(n^2\\) because it consists of all \\(n \\times n\\) matrices over the real numbers, and each entry can vary independently. The spaces \\(U\\) and \\(W\\) form a direct sum decomposition of \\(M(V)\\). This means that every matrix \\(X\\) in \\(M(V)\\) can be uniquely written as \\(X = A + B\\) where \\(A\\) is in \\(U\\) and \\(B\\) is in \\(W\\). The dimensions of \\(U\\) and \\(W\\) add up to the dimension of \\(M(V)\\), which is \\(n^2\\).\n\n**III. dim(U) < n**\n\nThis statement is not necessarily true. As shown in statement I, if \\(T\\) is diagonalizable, then \\(dim(U) = n^2\\), which is greater than or equal to \\(n\\), not less than \\(n\\).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **D. I and II only**."
