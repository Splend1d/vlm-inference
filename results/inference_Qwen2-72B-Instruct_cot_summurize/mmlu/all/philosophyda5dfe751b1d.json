A virtuous man, according to Stoicism, should accept what happens with equanimity, understanding that it is part of the natural order of things. This does not mean that one should not feel any emotion, but rather that one should not be overwhelmed or disturbed by these emotions to the point where they disrupt one's rationality and virtue."
