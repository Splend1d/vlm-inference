After several hours, both the friend and the defendant passed out. In the middle of the night, the defendant awoke with a headache. He went down to the kitchen and poured himself another shot of whiskey. The defendant also felt hungry and decided to make himself some eggs. After fixing his snack, he inadvertently forgot to turn off the stove. A gas leak occurred, causing a fire that burned down the house. If the defendant is charged with arson, he will be found\n\nA. guilty, because the defendant was reckless.\nB. guilty, because the defendant was criminally negligent.\nC. not guilty, because the defendant did not commit a felony.\nD. not guilty, because arson requires the presence of malice.\n"

However, it can also involve reckless or negligent behavior leading to a fire. In this scenario, the defendant's actions\u2014specifically, forgetting to turn off the stove while under the influence of alcohol\u2014could be seen as a gross deviation from the standard of care that a reasonable person would exercise in similar circumstances. This could constitute criminal negligence if it is determined that the defendant's actions were a substantial factor in causing the fire and resulting damage.\n\nIt's important to note that the specifics of the law can vary by jurisdiction, and the exact charges and outcomes would depend on the interpretation of the laws in the specific location where the incident occurred. Additionally, defenses such as intoxication might be considered, but voluntary intoxication is generally not a defense to criminal negligence."
