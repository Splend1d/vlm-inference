Dividend carryovers from years in which dividends were not paid.\n\nCumulative preferred stock entitles the holder to accumulated dividends in the event that the company did not pay them in previous years. This means that if the company skips or does not have enough profits to pay dividends in a given year, it must pay the owed dividends on the cumulative preferred stock before paying any dividends on common stock or non-cumulative preferred stock in future profitable years. \n\nIt's important to note that while cumulative preferred stock typically comes with voting rights in certain circumstances (such as when dividends are in arrears), the right to vote is not always guaranteed and can vary based on the specific terms of the stock issuance. Similarly, conversion rights and guaranteed dividends are not standard features of cumulative preferred stock and would depend on the specific terms agreed upon at the time of issuance."
