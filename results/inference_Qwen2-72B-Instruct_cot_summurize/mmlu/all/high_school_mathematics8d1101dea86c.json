                    "text": " Let's denote the number of ants of Species A on Day 0 as $a$ and the number of ants of Species B on Day 0 as $b$. We know that $a + b = 30$.\n\nOn Day 1, the number of ants of Species A becomes $2a$, and the number of ants of Species B becomes $3b$. So the total number of ants on Day 1 is $2a + 3b$.\n\nOn Day 2, the number of ants of Species A becomes $2 \\cdot 2a = 4a$, and the number of ants of Species B becomes $3 \\cdot 3b = 9b$. So the total number of ants on Day 2 is $4a + 9b$.\n\nContinuing this pattern, on Day 5, the number of ants of Species A becomes $2^5a = 32a$, and the number of ants of Species B becomes $3^5b = 243b$. So the total number of ants on Day 5 is $32a + 243b$.\n\nWe are given that the total number of ants on Day 5 is 3281, so we have the equation $32a + 243b = 3281$.\n\nNow we have a system of two equations:\n\\begin{align*}\na + b &= 30, \\\\\n32a + 243b &= 3281.\n\\end{align*}\n\nWe can solve the first equation for $a$: $a = 30 - b$.\n\nSubstituting $a = 30 - b$ into the second equation gives\n\\[32(30 - b) + 243b = 3281,\\]\nwhich simplifies to\n\\[960 - 32b + 243b = 3281,\\]\nor\n\\[211b = 2321.\\]\n\nDividing both sides by 211 gives $b = 11$.\n\nSubstituting $b = 11$ into the equation $a + b = 30$ gives $a + 11 = 30$, so $a = 19$.\n\nOn Day 5, the number of ants of Species A is $32a = 32 \\cdot 19 = 608$.\nThe answer is: D. 608."
