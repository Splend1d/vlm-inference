If I have commanded that the tribute offerings sent by you, O King, are to be accepted, this was solely in consideration for the spirit which prompted you to dispatch them from afar. . . . As your Ambassador can see for himself, we possess all things. I set no value on objects strange or ingenious, and have no use for your country's manufactures. It behooves you, O King, to display even greater devotion and loyalty in future, so that, by perpetual submission to our Throne, you may secure peace and prosperity.\nAccording to the passage, what was the Chinese reaction to the British goods?\n\nA. Awe at their technological superiority\nB. Fascination with their strangeness\nC. Offense at a perceived bribe\nD. Interpreting them as an act of submission\n"

Interpreting them as an act of submission\n\nThe passage indicates that the Chinese emperor saw the British goods as \"tribute offerings\" and \"strange and costly objects\" that he had no interest in. He accepted them only as a gesture of goodwill towards the spirit in which they were given, emphasizing China's self-sufficiency and the expectation of continued \"devotion and loyalty\" and \"perpetual submission\" from the British king. This suggests that the emperor interpreted the goods as a sign of the British king's submission to the Chinese throne rather than being impressed by their quality or novelty."
