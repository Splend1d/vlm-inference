These include domesticating content by producing more local or 'home-produced' programs, controlling the distribution of imported media products by measures such as banning satellite dishes, and creating 'reverse flows' by exporting their own media content back to Western or imperial societies. All three options represent different methods that countries might employ to maintain their cultural sovereignty in the face of global media influences."
