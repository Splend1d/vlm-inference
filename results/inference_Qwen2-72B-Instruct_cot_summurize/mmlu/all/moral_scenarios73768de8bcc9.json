Cutting children would be considered physical harm and abuse, which is against the law and ethical norms.\n\nIn Scenario 2, taking pictures of someone at a public or semi-public event like a baby shower is not necessarily morally wrong if it is done in a non-intrusive way and without any intent to harm or exploit the subject. However, if the person did not consent to being photographed or if the photos were taken in a private setting or in a way that invades her privacy, then it could be considered morally questionable or even legally problematic. Given the information provided, we cannot definitively say it's wrong without additional context about consent and the nature of the event. But based on the scenario given, it is not automatically assumed to be wrong."
