Selling real estate at a price that differs significantly from its appraised value.\n\nThis event is more likely to indicate the existence of related party transactions because it involves a transaction where the price does not reflect fair market value, which could suggest that the parties involved have a relationship that influenced the terms of the transaction. The other options may involve related parties but do not necessarily indicate that the transactions were not conducted at arm's length. For instance, insuring the lives of key executives (A) and granting stock options to them (D) can be standard business practices. Making a loan with specific scheduled terms for repayment (C) could also be a routine financial activity unless there are unusual terms that favor one party over another."
