White Southerners\n\nHistorically, white Southerners were a traditional Democratic Party group, but over time, this group has shifted significantly to the right and is now more likely to support Republican candidates. The region's political realignment began in the mid-20th century as the Democratic Party increasingly embraced civil rights legislation. This shift alienated many conservative white voters in the South who disagreed with these liberal policies, leading them to move toward the Republican Party. As a result, white Southerners among these options are the group that has the least liberal constituency today."
