White-collar crime often goes undetected in the context of everyday business transactions because it typically involves complex financial schemes, such as embezzlement, fraud, or insider trading, that can be hidden within legitimate business activities. These crimes may not be immediately apparent and can take time to uncover, especially if they involve sophisticated methods of concealment. Additionally, white-collar criminals often hold positions of power or trust within their organizations, which can make it easier for them to commit and cover up their crimes."
