However, it could be potentially problematic if the person's actions lead to pollution or harm to the ecosystem, but that would depend on specific circumstances not provided in the scenario.\n\nScenario 2: The actions described could be considered morally wrong if they were non-consensual. However, the scenario specifies that the actions were consensual, which changes the moral evaluation. In the context of consensual activities such as BDSM, where all parties agree to the terms and have established safe words or other safety measures, the actions might not be considered morally wrong by ordinary standards, as long as they are conducted within legal and ethical boundaries. It's important to note that any form of physical activity should be conducted with informed consent and respect for all parties involved."
