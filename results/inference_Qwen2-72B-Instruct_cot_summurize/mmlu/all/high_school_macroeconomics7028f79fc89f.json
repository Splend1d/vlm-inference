A lower discount rate.\n\nThe Federal Reserve can increase the money supply by lowering the discount rate, which is the interest rate that the Fed charges on loans to commercial banks. A lower discount rate makes it cheaper for banks to borrow money from the Fed, encouraging them to do so and thereby increasing the amount of money available for lending. This process ultimately leads to an expansion of the money supply in the economy.\n\nB. Selling Treasury securities to commercial banks would actually decrease the money supply, as it removes reserves from the banking system.\n\nC. A higher reserve ratio would require banks to hold more funds in reserve, reducing their ability to lend and thus decreasing the money supply.\n\nD. A lower personal income tax rate is not a monetary policy tool used by the Fed; it is a fiscal policy tool used by the government. It could potentially lead to increased consumer spending, but it does not directly affect the money supply like monetary policy tools do."
