For every year the car gets older, the selling price drops by approximately $983.\n\nThis is because the coefficient for age (-0.983) indicates the change in the selling price (in thousands of dollars) for each additional year of age. Therefore, for every year the car ages, the selling price decreases by about $983 (since the equation is in terms of $1,000 units, you would multiply 0.983 by 1,000 to get the actual dollar amount).\n\nOption A is incorrect because it suggests a percentage decrease, which is not indicated by the equation. Option B is incorrect because it incorrectly interprets the intercept as the price of a new car; the intercept represents the estimated selling price when age is zero, but this does not necessarily equate to the original price of a new car. Option C is incorrect because it overstates the drop in price by an order of magnitude."
