On March 25, as the landscaper was almost finished with the work on the front yard, the homeowner said to the landscaper, \"I'm very pleased with your work to date. If you are willing, I would like you to landscape my backyard, on the same terms and conditions as our existing contract, the work to be completed by May 1. If you can meet that deadline, I'll pay you $10,000 at that time. \" The landscaper replied, \"Agreed. Let's shake hands on it. \" They shook hands. What is the probable legal effect of the landscaper's promise on March 25 to landscape the backyard?\n\nA. The landscaper's promise created an enforceable unilateral contract.\nB. The landscaper's promise created an enforceable bilateral contract.\nC. The landscaper's promise was voidable, since it was not in writing.\nD. The landscaper's promise was illusory, thereby creating an unenforceable contract.\n"

In this case, the homeowner promised to pay the landscaper $10,000 upon completion of the work by May 1, and the landscaper promised to complete the landscaping of the backyard by that date. Both parties made promises, and there was mutual assent (as evidenced by their handshake), consideration (the $10,000 payment), and an offer and acceptance. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. The landscaper's promise created an enforceable bilateral contract. \n\nNote: While a written contract is often required for certain types of contracts under the Statute of Frauds (such as real estate transactions or agreements that cannot be performed within one year), the absence of a written agreement does not automatically make a contract voidable or unenforceable. Oral contracts can be enforceable if they meet the other requirements for a valid contract. However, proving the terms of an oral contract can be more difficult than with a written one."
