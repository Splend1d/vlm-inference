This pattern of evolution is thought to be driven by various factors, such as environmental changes, genetic drift, and natural selection. The concept was proposed by paleontologists Niles Eldredge and Stephen Jay Gould in 1972 as an alternative to the gradualist model of evolution, which posits that evolution occurs at a slow and steady pace over millions of years."
