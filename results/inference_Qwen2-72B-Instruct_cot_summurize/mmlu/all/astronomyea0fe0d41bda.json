                    "text": "The correct answer is D. The solar wind electromagnetically \"blows\" the ions directly away from the Sun.\n\nComets have two types of tails: the dust tail and the ion (or plasma) tail. The ion tail is composed of gas that has been ionized by the Sun's radiation. These ions become charged particles that interact with the solar wind, which is a stream of charged particles emanating from the Sun. The solar wind exerts an electromagnetic force on the ions, pushing them away from the Sun in a straight line, regardless of the comet's trajectory. This is why the ion tail always points directly away from the Sun."
