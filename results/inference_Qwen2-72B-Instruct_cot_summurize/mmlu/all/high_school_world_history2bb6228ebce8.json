They have a great carrack which goes there every year and she brings from there every year about six hundred coins: and all this silver of Japan, and two hundred thousand coins more in silver which they bring yearly out of India, they employ to their great advantage in China: and they bring from there gold, musk, silk, copper, porcelains, and many other things very costly and gilded.\nWhen the Portuguese come to Canton in China to traffic, they must remain there but certain days: and when they come in at the gate of the city, they must enter their names in a book, and when they go out at night they must put out their names. They may not lie in the town all night, but must lie in their boats outside of the town. And, their time expired, if any man remains there, he is imprisoned.\"\nRalph Fitch, an account of his travels to the Far East, 1599 C.E.\nWhich of the following developments from the period 1450\u20131750 C.E. most directly undid the trade patterns mentioned in the first paragraph?\n\nA. The eastward expansion of Russia\nB. The Portuguese conquest of India\nC. The establishment of the Tokugawa Shogunate\nD. The Spanish conquest of Mexico\n"

                    "text": "The development that most directly undid the trade patterns mentioned in the passage is:\n\nC. The establishment of the Tokugawa Shogunate\n\nThe establishment of the Tokugawa Shogunate in Japan (1603-1868) led to a period of isolationism known as sakoku, during which Japan largely closed its borders to foreign influence and trade. This policy restricted the activities of European traders, including the Portuguese, who had been engaging in trade with Japan. As a result, the lucrative trade between the Portuguese and Japan, particularly in silver, was significantly curtailed.\n\nWhile the other options also represent significant historical events, they do not directly impact the specific trade patterns described in the passage. The eastward expansion of Russia did not affect trade between Portugal, China, and Japan. The Portuguese conquest of India actually facilitated the trade patterns mentioned by giving the Portuguese a foothold in the Indian Ocean trade network. The Spanish conquest of Mexico, while leading to the influx of New World silver into Europe and Asia, did not specifically undo the trade patterns between the Portuguese, China, and Japan."
