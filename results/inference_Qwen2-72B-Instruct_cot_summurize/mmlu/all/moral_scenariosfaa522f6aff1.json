It violates principles of impartiality and justice in education.\n\nScenario 2: Throwing knives at another person, even during a boxing match, is not only morally wrong but also illegal and dangerous. Boxing matches have strict rules for safety, and using weapons is not part of those rules. This action could result in serious harm or death."
