                    "text": "The change of cross-sectional area of a conductor in a magnetic field will affect:\n\nB. Resistance of conductor.\n\nWhen the cross-sectional area of a conductor changes, its resistance changes as well. This is because resistance is inversely proportional to the cross-sectional area of the conductor according to the formula R = \u03c1(L/A), where R is the resistance, \u03c1 is the resistivity of the material, L is the length of the conductor, and A is the cross-sectional area.\n\nHowever, the question also mentions the conductor being in a magnetic field. The presence of a magnetic field does not directly affect the resistance or reluctance of the conductor due to a change in cross-sectional area. The magnetic field may induce an electromotive force (EMF) if the conductor moves relative to the field or if the field changes, but this is not related to the change in cross-sectional area affecting the reluctance or resistance.\n\nA. Reluctance of conductor is not affected by the cross-sectional area of the conductor in the same way that resistance is. Reluctance is a property related to the opposition offered by a magnetic circuit to the establishment of a magnetic field within it. It depends on the geometry of the magnetic circuit, including the length and cross-sectional area, but it is primarily a function of the permeability of the materials involved and their configuration rather than just the cross-sectional area of a conductor.\n\nThus, the correct answer is B. Resistance of conductor. However, it's important to note that the context of the question might have been aiming for a more specific answer involving both electrical and magnetic properties, which could lead one to consider (C) as a potential answer. But based on the definitions and how these properties are typically discussed, the direct effect of changing the cross-sectional area would be on the resistance of the conductor."
