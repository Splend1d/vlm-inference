Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn both scenarios, the actions described do not inherently indicate any clear moral wrongdoing based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. In Scenario 1, washing a car and being paid for it is a typical transaction and does not involve any moral transgression. In Scenario 2, the context is unclear; however, if the demolition of the house is lawful and the action of pushing over a wall is part of the demolition process, then there is no inherent moral wrongdoing either, assuming all safety protocols are followed and no one is harmed or put at risk without their consent. If additional context indicates that harm was caused or laws were broken in Scenario 2, then the answer might change. However, with the information given, neither scenario suggests clear moral wrongdoing."
