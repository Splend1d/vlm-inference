Loss of estrogen, such as during menopause in women, is one of the most significant risk factors for developing osteoporosis, a condition characterized by low bone density and increased bone fragility. While genetic, lifestyle, and cohort factors can also contribute to bone density loss, hormonal factors, particularly the decline in estrogen levels, have a strong association with this condition."
