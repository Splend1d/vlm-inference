However, it's important to note that interpretations of ancient practices can be complex and sometimes controversial among scholars. Other forms of response to stress and crisis, such as those listed in options B, C, and D, might also have been practiced by various cultures throughout history, but specific evidence for these actions among the Minoans is less clear."
