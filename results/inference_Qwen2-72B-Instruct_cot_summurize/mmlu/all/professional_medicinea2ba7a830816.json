He also has been confused and agitated during this period. He has a history of mild hypertension. His current medication is a diuretic. His temperature is 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), pulse is 108/min, respirations are 26/min, and blood pressure is 70/47 mm Hg. Physical examination shows delayed capillary refill of the lips and nail beds and cool extremities. His oxyhemoglobin saturation in a central vein is 60% (N=70\u201375). These findings are most consistent with which of the following types of shock?\n\nA. Cardiogenic\nB. Distributive\nC. Hypovolemic\nD. Obstructive\n"

                    "text": "The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are most consistent with hypovolemic shock (Option C). This type of shock results from an inadequate volume of circulating blood, often due to fluid loss from vomiting, diarrhea, or bleeding. The patient's history of vomiting and diarrhea, along with his low blood pressure, delayed capillary refill, cool extremities, and low oxyhemoglobin saturation, all suggest significant dehydration and reduced intravascular volume. Additionally, the use of a diuretic could exacerbate fluid loss.\n\nCardiogenic shock (Option A) would be characterized by poor cardiac output due to heart failure or myocardial infarction, not necessarily associated with the symptoms described.\n\nDistributive shock (Option B) is typically caused by vasodilation, such as in sepsis, anaphylaxis, or neurogenic shock, and usually presents with warm extremities due to peripheral vasodilation, which does not match the patient's presentation.\n\nObstructive shock (Option D) occurs when there is a mechanical obstruction to blood flow, such as a pulmonary embolism or cardiac tamponade, and would not fit the clinical picture provided."
