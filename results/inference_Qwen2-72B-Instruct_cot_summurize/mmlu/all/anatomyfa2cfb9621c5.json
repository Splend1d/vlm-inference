However, since you're asking for the most likely, the answer would be:\n\nB. The floor\n\nThe orbital floor is composed primarily of the maxillary bone, which is relatively thin and therefore more prone to fracture under pressure. When the force of an impact is applied to the orbit, the pressure can cause the floor to fracture inward, compressing the soft tissue of the orbit and potentially causing entrapment of the inferior rectus muscle and/or its tendons. This can result in symptoms such as diplopia (double vision) and enophthalmos (inward displacement of the eye)."
