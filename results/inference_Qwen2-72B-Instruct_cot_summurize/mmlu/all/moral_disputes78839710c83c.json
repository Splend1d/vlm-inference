In his article \"Why Abortion is Immoral,\" Marquis argues that the moral status of an action depends on its impact on the future of the individual involved, and that abortion is morally equivalent to killing a person because it deprives the fetus of a future that has value. He does not base his argument on the fetus's ability to feel pain or the potential harm to the woman, although he acknowledges that these factors may also be relevant in some cases. Therefore, the correct answer is C."
