Capacitance is defined as the ratio of the change in electric charge in a system to the corresponding change in electric potential. Thus, one farad is the capacitance across which, for a given electric potential applied across the device, there is a stored charge of one coulomb.\n\nIn equation form: \\( C = \\frac{Q}{V} \\)\n\nwhere:\n- \\( C \\) is the capacitance in farads,\n- \\( Q \\) is the charge in coulombs, and\n- \\( V \\) is the voltage in volts.\n\nTherefore, 1 F is theoretically equal to the ratio of 1 Coulomb (C) to 1 Volt (V)."
