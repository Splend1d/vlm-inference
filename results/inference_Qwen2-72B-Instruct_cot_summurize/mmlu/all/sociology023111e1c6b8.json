This can be upward mobility, where someone moves to a higher social position, or downward mobility, where someone moves to a lower social position, compared to their position at birth or their parents' position. In contrast, horizontal mobility refers to moving laterally within the same social stratum, such as changing jobs without changing one's overall social standing. Absolute and relative poverty refer to different measures of economic deprivation and do not describe changes in social position."
