Diminished economic resources\n\nDiminished economic resources is generally not a valid defense for avoiding payment on a negotiable instrument, such as a check, promissory note, or bill of exchange. The holder of the negotiable instrument has the right to expect payment regardless of the debtor's financial situation at the time the instrument becomes due.\n\nThe other options listed can be valid defenses under certain circumstances:\n\nA. Breach of contract - If the negotiable instrument was issued as part of a larger agreement and one party has breached that agreement, it could potentially be used as a defense.\nC. Fraud in the inducement - This refers to the situation where a party was induced to enter into the transaction by fraudulent means, which can be a defense against payment.\nD. Mental incapacity - If the person who issued the negotiable instrument was mentally incapacitated at the time of issuance, this can be a defense against its enforceability."
