They can be added across a portfolio of assets to give portfolio returns\n\nThis statement is not entirely correct because when dealing with portfolio returns, you need to take into account the weights of each asset in the portfolio. Simply adding up the continuously compounded returns of individual assets does not give you the portfolio return; you must also consider the proportion of each asset in the portfolio. The correct way to calculate portfolio log-return is by taking the weighted sum of the individual log-returns, where the weights are the proportions of each asset in the portfolio."
