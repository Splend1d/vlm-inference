                    "text": "The correct answer is C. phosphocreatine stores.\n\nDuring very high force contractions that last for 1-2 seconds, muscles rely primarily on stored ATP and phosphocreatine (PCr) as their immediate energy sources. ATP provides the direct energy required for muscle contraction, while phosphocreatine serves as a rapid means of regenerating ATP from ADP in the presence of creatine kinase. This system can provide energy very quickly but is depleted within about 5-10 seconds of intense activity. After phosphocreatine stores are depleted, other energy systems such as glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation take over to continue ATP production."
