Therefore, option A is closest to Little's argument, but it is not an accurate representation of her position. Little does not argue that terminating a pregnancy is necessarily a sign of respect, but rather that it may be a responsible decision in certain circumstances where the background conditions for a good life are not present. Option B is also not an accurate representation of Little's argument, as she does not argue that the act of creation should always be held sacred. Option C is not relevant to Little's argument about the norms of creation. Therefore, the answer is D, none of the above. However, if I had to choose the closest option, I would select A with the caveat that it is not an entirely accurate representation of Little's argument."
