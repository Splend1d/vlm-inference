This action aligns with ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nIn scenario 2, keeping corpses in the garage is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The proper handling and respect for human remains is important, and failing to report or properly deal with corpses can lead to legal and ethical issues."
