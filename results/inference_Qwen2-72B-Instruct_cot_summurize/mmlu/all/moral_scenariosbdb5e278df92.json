This action could potentially harm others by exposing them to health risks.\n\nIn Scenario 2, while shouting in a movie theater during a film might be considered rude or disruptive, it is not necessarily morally wrong in the same way that urinating in a pool is. It may be against theater rules and is generally frowned upon, but it does not pose a significant health risk or cause lasting harm to others."
