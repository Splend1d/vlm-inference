This can be represented as:\n\n\\[\n(p_1 \\land p_2 \\land p_3) \\lor (p_1 \\land p_2 \\land p_4) \\lor (p_1 \\land p_3 \\land p_4) \\lor (p_2 \\land p_3 \\land p_4) \\lor (p_1 \\land p_2 \\land p_3 \\land p_4)\n\\]\n\nSo, **Condition I** can indeed be expressed using a Boolean formula with the given connectives.\n\n### Condition II: Exactly three of \\(p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4\\) are true.\n\nThis is more complex because we need to ensure exactly three variables are true, which means we must exclude the case where all four variables are true. We can express this by taking the formula from **Condition I** and excluding the case where all four variables are true:\n\n\\[\n((p_1 \\land p_2 \\land p_3) \\lor (p_1 \\land p_2 \\land p_4) \\lor (p_1 \\land p_3 \\land p_4) \\lor (p_2 \\land p_3 \\land p_4)) \\land \\lnot(p_1 \\land p_2 \\land p_3 \\land p_4)\n\\]\n\nHowever, since we cannot use the NOT operator (\\(\\lnot\\)), we cannot directly express **Condition II** using only the AND (\\(\\land\\)) and OR (\\(\\lor\\)) operators.\n\n### Condition III: An even number of \\(p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4\\) are true.\n\nTo have an even number of variables being true, either 0, 2, or 4 variables should be true. The formula for this can be constructed as follows:\n\n- For 0 variables true: This scenario is inherently included as long as we consider cases where not all variables are true.\n- For 2 variables true: This can be represented by considering all possible pairs of variables being true and then ORing them together.\n- For 4 variables true: This is simply \\(p_1 \\land p_2 \\land p_3 \\land p_4\\).\n\nThe full formula would be quite extensive, but essentially it would involve ORing all possible combinations of two variables being true with the case where all four are true. Since we are dealing with an even number, we do not need to negate any part of this expression, making it possible to express using only AND and OR.\n\nTherefore, **Conditions I and III** can be expressed using a Boolean formula with the given connectives, while **Condition II** cannot.\n\nThe correct answer is **D. I and III**."
