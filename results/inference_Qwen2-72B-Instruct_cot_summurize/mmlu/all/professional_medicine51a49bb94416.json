Obstructive sleep apnea in children is often caused by enlarged tonsils and adenoids, which can be surgically removed (adenotonsillectomy) to improve breathing during sleep. This procedure can significantly reduce or eliminate symptoms of sleep apnea and improve daytime behavior and attention. Elevation of the head of the bed (option A) may help slightly but is not a definitive treatment. Heart rate and apnea monitoring (option B) is useful for diagnosing sleep apnea but does not treat it. Imipramine (option C) is an antidepressant medication and is not indicated for the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea."
