The earliest non-human primate relatives, also known as protohominids, appeared during the Miocene epoch, which lasted from about 23 to 5.3 million years ago. However, it's important to note that the very earliest primates appeared much earlier, during the Paleocene epoch, but the earliest hominids (the group that includes humans and our direct ancestors) did appear during the Miocene."
