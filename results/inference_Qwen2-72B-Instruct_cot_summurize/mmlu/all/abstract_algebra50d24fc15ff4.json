This mapping satisfies the definition of a homomorphism, as it preserves the group operation (since the identity element in any group, when combined with any other element, yields that other element). Thus, there always exists at least this trivial homomorphism between any two groups.\n\n**Statement 2**: \"Every homomorphism is a one-to-one map.\"\n\nThis statement is false. While some homomorphisms can indeed be one-to-one (injective), not all homomorphisms have this property. A counterexample would be any non-trivial homomorphism where more than one element of the domain maps to the same element in the codomain. The trivial homomorphism mentioned above, for instance, is not one-to-one unless \\(G\\) is itself the trivial group containing only the identity element.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **C. True, False**."
