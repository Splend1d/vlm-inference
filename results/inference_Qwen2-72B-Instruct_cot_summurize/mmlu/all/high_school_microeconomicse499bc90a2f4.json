It tends to be greater (i.e., more elastic) when:\n\n1. The good represents a significant portion of the consumer's budget, because consumers will pay more attention to price changes for goods that cost them more relative to their income.\n2. There is a longer time horizon to respond to the price change, as consumers need time to adjust their consumption habits or find substitutes.\n3. There are many close substitutes available, making it easier for consumers to switch to another product if the price increases.\n4. The good is not a necessity, as people are more willing to cut back on non-essential items when prices rise.\n\nTherefore, option A aligns with the factors that increase price elasticity of demand. Options B, C, and D describe conditions under which demand would likely be less elastic."
