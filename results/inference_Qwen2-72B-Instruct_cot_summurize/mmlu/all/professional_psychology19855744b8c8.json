POSITIVE FEEDBACK \u2192 disrupting homeostasis by creating deviations in the status quo\n\nThis definition is not incorrect per se, but it is often misunderstood or misinterpreted in the context of systems theory. In systems theory, positive feedback refers to processes that amplify changes; this can either be beneficial or detrimental to the system's stability. However, in the context of maintaining homeostasis, positive feedback is typically contrasted with negative feedback, which works to reduce deviations and restore balance. Positive feedback mechanisms can sometimes disrupt homeostasis, but they are not inherently designed to do so. Instead, they can contribute to the evolution or change of the system under certain conditions.\n\nIn family systems theory, positive feedback loops are usually seen as processes that reinforce existing patterns or behaviors, potentially leading to escalation of conflicts or issues if not balanced by negative feedback mechanisms that work to stabilize the system. Thus, while positive feedback can indeed create deviations in the status quo, it is not solely defined by its role in disrupting homeostasis."
