The string length is not a multiple of half the wavelength of the wave.\n\nStanding waves form on a string when the frequency of the wave matches one of the natural frequencies of the string, which depend on its length, tension, and linear mass density. For standing waves to occur at a given frequency, the length of the string must be a multiple of half the wavelength (L = n\u03bb/2, where n is an integer). If the string length does not satisfy this condition for the 60 Hz frequency, then standing waves will not form."
