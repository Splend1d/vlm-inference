While C is also true in the sense that race relations in Britain and America do indeed have roots in colonial history, it is not the primary focus of theories of racialized discourse, which emphasize the ongoing construction and perpetuation of racial categories through language and ideology. A and D are incorrect because they imply that race is either biologically determined or chosen by individuals, both of which are contradicted by the social constructionist view."
