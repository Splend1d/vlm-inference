                    "text": "Let's analyze each statement:\n\n**Statement 1**: For every positive integer \\(n\\), there is a cyclic group of order \\(n\\).\n\nThis statement is true. A cyclic group of order \\(n\\) can be generated by a single element, say \\(g\\), such that \\(g^n = e\\) (where \\(e\\) is the identity element) and no smaller positive power of \\(g\\) equals \\(e\\). An example of such a group is \\(\\mathbb{Z}_n\\), the integers modulo \\(n\\) under addition, which is cyclic and generated by \\(1\\). Therefore, for any positive integer \\(n\\), there exists a cyclic group of order \\(n\\).\n\n**Statement 2**: Every finite cyclic group contains an element of every order that divides the order of the group.\n\nThis statement is also true. If \\(G\\) is a finite cyclic group of order \\(n\\), then for every divisor \\(d\\) of \\(n\\), there exists an element in \\(G\\) whose order is \\(d\\). This follows from the fact that if \\(G = \\langle g \\rangle\\), then \\(g^{n/d}\\) has order \\(d\\), since \\((g^{n/d})^d = g^n = e\\), but no smaller positive power of \\(g^{n/d}\\) equals \\(e\\). Hence, every finite cyclic group does indeed contain an element of every order that divides the order of the group.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **A. True, True**."
