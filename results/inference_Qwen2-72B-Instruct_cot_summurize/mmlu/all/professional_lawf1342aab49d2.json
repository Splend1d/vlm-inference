Since they are within the jurisdiction of the county where the warehouse is located, they are subject to taxation by that county. The fact that the tires are mingled and stored in the warehouse and the bicycles are assembled and remain on the loading docks does not exempt either from ad valorem property taxation. Both items are part of the business inventory and thus can be taxed by the county."
