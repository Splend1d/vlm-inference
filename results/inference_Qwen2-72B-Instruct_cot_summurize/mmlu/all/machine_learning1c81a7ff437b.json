If D represents the number of parameters (dimensions) in your model, then for each parameter, you perform a constant time operation (the subtraction mentioned). Therefore, if you have D parameters, you will need to perform this operation D times.\n\nThus, the cost of one gradient descent update, given the gradient, is **O(D)**.\n\nSo the correct answer is:\n\nA.
