Percentage depletion in excess of straight-line depreciation on natural resource properties.\n2. The excess of capital gains over capital losses (long-term capital gains).\n\nHowever, dividends from publicly-held companies are not considered an AMT tax preference item; they are taxed at regular rates under both the regular tax system and the AMT system.\n\nThe percentage depletion in excess of the property's adjusted basis is a tax preference item because it allows a greater deduction than the straight-line depreciation method that must be used for AMT purposes.\n\nThe long-term capital gain is also considered a tax preference item under AMT because the AMT calculation does not allow for any special rates on capital gains. All income is taxed at the same rate under AMT.\n\nThus, the total amount of West's AMT tax preference items is the sum of the percentage depletion in excess of the property's adjusted basis and the long-term capital gain:\n\n$9,000 (percentage depletion) + $15,000 (long-term capital gain) = $24,000\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. $24,000"
