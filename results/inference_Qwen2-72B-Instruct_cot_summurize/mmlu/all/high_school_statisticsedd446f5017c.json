By blocking on exercise intensity, you account for its potential influence on cholesterol levels, ensuring that any observed effects can be more confidently attributed to the treatment (fish oil or garlic capsules) rather than to differences in exercise intensity among participants.\n\nSince sleep length is not associated with cholesterol level, blocking on this factor would not be necessary. Blocking on cholesterol level or capsule type would not make sense in this context; blocking on cholesterol level would imply pre-experimentation knowledge of the outcome variable, which is what you're trying to measure, and blocking on capsule type would defeat the purpose of comparing the two treatments."
