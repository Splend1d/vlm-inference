                    "text": "The correct answer is D. lead the firm to hire more workers and to pay them higher wages.\n\nHere's why: When the firm experiences a technological innovation that increases its marginal physical product (MPP), the output produced by each additional worker increases. This means that each additional worker now contributes more to total revenue than before. As a result, the marginal revenue product (MRP) of labor rises, where MRP is defined as the additional revenue generated by hiring one more worker.\n\nIn a perfectly competitive market, firms will hire workers up to the point where the MRP equals the wage rate (W). Since the MRP has increased due to the innovation, the firm will be willing to pay a higher wage to attract additional workers, as long as the increase in MRP exceeds the increase in W. Thus, the firm will pay higher wages to attract these workers.\n\nAdditionally, because the firm is a price taker, it cannot influence the market wage rate. However, since the MRP is now higher than the market wage rate, the firm will find it profitable to hire more workers until the new equilibrium is reached where MRP = W again. Therefore, the firm will hire more workers at the higher wage rate.\n\nIt is important to note that while the firm may pay higher wages, this does not necessarily mean that the overall market wage rate will increase, as the firm is just a single participant in a competitive market. The market wage rate will only change if the innovation affects multiple firms or the industry as a whole."
