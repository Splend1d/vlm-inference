Ownership of processed data and costs of data migrations.\n\nThis concern is more unique to SaaS offerings because when using a SaaS, the data is typically stored on the provider's servers, raising questions about who owns the data and what happens to it if you switch providers or the service is discontinued. With an in-house application, the company has full control over its data and doesn't have to worry about migration costs as much since the data resides within their own infrastructure."
