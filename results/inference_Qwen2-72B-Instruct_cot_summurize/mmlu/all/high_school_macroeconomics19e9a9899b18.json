Increased Nominal GDP, Decreased Real GDP\n\nWhen the price level rises while the production (quantity) of goods and services remains constant, nominal GDP increases because it is measured at current prices. However, real GDP, which is adjusted for inflation and measures the value of goods and services at constant prices, would remain the same or effectively decrease in terms of purchasing power if we consider that the rise in price level represents inflation. Since the question implies that the value of goods and services has not increased in quantity, the real GDP has not increased; thus, it can be considered to have decreased in comparison to what it could have been without inflation. But more accurately, it stays the same in physical volume terms but loses value when compared to its previous purchasing power."
