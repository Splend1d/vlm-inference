He argued that aggregate demand (total spending in the economy) determines the overall level of economic activity, and that inadequate demand leads to prolonged periods of high unemployment. Keynes proposed that governments should use fiscal policy (spending and taxation) and monetary policy (manipulation of the money supply and interest rates) to manage demand and stabilize the economy, particularly during recessions. His theories were influential in shaping economic policies aimed at addressing the Great Depression."
