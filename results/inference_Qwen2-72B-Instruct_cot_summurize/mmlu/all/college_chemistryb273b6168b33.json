                    "text": "The number of lines in an Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectrum can be determined by considering the number of equivalent magnetic nuclei that couple to the unpaired electron(s). In this case, we have a nitronyl nitroxide diradical where each radical has one unpaired electron coupled to two equivalent nitrogen nuclei.\n\nThe EPR spectrum's complexity arises from the interaction of the unpaired electrons with the nuclear spins. The number of lines in the EPR spectrum can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[ n = (2I + 1)^n \\]\n\nwhere \\( I \\) is the nuclear spin quantum number and \\( n \\) is the number of equivalent nuclei with the same spin quantum number interacting with the unpaired electron(s).\n\nFor nitrogen-14 (^14N), the nuclear spin quantum number \\( I \\) is 1. Therefore, for each of the two equivalent nitrogen nuclei coupling to one unpaired electron, the formula gives us:\n\n\\[ n = (2 \\times 1 + 1) = 3 \\]\n\nSince there are two equivalent nitrogen nuclei per unpaired electron, and we have two unpaired electrons (one for each radical in the diradical system), the total number of lines would be the product of the number of lines produced by each nucleus, which is:\n\n\\[ n_{\\text{total}} = 3 \\times 3 = 9 \\]\n\nHowever, the question specifies that \\( J \\ll a \\), where \\( J \\) is the exchange coupling constant between the two unpaired electrons and \\( a \\) is the hyperfine coupling constant between the unpaired electron and the nitrogen nuclei. When \\( J \\) is much less than \\( a \\), the two unpaired electrons behave almost independently, and their spectra do not split further due to their interaction with each other.\n\nThus, even though there are two unpaired electrons, they do not significantly interact with each other under these conditions, so we treat them separately. Each unpaired electron will give rise to 3 lines due to its interaction with the two equivalent nitrogen nuclei. Since the two unpaired electrons are independent in this scenario, the total number of lines remains:\n\n\\[ n_{\\text{total}} = 3 \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. 3 lines"
