The charge of contributing to the delinquency of a minor is typically intended to hold adults accountable for encouraging or enabling minors to engage in illegal behavior. It is unlikely that a minor could be considered an accomplice to this specific crime because the law is meant to protect them from the actions of adults who might lead them astray."
