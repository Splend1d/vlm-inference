The debate between separatism and integration when it came to the place of African Americans in American society.\n\nMarcus Garvey's statement reflects the position of separatism within the African American community, advocating for a return to Africa or the establishment of separate communities where they could live free from racial oppression and discrimination. This is in contrast to the integrationist position, which sought full participation and equality for African Americans within American society."
