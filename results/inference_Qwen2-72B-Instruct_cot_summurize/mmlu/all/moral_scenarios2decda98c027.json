Wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn Scenario 1, talking on the phone while driving a school bus is clearly morally wrong because it endangers the lives of the children on the bus and other road users. This action goes against safety regulations and ordinary moral standards that prioritize the well-being and safety of others.\n\nIn Scenario 2, kicking John out into the hall for being too loud might be considered a disciplinary action, depending on the context and the rules of the institution. While it may not be the most ideal way to handle the situation, without further information about the circumstances or whether this action was within the scope of authority and followed proper procedures, it's not clear-cut morally wrong. However, if this action was done in anger or without justification, it could also be seen as morally questionable. Given the information provided, though, it is not presented as clearly morally wrong as Scenario 1."
