This typically involves having specialized knowledge, skills, experience, or education that can assist the judge or jury in understanding complex psychological issues relevant to the case. The court will assess the psychologist's qualifications and determine whether they meet the criteria for being considered an expert witness. Board certification may be one of the factors considered, but it is not a requirement in itself. The psychologist does not need to have been hired by the person they will be testifying about, and while their testimony should be based on their professional expertise, it may include interpretations of information beyond what they personally observed or obtained, provided it is within their area of expertise and is relevant to the case."
