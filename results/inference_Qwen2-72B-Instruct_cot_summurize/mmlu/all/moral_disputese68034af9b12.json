However, in general discussions of terrorism, \"violence\" is often defined more broadly than just bodily harm to persons. It typically includes the destruction of property as well, as this can be a means to instill fear, cause economic damage, or disrupt social stability. Therefore, if we are to assume that Valls' definition follows common usage, the answer would be:\n\nB. including bodily harm to persons and the destruction of property.\n\nBut for a precise answer, one would need to refer directly to the specific text or speech where Valls defines terrorism."
