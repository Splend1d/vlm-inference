This is a time of challenge to our interests and our values and it's a time that tests our wisdom and skills.\nAt this time in Iran, 50 Americans are still held captive, innocent victims of terrorism and anarchy. Also at this moment, massive Soviet troops are attempting to subjugate the fiercely independent and deeply religious people of Afghanistan. These two acts\u2014one of international terrorism and one of military aggression\u2014present a serious challenge to the United States of America and indeed to all the nations of the world. Together we will meet these threats to peace.\u2026\nThree basic developments have helped to shape our challenges: the steady growth and increased projection of Soviet military power beyond its own borders; the overwhelming dependence of the Western democracies on oil supplies from the Middle East; and the press of social and religious and economic and political change in the many nations of the developing world, exemplified by the revolution in Iran.\nEach of these factors is important in its own right. Each interacts with the others. All must be faced together, squarely and courageously. We will face these challenges, and we will meet them with the best that is in us. And we will not fail.\n\u2014Jimmy Carter, State of the Union Address, January 23, 1980\nThe situation Carter described led most directly to which of the following?\n\nA. The creation of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)\nB. Carter's defeat in the next presidential election\nC. An American invasion in the Middle East\nD. Carter's victory in the next presidential election\n"

Carter's defeat in the next presidential election.\n\nThe hostage crisis in Iran and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan were significant foreign policy challenges for the Carter administration. The ongoing hostage crisis hurt President Carter's approval ratings and contributed to a sense of national malaise. The perception that he was unable to effectively manage the crisis played a role in his defeat in the 1980 presidential election to Ronald Reagan. The other options listed did not occur as a direct result of the situations Carter described in his address."
