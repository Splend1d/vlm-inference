Mean: The mean might not necessarily be zero; it would simply be the common value that all elements in the data set have.\n\nB. Standard Deviation: The standard deviation measures the dispersion or spread of the data points relative to the mean. If all values are the same, there is no dispersion, so the standard deviation would be zero.\n\nC. Variance: Variance is another measure of dispersion and is actually the square of the standard deviation. Since there is no dispersion when all values are the same, the variance would also be zero.\n\nD. Range: The range is the difference between the highest and lowest numbers in a list of numbers. When all numbers are the same, the difference between the highest and lowest number is zero, so the range would also be zero.\n\nGiven the question asks which one does NOT equal zero, the answer is:\n\nA. Mean\n\nThe mean could be any value, but it won't be zero unless all the values in the data set were zero to begin with."
