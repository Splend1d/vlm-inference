Following the President's announcement, Congress enacted a statute that unequivocally prohibited \"the U. S.

The President's authority as Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces is derived from Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution, which states that the President \"shall be Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States.\" This provision gives the President broad authority over the military, including the power to direct military operations and engage in joint training exercises with foreign military forces. Congress does have the power to declare war and regulate the armed forces under Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution, but it cannot unduly restrict the President's ability to carry out his duties as Commander-in-Chief. Therefore, the statute is most likely unconstitutional because it infringes upon the President's authority as Commander-in-Chief. However, it should be noted that the constitutionality of such a statute could depend on the specific language of the statute and how it is interpreted by the courts."
