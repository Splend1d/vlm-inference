The main character might be playing a harmless prank on their mother-in-law, assuming she will find out the truth before packing or upon arrival.\n\nIn Scenario 2, shooting an animal that poses an immediate threat to a person's safety or life is generally not considered morally wrong. Protecting one's child from harm is seen as a morally right action under such circumstances."
