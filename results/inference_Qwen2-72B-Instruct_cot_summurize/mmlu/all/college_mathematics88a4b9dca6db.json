                    "text": "Let's analyze each statement individually:\n\nI. If A and C are connected, then B is connected.\n\nThis statement is not necessarily true. Consider the real line \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) with its usual topology. Let \\(A = [0, 1]\\), \\(B = [0, 1] \\cup [2, 3]\\), and \\(C = [0, 3]\\). Here, \\(A\\) and \\(C\\) are connected, but \\(B\\) is not since it can be separated into two disjoint open sets (\\([0, 1)\\) and \\((2, 3]\\)).\n\nII. If A and C are compact, then B is compact.\n\nThis statement is also not necessarily true. Compactness is not transitive in this way. For instance, again consider \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) with its usual topology. Let \\(A = [0, 1]\\), \\(B = [0, 1] \\cup [2, 3)\\), and \\(C = [0, 3]\\). Both \\(A\\) and \\(C\\) are compact because they are closed and bounded in \\(\\mathbb{R}\\). However, \\(B\\) is not compact because it is not closed (the sequence \\(\\{2 - \\frac{1}{n}\\}_{n=1}^\\infty\\) converges to 2, which is not in \\(B\\)).\n\nIII. If A and C are Hausdorff, then B is Hausdorff.\n\nThis statement is true. The Hausdorff property is a property of the entire topological space, not just of subsets within it. If \\(X\\) is Hausdorff (and both \\(A\\) and \\(C\\) being Hausdorff implies that \\(X\\) itself is Hausdorff, since \\(A\\) and \\(C\\) are subsets of \\(X\\)), then any subset of \\(X\\) inherits the Hausdorff property. This means that for any two distinct points in \\(B\\), there exist disjoint open sets containing each point, respectively. Since \\(B \\subseteq X\\), and \\(X\\) is Hausdorff, then \\(B\\) must also be Hausdorff.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **B. III only**."
