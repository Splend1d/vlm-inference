Duty is collected on this and on nothing else. We send it to the land of the pagan Sudan and sell it for two-thirds of its weight in gold, so that we sell 100 measures of this copper for 66 2/3 measures of gold.' He also stated that there are pagan nations in his kingdom from whom he does not collect the tribute (jizya) but whom he simply employs in extracting the gold from its deposits. The gold is extracted by digging pits about a man's height in depth and the gold is found embedded in the sides of the pits or sometimes collected at the bottom of them.\"\nFrom N. Levtzion & J.F.P.

                    "text": "The passage doesn't provide direct evidence for the spread of Islam to the lands of the kingdom of Mali, but given the context and historical knowledge, option B, \"Trade contacts who came from the north across the Sahara,\" is the most plausible explanation for the spread of Islam to Mali. Trade routes across the Sahara were crucial in the transmission of goods, ideas, and religions between North Africa and West Africa. Muslim traders played a significant role in these exchanges, bringing Islamic beliefs and practices with them as they interacted with local populations.\n\nIslam likely spread to Mali through these trade networks, as merchants from North Africa and other parts of the Islamic world established commercial links with the region. These interactions would have included the sharing of religious beliefs, leading to the conversion of some members of the Malian society, including possibly the ruling elite. The reference to the sale of copper for gold and the mention of pagan nations within the kingdom suggest a complex economy with external trade connections, which would have facilitated the spread of Islam through merchant networks."
