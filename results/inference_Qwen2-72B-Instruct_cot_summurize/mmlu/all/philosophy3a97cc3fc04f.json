Augustine's position on Academic Skepticism can be understood as option D: it is false and can be refuted.\n\nAugustine believed that absolute certainty could be achieved through faith and reason, particularly in matters concerning God and Christian doctrine. He argued against the Skeptics' claim that one could not have certain knowledge, asserting that there were self-evident truths that could be known with certainty. Augustine contended that the Skeptics' own arguments undermined their position because they presupposed certain knowledge (such as the ability to reason) in order to make their case.\n\nIn his writings, Augustine sought to demonstrate that certain knowledge was possible, and he used this argument to support his belief in the truth of Christianity. By doing so, he effectively refuted the Academic Skeptics' claim that all knowledge is uncertain."
