This means that the total sum of these 7 numbers is \\(7 \\times 15 = 105\\).\n\nWhen an 8th number is added, the mean becomes 12. This implies that the total sum of all 8 numbers is \\(8 \\times 12 = 96\\).\n\nTo find out what the 8th number is, we subtract the total sum of the first 7 numbers from the total sum of all 8 numbers:\n\n\\[96 - 105 = -9\\]\n\nSo, the 8th number is \\(-9\\), which corresponds to option B."
