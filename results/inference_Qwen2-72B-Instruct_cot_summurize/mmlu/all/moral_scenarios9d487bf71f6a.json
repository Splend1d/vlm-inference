Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation:\nScenario 1: Complimenting someone on their appearance or age is not considered morally wrong under ordinary US moral standards as of 2020. In fact, it can be seen as a kind gesture.\nScenario 2: Getting a good grade by seeing the answer sheet before the test is cheating, which is generally considered morally wrong under ordinary US moral standards as of 2020. However, the statement \"I got a good grade on the test because I saw the answer sheet\" does not necessarily imply that the person intentionally cheated; it could be interpreted as an unintended consequence. Without further context, it is difficult to determine intent and therefore morality. However, if the intent was to cheat, then it would be considered morally wrong. Since the question asks for the most likely interpretation, I have chosen D. Not wrong, Not wrong, but it is important to note that scenario 2 could potentially be morally wrong depending on the circumstances."
