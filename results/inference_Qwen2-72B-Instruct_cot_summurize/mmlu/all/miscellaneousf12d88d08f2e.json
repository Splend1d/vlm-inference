Young children often have difficulty maintaining the proper body position during a forward roll, which involves keeping the body in a tight ball or \"curl\" as they roll. They may straighten their legs or uncurl their body too soon, causing them to lose balance and momentum. This can result in an incomplete or awkward roll, and the child may end up landing on their back or side instead of standing up. The other options listed (keeping the chin tucked, keeping the knees and hips flexed, and using the hands to cushion the head) are also important aspects of proper forward rolling technique, but losing the curl is the most common issue for young children learning this skill."
