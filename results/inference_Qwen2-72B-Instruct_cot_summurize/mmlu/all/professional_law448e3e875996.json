In light of the defendant's lengthy juvenile criminal history, which included violent offenses, and the fact that armed robbery is a crime of violence, he was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. Did the life-without-parole sentence violate the Eighth Amendment ban on cruel and unusual punishment?\n\nA. No, because a juvenile may be sentenced to life without parole if release would pose a danger to the community.\nB. No, because the Eighth Amendment does not apply outside the context of capital punishment.\nC. Yes, because a life-without-parole sentence is not permissible for a juvenile defendant convicted of a nonhomicide offense.\nD. Yes, because a life-without-parole sentence is not permissible for an adult or juvenile defendant convicted of a nonviolent offense.\n"

Yes, because a life-without-parole sentence is not permissible for a juvenile defendant convicted of a nonhomicide offense.\n\nIn 2010, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Graham v. Florida that juvenile offenders cannot be sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole when they have not committed a homicide. The Court held that such sentences violate the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment because they fail to take into account the unique characteristics of juveniles, including their greater potential for rehabilitation. Therefore, the life-without-parole sentence for this 14-year-old defendant, who was convicted of armed robbery (a nonhomicide offense), would indeed violate the Eighth Amendment."
