Eating fish\n\nRegular consumption of fish, particularly those high in omega-3 fatty acids like salmon, mackerel, and sardines, has been associated with a decreased risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. Omega-3 fatty acids are thought to help maintain brain health and reduce inflammation, which may contribute to a lower risk of cognitive decline. \n\nA. Being African or Hispanic American - These ethnic groups have been found to have a higher risk of developing Alzheimer's disease compared to non-Hispanic whites.\nC. A lower level of education - Lower levels of education have been linked to an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease, possibly due to reduced cognitive reserve.\nD. Being married - While social engagement can be beneficial for cognitive health, simply being married does not necessarily decrease the risk of Alzheimer's disease. However, a supportive social network can contribute to overall well-being and potentially delay the onset of dementia symptoms."
