This means that their genome is a single-stranded RNA molecule that acts directly as messenger RNA (mRNA) in the host cell. The viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase synthesizes complementary negative strands from this positive strand, which then serve as templates for the synthesis of new positive strands. This process allows the virus to generate its progeny RNA genomes and proteins necessary for new virions assembly within the host cell."
