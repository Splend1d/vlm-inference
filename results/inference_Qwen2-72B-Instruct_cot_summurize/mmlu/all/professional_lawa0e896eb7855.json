The land conveyed to the woman fronted on a public highway. The land retained by the man was landlocked. One year later, the man died intestate, leaving a cousin as his only heir. The cousin visited the man's land for the first time and discovered that it had no access to a public highway. A neighbor who owned adjoining land fronting on the public highway offered to sell the cousin a right to cross the neighbor's land for access to the highway. Although the neighbor's price was reasonable, the cousin rejected the offer. The woman has refused to allow the cousin to cross her land for access to the public highway even though the woman's land is still vacant. The cousin has sued the woman, seeking access across the woman's land to the public highway. Who is likely to prevail?\n\nA. The cousin, based on necessity.\nB. The cousin, because the woman's land is still vacant.\nC. The woman, because the cousin could obtain an alternative access to the highway from the neighbor.\nD. The woman, because the man failed to reserve an easement in his deed to the woman.\n"

The woman, because the man failed to reserve an easement in his deed to the woman.\n\nIn this scenario, when the man conveyed the eastern half of the tract of land to the woman by a warranty deed, he did not reserve any rights or easements over that portion of the land for himself. As such, when he died and his land became landlocked, there was no legal provision allowing for access across the woman's land. The fact that the woman's land is still vacant does not automatically grant the cousin, as the heir of the man, a right of way across it.\n\nThe cousin's refusal to purchase a right of way from the neighbor, even though the price was reasonable, suggests that the court may view the cousin as not taking reasonable steps to remedy the situation. Additionally, the principle of \"necessity\" typically applies only at the time of conveyance; once the conveyance is complete without an easement, the doctrine of necessity does not create an easement after the fact. Therefore, the cousin is unlikely to prevail based on necessity alone.\n\nThe cousin's best argument would have been if the man had reserved an easement for access when conveying the land to the woman, but since he did not, the woman is likely to prevail in the lawsuit."
