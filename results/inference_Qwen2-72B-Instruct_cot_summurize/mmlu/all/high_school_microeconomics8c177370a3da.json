Price is determined by the equilibrium in the entire market.\n\nIn perfect competition, individual firms have no control over the market price, which is determined by the interaction of industry-wide supply and demand. Each firm is a price taker, meaning it accepts the market price as given and can sell any quantity of output at that price. This results in a horizontal demand curve for the individual firm, indicating constant price regardless of the quantity sold. Therefore, options A, B, and D are incorrect."
