Modern European genomes have contributions from the earliest anatomically modern Homo sapiens who lived in Europe 45,000 years ago, people genetically traceable to the Middle East who moved into Europe about 9,000 years ago, and people who moved there from West Asia less than 5,000 years ago. These findings are consistent with the theory of multiple waves of migration into Europe over thousands of years."
