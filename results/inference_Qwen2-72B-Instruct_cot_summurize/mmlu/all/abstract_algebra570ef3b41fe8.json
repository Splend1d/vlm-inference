Number of relations form A = {x, y, z} to B= (1, 2), is 64.\n\nExplanation:\nA relation R from set A to set B is defined as a subset of the Cartesian product A x B. The number of elements in the Cartesian product of A and B is |A| * |B|, where |A| denotes the cardinality (number of elements) of set A and |B| denotes the cardinality of set B.\n\nHere, |A| = 3 (as A = {x, y, z}) and |B| = 2 (as B = {1, 2}). Therefore, the number of elements in the Cartesian product A x B is 3 * 2 = 6.\n\nEach element of A x B can either be included in the relation R or not. Thus, for each of the 6 elements, there are 2 choices: include it in R or do not include it. Hence, the total number of possible relations from A to B is 2^6 = 64.\n\nLet's examine the other options:\n\nA. Every equivalence relation is a partial-ordering relation.\nThis statement is false. Equivalence relations and partial-ordering relations are distinct types of relations with different properties. An equivalence relation on a set S is a relation that is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive. In contrast, a partial-ordering relation on a set S is a relation that is reflexive, antisymmetric, and transitive. Since an equivalence relation must be symmetric and a partial-ordering relation must be antisymmetric (which implies it cannot be symmetric except when it is the identity relation), an equivalence relation cannot be a partial-ordering relation unless it is the identity relation.\n\nC. Empty relation _ is reflexive.\nThis statement is false. A relation R on a set S is reflexive if every element of S is related to itself, i.e., for all s in S, (s, s) \u2208 R. If R is the empty relation, then there are no elements (s, s) in R for any s in S, so the empty relation cannot be reflexive. However, it is vacuously true that the empty relation is transitive and antisymmetric since there are no counterexamples to disprove these properties.\n\nD. Properties of a relation being symmetric and being un-symmetric are negative of each other.\nThis statement is false. A relation R on a set S is symmetric if for all a, b in S, if (a, b) \u2208 R, then (b, a) \u2208 R. A relation R is unsymmetric if for all a, b in S, if (a, b) \u2208 R, then (b, a) \u2209 R. These properties are not negatives of each other because a relation can be neither symmetric nor unsymmetric. For example, a relation that contains some pairs (a, b) but not their reverses (b, a) would be neither symmetric nor unsymmetric."
