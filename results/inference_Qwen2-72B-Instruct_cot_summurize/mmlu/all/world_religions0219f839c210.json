It is believed to be a spiritual gift in which the speaker vocalizes words that are not recognized as any known language but are thought to be divine in origin. This phenomenon is often experienced during religious services as a form of direct communication with God. While it may occur in other denominations, it is most commonly identified with Pentecostalism."
