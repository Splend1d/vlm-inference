The pedestrian was seriously injured in the accident and sued the motorist to recover damages for personal injuries. There were no witnesses to the accident. The motorist claims that the traffic light was green at the time she entered the intersection. The pedestrian now has amnesia and cannot remember how the accident occurred. At trial, the pedestrian's attorney calls a witness to testify. The witness proposes to testify that she was in the emergency room at the hospital when the pedestrian was brought in following the accident. The witness further testifies that while the pedestrian was being treated for his injuries, the nurse asked him, \"How did you get hurt?\" The pedestrian replied, \"The car ran the red light and struck me as I was walking through the intersection. \"Upon objection, this evidence is\n\nA. admissible as a statement made for purposes of medical treatment and diagnosis.\nB. admissible as a present sense impression.\nC. inadmissible, because the witness was eavesdropping on a confidential communication between the pedestrian and a hospital representative.\nD. inadmissible, because it is hearsay not within any recognized exception.\n"

It does not fall under the exception for statements made for purposes of medical treatment and diagnosis because such statements must be relevant to the treatment or diagnosis, and a statement about the cause of the injury may not always meet this requirement. The statement also does not qualify as a present sense impression because it was not a description or explanation of an event made while the declarant was perceiving the event or immediately thereafter. The fact that the witness overheard the conversation does not automatically make it inadmissible due to confidentiality; however, without fitting into a hearsay exception, the statement remains inadmissible."
