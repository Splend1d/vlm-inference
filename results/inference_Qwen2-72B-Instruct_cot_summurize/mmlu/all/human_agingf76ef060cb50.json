This is a significant challenge in immune system theories of senescence because it involves understanding the complex interactions between various factors, including genetics, environmental exposures, and lifestyle choices, that contribute to the aging of the immune system. Without knowing the primary cause, it is difficult to develop effective interventions to prevent or delay immune system senescence.\n\nOptions B and C are incorrect because auto-immune disorders do occur and the immune system does decline with age, which are both well-documented phenomena. Option D is also incorrect because while there may be gaps in our knowledge about senescence, there is a substantial body of research on the topic, particularly concerning the immune system's role in aging."
