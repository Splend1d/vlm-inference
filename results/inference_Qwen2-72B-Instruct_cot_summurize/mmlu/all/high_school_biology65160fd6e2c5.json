This means that the forelimb structures we see in diverse mammals like horses, whales, and bats have evolved from ancestral structures, and their current form is a result of modifications over time that have been beneficial for survival and reproduction in their respective environments. These structures may not be \"optimal\" in an engineering sense, but they are the product of evolutionary history and the constraints it imposes."
