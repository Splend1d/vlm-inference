The two species share many proteins in common, and the nucleotide sequences that code for these proteins are almost identical.\n\nHomology refers to structures in different species that share a common evolutionary origin, even if they might perform different functions today. Convergent evolution is when unrelated species develop similar traits independently due to similar environmental pressures or functional needs. If the two species share many proteins in common, and especially if the nucleotide sequences coding for these proteins are almost identical, this strongly suggests a common ancestor and supports an explanation based on homology rather than convergent evolution."
