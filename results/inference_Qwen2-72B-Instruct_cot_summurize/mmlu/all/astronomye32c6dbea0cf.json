Initially, hydrogen fuses to form helium in a process called proton-proton chain or the CNO cycle. After the star has exhausted its hydrogen fuel, helium begins to fuse into heavier elements like carbon and oxygen. Further on, the star can fuse carbon and oxygen to form neon, magnesium, silicon, sulfur, and eventually iron. Fusion reactions stop at iron because iron nucleus has the highest binding energy per nucleon, making further fusion endothermic and thus not energetically favorable."
