While skeletal muscles can consume a lot of energy during physical activity, at rest, they have a lower metabolic rate compared to other organs like the brain, liver, and kidneys.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Skeletal Muscle\n\nHere's a rough comparison of the energy expenditure per unit of body mass for these organs:\n- Brain: ~23% of total body metabolism at rest\n- Liver: ~20-25% of total body metabolism at rest\n- Kidneys: ~6-8% of total body metabolism at rest\n- Skeletal Muscle: ~15-20% of total body metabolism during rest, but much higher during physical activity\n\nIt's important to note that the percentage of total body metabolism attributed to each organ can vary based on factors such as age, sex, and overall health status. However, in terms of energy expenditure per unit of body mass at rest, skeletal muscle generally ranks lower than the other organs listed."
