Sensitive or critical periods\n\nSensitive or critical periods refer to specific times in development when an individual is particularly responsive to certain environmental experiences. If these experiences occur during the sensitive period, they can promote optimal development. If they do not occur or occur at the wrong time, development may be negatively affected. This concept highlights the importance of timing in development and how it can influence an individual's potential developmental trajectories."
