Early settlements often formed along coastlines and rivers because these areas provided easy access to trade routes, which were essential for the exchange of goods, resources, and ideas. Waterways served as natural highways, allowing for the transport of goods with less effort than overland travel. This facilitated commerce and cultural exchange, leading to higher population densities in these areas."
