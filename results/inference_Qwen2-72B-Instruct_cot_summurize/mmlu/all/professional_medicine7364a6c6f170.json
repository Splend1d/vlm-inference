The symptoms are more severe when she is preparing for examinations but improve after bowel movements. She takes no medications. She does not smoke or use illicit drugs. She drinks alcoholic beverages occasionally. She is 160 cm (5 ft 3 in) tall and weighs 57 kg (125 lb); BMI is 22 kg/m2 . Her pulse is 72/min, and blood pressure is 100/72 mm Hg. Physical examination, including digital rectal examination, shows no other abnormalities. A complete blood count and serum electrolyte concentrations are within the reference ranges. A urease breath test result is negative. Upper and lower endoscopies show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient?\n\nA. Azathioprine\nB. Infliximab\nC. Lubiprostone\nD. Mesalamine\n"

IBS can be triggered by stress, as in this case where the symptoms worsen during exam preparation.\n\nGiven the patient's symptoms and the lack of abnormalities on physical examination and endoscopic evaluation, the most likely diagnosis is IBS. The treatment options for IBS include lifestyle modifications, dietary changes, and pharmacotherapy. Among the listed options, Lubiprostone (C) is the only medication that is indicated for the treatment of IBS with predominant constipation (IBS-C). Lubiprostone is a chloride channel activator that increases fluid secretion into the small intestine and colon, leading to softer stools and easier bowel movements. It has been shown to be effective in improving symptoms such as abdominal pain, bloating, and constipation in patients with IBS-C.\n\nAzathioprine (A) and Infliximab (B) are immunosuppressive agents used to treat inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, which have not been diagnosed in this patient. Mesalamine (D) is an anti-inflammatory agent used to treat mild to moderate ulcerative colitis, another condition that has not been diagnosed in this patient.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient would be Lubiprostone (C). However, it is important to note that lifestyle and dietary modifications should also be considered in the management of IBS."
