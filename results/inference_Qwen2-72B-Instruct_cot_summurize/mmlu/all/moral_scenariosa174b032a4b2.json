Wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn Scenario 1, the main character plucks rare flowers from a public garden, which is considered vandalism and destruction of public property, especially when the plants are rare or endangered. This action is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character breaks someone else's running record. While this might be disappointing for the person whose record was broken, it is not a morally wrong action. Competition and personal achievements are generally encouraged, and breaking records is part of the nature of sports and other competitive activities."
