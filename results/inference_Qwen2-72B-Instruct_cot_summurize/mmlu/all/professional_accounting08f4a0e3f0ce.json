                    "text": "To determine the amount Johnson must include in his gross income, we need to calculate the cost of the group term life insurance provided by his employer that exceeds the IRS exclusion limit.\n\nThe IRS generally excludes from income the first $50,000 of employer-provided group term life insurance coverage. Any coverage above this amount is taxable and its cost must be included in the employee's gross income.\n\nGiven that Johnson's salary is $100,000 and he receives group term life insurance at twice his salary, the total insurance coverage is $200,000. The first $50,000 of this coverage is not taxable. Thus, the taxable portion of the insurance is $200,000 - $50,000 = $150,000.\n\nNext, we calculate the cost of this taxable portion using the IRS-established uniform cost of insurance rate of $2.76 per $1,000 of coverage:\n\n\\[ \\text{Cost of taxable insurance} = 150,000 / 1,000 * 2.76 = 150 * 2.76 = 414 \\]\n\nTherefore, Johnson must include an additional $414 in his gross income due to the taxable portion of his group term life insurance.\n\nAdding this to his base salary of $100,000, Johnson's total gross income becomes:\n\n\\[ \\$100,000 + \\$414 = \\$100,414 \\]\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nC. $100,414"
