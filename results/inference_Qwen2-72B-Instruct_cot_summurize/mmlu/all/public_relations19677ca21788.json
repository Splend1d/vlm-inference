Among the options provided, Michael Porter is the most well-known for his work on strategy and competitive advantage, but he's not listed in the options. However, based on the options given:\n\nA. Steyn (2003) - Not commonly associated with strategic management or competitive advantage.\nB. Gregory (2006) - Not a widely recognized authority on strategy and competitive advantage.\nC. Cutlip et al (2006) - Known more for their work in public relations rather than strategy or competitive advantage.\nD. Henry (2006) - This could refer to Alastair R. Henry, who has written about business strategy, including how organizations can gain competitive advantage.\n\nGiven these choices, D. Henry (2006) would be the closest answer to the question, assuming it refers to Alastair R. Henry, who has indeed written about strategy in the context of gaining competitive advantage for organizations."
