Johnson to use military force in Southeast Asia without declaring war. This resolution gave the president broad authority to escalate U.S. military involvement in Vietnam, leading to a significant increase in American troops and military operations in the region. The resolution was based on reports that North Vietnamese naval vessels had attacked a U.S. destroyer in the Gulf of Tonkin, although the accuracy of these reports has since been questioned."
