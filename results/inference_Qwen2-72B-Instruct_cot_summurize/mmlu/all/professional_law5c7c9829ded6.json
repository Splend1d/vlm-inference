M. by two or more persons if such noise is audible off the premises where the singing takes place. The ordinance expressly exempted from its purview the singing or chanting of religious songs. After the ordinance was enacted and went into effect, several college students were walking down the street on their way to a victory celebration following a big college football game. They began loudly chanting, \"We're number 1. . . we're number 1. \" One of the residents who lived on the street was greatly disturbed by the noise and reported the incident to the police, who were immediately summoned to the scene. The students who engaged in the chanting were arrested and charged with violating the ordinance. The students who were prosecuted now bring suit challenging the constitutionality of the city ordinance. Which of the following would constitute their WEAKEST argument against enforcement of the city ordinance?\n\nA. The ordinance deprives persons of their freedom of expression, in violation of the First andFourteenth Amendments.\nB. The ordinance deprives persons of their liberty without due process of law because the ordinance is not related to any legitimate community interest.\nC. The statutory language of the ordinance is vague and overbroad since it attempts to encompass all forms of singing.\nD. The ordinance deprives the persons of the equal protection of the laws by impermissibly distinguishing between religiously inspired singing and all forms of singing.\n"

The ordinance deprives persons of their liberty without due process of law because the ordinance is not related to any legitimate community interest.\n\nThis argument is the weakest because the ordinance can be justified as serving a legitimate community interest in maintaining public order and preventing noise pollution during certain hours of the day. The time restrictions imposed by the ordinance (1:00 P.M. to 1:00 A.M.) suggest that the city is attempting to balance the rights of individuals to express themselves with the rights of others to enjoy peace and quiet during what might be considered reasonable hours. The restriction on singing and chanting by two or more persons when audible off the premises could be seen as a measure to prevent disturbances and maintain a peaceful environment for residents. Therefore, the argument that there is no legitimate community interest being served by the ordinance is less likely to succeed in court compared to the other arguments presented."
