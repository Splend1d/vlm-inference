Anatomically modern Homo sapiens have been around for at least 200,000 years based on the fossil record and genetic evidence. The earliest known fossils of our species date back to about 300,000 years ago in Morocco, but they show a mix of modern and archaic features. Fully anatomically modern humans appear in the fossil record around 200,000 years ago in Africa."
