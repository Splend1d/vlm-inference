The corona is a very tenuous and extended atmosphere of the Sun, consisting of plasma with a temperature of around 1-2 million degrees Celsius. This high temperature causes the plasma to emit X-rays and extreme ultraviolet radiation, but it is not bright enough in visible light to be seen against the much brighter photosphere (the visible surface of the Sun). During a total solar eclipse, the Moon blocks out the bright light of the photosphere, allowing us to see the fainter corona surrounding it."
