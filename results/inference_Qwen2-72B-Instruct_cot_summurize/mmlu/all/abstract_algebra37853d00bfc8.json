Notice that the cycle \\((2, 3)\\) is absorbed into the cycle \\((1, 2, 5, 4)\\) because they share the element 2. However, since these cycles are written as disjoint cycles, it implies that when applying \\(p\\), the action on 2 is determined by the first cycle that contains 2 from left to right. Therefore, the permutation \\(p\\) acts as follows:\n\n- \\(p(1) = 2\\)\n- \\(p(2) = 3\\) (because the second cycle takes precedence over the first one for 2)\n- \\(p(3) = 2\\) (since 3 goes back to 2 through the cycle \\((2, 3)\\))\n- \\(p(4) = 1\\) (from the cycle \\((1, 2, 5, 4)\\))\n- \\(p(5) = 4\\) (also from the cycle \\((1, 2, 5, 4)\\))\n\nSo, \\(p\\) can be rewritten as a single cycle: \\(p = (1, 2, 3, 5, 4)\\).\n\nThe order of \\(p\\) is the least common multiple (LCM) of the lengths of its disjoint cycles. In this case, since \\(p\\) has been simplified into a single cycle of length 5, the order of \\(p\\) is simply 5.\n\nNext, the order of \\(S_5\\) (the symmetric group of degree 5) is \\(5!\\) (factorial), which equals \\(5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 120\\).\n\nThe index of the subgroup generated by \\(p\\) in \\(S_5\\) is given by the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Index} = \\frac{\\text{Order of } S_5}{\\text{Order of } <p>} = \\frac{120}{5} = 24.\\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. 24."
