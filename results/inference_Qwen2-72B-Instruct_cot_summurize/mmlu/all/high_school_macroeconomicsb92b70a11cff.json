However, they must first set aside a certain percentage of these deposits as required reserves based on the reserve ratio. The remaining funds become excess reserves, which can be used for lending or other purposes. If the amount of checking deposits increases, and assuming the reserve ratio stays constant, the excess reserves in the banking system will also increase. \n\nThe other options would not necessarily lead to an increase in excess reserves:\n- A. Increasing the reserve ratio would require banks to hold more reserves, reducing their excess reserves.\n- C. Increasing the discount rate would make it more expensive for banks to borrow from the Federal Reserve, potentially reducing their excess reserves as they might need to use them instead of borrowing.\n- D. When the Fed sells Treasury securities to commercial banks, it removes reserves from the banking system, decreasing excess reserves."
