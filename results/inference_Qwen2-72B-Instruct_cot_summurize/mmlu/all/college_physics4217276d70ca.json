                    "text": "The relationship between the temperature of a blackbody and the wavelength at which its emission spectrum peaks is given by Wien's displacement law. The law states that the wavelength (\\(\\lambda_{max}\\)) at which the emission spectrum of a blackbody reaches its peak is inversely proportional to the absolute temperature (T) of the blackbody:\n\n\\[\n\\lambda_{max} \\cdot T = b\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(b\\) is a constant known as Wien's displacement constant, approximately equal to \\(2.89777 \\times 10^{-3}\\) m\u00b7K.\n\nGiven that the surface temperature of the Sun is about 6,000 K and the peak emission wavelength for the Sun is around 500 nm (which is equivalent to \\(5 \\times 10^{-7}\\) m), we can calculate Wien's displacement constant using these values:\n\n\\[\n5 \\times 10^{-7} \\, \\text{m} \\cdot 6000 \\, \\text{K} = 2.89777 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{m} \\cdot \\text{K}\n\\]\n\nNow, let's find the peak emission wavelength for a body with a surface temperature of 300 K:\n\n\\[\n\\lambda_{max} \\cdot 300 \\, \\text{K} = 2.89777 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{m} \\cdot \\text{K}\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\(\\lambda_{max}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\lambda_{max} = \\frac{2.89777 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{m} \\cdot \\text{K}}{300 \\, \\text{K}} \\approx 9.66 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{m}\n\\]\n\nThis value corresponds to infrared radiation, specifically in the range of 9.66 micrometers or 0.00966 millimeters. None of the answer choices exactly match this calculated value, but option C (10 mm) is closest when considering the order of magnitude and typical ranges for blackbody emission peaks. However, 10 mm is significantly larger than the calculated value, suggesting an error in the options provided or rounding in the calculation. Given the options, the correct choice based on the calculation would be:\n\nC. 10 mm\n\nBut it's important to note that this choice is not precise according to the calculated value. A more accurate choice would be closer to 9.66 micrometers or 0.00966 millimeters, which is not listed among the options."
