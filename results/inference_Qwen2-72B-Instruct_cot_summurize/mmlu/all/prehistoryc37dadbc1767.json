Recent studies have shown that non-African modern humans (those with European and Asian ancestry) carry some Neandertal DNA, which suggests interbreeding occurred between Neandertals and early modern humans outside of Africa. The percentage varies but generally falls within the range of 1% to 4%. This genetic contribution does not appear in African populations, suggesting that interbreeding occurred after modern humans left Africa."
