However, the concept remains the same: capacitance is inversely proportional to the length of the cable.\n\nSo, if you double the length (\\( d \\) in the formula), then capacitance will be halved because capacitance is inversely proportional to the distance between the plates (or the length of the cable in this context).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. one-half."
