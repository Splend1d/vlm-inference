The nominal interest rates fall.\n\nWhen the money supply increases, assuming money demand remains constant and downward sloping, there will be an excess supply of money at the initial interest rate. This excess supply puts downward pressure on the interest rate as lenders compete to lend out their excess funds. Borrowers take advantage of lower rates, increasing their demand for money until the new equilibrium is reached at a lower interest rate."
