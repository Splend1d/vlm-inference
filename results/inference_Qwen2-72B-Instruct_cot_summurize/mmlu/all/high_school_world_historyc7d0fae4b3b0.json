They have a great carrack which goes there every year and she brings from there every year about six hundred coins: and all this silver of Japan, and two hundred thousand coins more in silver which they bring yearly out of India, they employ to their great advantage in China: and they bring from there gold, musk, silk, copper, porcelains, and many other things very costly and gilded.\nWhen the Portuguese come to Canton in China to traffic, they must remain there but certain days: and when they come in at the gate of the city, they must enter their names in a book, and when they go out at night they must put out their names. They may not lie in the town all night, but must lie in their boats outside of the town. And, their time expired, if any man remains there, he is imprisoned.\"\nRalph Fitch, an account of his travels to the Far East, 1599 C.E.\nWhich of the following developments from the period 1750\u20131900 C.E. most directly undid the trade patterns mentioned in the first paragraph?\n\nA. The discovery of certain goods that the Chinese were interested in purchasing from European merchants\nB. Enlightenment revolutions in Europe and the Americas\nC. The Industrial Revolution\nD. The colonization of Africa\n"

The Industrial Revolution\n\nThe Industrial Revolution, which began in the late 18th century and continued through the 19th century, transformed the global economy by enabling mass production of goods in factories using machinery powered by steam engines. This led to a significant increase in the availability and variety of manufactured goods in Europe, which could then be traded with other parts of the world. As European countries became major producers of industrial goods, their trade patterns shifted, and they no longer relied as heavily on Asian goods like silk, porcelain, and spices. Instead, they exported large quantities of textiles, metals, and other factory-produced items to Asia and other regions. This shift in trade dynamics was a direct result of the changes brought about by the Industrial Revolution."
