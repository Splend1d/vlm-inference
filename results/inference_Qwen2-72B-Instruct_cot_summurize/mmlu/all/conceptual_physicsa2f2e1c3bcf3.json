The other terms you mentioned refer to different aspects of wave motion:\n\n- Frequency is the number of cycles or oscillations per unit of time, usually measured in Hertz (Hz).\n- Wavelength is the distance between two corresponding points on successive waves.\n- Amplitude is the maximum displacement of the pendulum from its rest position.\n\nIn the context of a pendulum, only the period directly relates to the time it takes for the pendulum to swing back and forth."
