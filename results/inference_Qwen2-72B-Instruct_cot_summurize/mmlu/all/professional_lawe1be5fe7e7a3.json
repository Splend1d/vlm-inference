In this case, the builder has a claim against the homeowner for breach of contract.\n\nThe builder has expended $9,000 on labor and $1,000 on materials for a total of $10,000. However, the builder also expected to earn a profit from the job. The total contract price was $20,000, and it would have cost the builder an additional $5,000 to complete the project. This means the builder expected to make a profit of $5,000 (the difference between the contract price and the total cost of completing the project).\n\nHowever, the builder mitigated their damages by reselling the unused materials for $1,000. This amount should be deducted from the total damages.\n\nSo, the builder\u2019s damages would be calculated as follows:\n\nTotal cost expended by the builder: $10,000 Expected profit: $5,000 Less: Loss avoided by resale of unused materials: -$1,000 Total damages: $14,000\n\nTherefore, the builder is likely to recover $14,000 from the homeowner in a suit for breach of contract."
