Here's why the others are incorrect:\n\nA. Brain growth is actually faster during early childhood, not adolescence. While the brain does undergo significant development and refinement in adolescence, particularly in areas like the prefrontal cortex which is involved in decision making and impulse control, the rapid growth phase has already passed by this stage.\n\nB. Peak bone mass typically occurs later, often in the late teens to early twenties for most individuals. Bone density continues to increase until this point, with the growth spurt of puberty playing a significant role in this process.\n\nD. Type 2 obesity-related diabetes is unfortunately not a rare problem in adolescence anymore. The rise in childhood obesity has led to an increase in cases of type 2 diabetes in adolescents. This condition was once considered almost exclusively adult-onset, but now adolescents are being diagnosed more frequently due to poor diet, lack of exercise, and obesity."
