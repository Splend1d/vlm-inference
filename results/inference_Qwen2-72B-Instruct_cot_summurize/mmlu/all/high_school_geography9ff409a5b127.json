Complementarity.\n\nComplementarity refers to the tendency of businesses to locate near each other when they can benefit from shared customer traffic. New stores opening around a large shopping mall are likely doing so because they can take advantage of the foot traffic generated by the mall, which benefits their business. This is an example of complementarity in action.\n\nGravity concept (A) is a theory that larger cities will attract more people and businesses due to their size and resources. Distance decay (B) is the idea that the interaction between two places decreases as the distance between them increases. Movement bias (D) is the tendency for people or goods to move along established routes rather than taking new or unfamiliar paths. While these concepts may also play a role in the location decisions of businesses, they do not specifically explain why new stores would open around a large shopping mall."
