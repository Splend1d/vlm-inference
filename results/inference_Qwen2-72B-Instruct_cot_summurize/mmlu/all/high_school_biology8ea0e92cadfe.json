The survivors, in this instance, are the heaviest males and females, which implies that the trait of being heavy has been disproportionately represented in the surviving population.\n\nGiven that weight is heritable and assuming it follows a binomial distribution (though typically, such traits follow a normal distribution due to multiple genes and environmental factors), the offspring of these heavy survivors would also tend to inherit genes associated with heavier body weight.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. a higher mean weight compared with members of the original population\n\nThis is because the average weight of the original population would have included a range of lighter individuals who did not survive the eruption. The new population's mean weight will be shifted towards the heavier end of the distribution because only the heavier individuals survived to reproduce."
