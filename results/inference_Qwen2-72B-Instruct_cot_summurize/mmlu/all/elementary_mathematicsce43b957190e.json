The options provided include centimeter, which is a unit of length; cup, which is a unit of volume; and gram and pound, which are units of mass or weight. Therefore, the most appropriate unit for measuring the capacity of a jar is the cup. Other common units for capacity or volume could include liters, gallons, quarts, etc., but those are not listed among the options."
