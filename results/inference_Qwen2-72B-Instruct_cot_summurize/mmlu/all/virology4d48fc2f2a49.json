However, vaccination and hygiene practices are the primary methods used for controlling the spread of influenza.\n\nVaccination is particularly important for high-risk groups such as the elderly, young children, pregnant women, and individuals with certain medical conditions that put them at higher risk for complications from influenza. It is also recommended for healthcare workers to prevent the spread of the virus within these facilities.\n\nHygiene measures include frequent handwashing, use of personal protective equipment (PPE) like masks and gloves, and maintaining clean environments. These practices help reduce the transmission of the virus between patients and staff.\n\nAntiviral drugs can be used prophylactically to prevent infection or therapeutically to treat those who have already contracted the virus, especially in high-risk populations. They are not the primary method of control but can be an important part of an overall strategy.\n\nHumanized monoclonal antibodies (D) are a newer treatment option for severe cases of influenza or for prophylaxis in individuals who cannot receive the vaccine due to allergies or other contraindications. While they may play a role in managing influenza, they are not widely used as a primary method of control in risk sectors."
