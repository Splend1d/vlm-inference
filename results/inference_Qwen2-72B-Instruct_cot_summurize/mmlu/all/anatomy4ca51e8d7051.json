The submental lymph nodes receive lymph from the anterior two-thirds of the tongue, including the tip, and the floor of the mouth. The submandibular lymph nodes typically drain lymph from the posterior part of the tongue and the oral cavity. However, it's important to note that lymphatic drainage can have some individual variation."
