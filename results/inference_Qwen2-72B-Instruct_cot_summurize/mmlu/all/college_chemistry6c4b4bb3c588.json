                    "text": "In NMR spectroscopy, the relative intensity of peaks is proportional to the number of equivalent protons giving rise to that peak. However, it's also important to consider how many protons each molecule has in its structure that is contributing to the overall signal.\n\nDMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide) has 3 equivalent methyl protons (-CH3) that will give a signal in the 1H NMR spectrum.\nAcetonitrile (CH3CN) has 3 equivalent methyl protons (-CH3) that will also give a signal in the 1H NMR spectrum.\n\nGiven that the relative intensities of the lines for DMSO and AN are \u03b1 and 3\u03b1, respectively, this indicates that there are three times as many protons contributing to the signal from acetonitrile compared to the signal from DMSO. However, since both molecules contribute an equal number of protons (3) to their respective signals, the difference in intensity is directly related to the concentration of the molecules.\n\nLet's denote the concentration of DMSO as [DMSO] and the concentration of AN as [AN]. The ratio of the number of protons contributing to the signal is 1:3, but since they both have the same number of protons contributing to the signal, the ratio of their concentrations must be what leads to this intensity ratio.\n\nIf we assume that [DMSO] = x and [AN] = y, then the ratio of their concentrations would be x:y. Given the intensities \u03b1 and 3\u03b1, and knowing that the intensity is proportional to the concentration of the contributing protons, we can write:\n\n\\[ \\frac{\\alpha}{3\\alpha} = \\frac{x}{y} \\]\n\nSimplifying this gives us:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{x}{y} \\]\n\nThus, the ratio of [DMSO]:[AN] is 1:3.\n\nThe correct answer is B. 1:3."
