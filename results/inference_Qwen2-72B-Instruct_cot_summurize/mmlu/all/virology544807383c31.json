Replicates in the nucleus\n\nMany viruses, including DNA viruses such as herpesviruses, adenoviruses, and poxviruses, and certain RNA viruses like influenza viruses, replicate in the host cell's nucleus. This allows them to utilize the host cell's machinery for DNA or RNA synthesis and processing.\n\nA. Cytoplasmic replication and 'snatched caps' are used as primers for RNA transcription - This strategy is used by some RNA viruses, such as paramyxoviruses, which replicate in the cytoplasm and use 'cap-snatching' to prime their mRNA synthesis. However, not all viruses use this method.\n\nB. Replicates in cytoplasmic tubules - While some viruses may form structures in the cytoplasm for replication (like the factories formed by some bacteriophages or the viroplasms of reoviruses), this is not a universal strategy among viruses.\n\nC. Extracellular replication - Viruses do not replicate extracellularly; they require a host cell to replicate."
