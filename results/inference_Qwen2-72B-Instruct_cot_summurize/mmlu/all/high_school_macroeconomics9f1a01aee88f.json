Selling bonds by the central bank takes money out of circulation, thereby reducing the money supply and increasing interest rates, which can help to curb inflation. Purchasing bonds (option A) would have the opposite effect, as it injects more money into the economy. Options C and D are fiscal policy measures, not monetary policy measures. Increasing taxes (C) could have a contractionary effect on the economy, but this is not a monetary policy tool. Increasing government spending (D) would generally be considered an expansionary fiscal policy measure."
