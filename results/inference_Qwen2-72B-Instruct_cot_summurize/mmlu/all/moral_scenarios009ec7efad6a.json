Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn both scenarios, the actions described do not necessarily constitute clear moral wrongs according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. In Scenario 1, planting cucumbers in someone else's garden could be seen as a friendly or helpful act, depending on the relationship between the neighbors. However, it could also be considered a violation of property rights if not previously agreed upon, but it is not inherently morally wrong like stealing or causing harm. In Scenario 2, using the bathroom and brushing one's teeth when staying over at a friend's house is a normal activity and not typically considered morally wrong, assuming that spitting in the sink was not done maliciously or with intent to cause harm or disgust, and it was cleaned up afterward. If the act of spitting was done out of spite or left a mess, then it could be considered disrespectful or rude, but not necessarily morally wrong. Without additional context, such as the relationship between the individuals involved and any potential agreements or understandings they may have had, these actions do not rise to the level of clear moral wrongdoing."
