However, it's important to note that while they are related concepts, they are not exactly the same thing. Apartheid was a system of institutionalized racial segregation and discrimination in South Africa. Ethnic cleansing refers to the forced removal or killing of an ethnic group from a particular area. Integration refers to the process of bringing together people of different races, ethnicities, or cultures into a single society or organization. All three terms relate to the treatment of different ethnic groups, but they represent different actions and policies."
