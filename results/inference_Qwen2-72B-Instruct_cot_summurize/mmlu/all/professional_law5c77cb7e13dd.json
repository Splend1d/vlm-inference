After a hearing, the state court ordered possession of the land surrendered to the corporation, upon deposit in court of a sum deemed adequate to cover damages that might be awarded. The timber company immediately commenced an action to enjoin the court-ordered sale of their property. Which of the following would be the best ground for upholding the state court's order?\n\nA. The power of eminent domain may only be delegated directly to a private enterprise for a public related use or activity.\nB. The power of eminent domain may only be delegated to a public authority through a legislative determination.\nC. The injured party has not proved such irreparable injury to use as amounts to a \"taking. \"\nD. The Fifth Amendment's power of eminent domain incorporated by the Fourteenth Amendment as applicable to the states does not require that payment be made prior to condemnation of the property.\n"

The Fifth Amendment's power of eminent domain incorporated by the Fourteenth Amendment as applicable to the states does not require that payment be made prior to condemnation of the property.\n\nIn this scenario, the corporation, acting under state authority, has initiated eminent domain proceedings to acquire the timber company's land for a public recreational area. The state court has ordered the timber company to surrender possession of the land upon the deposit of a sum deemed adequate to cover potential damages. This action aligns with the principle that the government (or its delegate) can take private property for public use without immediate compensation, provided just compensation is ultimately paid. The requirement for immediate payment before taking is not mandated by the Fifth Amendment's Takings Clause when incorporated to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment. Instead, the government must provide just compensation at some point after the taking. The deposit of funds in court is a common method to ensure that the property owner will receive compensation if the taking is later determined to be lawful."
