Thule.\n\nThe Thule people were a culture that emerged around 1000 AD in the region of present-day Alaska and then migrated eastward across the Arctic, eventually reaching Greenland by around 1200 AD. They are known for their use of large skin-covered boats called umiaks and kayaks, which allowed them to hunt marine mammals such as whales and walruses. The Thule people also developed advanced techniques for building igloos and other structures from snow and ice, and they were skilled at crafting tools and weapons from bone, ivory, and stone. Their migration and expansion across the Arctic is considered one of the most significant cultural developments in the history of the region."
