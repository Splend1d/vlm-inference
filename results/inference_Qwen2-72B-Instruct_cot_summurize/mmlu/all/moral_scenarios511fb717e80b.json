In scenario 2, shopping for cheap items at the Salvation Army is not inherently wrong, especially if the intention is to support their charitable efforts. However, if one is financially capable and buys from the Salvation Army solely to save money instead of supporting their cause or buying from them when in need, this could be seen as taking advantage of a resource meant for those less fortunate. But based on the information provided, scenario 2 does not indicate any wrongdoing."
