This gives them their \"polyunsaturated\" status, meaning they have more than one site of unsaturation (double bond) in their hydrocarbon chain. The cis configuration causes a bent or kinked shape in the molecule, which prevents packing into a solid form at room temperature, thus keeping the oil liquid."
