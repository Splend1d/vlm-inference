The interarytenoid muscles (including the lateral and medial ones), which are innervated by the recurrent laryngeal nerve, are responsible for adducting (closing) and abducting (opening) the vocal cords.\n\nWhen the recurrent laryngeal nerve is damaged, the interarytenoid muscles become weak or paralyzed, preventing proper adduction and abduction of the vocal cords. However, since the cricothyroid muscle remains intact, it can still tense the vocal cords. As a result, the vocal fold on the injured side appears tensed and in an intermediate position between adduction and abduction."
