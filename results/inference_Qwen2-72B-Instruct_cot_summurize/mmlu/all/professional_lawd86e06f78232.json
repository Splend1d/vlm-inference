The witness worked with the police a few days later to try and create a composite sketch of the purse snatcher. This was used by the police to capture the purported purse snatcher. The witness died several days before the trial. When the witness's drawing was offered by the prosecution as evidence at trial, is the trial judge likely to accept it as admissible evidence?\n\nA. Yes, because the police took it and used it to find someone, therefore it must be an accurate representation of the perpetrator; the exhibit must be admitted.\nB. Yes, because it is in the nature of the written recollection of the decedent at a time close to the crime and it therefore has testimonial reliability.\nC. No, because the defense had no opportunity to cross-examine the witness under oath about the drawing prior to her death and such sketches are inherently unreliable in any event.\nD. No, because it was drawn up days after the event and is in violation of the best evidence rule.\n"

No, because the defense had no opportunity to cross-examine the witness under oath about the drawing prior to her death and such sketches are inherently unreliable in any event.\n\nThis situation involves the hearsay rule and the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. The witness's drawing is considered hearsay because it is an out-of-court statement offered for the truth of the matter asserted (that the drawing accurately represents the appearance of the perpetrator). Under the hearsay rule, such evidence is generally inadmissible unless an exception applies.\n\nAdditionally, the Confrontation Clause guarantees the right of the accused to confront witnesses against them. Since the witness who created the drawing has died and cannot be cross-examined, admitting the drawing would potentially violate this right.\n\nWhile the drawing may have some probative value, its admission could be challenged on grounds of reliability and the inability to cross-examine the witness. The court would need to weigh these factors in determining whether to admit the drawing as evidence.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because it assumes that the drawing's accuracy is guaranteed by the police involvement, which is not necessarily true. Answer B is also incorrect because while the drawing might be a contemporaneous record, it still does not meet the criteria for admissibility under the hearsay exceptions or the Confrontation Clause. Answer D is incorrect because the best evidence rule is not applicable here; it typically deals with the admissibility of original documents versus copies or summaries."
