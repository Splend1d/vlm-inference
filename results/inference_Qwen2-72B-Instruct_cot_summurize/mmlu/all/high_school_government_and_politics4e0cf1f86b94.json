The U.S. Constitution divides power among three branches of government (legislative, executive, and judicial) and further divides legislative power between two houses of Congress. This system of checks and balances helps to ensure that no single branch or entity can easily dominate the others, promoting stability and preventing rapid shifts in policy. While cooperation between the two major political parties (A) can contribute to stability when it occurs, partisan conflict often leads to gridlock rather than stability. Judicial activism (B) refers to judges making decisions based on personal or political considerations rather than existing law, which can lead to instability if it results in frequent overturning of laws and policies. Affirmative action programs (D) are specific policies aimed at increasing opportunities for historically excluded groups, and they do not inherently contribute to the overall stability of public policy."
