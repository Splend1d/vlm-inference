At the man's trial, the owner of the liquor store was called to testify. He admitted that he was unable to identify the man, who now had a shaven head, as the robber. The prosecuting attorney then handed the owner six photographs. He proposed to testify, over defense objections, that he had previously told the prosecuting attorney that picture #4, admittedly a picture of the man before he shaved his head, was a picture of the person who robbed his store. The owner's proffered testimony should be adjudged\n\nA. admissible as a prior identification by the witness.\nB. admissible as past recollection recorded.\nC. inadmissible, because it is hearsay not within any recognized exception.\nD. inadmissible, because it is a violation of the man's right of confrontation.\n"

This type of evidence is often admissible under the hearsay exception for prior consistent statements offered to rebut a charge of recent fabrication or improper influence or motive. In this case, since the witness is unable to identify the defendant due to the change in appearance, the prosecution can use the prior identification to support the witness's credibility and to counter any suggestion that the identification is a recent fabrication or influenced by improper motives."
