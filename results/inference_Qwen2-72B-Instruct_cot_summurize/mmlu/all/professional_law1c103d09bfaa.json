Based on the evidence presented at these hearings, a senator wishes to introduce a bill providing free medical and hospital care for all citizens 70 years of age and older. The senator, however, intends to include a provision in the bill denying such medical and hospital care benefits to aliens (in the same age category) unless they have been legally admitted for permanent U. S. residency. The senator has asked for your advice regarding his proposed bill. You are understandably concerned about the legality of the aliens proviso. Which of the following is the strongest argument in support of the constitutionality of the provision disqualifying aliens from receiving such medical and hospital benefits?\n\nA. Due to the fact that the medical and hospital benefits will be paid for by the government, they are a privilege not a right and, therefore, are not within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment.\nB. The disqualifying provision does not unduly burden either interstate commerce or the right of aliens to travel freely from state to state.\nC. The principles of equal protection apply against the states and not against the federal government.\nD. The disqualifying provision is reasonably related to legitimate congressional objectives under its immigration, citizenship, and spending powers.\n"

The disqualifying provision is reasonably related to legitimate congressional objectives under its immigration, citizenship, and spending powers.\n\nThis argument acknowledges that Congress has the authority to make rules concerning naturalization and immigration, as well as the power to spend money for the general welfare. By limiting the benefits to citizens and legal permanent residents, the provision can be seen as a reasonable exercise of these powers, aimed at prioritizing resources for those who have established a legal status in the country. This rationale is more likely to withstand constitutional scrutiny than arguments based on the idea that government-provided benefits are mere privileges or that the equal protection clause does not apply to the federal government."
