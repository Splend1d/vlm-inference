This is because the behavior of electrons at the quantum scale is described by wave-particle duality, where they exhibit properties of both particles and waves. The wave model is particularly useful for understanding the quantization of electron energy levels due to the Schr\u00f6dinger wave equation, which describes how the quantum state of a physical system changes with time."
