The defendant timely moved for postconviction relief under the Sixth Amendment on the ground that his attorney had provided ineffective assistance of counsel. The trial judge, after a hearing, found that the attorney had performed deficiently by failing to raise a proper objection that would have resulted in exclusion of important prosecution evidence. What more, if anything, must the trial court find in order to sustain the defendant's Sixth Amendment claim?\n\nA. Nothing more, because the unjustifiable failure to object to important prosecution evidence is structural error.\nB. That the attorney was court-appointed and not privately retained.\nC. That there is a reasonable probability that the trial's outcome would have been different if the attorney had objected.\nD. That there is clear and convincing evidence that the trial's outcome would have been different if the attorney had objected.\n"

That there is a reasonable probability that the trial's outcome would have been different if the attorney had objected.\n\nIn order to sustain a Sixth Amendment claim for ineffective assistance of counsel, the defendant must show not only that the attorney's performance was deficient (which the trial judge has already determined), but also that this deficiency prejudiced the defense. This means the defendant must demonstrate that there is a reasonable probability that, but for the attorney's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. A \"reasonable probability\" is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome. This standard was established by the U.S. Supreme Court in Strickland v. Washington (1984)."
