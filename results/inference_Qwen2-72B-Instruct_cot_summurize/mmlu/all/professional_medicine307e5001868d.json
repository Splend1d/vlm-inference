The wheezing indicates bronchoconstriction, which can be relieved by a \u03b22-adrenergic agonist. These medications work by stimulating \u03b22 receptors in the lungs, causing bronchodilation and relieving airway constriction. Examples of \u03b22-adrenergic agonists include albuterol (Ventolin) and salmeterol (Serevent).\n\n\u03b11-Adrenergic agonists (option A) would cause vasoconstriction and may be used to treat nasal congestion or low blood pressure, but they are not typically used for allergic reactions or asthma.\n\u03b12-Adrenergic agonists (option B) have sedative effects and are used to treat conditions like glaucoma, hypertension, and anxiety; they are not used for bronchoconstriction.\n\u03b11-Adrenergic antagonists (option C) are used to treat conditions like hypertension and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH); they do not relieve bronchoconstriction."
