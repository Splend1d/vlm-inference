                    "text": "In this problem, we need to consider both conservation of energy and conservation of momentum. Let's start with the conservation of energy.\n\nThe initial energy of the system comes from the photon, which has an energy given by \\(E = hf\\), where \\(h\\) is Planck's constant and \\(f\\) is the frequency of the photon. However, since we don't know the frequency, we'll express the energy in terms of the rest mass energy of the particles involved.\n\nBefore the interaction, the total energy is just the energy of the photon. After the interaction, the total energy is the sum of the rest mass energies of the three particles (two electrons and one positron) plus their kinetic energies. Since all three particles have the same mass \\(m\\) and move at the same speed, their kinetic energies are the same.\n\nLet \\(E_k\\) be the kinetic energy of each particle after the interaction. Then, the total energy after the interaction is:\n\n\\[3mc^2 + 3E_k\\]\n\nBy conservation of energy, the energy of the photon before the interaction must equal the total energy after the interaction:\n\n\\[E_{photon} = 3mc^2 + 3E_k\\]\n\nHowever, because the particles move off at equal speeds, their momenta will also be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction for the electrons and positron, ensuring conservation of momentum. Since the electron was initially at rest and no external forces acted on the system, the net momentum before the interaction is zero. Therefore, the momenta of the three particles after the interaction must also add up to zero. This implies that the total momentum contributed by the kinetic energies cancels out, and thus, the total energy after the interaction reduces to just the rest mass energy of the three particles.\n\nSo, the energy of the photon must equal the total rest mass energy of the three particles:\n\n\\[E_{photon} = 3mc^2\\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. 3mc^2"
