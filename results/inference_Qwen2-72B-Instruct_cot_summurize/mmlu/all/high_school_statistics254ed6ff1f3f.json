The z-score is a measure of how many standard deviations an element is from the mean.\n\nGiven:\n- Mean (\\(\\mu\\)) = 650\n- Standard Deviation (\\(\\sigma\\)) = 45\n- We're interested in the range between 700 and 740\n\nFirst, calculate the z-scores for both 700 and 740:\n\nFor a score of 700:\n\\[z_1 = \\frac{X - \\mu}{\\sigma} = \\frac{700 - 650}{45} = \\frac{50}{45} = 1.11\\]\n\nFor a score of 740:\n\\[z_2 = \\frac{X - \\mu}{\\sigma} = \\frac{740 - 650}{45} = \\frac{90}{45} = 2\\]\n\nNow, we need to find the area under the standard normal curve between \\(z_1 = 1.11\\) and \\(z_2 = 2\\). This can be done using a z-table or a calculator with a built-in function for the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the standard normal distribution.\n\nUsing a z-table or calculator:\n- The probability that a score falls at or below \\(z_2 = 2\\) is approximately 0.9772.\n- The probability that a score falls at or below \\(z_1 = 1.11\\) is approximately 0.8665.\n\nThe percentage of applicants considered (those scoring above 700) who have scores below 740 is the difference between these two probabilities:\n\\[P(700 < X < 740) = P(X < 740) - P(X < 700) = 0.9772 - 0.8665 = 0.1107\\]\n\nHowever, this calculation gives us the percentage of all applicants who score between 700 and 740. Since we are interested in the percentage of applicants considered (i.e., those scoring above 700), we need to adjust our calculation.\n\nThe percentage of all applicants who score above 700 is \\(1 - P(X < 700)\\):\n\\[P(X > 700) = 1 - P(X < 700) = 1 - 0.8665 = 0.1335\\]\n\nTherefore, the percentage of applicants considered (those scoring above 700) who have scores below 740 is:\n\\[\\frac{0.1107}{0.1335} \\approx 0.829 \\text{ or } 82.9\\%\\]\n\nSo, the correct answer is C. 82.9%."
