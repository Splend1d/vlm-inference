(i) specify exactly what they mean by \"unnaturalness\" and (ii) explain why unnaturalness (so defined) matters morally.\n\nIn other words, for the argument against homosexuality based on its supposed \"unnaturalness\" to hold any ethical significance, opponents must first clearly define what they mean when they use the term \"unnatural.\" They must then provide a compelling reason as to why something being \"unnatural\" should be considered ethically problematic or morally wrong.\n\nCorvino argues that many who make this claim fail to adequately address these points, often relying on vague or circular definitions of \"unnaturalness,\" and failing to demonstrate how \"unnaturalness\" itself constitutes a moral failing. He contends that unless these two conditions are met, the \"unnaturalness\" argument lacks the necessary substance to serve as a valid ethical critique of homosexuality."
