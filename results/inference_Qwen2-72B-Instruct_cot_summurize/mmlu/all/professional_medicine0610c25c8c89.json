Until now, the patient's postoperative course had been unremarkable and he has been treated with low-dose morphine for pain control. Medical history is remarkable for type 2 diabetes mellitus controlled with metformin and diet. Vital signs now are temperature 36.8\u00b0C (98.2\u00b0F), pulse 80/min and regular, respirations 20/min, and blood pressure 150/92 mm Hg. The surgical incision appears clean and well approximated without abnormal erythema or swelling. The left lower extremity and foot appear pale. Palpation of the left lower extremity discloses a strong femoral pulse, a weak popliteal pulse, and a cool, pulseless foot. Which of the following is the most appropriate management?\n\nA. Bedside compartment pressure measurements\nB. Doppler ultrasonography of the left lower extremity\nC. Intra-arterial tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) therapy\nD. Intraoperative angiography\n"

Doppler ultrasonography of the left lower extremity.\n\nThe patient's sudden onset of increasing pain in the left foot, along with the cool, pulseless foot and weak popliteal pulse, suggests an acute arterial occlusion distal to the bypass graft. Doppler ultrasonography can help identify the location and extent of any arterial occlusion, which is crucial information for planning further treatment.\n\nCompartment pressure measurements (option A) are more relevant for diagnosing compartment syndrome, which typically presents with pain out of proportion to physical findings, paresthesias, and muscle weakness, but not necessarily with a pulseless foot.\n\nIntra-arterial tPA therapy (option C) might be considered if an acute thrombotic occlusion is identified, but it should not be initiated before confirming the diagnosis through imaging studies like Doppler ultrasonography.\n\nIntraoperative angiography (option D) is an invasive diagnostic procedure that may be performed during surgery if Doppler ultrasonography confirms an occlusion and surgical intervention is deemed necessary. It is not the initial test of choice for diagnosing the cause of the patient's symptoms."
