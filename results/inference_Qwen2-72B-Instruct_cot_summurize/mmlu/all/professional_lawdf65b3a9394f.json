The woman discovered that the service was selling her personal profile information, and the information pertaining to thousands of other members, to third party purchasers for tracking of their Internet activities and buying habits. In her class action breach of contract action against the service, she alleged two theories of damages. First, she contended that she and the class members suffered \"embarrassment and humiliation\" from the disclosure, and second, that she and the others must be compensated for the market value of the information seized. Will the court likely recognize these allegations as sufficient to state a claim for breach of contract?\n\nA. Yes, because the service breached the duty of good faith inherent in every contract.\nB. Yes, because these are common types of damages that are authorized in breach of contract cases.\nC. No, because Internet laws protect absolutely all communications and downloads of this nature as part of the service's guaranteed scope of free speech rights.\nD. No, because humiliation is not an item of damages in a breach of contract case, and the unauthorized collection of personal data does not establish an economic loss.\n"

No, because humiliation is not an item of damages in a breach of contract case, and the unauthorized collection of personal data does not establish an economic loss.\n\nWhile it is true that the service might have breached the duty of good faith inherent in every contract (which could be a valid legal argument), the question specifically asks about the sufficiency of the damages alleged. Humiliation and embarrassment are generally not recoverable in contract law unless they can be linked to some form of pecuniary loss. The market value of the information seized could potentially be a valid form of economic loss if it can be proven that the information has a quantifiable monetary value and that the defendant profited from its sale or use. However, simply stating that the information has a market value without providing specifics on how that value can be calculated or how the plaintiff and class members were economically harmed may not be sufficient to state a claim for damages in a breach of contract action. \n\nIt's important to note that the answer provided here focuses on the sufficiency of the damages alleged, rather than the validity of the breach of contract claim itself. The latter would depend on the terms of the contract and whether the service violated those terms by selling the personal profile information."
