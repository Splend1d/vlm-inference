Therefore, states with larger populations have more electoral votes, making them more attractive to presidential candidates who want to maximize their chances of winning the election. Battleground states, or swing states, also receive a lot of attention because they are seen as up for grabs and can sway the outcome of the election. However, candidates still tend to focus more on states with larger populations because of the greater number of electoral votes at stake."
