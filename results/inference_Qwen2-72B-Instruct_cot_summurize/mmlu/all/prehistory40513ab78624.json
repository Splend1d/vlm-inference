The most famous of these, the Lord of Sip\u00e1n tomb, was actually discovered under quite different circumstances.\n\nIn 1987, a team of archaeologists led by Dr. Walter Alva began excavations at the Huaca Rajada site near Sip\u00e1n in northern Peru after looters had dug a tunnel into one of the tombs. This initial looting alerted authorities and archaeologists to the presence of significant archaeological remains at the site. The team then worked quickly to secure and excavate the area, leading to the uncovering of one of the richest and most intact burials of the Moche culture, which included the Lord of Sip\u00e1n, a high-ranking Moche priest-warrior.\n\nSo, while option A (thieves raiding the tombs were caught by the police) is close, it was actually the initial looting activity that led to the discovery rather than the thieves being caught. The subsequent involvement of law enforcement and archaeologists was crucial in preventing further damage and allowing for the proper excavation and documentation of the site."
