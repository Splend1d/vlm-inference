                    "text": "The correct answer is:\n\nA. This November, the average donation is $155.\n\nExplanation:\n\nOption A is correct because it accurately reflects the information provided: the average (mean) donation is $155.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the average does not imply anything about the distribution of the data; 50% of donations being more than the average would only be true if the data were symmetrically distributed around the mean, which we cannot assume based on the information given.\n\nOption C is incorrect because it suggests an unrealistically wide 95% confidence interval. The formula for calculating a 95% confidence interval for the mean is \\(\\bar{x} \\pm Z_{\\alpha/2} \\times \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}}\\), where \\(\\bar{x}\\) is the sample mean, \\(Z_{\\alpha/2}\\) is the Z-score corresponding to the desired confidence level (1.96 for 95% confidence), \\(s\\) is the standard deviation, and \\(n\\) is the sample size. Plugging in the numbers from the question, we get:\n\\[155 \\pm 1.96 \\times \\frac{32}{\\sqrt{100}} = 155 \\pm 1.96 \\times 3.2 = 155 \\pm 6.272\\]\n\nThis gives us a 95% confidence interval of approximately $148.728 to $161.272, which is much narrower than the range given in option C.\n\nOption D is the closest to being correct, but it's not worded as precisely as it could be. It correctly calculates the approximate 95% confidence interval for the mean donation based on the given data. However, since the exact calculations give a slightly different range ($148.728 to $161.272), option D is technically not as precise as it could be, but it is the best choice among the options provided when considering the context and the level of detail typically expected in such questions."
