However, it can become thicker, yellow, and/or clouded due to conditions such as cataracts or the natural aging process. The lens is enclosed in a capsule and maintains its shape through the turgor pressure of the aqueous humor, but it does not \"fill with fluid\" in the sense that its internal composition changes to include more liquid."
