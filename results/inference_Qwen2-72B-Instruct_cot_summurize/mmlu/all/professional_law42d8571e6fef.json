This relationship gives the landlord certain rights against the tenant, such as the right to collect rent and enforce the terms of the lease. When a tenant subleases the property to a third party, the sublessee does not have privity of estate with the original landlord; instead, the sublessee has privity of estate with the original tenant (the sublessor).\n\nIn this case, since the cousin (sublessee) defaulted on the rental payments, the landlord cannot directly recover the past rent due from the cousin because there is no privity of estate between them. The landlord's recourse would be against the original tenant (who subleased the property), as the original tenant is still responsible for the rent under the terms of their lease with the landlord. The original tenant could then seek to recover the rent from their cousin (the sublessee)."
