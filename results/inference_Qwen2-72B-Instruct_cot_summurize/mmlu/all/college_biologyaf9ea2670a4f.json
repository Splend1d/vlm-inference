In this case, the birds could potentially nest both in treetops and on cliff ledges (their fundamental niche), but due to the presence of a more aggressive bird species on the cliff ledges, they are restricted to using the treetops. Thus, they are only utilizing their realistic niche, which is determined by the competitive exclusion on the cliff ledges."
