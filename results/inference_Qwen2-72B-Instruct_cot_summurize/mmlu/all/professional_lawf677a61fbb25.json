No, because the defendant may not prove his good character by specific instances of good conduct.\nC. Yes, because a criminal defendant may prove his good character as a basis for inferring conduct.\nD. Yes, because, by accusing the defendant of being a thief, the prosecution has put his character in issue.\n"

                    "text": "The witness's testimony is potentially admissible under certain circumstances, but it depends on how the evidence is presented and the rules of evidence in the jurisdiction where the trial is taking place. Generally, character evidence is not admissible to prove that a person acted in accordance with that character on a particular occasion (Rule 404(a) of the Federal Rules of Evidence). However, there are exceptions.\n\nIn this case, the defendant is attempting to introduce evidence of a pertinent trait of character (honesty/integrity) as a defense. Under Rule 404(a)(2), a criminal defendant may offer evidence of a pertinent trait of character, and the prosecution may rebut with evidence to the contrary. The defendant's past behavior as an army supply sergeant who resisted opportunities for black marketeering could be relevant to show that he is less likely to commit theft.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the evidence must be relevant to the crime charged. In this case, if the defendant is charged with theft, evidence of his honesty in a different context (as an army supply sergeant) might be considered relevant if it directly pertains to the defendant's propensity for committing theft.\n\nThus, the answer would be:\n\nC. Yes, because a criminal defendant may prove his good character as a basis for inferring conduct. However, it should be noted that the court will have to determine whether the probative value of this evidence outweighs its potential prejudicial effect (under Rule 403) and whether the evidence is indeed relevant to the case at hand.\n\nIt's also worth mentioning that while the prosecution hasn't necessarily \"put the defendant's character in issue\" simply by charging him with theft, the defendant can still introduce character evidence under Rule 404(a)(2). So, option D is not entirely accurate in this context."
