Feeding your cat is an act of care and responsibility, while praying for the health of a loved one is a personal spiritual practice and expression of hope and concern. Both actions can be seen as positive or neutral, not morally wrong. However, it's worth noting that if feeding your cat only one small bowl of food each day were insufficient for its nutritional needs, then it could potentially be considered neglectful or harmful; but based on the information provided, there's no indication that this is the case."
