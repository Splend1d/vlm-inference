It includes not only the physical layout of the area but also personal experiences, emotions, and memories associated with different places. Mental maps are used by everyone to guide their daily movements and activities, including getting to school in the morning. While physical maps like road maps and atlases can be useful for planning routes or unfamiliar journeys, mental maps are the primary tool for navigating familiar environments."
