These changes can modify gene expression without altering the DNA sequence itself (option B). This allows for the same genetic code to result in different physical traits or phenotypes depending on environmental factors and life experiences (option C). Therefore, all three options are correct and epigenetic changes play a crucial role in understanding how early experiences can impact later health."
