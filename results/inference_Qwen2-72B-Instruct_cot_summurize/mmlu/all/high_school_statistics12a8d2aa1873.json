In repeated samplings of the same size, 95 percent of the intervals constructed will contain the true mean weight of the oranges of this variety.\n\nExplanation:\n\nA 95% confidence interval means that if we were to repeat the sampling process many times, and construct a confidence interval each time, approximately 95% of those intervals would capture the true population mean. This directly corresponds to statement A.\n\nStatement B is incorrect because it refers to the \"sampled mean weight,\" which is not relevant to the concept of a confidence interval for estimating the true population mean.\n\nStatements C and D are incorrect because they misinterpret the confidence interval as a statement about individual observations rather than an estimate of the population mean. The confidence interval does not imply anything about the proportion of individual oranges within that range, only about the likely location of the true mean weight of the population."
