                    "text": "Let's analyze each statement:\n\nI. The ball\u2019s speed is zero at the highest point.\nThis statement is true. At the highest point in its trajectory, the ball momentarily stops before it starts falling back down. This means its velocity (speed and direction) is zero at that instant.\n\nII. The ball\u2019s acceleration is zero at the highest point.\nThis statement is false. Even at the highest point, the ball still experiences acceleration due to gravity (and air resistance, which we'll consider constant throughout the motion). Since air resistance acts opposite to the direction of motion, at the top of the trajectory, air resistance will act downwards along with gravity, meaning there is non-zero acceleration downward.\n\nIII. The ball takes a longer time to travel up to the highest point than to fall back down.\nThis statement is true. Due to air resistance, the ball decelerates as it goes up more quickly than it accelerates on the way down. This is because the force of air resistance decreases as the ball's speed decreases, so there is less resistance acting against the ball when it starts its descent, allowing it to accelerate faster towards the ground under the influence of gravity.\n\nSo, the correct answer is D. I & III only."
