Therefore, implementing a similar education program for all children will improve them in the future opportunities for success in school education. Which of the following best illustrates the logical loopholes summarized above?\n\nA. Children's cognitive abilities are constantly changing at the age of 3-5\nB. Establishing such education and training programs on a national basis requires a special public expenditure\nC. Many parents mistakenly believe that early formal education will occupy the time that children would have been able to better explore the world independently\nD. Investigators are unaware that they include a large group of children who have previously received another education\n"

This undermines the conclusion that implementing a similar program for all children will universally improve their future educational outcomes, as the study's findings might not accurately reflect the program's isolated impact."
