Income is transferred from domestic steel consumers to domestic steel producers.\n\nA protective tariff on imported steel raises the price of steel for consumers, which includes both businesses and households that use steel. This price increase effectively transfers income from those who consume steel to the domestic steel producers who are now able to charge higher prices due to reduced competition from cheaper foreign imports. The other options do not accurately describe the typical consequences of such a tariff."
