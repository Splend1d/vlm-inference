His old companions were all turning to the politicians; the famous Nihilists who made Europe tremble-sons of village priests, of the lower middle class, of tradesmen-could not rise above the idea of national liberation, and seemed to believe that the world would be delivered-when they had killed their despot&\u2026\n\"Foolery! They'll never get out of it with their foolery.\"\nThen, lowering his voice still more, in a few bitter words he described his old dream of fraternity. He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken place.\nHis voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on \u00e9tienne, directly addressing him:\n\"Now, do you understand that? These hatworkers at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live without doing anything! Yes, that is your idea, all of you French workmen; you want to unearth a treasure in order to devour it alone afterwards in some lazy, selfish corner. You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you. You will never be worthy of happiness as long as you own anything, and your hatred of the bourgeois proceeds solely from an angry desire to be bourgeois yourselves in their place.\"\n\u00e9mile Zola, French writer, Germinal, 1885\nIn European industry, the mining industry as discussed in the passage grew in importance following the invention of\n\nA. the water frame\nB. the spinning jenny\nC. the steam engine\nD. the internal combustion engine\n"

However, given the context of the passage and the time period (late 19th century), the invention that most significantly contributed to the growth of the mining industry was likely:\n\nC. the steam engine\n\nThe steam engine, which was developed during the Industrial Revolution, allowed for the mechanization of many industries, including mining. It enabled the pumping of water out of deep mines, making it possible to extract minerals and coal from previously unreachable depths. This innovation was crucial for the expansion of the mining sector and the overall industrial growth of Europe during this time."
