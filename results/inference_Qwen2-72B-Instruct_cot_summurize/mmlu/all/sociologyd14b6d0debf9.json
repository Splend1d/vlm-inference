Instrumentally-rational action (Zweckrational): Action that is taken to achieve a specific goal or outcome. It is based on calculations of efficiency and the best means to an end.\n\n2. Value-rational action (Wertrational): Action that is taken because it aligns with a person's values or beliefs, regardless of the potential outcomes.\n\n3. Traditional action: Action that is taken because it has been done in the past or is part of established customs and traditions.\n\n4. Affective action: Action that is driven by emotions or feelings, such as love, hate, or fear."
