The line on which the call was made was a line owned by a woman. Immediately after receiving the call, the telephone operator reported the threatening conversation to the police. About half an hour later, during which time she had handled a number of other calls, the telephone operator received a call from a police officer who was at the woman's home. He asked her to listen to a voice. After she did, the officer asked the telephone operator if she could identify it. The telephone operator responded that she was positive that it was the voice of the person who had made the threat. As a result of the telephone operator's identification, the woman's boyfriend was arrested and charged with the crime of terrorist threatening. As a consequence of the arrest, the boyfriend lost his job and suffered embarrassment and ridicule in the community. At trial, however, the telephone operator's identification proved to be erroneous, and the boyfriend was exonerated. In a defamation action for slander by the boyfriend against the telephone operator and the telephone company, he will most likely\n\nA. succeed, because the telephone operator's erroneous identification constituted slander per Se.\nB. succeed, because the telephone operator's erroneous identification resulted in the loss of his good reputation in the community.\nC. not succeed, because the telephone operator's erroneous identification was made without actual malice.\nD. not succeed, because the telephone operator's erroneous identification was protected by a qualified privilege for statements made in the public interest.\n"

She had a duty to relay this information, and her actions were intended to prevent harm and protect public safety. Qualified privilege allows for the communication of potentially defamatory information under certain circumstances where there is a public interest in the dissemination of such information. However, this privilege can be defeated if the plaintiff can prove that the defendant acted with actual malice or negligence. Since there is no indication that the telephone operator acted with malice or that she was negligent in her duties, the qualified privilege would likely apply, and the boyfriend would not succeed in his defamation action."
