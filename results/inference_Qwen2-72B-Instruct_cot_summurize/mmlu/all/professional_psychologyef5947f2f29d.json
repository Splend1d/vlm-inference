                    "text": "The correct answer is C. Psychologists are prohibited from having sexual intimacies with former therapy clients in certain circumstances (e.g., when there is a risk of exploitation). According to the American Psychological Association's Ethical Principles of Psychologists and Code of Conduct, psychologists should not engage in sexual intimacies with former clients, students, supervisees, or employees after the professional relationship has ended if there is a risk of exploitation or harm. This prohibition applies indefinitely in some cases, such as when the psychologist has had a multiple relationship with the individual that could reasonably be expected to impair the psychologist's objectivity, competence, or effectiveness in performing his or her functions as a psychologist, or could exploit or harm the person. In other cases, the prohibition may apply for a specific period of time, such as two years after the termination of the professional relationship. However, the exact guidelines can vary depending on the jurisdiction and the specific circumstances of the case. Therefore, it is important for psychologists to consult their local laws and ethical guidelines to determine the appropriate course of action in each situation. It is worth noting that option A is incorrect because the prohibition is not absolute and depends on the circumstances of the case. Option B is also incorrect because the prohibition may apply for longer than one year in some cases. Option D is incorrect because the prohibition does exist in certain circumstances."
