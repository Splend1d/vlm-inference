Although the specifics differ, with one document establishing a republic and the other a constitutional monarchy, both emphasize the importance of representation in government. Source 1 outlines the establishment of the Republic of Colombia through the unification of Venezuela and New Granada, emphasizing the role of a sovereign congress and the appointment of executive officials by the acting congress. Source 2 establishes a constitutional monarchy in Brazil, indicating that the government will be hereditary but also representative, suggesting a degree of citizen involvement in governance. Neither source discusses military dictatorships (option C) or industrialization's impact on government (option D), and while Source 2 does involve a monarch, it is within the context of a constitutional framework (not option B)."
