He wanted to reward the colonies through his extension of \"salutary neglect.\"\n\nThe excerpt from The Sugar Act of 1764 indicates that Prime Minister Grenville believed in controlling trade, raising revenue, and having Parliament impose taxes on the colonies to help pay for the costs of defending and protecting them, especially after the French and Indian War. This stance was contrary to the policy of \"salutary neglect,\" which allowed the colonies a great deal of autonomy and did not strictly enforce British laws and regulations. Grenville did not want to reward the colonies through an extension of this leniency but instead sought to assert greater control and fiscal responsibility over them."
