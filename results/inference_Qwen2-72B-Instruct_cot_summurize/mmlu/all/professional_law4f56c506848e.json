An implied-in-fact contract.\n\nWhen a client accepts the services of an attorney without a specific agreement regarding the amount of the fee, it is generally assumed that there is an implied-in-fact contract for the attorney's services. This type of contract arises from the conduct of the parties and the circumstances of the case, indicating that they have mutually agreed to enter into a contractual relationship, even if the terms are not explicitly stated. The attorney can later seek reasonable compensation based on the customary fees for such services in the area or as determined by the court."
