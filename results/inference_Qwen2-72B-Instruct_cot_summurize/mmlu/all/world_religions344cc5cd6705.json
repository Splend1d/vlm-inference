All of the above\n\nThe Communidades de Base, or Base Christian Communities, are small grassroots religious groups that emerged in Latin America during the 1960s and 1970s as part of the liberation theology movement. They are associated with Bishop Oscar Romero, who was a vocal advocate for social justice and human rights in El Salvador. The communities emphasize resistance against oppression and renewal of the Church from the bottom up. They also uphold the dignity of all human beings, particularly the poor and marginalized, as central to their faith and practice."
