They reveal that the age of the solar system is approximately 4.6 billion years.\n\nMeteorites, especially primitive ones known as chondrites, contain some of the oldest materials in the solar system. By studying isotopes within these meteorites, scientists can determine their age using radiometric dating techniques. This has led to the widely accepted age for the solar system of about 4.6 billion years. While meteorites can provide information on other aspects of the solar system's history, such as its composition and the processes that occurred during its formation, option C directly addresses what they reveal about the solar system's age."
