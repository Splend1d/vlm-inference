The correct answer from the options provided is:\n\nA. It contradicts the hypothesis that the monumental construction of the Maya was largely inspired by the Olmec.\n\nRecent archaeological research has suggested that the initial phases of monumental construction at Ceibal predate the influence of the Olmec culture, which had been previously thought to have played a significant role in inspiring the Maya to build such structures. This finding supports the idea that the Maya developed their monumental architecture independently, rather than as a direct result of Olmec influence. This challenges earlier hypotheses that the Olmec were the primary cultural force behind the emergence of complex societies and monumental architecture in Mesoamerica. Instead, it suggests that the Maya had their own internal processes driving the development of their civilization."
