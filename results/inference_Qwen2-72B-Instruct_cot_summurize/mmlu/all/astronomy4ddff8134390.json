Methane does not condense into ice in the warmer atmospheric temperatures of Jupiter and Saturn.\nB. Methane did not exist in the solar nebula at the radii of Jupiter and Saturn when the planets formed.\nC. The relatively slow rotation of Uranus and Neptune allows methane to migrate to higher levels in the atmosphere and condense into clouds.\nD. Methane reacts with the abundant ammonia clouds in Jupiter and Saturn and is removed from the atmosphere.\n"

Methane does not condense into ice in the warmer atmospheric temperatures of Jupiter and Saturn.\n\nUranus and Neptune are much farther from the Sun than Jupiter and Saturn, which means they receive less solar energy and are therefore colder. This lower temperature allows methane gas in their atmospheres to condense into clouds of methane ice crystals, which reflect blue light and give the planets their characteristic blue color. In contrast, the warmer temperatures in the atmospheres of Jupiter and Saturn prevent methane from condensing into ice, so it remains as a gas and does not form visible clouds."
