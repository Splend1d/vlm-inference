Using someone else's toothbrush without permission might be considered disrespectful or unsanitary, but it is not typically viewed as a morally wrong action on par with lying, stealing, or harming others. The second scenario may involve questionable motives for bringing a friend to the spa, but it does not inherently involve any action that would be considered morally wrong unless there was an intention to publicly humiliate or belittle the friend. Simply feeling better about oneself in comparison to another person, while perhaps not the most virtuous motive, is not a clear violation of moral standards."
