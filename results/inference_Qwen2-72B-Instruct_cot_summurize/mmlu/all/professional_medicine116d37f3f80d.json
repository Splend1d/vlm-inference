Medical history is significant for sickle cell trait and mild anemia. She has been taking 800 mg of ibuprofen three times daily for Achilles tendinitis diagnosed 1 month ago. She has smoked five cigarettes daily for the past 15 years, and she drinks one to five beers on weekends. She experimented with cocaine briefly 16 years ago, but she has never used intravenous drugs. She has been in a monogamous sexual relationship for the past 12 years. Today, vital signs are temperature 37.2\u00b0C (99.0\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 16/min, and blood pressure 145/95 mm Hg. Physical examination discloses periorbital edema but no jugular venous distention. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Cardiac examination discloses an S1 and S2 without murmurs or gallops. Abdominal examination discloses bulging flanks and shifting dullness to percussion. Examination of the lower extremities shows pitting edema from the mid thigh to the ankles bilaterally. Results of which of the following studies are most likely to be abnormal in this patient?\n\nA. HIV antibody study\nB. Serum B-type natriuretic peptide concentration\nC. Toxicology screening of the urine\nD. Urine protein concentration\n"

                    "text": "The most likely abnormal finding in this patient would be D. Urine protein concentration. The patient's symptoms of leg swelling, weight gain, and periorbital edema, along with the physical examination findings of pitting edema and abdominal examination showing bulging flanks and shifting dullness to percussion, suggest fluid retention and possible renal involvement. Proteinuria, or the presence of protein in the urine, can be a sign of kidney damage or disease, and may be present in conditions such as nephrotic syndrome or glomerulonephritis. The patient's use of ibuprofen, which can cause kidney damage, and her sickle cell trait, which can increase the risk of kidney problems, further support the possibility of renal involvement.\n\nA. HIV antibody study is not necessarily indicated based on the information provided, although it could be considered if there are other risk factors or symptoms that suggest HIV infection.\nB. Serum B-type natriuretic peptide concentration is a marker of heart failure, but the patient's cardiac examination did not reveal any abnormalities, and her symptoms do not specifically point to heart failure.\nC. Toxicology screening of the urine may show evidence of drug use, but the patient's history does not suggest current drug use that would require urgent toxicology screening."
