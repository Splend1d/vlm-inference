Higher interest rates that decrease private investment.\n\nExpansionary fiscal policy involves increasing government spending or decreasing taxes, which can lead to increased demand for goods and services, higher economic growth, and potentially inflation. However, if this policy leads to higher interest rates, it can crowd out private investment as borrowing becomes more expensive. This reduces the overall effectiveness of the expansionary fiscal policy since part of the increased demand is offset by reduced investment. This phenomenon is known as the crowding-out effect."
