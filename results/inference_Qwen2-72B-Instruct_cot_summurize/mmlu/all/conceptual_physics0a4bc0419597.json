Since the gravitational force is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between two masses (\\(F = G\\frac{m_1m_2}{r^2}\\)), when the distance \\(r\\) is constant, so is the gravitational force.\n\nIn contrast, for elliptical and parabolic orbits, the distance between the satellite and the central mass changes as the satellite moves along its path, causing the gravitational force to vary."
