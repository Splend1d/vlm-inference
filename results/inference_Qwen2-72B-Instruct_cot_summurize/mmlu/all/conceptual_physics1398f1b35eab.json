This is because the force of gravity on an object (F = mg, where m is the mass of the object and g is the acceleration due to gravity) is directly proportional to its mass. However, the acceleration (a) produced by this force is given by Newton's second law: F = ma. Rearranging this equation gives us a = F/m. Since the force due to gravity (F = mg) is in the numerator and the mass (m) is in the denominator, the acceleration due to gravity (g) is the same for all objects, regardless of their mass, as long as they are in the same gravitational field. Thus, the ratio of force to mass (F/m) is the same for both the heavy rock and the light rock, leading to the same acceleration."
