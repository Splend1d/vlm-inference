All plant protein sources contain all essential amino acids although some may be limited by the amount of particular amino acids\n\nWhile it's true that many plant protein sources may have lower levels of certain essential amino acids compared to animal proteins, no plant protein is completely devoid of any essential amino acid. Some plant proteins are considered \"incomplete\" because they may lack one or more essential amino acids in sufficient quantities for human needs. However, this can often be addressed through the consumption of a variety of plant-based foods that complement each other's amino acid profiles. For example, combining rice and beans provides a complete set of essential amino acids."
