Charging all costs to expense when incurred.\n\nThis is based on FASB Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 730, Research and Development Costs, which states that research and development costs should be charged to expense as incurred. This includes both research costs (which are costs for planned search or critical investigation aimed at discovery of new knowledge with the hope that such knowledge may be useful in developing a new product or process or in bringing about a significant improvement to an existing product or process) and development costs (which are costs incurred after technological feasibility has been established for a product).\n\nCapitalization of R&D costs is allowed under certain circumstances, but only for development costs after technological feasibility has been established and certain criteria are met regarding the ability to recover those costs through future economic benefits. However, this question specifies costs with no alternative future use, which would not meet the criteria for capitalization."
