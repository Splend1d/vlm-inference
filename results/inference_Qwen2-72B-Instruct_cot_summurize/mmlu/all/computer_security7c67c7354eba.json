Freenet\n\nFreenet is a decentralized anonymous peer-to-peer application that allows users to publish and access information on the internet without fear of censorship or monitoring. It is often associated with the darknet, as it can be used for transferring files anonymously. The other options listed (ARPANET, Stuxnet, and Internet) do not fit this description. ARPANET was an early packet-switching network and precursor to the internet, Stuxnet is a type of malicious software designed to target industrial control systems, and the Internet is the global system of interconnected computer networks that use the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) to link devices worldwide."
