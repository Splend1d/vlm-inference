The grade equivalent score is a type of norm-referenced score that indicates the grade level and month when a group of same-grade students, on average, obtain a particular score. It does not mean that the student should be placed in that grade, nor does it refer to the average score obtained by students at a given age. It is not used to determine accountability among peers but rather to provide an indication of where the student stands relative to other students at different grade levels. However, since option A is closest to the definition, it is the best choice. Note that interpretation of grade equivalent scores can sometimes be misunderstood, so careful explanation is necessary."
