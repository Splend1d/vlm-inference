Understated, Understated.\n\nWhen Arno Co. omits the recording of a credit purchase of merchandise that was actually received and included in the year-end physical inventory, it means that the cost of goods sold (COGS) will be understated because the inventory value (an asset) is overstated by the amount of the purchase that wasn't recorded. However, since the purchase was made on credit, there would also be an accounts payable liability that should have been recorded but wasn't. Therefore, both assets (inventory) and liabilities (accounts payable) are understated on the balance sheet at year-end.\n\nHere's how it breaks down:\n\n- Inventory (an asset) should have been reduced by the cost of the merchandise purchased, but since the purchase wasn't recorded, inventory is overstated.\n- Accounts Payable (a liability) should have been increased by the amount owed for the merchandise purchased on credit, but since the purchase wasn't recorded, accounts payable is understated.\n\nSo, the correct answer is that both assets and liabilities are understated due to the omitted transaction."
