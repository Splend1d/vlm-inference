The municipality's zoning is cumulative. cumulative. Five years ago, the municipality rezoned the area to single-family residential use.

The daughter immediately moved into the apartment and took over the operation of the shoe store on the first floor.

No, but the municipality must pay her reasonable compensation for her loss resulting from the change in zoning.\nC. Yes, because the shoe store is a nonconforming use.\nD.

Yes, because the shoe store is a nonconforming use.\n\nWhen an area is rezoned, existing uses that do not conform to the new zoning regulations are typically allowed to continue as \"nonconforming uses.\" In this case, the building was originally zoned for nonresidential use and the shoe store was operating legally before the rezoning. Therefore, the shoe store is considered a nonconforming use and can continue to operate, even after the death of the original owners and the inheritance by the daughter. However, if the nonconforming use were to be abandoned or significantly altered, it could potentially lose its nonconforming status."
