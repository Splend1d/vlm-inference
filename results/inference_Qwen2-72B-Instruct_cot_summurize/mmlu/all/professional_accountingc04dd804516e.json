Prenumbered receiving reports completed by the client\u2019s employees: This type of evidence can be less reliable than external evidence because it can be subject to manipulation by the client's employees. However, prenumbered documents can help ensure completeness and prevent fraud.\n\nC. Prior months\u2019 bank statements obtained from the client: Bank statements are typically considered reliable because they come from an independent source (the bank), although there is a slight risk if the client has altered them before providing them to the auditor.\n\nD. Municipal property tax bills prepared in the client\u2019s name: These are also generally reliable as they come from a government source, which is considered an independent third party.\n\nGiven these considerations, option B\u2014prenumbered receiving reports completed by the client\u2019s employees\u2014provides the least assurance of reliability among the choices because it is the most likely to be subject to manipulation by the client's personnel."
