In this case, the two populations show completely different genotypes (A1A1 in population 1 and A2A2 in population 2) with no intermediate genotypes present, indicating discrete genetic variation.\n\nGenetic drift (A) involves random changes in allele frequencies over time, but it does not explain the clear distinction between the two populations without any intermediate genotypes.\n\nGene flow (B) is the transfer of alleles from one population to another through migration, but since the populations are far from one another, gene flow is unlikely to be the primary cause of the observed genetic variation.\n\nDisruptive selection (C) occurs when the extreme variants of a trait are favored over intermediate variants, leading to a bimodal distribution of the trait. While this could lead to discrete variation, the information provided does not suggest any selective pressures acting differently on the two populations."
