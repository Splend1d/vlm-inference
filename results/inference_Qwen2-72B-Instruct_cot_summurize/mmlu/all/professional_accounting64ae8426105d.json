In the two years following the year of death (as long as the taxpayer remains unmarried and has not remarried), the surviving spouse can file as a \"qualifying widow(er) with dependent child\" if there is a dependent child. However, since the question specifies that there were no dependents, the surviving spouse can still file as a \"qualifying widow(er)\" without a dependent child for the first two years following the year of death.\n\nIn this case, for year 2, the surviving spouse would file as a qualifying widow(er) even without having a dependent child."
