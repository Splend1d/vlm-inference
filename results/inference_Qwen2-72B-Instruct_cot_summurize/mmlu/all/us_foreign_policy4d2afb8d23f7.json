A focus on class and economic interests\n\nSocio-economic accounts of US Cold War foreign policy often emphasize the role of economic interests and class dynamics in shaping US foreign policy decisions. These analyses might explore how the US government's policies were influenced by the needs of American businesses, the desire to maintain access to key resources, or the imperative to support capitalist economies abroad as a bulwark against communism. While other factors such as ideology, language, and culture certainly played a role in US foreign policy during the Cold War, socio-economic accounts tend to prioritize economic considerations. However, it is important to note that comprehensive analyses may incorporate elements of all these factors."
