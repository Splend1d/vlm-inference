It is produced by the vascular cambium on the outside of the xylem.\n6. **Primary Phloem**: This is the initial phloem formed during primary growth.\n7. **Cortex**: This is the outer layer of the stem, beneath the epidermis, and it contains a variety of cell types including collenchyma and parenchyma cells.\n\nThe order listed in option D correctly represents the sequence of tissues and tissue regions from the inside to the outside of the twig that the larvae would encounter as they bore through."
