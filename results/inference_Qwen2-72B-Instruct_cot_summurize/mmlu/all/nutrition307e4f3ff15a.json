Long chain (>=20 carbons) n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids\n\nLong chain omega-3 (n-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; 20:5 n-3) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6 n-3), have been associated with reduced cardiovascular mortality. These fatty acids can be found in marine oils, such as fish oil, and have been shown to have beneficial effects on heart health, including anti-inflammatory and anti-thrombotic properties.\n\nIt's important to note that while long-chain saturated fatty acids may also be present in plasma phospholipids, they are generally not associated with reduced cardiovascular mortality. In fact, high levels of certain saturated fatty acids, like palmitic acid (16:0) and stearic acid (18:0), have been linked to increased cardiovascular risk. Alpha-linolenic acid (18:3 n-3) is an essential fatty acid that can be converted to EPA and DHA in the body, but its conversion rate is low, and its direct impact on cardiovascular mortality is less clear compared to long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids."
