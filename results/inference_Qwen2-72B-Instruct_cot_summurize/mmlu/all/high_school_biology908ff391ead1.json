Here, p is the frequency of the dominant allele A, and q is the frequency of the recessive allele a.\n\nGiven that the autosomal recessive trait is expressed in 1% of the population, this means that q^2 = 0.01.\n\nTo find q, we take the square root of both sides: \u221aq^2 = \u221a0.01, so q = 0.1.\n\nNow, we need to find the value of p. Since p + q = 1 (the sum of the frequencies of all alleles must equal 1), we have p + 0.1 = 1, so p = 0.9.\n\nThe percentage of the population who are carriers (heterozygous for the trait) is given by 2pq, which is 2 * 0.9 * 0.1 = 0.18 or 18%.\n\nSo, the correct answer is B. 18%."
