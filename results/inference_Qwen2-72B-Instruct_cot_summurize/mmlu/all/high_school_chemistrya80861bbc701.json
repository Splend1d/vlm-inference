                    "text": "The correct answer is B. This is a spontaneous process because of an entropy increase.\n\nWhen potassium perchlorate (KClO4) dissolves in water and the temperature of the solution decreases, it indicates that heat is being absorbed from the surroundings. This is an endothermic process, not an exothermic one. The fact that the solution's temperature drops suggests that the system is taking in heat, which increases the disorder or randomness (entropy) of the system. In dissolution processes, the increase in entropy due to the dispersion of solute particles into the solvent often drives the spontaneity of the reaction, even if the process is endothermic. Therefore, option B is the correct choice."
