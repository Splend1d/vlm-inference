They help researchers determine whether the findings of a study are likely due to chance or if they represent a true effect that can be generalized to the larger population. This is done through hypothesis testing, where statistical tests are used to calculate the probability (p-value) that the observed results occurred by chance. If the p-value is below a predetermined threshold (often 0.05), the results are considered statistically significant and less likely to have occurred by chance.\n\nDescriptive statistics (option B) summarize and describe the features of a dataset, but do not allow for inference beyond the data at hand. Standard deviation (option C) measures the amount of variation or dispersion in a set of values, but it does not help in determining the likelihood that the findings are due to chance. Extraneous variables (option D) are variables other than those being studied that may affect the outcome of an experiment; while controlling for them is important for internal validity, they are not directly involved in determining whether the findings reflect chance processes."
