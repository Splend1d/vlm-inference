The Reds offer discounted parking for all home games.\n\nConsumer surplus is the difference between the total amount that consumers are willing and able to pay for a good or service and the total amount that they actually do pay. Offering discounted parking does not directly affect the price of the tickets, but it does reduce the overall cost of attending the game for the fans, thereby increasing their consumer surplus. The other options either have no effect on consumer surplus (option B), decrease consumer surplus (options C and D), or may potentially decrease consumer surplus if the increased cost leads to higher ticket prices (option D)."
