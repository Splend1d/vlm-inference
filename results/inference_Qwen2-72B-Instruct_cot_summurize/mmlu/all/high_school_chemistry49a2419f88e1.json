If the helium is evacuated into a larger container while the temperature is held constant, what will the effect on the entropy of the helium be?\n\nA. It will remain constant as the number of helium molecules does not change.\nB. It will decrease as the gas will be more ordered in the larger flask.\nC. It will decrease because the molecules will collide with the sides of the larger flask less often than they did in the smaller flask.\nD. It will increase as the gas molecules will be more dispersed in the larger flask.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is D. The entropy of the helium gas will increase when it is transferred to a larger container at constant temperature. Entropy is a measure of the disorder or randomness of a system. When the volume of the container increases, the helium molecules have more space to move around in, which results in a greater number of possible arrangements of the molecules. This increase in the number of possible arrangements corresponds to an increase in entropy.\n\nThe fact that the number of helium molecules does not change is true, but this does not mean that the entropy remains constant. The key factor here is the change in volume, which affects the number of available microstates for the molecules, leading to an increase in entropy."
