Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation: In scenario 1, leaving the baby with a neighbor while shopping might be seen as a reasonable action if the neighbor is a trusted adult capable of taking care of the child. It would only be considered morally wrong if the neighbor was not a responsible caregiver or if the baby was left for an excessively long period without proper arrangements. Without additional context, we cannot assume that this action is morally wrong.\n\nIn scenario 2, feeding the dog when it's time to eat is actually a responsible and caring action, not morally wrong at all. Ensuring that a pet is well-fed is part of being a good pet owner."
