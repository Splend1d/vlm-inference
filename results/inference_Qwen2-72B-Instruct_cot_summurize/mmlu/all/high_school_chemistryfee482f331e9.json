Fill the flask partway with water, then add 600 mL of the stock solution, swirling to mix it. Last, fill the flask the rest of the way with distilled water.\n\nThe correct answer based on the calculations is **A** or **C**, but the best practice when preparing a solution in a volumetric flask involves adding the solute to the flask first, followed by enough solvent to reach the calibration mark. Therefore, the proper procedure would be to add 167 mL of the stock solution to the flask, then fill the flask the rest of the way with distilled water while swirling the solution. This makes **A** the best choice, as it directly follows the steps required without pre-filling the flask with water. However, both A and C could work, with A being more precise in terms of following standard laboratory procedures."
