Under IRS rules, these types of expenses can typically be amortized over a 180-month (15-year) period starting in the month the business begins operations.\n\nHowever, if the question is looking for an option that stands out as NOT being amortizable under any circumstances, the answer would not be clearly provided among the options given, since all of them are usually amortizable. \n\nIt's important to note that specific tax laws and regulations can change, and there may be exceptions or special rules that apply based on the circumstances. It's always recommended to consult with a tax professional or refer to the latest IRS guidelines for the most accurate information regarding your specific situation. If the context of the question implies seeking an answer where none of the given options are universally non-amortizable, then the question might be misphrased or require additional clarification."
