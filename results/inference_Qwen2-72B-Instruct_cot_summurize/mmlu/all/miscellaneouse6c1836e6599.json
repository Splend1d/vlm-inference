However, the classic recipe for a Pink Lady actually uses a combination of gin, applejack brandy, heavy cream, lemon juice, and egg white. The pink color comes from the addition of red food coloring, rather than a particular liqueur. Some variations of the cocktail may include grenadine or another pink-hued ingredient, but this is not part of the traditional recipe. So the answer would be A. grenadine, but with the caveat that it is not part of the classic recipe for a Pink Lady."
