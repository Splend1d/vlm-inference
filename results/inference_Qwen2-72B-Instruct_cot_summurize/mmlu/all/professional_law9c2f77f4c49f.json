A vested remainder pur autre vie is a future interest that has become fixed in someone, subject to open (meaning it could increase if someone yet unborn is entitled to share in it), where the interest depends on the life of another person. A contingent remainder pur autre vie is also a future interest, but its vesting is dependent on the occurrence of a condition precedent other than death, and it too is measured by the life of another person. A shifting executory interest pur autre vie refers to an interest that shifts from one party to another based on a condition related to the life of another person.\n\nIn this case, the brother's interest is contingent upon the uncle moving to another state while he is still alive, which is a condition precedent. Therefore, it is a contingent remainder pur autre vie. If the uncle moves to another state during the son's lifetime, the brother's interest will vest; otherwise, it remains contingent."
