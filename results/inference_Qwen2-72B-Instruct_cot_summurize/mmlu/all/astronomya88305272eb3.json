When the Earth passes through the orbit of a comet we are bombarded by sand-sized particles which cause a meteor shower. Comets leave behind a trail of debris as they orbit the sun, and when the Earth passes through this debris field, the particles burn up in our atmosphere, causing a meteor shower."
