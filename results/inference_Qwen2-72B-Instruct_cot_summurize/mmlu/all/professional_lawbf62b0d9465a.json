The airline that owned and operated the airplane is incorporated and has its maintenance facilities and principal place of business in State C. One day before the statute of limitations on their claims would have run, the estates of the pilot and each of the passengers filed a wrongful death action against the airline in federal court in State A. The airline was served one week later and wants to prevent the State A federal court from hearing the action. Which of the following motions is most likely to accomplish the airline's goal?\n\nA. A motion to dismiss the action for improper venue.\nB. A motion to dismiss the action for lack of personal jurisdiction.\nC. A motion to dismiss the action under the doctrine of forum non conveniens.\nD. A motion to transfer the action to a federal court in State C.\n"

A motion to transfer the action to a federal court in State C.\n\nAlthough the other motions might be relevant in certain circumstances, they are less likely to succeed based on the information provided:\n\nA. A motion to dismiss the action for improper venue might not succeed because the accident occurred in State A, which could make it an appropriate venue.\n\nB. A motion to dismiss the action for lack of personal jurisdiction may not be successful since the airline does business across state lines and has operations in multiple states, including where the accident occurred.\n\nC. A motion to dismiss the action under the doctrine of forum non conveniens could be considered, but this doctrine is typically used when there is another more appropriate forum available, and the inconvenience of litigating in the chosen forum outweighs the plaintiff's choice. However, the plaintiffs' choice of forum is often given significant weight, especially if the accident occurred in that location.\n\nD. A motion to transfer the action to a federal court in State C, where the airline is incorporated and has its principal place of business, might be successful if the airline can argue that the case would be more conveniently heard in State C due to the location of witnesses, evidence, and the airline's operations. This motion is based on 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404(a), which allows for the transfer of venue if it is in the interest of justice and convenience. Given that the airline's maintenance facilities and principal place of business are in State C, this argument could hold more weight than the others."
