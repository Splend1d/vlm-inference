Marine birds excrete salts through specialized salt-exchange glands and excrete small volumes of urine.\n\nMarine birds, such as pelicans and gulls, have evolved specialized structures called salt glands located above their eyes. These glands help them to excrete excess salts from seawater by secreting a highly concentrated saline solution through the nostrils. This process allows the birds to drink seawater while maintaining their internal osmolarity at a level that is hypoosmotic to seawater. Additionally, they typically produce small volumes of urine to conserve water since they live in an environment where fresh water may be scarce."
