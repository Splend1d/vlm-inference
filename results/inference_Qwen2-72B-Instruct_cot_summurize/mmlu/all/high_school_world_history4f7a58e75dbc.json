This improvement can be seen as a significant achievement of the Soviet government in terms of education and social development, which aligns with the goals of communism to create a more equal and educated society. While acknowledging the potential for abuses under the leadership of Lenin and Stalin, the historian could argue that these achievements demonstrate the effectiveness of the Soviet system in advancing certain aspects of societal well-being."
