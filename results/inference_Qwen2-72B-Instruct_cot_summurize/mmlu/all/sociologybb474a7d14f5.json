An open society is typically characterized by its democratic values, freedom of expression, and social mobility. In such a society, individuals can move between different levels of the social hierarchy based on their abilities and efforts rather than being confined to a fixed position determined by birth or other ascribed characteristics.\n\nWhile options A, B, and C may be present in certain open societies, they do not define what it means to be an open society in the broader sense. Option A refers to equality, which is important but not the defining characteristic; option B refers to transparency in government, which is also important but not the sole defining feature; and option C refers to sexual attitudes, which can vary widely even within open societies and is not a defining characteristic of openness.\n\nThus, the most accurate definition for an 'open' society from the given options is D, allowing people to move between levels of the hierarchy."
