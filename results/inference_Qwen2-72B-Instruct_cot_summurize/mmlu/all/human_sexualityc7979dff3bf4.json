They conducted extensive research on human sexuality in the 1960s and 1970s, which included detailed observations of sexual responses and behaviors. Their work debunked many myths about female sexuality and provided empirical evidence that women are capable of experiencing multiple orgasms. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Masters and Johnson."
