This reduction in current supply shifts the supply curve for good A to the left.\n\nThe effect on the demand curve for good A is not directly influenced by producers' expectations alone, unless those expectations cause a change in consumer behavior (for example, if consumers hear about the expected price increase and decide to buy more now to avoid higher prices later). Without such information, we can assume the demand curve remains unchanged.\n\nWith a leftward shift in the supply curve and the demand curve remaining constant, the new equilibrium will result in a higher equilibrium price and a lower equilibrium quantity. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. The equilibrium price will rise and the equilibrium quantity will fall."
