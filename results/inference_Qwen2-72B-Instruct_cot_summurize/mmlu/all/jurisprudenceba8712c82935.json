Power and Liability\n4. Immunity and Disability\n\nAccording to Hohfeld, these terms are not only opposites but also related in such a way that if one person has a right, another has a duty; if one has a privilege, others have no-right; if one has power, others have liability; and if one has immunity, others have disability.\n\nThe question asks which of the following apparent correlatives contradicts Hohfeld's scheme of 'jural relations'. Since all the options provided (A through D) correctly represent Hohfeld's jural correlatives as he defined them, none of them, by themselves, would be considered a contradiction of his scheme.\n\nHowever, if we interpret the question as asking for an option that does not fit into Hohfeld's scheme when improperly paired, then any pairing other than those listed above would be contradictory. For example, pairing \"right\" with \"liability,\" or \"privilege\" with \"duty,\" would contradict Hohfeld's scheme.\n\nGiven the options as presented, none of them (A, B, C, D) directly contradicts Hohfeld's scheme of 'jural relations' on their own, as they are all correct pairs according to his theory. If the question intends to ask about an incorrect pairing, it does not provide enough information to select an answer based on the given options. \n\nIf I must choose one as per the strictest interpretation of the question, none of the options (A, B, C, D) contradicts Hohfeld's scheme as they are all part of his jural correlatives. However, since the question asks for a contradiction, and assuming there is an error in its formulation, I cannot provide an answer that directly responds to the question as it stands."
