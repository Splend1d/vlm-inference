Lt \u2228 Le\n\nWhere 'L' stands for the predicate 'is a latte boy', 't' represents Taylor, and 'e' represents Eric. However, the correct subject-position should have the constants (t, e) before the predicate symbol (L). So the most accurate answer would be:\n\nC. tL \u2228 eL\n\nBut based on standard logical notation, the answer should look like this: \n\nLt \u2228 Le\n\nSo, if we follow the given options, A would be the correct answer, but considering proper notation, an option that looks like \"Lt \u2228 Le\" with the understanding that 't' represents Taylor and 'e' represents Eric would be ideal. Unfortunately, that option isn't provided in your list, so the closest answer is A. However, based on proper notation, C would be the correct representation if it was notated correctly as Lt \u2228 Le."
