This best describes the balance the Supreme Court has struck between the Establishment Clause and the Free Exercise Clause. The Establishment Clause prohibits the government from making any law respecting an establishment of religion, while the Free Exercise Clause prohibits the government from interfering with the practice of religion. The Supreme Court has interpreted these clauses to mean that the government cannot sponsor or promote religion (Establishment Clause), but it also cannot prohibit individuals from freely exercising their religious beliefs (Free Exercise Clause). Thus, state-sponsored prayer during school hours is prohibited because it would violate the Establishment Clause, but voluntary prayer by student groups before school is allowed because it does not involve state sponsorship and is protected under the Free Exercise Clause."
