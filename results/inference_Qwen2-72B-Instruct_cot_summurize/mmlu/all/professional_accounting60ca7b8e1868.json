                    "text": "When variances are written off directly to the cost of goods sold, they immediately impact the income statement, reducing net income. However, if the variances were instead allocated to work in progress, finished goods, and cost of goods sold, the immediate impact on net income would be less severe because not all of the variance would hit the income statement right away.\n\nAllocating the variances to inventory accounts (work in progress and finished goods) would increase these assets on the balance sheet, potentially improving the current ratio if the increase in current assets is not offset by an equivalent increase in current liabilities. The current ratio is calculated as current assets divided by current liabilities.\n\nHowever, over time, as the inventory is sold and the allocated variances are recognized in the cost of goods sold, net income will be reduced in future periods. This delayed recognition could result in lower net income in subsequent periods when compared to writing off the variances immediately.\n\nSo, in the short term:\n- Allocating variances to inventory rather than writing them off directly to COGS would likely lead to a slight increase in the current ratio due to higher current assets.\n- Net income would also likely increase in the short term because the full impact of the unfavorable variances is not immediately recognized.\n\nIn the long term, as the inventory is sold and the allocated variances are recognized in the cost of goods sold, net income would decrease.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Increases Decreases\n\nThis assumes that the question is asking about the short-term effects on the current ratio and net income. In the short term, the current ratio would increase, and net income would also increase relative to writing off the variances immediately. However, in the long term, net income would decrease as the allocated variances are recognized in the cost of goods sold."
