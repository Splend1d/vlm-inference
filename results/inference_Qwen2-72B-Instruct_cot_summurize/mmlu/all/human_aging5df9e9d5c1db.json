However, given that Dr. Norman Shealy is a well-known physician and advocate for holistic health, it's likely that his advice would fall into categories related to personal health and well-being. Thus, options B (Eat the right foods) and C (Get plenty of exercise) seem most probable based on his expertise and typical areas of focus.\n\nDr. Shealy has written extensively on topics such as nutrition, exercise, stress management, and alternative therapies. Therefore, if the question is asking about general advice he might give in a \"Senior View\" section, which could be aimed at older adults, his advice might lean towards maintaining good health through proper diet and regular physical activity.\n\nThat said, staying in school (option A) could also be relevant if the context includes lifelong learning and mental health, which are important aspects of aging well. Finding a high paying job (option D) is less likely to be his primary advice, as it doesn't directly relate to health and wellness, although financial security can certainly contribute to overall quality of life.\n\nIn summary, without more specific information, the most likely answers based on Dr. Shealy's known areas of interest would be either B (Eat the right foods) or C (Get plenty of exercise)."
