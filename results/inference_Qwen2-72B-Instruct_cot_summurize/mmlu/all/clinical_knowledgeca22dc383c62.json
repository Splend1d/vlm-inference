They are unable to pass air through their vocal cords.\n\nWhen a tracheostomy cuff (a balloon-like structure at the base of a breathing tube) is inflated, it seals the tracheostomy tube against the trachea (windpipe) to prevent leaks of air and to keep secretions from entering the lungs. This seal also prevents air from escaping through the vocal cords, which are located above the trachea. As a result, the patient may not be able to speak because they cannot push air through their vocal cords to produce sound. Inflating the cuff is typically done during mechanical ventilation to ensure that all the air delivered by the ventilator goes into the lungs rather than leaking out around the tube."
