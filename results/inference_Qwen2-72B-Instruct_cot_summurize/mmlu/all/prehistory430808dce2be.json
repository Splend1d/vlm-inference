They also had smaller brains relative to body size, although the average brain volume was similar or even slightly larger than that of contemporary humans. However, the shape and structure of their brains differed (option B). Their noses were indeed larger, which is thought to have helped warm and humidify cold, dry air in the glacial environments they inhabited. Regarding option C, Neandertal skeletons do not have more bones than modern Homo sapiens; they have the same number but with some differences in shape and structure. Therefore, the correct answer is D, as it includes both A and B."
