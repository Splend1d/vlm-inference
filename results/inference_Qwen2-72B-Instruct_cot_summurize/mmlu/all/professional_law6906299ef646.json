The man tried to discourage the woman's behavior, but the woman persisted. If the man asserts a claim against the woman based on invasion of privacy, the most likely outcome is that the man will\n\nA. prevail, because the telephone calls intruded upon his seclusion and solitude.\nB. prevail, but only if the man is able to prove malice on the defendant's part.\nC. not prevail, because the telephone calls did not cause the man to suffer any economic loss or hardship.\nD. not prevail, unless the woman's conduct was a crime in some respect.\n"

The persistent and unwanted phone calls, visits to his home and workplace, and other contacts by the woman could be seen as an intrusion into the man's private life, which is a tort under the law. The man does not necessarily have to prove malice (option B) or economic loss (option C), nor does the woman's conduct need to be criminal (option D) for him to prevail in a civil lawsuit for invasion of privacy. The key issue is whether the woman's actions were highly offensive to a reasonable person and constituted an intrusion into the man's private affairs."
