                    "text": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of geometric probability. The condition for forming a triangle from three segments is given by the triangle inequality theorem: the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the remaining side.\n\nLet's consider the line segment as a whole unit (for simplicity, let's think of it as having length 1 instead of 10, since scaling does not affect the probability). We choose points A and B on this line at random. Without loss of generality, assume A is to the left of B when looking from left to right. Let the length of the segment from the left end to point A be x, the length of the segment from A to B be y, and the length of the segment from B to the right end be z. Thus, we have:\n\n\\[x + y + z = 1\\]\n\nFor these segments to form a triangle, they must satisfy the triangle inequalities:\n\n\\[x + y > z\\]\n\\[x + z > y\\]\n\\[y + z > x\\]\n\nSince \\(x + y + z = 1\\), we can substitute \\(z = 1 - x - y\\) into the inequalities:\n\n\\[x + y > 1 - x - y\\]\n\\[x + 1 - x - y > y\\]\n\\[y + 1 - x - y > x\\]\n\nSimplifying each inequality gives us:\n\n\\[2y + 2x > 1\\]\n\\[1 - y > y\\]\n\\[1 - x > x\\]\n\nOr equivalently,\n\n\\[y + x > \\frac{1}{2}\\]\n\\[y < \\frac{1}{2}\\]\n\\[x < \\frac{1}{2}\\]\n\nThese conditions define a region in the coordinate plane where x and y represent the positions of points A and B relative to the ends of the segment. The first condition creates a diagonal line dividing the square into two triangles, while the second and third conditions create two lines parallel to the axes, cutting off two smaller squares at the corners.\n\nThe total area of the square representing all possible placements of A and B is 1 (since both x and y range from 0 to 1). The area representing valid placements, based on the above conditions, is the area of the larger triangle minus the areas of the two smaller triangles. Each smaller triangle has an area of \\(\\frac{1}{2} * \\frac{1}{2} * \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{8}\\), so the area representing valid placements is:\n\n\\[Area_{valid} = \\frac{1}{2} - 2*\\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{4}\\]\n\nTherefore, the probability that the segments formed by choosing A and B can form a triangle is the ratio of the valid area to the total area:\n\n\\[Probability = \\frac{Area_{valid}}{Area_{total}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{4}}{1} = \\frac{1}{4} = 25%\\]\n\nSo the answer is **C. 25%**."
