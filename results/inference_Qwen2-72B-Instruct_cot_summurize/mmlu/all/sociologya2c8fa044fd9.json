One reason for this is that selective schools, such as grammar schools, continued to exist in some areas and were able to admit the most academically gifted students through entrance exams. This meant that these schools attracted a disproportionate number of middle-class students who had the resources and support to prepare for the exams.\n\nAt the same time, comprehensive schools often grouped students into different ability streams or sets based on their academic performance. This practice, known as streaming or setting, meant that students perceived to be less academically capable were often placed in lower sets, which could have lower expectations and less challenging curricula. Working-class students were more likely to be placed in lower sets due to systemic biases and socioeconomic factors affecting their educational outcomes. As a result, class inequalities persisted even within the comprehensive school system."
