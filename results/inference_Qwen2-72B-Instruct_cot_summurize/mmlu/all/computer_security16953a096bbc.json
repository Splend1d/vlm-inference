However, when the computer is on and the U2F dongle is properly configured and used, it can protect against malware trying to steal the second factor during an active session. So, the first statement is false due to the condition about the computer being turned off.\n\nThe second statement is true. The U2F protocol is designed so that a server can reliably determine that the user attempting to log in is indeed behind the computer that sent the login request. This is achieved through a challenge-response mechanism where the server sends a challenge to the client (the user's computer), and the U2F device generates a signature based on this challenge and the user's private key. The server then verifies this signature to confirm the user's identity.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. False, True"
