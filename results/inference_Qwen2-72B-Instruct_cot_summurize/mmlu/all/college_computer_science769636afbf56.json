In the worst-case scenario, which occurs when the input array is already sorted or nearly sorted, Quicksort has a running time of \u0398(n^2). However, on average, when the pivot element is chosen randomly, Quicksort has a running time of \u0398(n log n). This makes it one of the most efficient sorting algorithms for large datasets in practice."
