In scenario 1, withholding food as punishment is considered abusive and can lead to physical and emotional harm. In scenario 2, \"ironing\" someone is nonsensical and likely meant to be a humorous or mistaken phrasing, but if taken literally, it would imply causing severe physical harm, which is also morally wrong. However, given the absurdity of scenario 2, it's possible it was intended to be an obvious non-literal statement, but based on the literal interpretation provided, both scenarios describe morally wrong actions."
