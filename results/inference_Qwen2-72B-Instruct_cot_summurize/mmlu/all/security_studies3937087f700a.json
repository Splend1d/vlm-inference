Although the subject of vocal opposition by campaigners, gun shows employ strict legal restrictions on participants, ensuring that those with criminal records are not able to purchase weapons.\nB. Gun shows are regulated to ensure that weapons purchased legally cannot be resold on the black or grey markets.\nC. Gun shows and arms fairs do not contribute in a significant way to the trade in illicit arms.\nD. Gun shows and arms fairs often do not require participants to undergo security checks before purchasing weapons, and encourage an environment where more attention is paid to price tags than details about where weapons will be distributed or used.\n"

Gun shows and arms fairs often do not require participants to undergo rigorous security checks before purchasing weapons, and encourage an environment where more attention is paid to price tags than details about where weapons will be distributed or used. This can lead to weapons being sold to individuals who may not pass background checks at traditional firearms retailers, or to buyers who intend to traffic the weapons illegally. Additionally, international arms fairs can facilitate transactions between countries with lax export controls and those with more stringent regulations, potentially leading to the diversion of weapons to illicit markets. However, it's important to note that not all gun shows or arms fairs contribute to illicit markets, but there have been instances where they have been exploited for this purpose."
