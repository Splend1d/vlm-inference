Expressing speech in print\n\nAt the age of three, children are typically not expected to have developed skills such as paraphrasing complex ideas, spelling words correctly, or capitalizing proper nouns. However, they can begin to understand that spoken language can be represented by written symbols and that those symbols convey meaning. This process of expressing speech in print is an important early literacy skill that is developmentally appropriate for three-year-olds. It includes recognizing that letters make sounds and that words are made up of letters, which can then be combined to form sentences that represent what is being said."
