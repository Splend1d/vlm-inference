Hydrogen ions can also be transported by these same MCTs or other proton-specific transporters. While there are cotransport mechanisms in the body for other substances, carnosine does not appear to be directly involved in the cotransport of lactate or hydrogen ions from muscles. Active transport could potentially play a role under certain conditions, but the primary mechanism is through specific protein transporters. Simple diffusion might occur to some extent, but it is not the primary mechanism for these molecules due to their charged nature."
