The spear-thrower, also known as an atlatl, represented a useful innovation because it allowed humans to launch projectiles with greater force and accuracy than they could with their arms alone. This tool extended the range and power of hunters, making it easier for them to take down large game. The spear-thrower dates back to the Upper Paleolithic period, which began around 40,000 years ago, and was used until the end of the Late Stone Age, approximately 10,000 years ago."
