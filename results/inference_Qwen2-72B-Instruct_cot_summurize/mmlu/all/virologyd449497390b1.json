This is indeed quite unique as most DNA viruses have double-stranded DNA (dsDNA). Parvoviruses belong to the family Parvoviridae and their genome typically ranges from 4.5 to 6.4 kilobases in length. The ssDNA can be either positive-sense or negative-sense, but in the case of parvoviruses, it is usually single-stranded with a slight positive-sense bias."
