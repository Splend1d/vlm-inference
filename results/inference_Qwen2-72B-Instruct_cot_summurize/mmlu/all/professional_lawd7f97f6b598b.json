The other options (A, B, and D) could potentially be relevant if there is documented proof or a conviction, as they pertain directly to the claim that the judge is corrupt or has engaged in illegal behavior that might support the assertion that he is the \"best judge money can buy.\" However, unproven accusations like those in option C do not meet this standard."
