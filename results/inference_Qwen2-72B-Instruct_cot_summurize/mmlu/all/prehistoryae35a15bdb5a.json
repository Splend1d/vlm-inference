(which would be around 900 BCE using the conventional calendar) did NOT include:\n\nC. a sophisticated bronze producing industry.\n\nThe Maya civilization is known for its advancements in areas such as writing, mathematics, astronomy, and architecture, but they did not have a significant bronze-producing industry like that of Old World civilizations. The Maya primarily used stone, wood, and other materials that did not require metalworking at high temperatures, which would have been necessary for bronze production. Bronze artifacts found in Mesoamerica from this period are generally attributed to external influences rather than local production."
