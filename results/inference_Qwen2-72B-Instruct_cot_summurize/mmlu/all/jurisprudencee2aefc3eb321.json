Because they are an expression of a capitalist economy and are unnecessary in a socialist society.\n\nMarxist theory views law as a superstructure that reflects the economic base of society. In a capitalist system, individual rights are seen as necessary to protect private property and facilitate market transactions. However, in a socialist or communist society, where the means of production are owned collectively, there would be no need for such individual rights because the community would own everything in common. Thus, individual rights are rejected in a Marxist account of law because they are viewed as a tool of the bourgeoisie to maintain their power and control over the proletariat."
