Humanitarian intervention prioritises the human as the referent object of security, undermining the state-centric approach of realism.\n\nRealism, as a school of thought in international relations, is indeed state-centric, emphasizing the importance of states' interests and power politics over moral or ethical considerations. Realists argue that states should primarily focus on their own survival and security, which often means acting in their national interest rather than engaging in humanitarian interventions that may not directly benefit them.\n\nOptions A, B, and C reflect common realist arguments against humanitarian interventions:\n\nA. Asserts that armed force should only be used in the national interest, which is a core principle of realism.\nB. Suggests that foreign intervention can lead to an unstable peace, which is a concern for realists who prioritize stability and predictability in the international system.\nC. Claims that foreign intervention tends to prolong wars and is ineffective, which aligns with realist skepticism about the ability of external actors to resolve internal conflicts.\n\nHowever, option D does not fit within the realist framework because it describes a critique that comes from a perspective that challenges the very state-centric nature of realism itself. This assertion would more likely come from a liberal or constructivist viewpoint, which places greater emphasis on human rights and individual welfare."
