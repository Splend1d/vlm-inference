Given this characteristic, the scale would be most useful for measuring the intelligence of:\n\nC. children with hearing impairments.\n\nThis choice best fits the description because children with hearing impairments might struggle with tests that rely heavily on auditory instructions or spoken language. The Leiter Scale's nonverbal nature allows for an assessment of cognitive abilities without these potential barriers."
