Given this, let's calculate the cost of goods sold (COGS) for the 50,000 units sold by Ultra Co. in January.\n\nFirst, we need to identify which units were sold. Since the company sold 50,000 units and the purchases were as follows:\n\n- 1/23 Purchase: 40,000 units at $17 each\n- 1/20 Purchase: 30,000 units at $15 each\n\nThe 50,000 units sold would be comprised of the entire 40,000 units from the 1/23 purchase and 10,000 units from the 1/20 purchase (since 40,000 + 10,000 = 50,000).\n\nNow, let's calculate the COGS:\n\n- For the 40,000 units purchased on 1/23 at $17 each: 40,000 * $17 = $680,000\n- For the 10,000 units purchased on 1/20 at $15 each: 10,000 * $15 = $150,000\n\nAdding these two amounts together gives us the total cost of goods sold for the 50,000 units sold:\n\n$680,000 + $150,000 = $830,000\n\nThus, the correct answer is C. $830,000."
