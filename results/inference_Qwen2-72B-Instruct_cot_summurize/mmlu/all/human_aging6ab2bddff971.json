Older adults may have decreased cognitive and physical abilities, which can make it more difficult for them to navigate unfamiliar roads and traffic patterns. This can increase their risk of being involved in a traffic accident. However, it's important to note that older adults can still be safe drivers if they take precautions such as avoiding driving during rush hour or in bad weather, staying on familiar routes, and getting regular vision and hearing check-ups."
