No, because the defendant failed to object after the judge gave the instructions to the jury.\n\nIn order to preserve an issue for appeal regarding jury instructions, a party must typically make a specific objection after the instructions are given but before the jury retires to deliberate. This allows the court to correct any errors before the case is taken from its hands. Since the defendant did not object at the appropriate time, they have likely waived their right to raise the issue on appeal. However, there may be exceptions if the error is deemed \"plain error\" that affects substantial rights, but this is generally a higher standard to meet."
