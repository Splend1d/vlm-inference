Capital gains are not included in DNI because they are allocable to the corpus (principal) of the trust, not to the income portion.\n\nHere are the steps to calculate DNI:\n\n1. Add up all items of income:\n   - Dividend income = $2,500\n   - Taxable interest income = $2,000\n   Total income = $4,500\n\n2. Subtract expenses allocable to income:\n   - Accounting fees = ($500)\n   - Trustee fees = ($750)\n   Total expenses = ($1,250)\n\n3. Calculate DNI by subtracting total expenses from total income:\n   DNI = Total income - Total expenses\n   DNI = $4,500 - $1,250\n   DNI = $3,250\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. $3,250."
