However, the most accurate answer would be:\n\nE. veto legislation passed by Congress\n\nThis is one of the primary checks that the executive branch has on the legislative branch, as outlined in the U.S. Constitution. The President can veto (reject) legislation passed by Congress, and Congress can override the veto with a two-thirds majority vote in both the House of Representatives and the Senate.\n\nWhile the President can call special sessions of Congress (which is option A), this is not considered a check on the legislative branch but rather a tool for convening Congress when necessary. Options B, C, and D are not powers held by the President regarding Congress."
