                    "text": "The problem you've presented involves binomial distribution since we're dealing with independent Bernoulli trials (each coin flip), where the probability of success (getting heads) is constant for each trial.\n\nFor a fair coin, the probability of getting heads (p) is 0.5, and the probability of getting tails (q) is also 0.5. The number of trials (n) is 100.\n\nWe want to determine which of the given options has the greatest probability.\n\nA. H = 50: This means exactly 50 heads out of 100 flips. The probability can be calculated using the binomial formula:\n\n\\[ P(X=k) = \\binom{n}{k} p^k q^{n-k} \\]\n\nwhere \\( k = 50 \\), \\( n = 100 \\), \\( p = 0.5 \\), and \\( q = 0.5 \\).\n\n\\[ P(H=50) = \\binom{100}{50} (0.5)^{50} (0.5)^{50} \\]\n\nB. T >= 60: This means 60 or more tails out of 100 flips. The probability is the sum of probabilities of getting 60, 61, ..., 100 tails. However, due to symmetry in the binomial distribution when \\( p = q = 0.5 \\), this probability is equal to the probability of getting 40 or fewer heads (since getting 60 or more tails is equivalent to getting 40 or fewer heads).\n\nC. 51 <= H <= 55: This means between 51 and 55 heads out of 100 flips. The probability is the sum of probabilities of getting 51, 52, 53, 54, and 55 heads.\n\nD. H >= 48 and T >= 48: This means at least 48 heads and at least 48 tails. This event covers all outcomes except those with 47 or fewer heads or 47 or fewer tails. Due to symmetry, this is equivalent to excluding 53 or more heads or 53 or more tails.\n\nConsidering the Central Limit Theorem, as the number of trials increases, the binomial distribution approaches a normal distribution. For large n, the binomial distribution will be symmetric around its mean, which is np = 50 for heads and tails. The standard deviation (\u03c3) is sqrt(npq) = sqrt(25) = 5.\n\n- Option A is the probability of hitting the exact mean, which, while not the highest probability region, is still quite significant.\n- Option B is less likely because it's asking for a deviation from the mean that is over one standard deviation away (60 heads or tails).\n- Option C is closer to the mean than option B but covers fewer possibilities than D.\n- Option D covers a wider range of outcomes close to the mean, making it the most probable event among the four.\n\nTherefore, **D. H >= 48 and T >= 48** is the event with the greatest probability."
