In his political theory, as outlined in \"Leviathan,\" Hobbes argues that individuals enter into a social contract with their sovereign, surrendering certain freedoms in exchange for protection and order. Injustice, therefore, occurs when someone breaks this contract, particularly by failing to honor agreements or transgressing against the laws established by the sovereign."
