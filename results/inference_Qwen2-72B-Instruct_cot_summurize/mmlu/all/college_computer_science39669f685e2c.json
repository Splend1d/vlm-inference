Range search: Given values a and b, find all the records whose key value is in the range a, b.\n\nWhile hash tables can support fast insert, delete, and search operations (on average constant time), they do not inherently support range searches efficiently. Range searches require some form of ordered data structure, such as a binary search tree or a B-tree, which can traverse the elements in order based on their keys. A hash table does not maintain any particular order of its elements, so it cannot efficiently find all elements within a given key range without checking each element individually, resulting in potentially linear time complexity for this operation."
