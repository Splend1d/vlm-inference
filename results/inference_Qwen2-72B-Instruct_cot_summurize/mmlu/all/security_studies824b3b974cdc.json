A growing effort by governments to prevent the spread of weapons, especially weapons of mass destruction (WMDs). This has led to various international treaties and agreements aimed at non-proliferation, such as the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT).\n\nB. A growth in volume of the arms trade. Despite the end of the intense rivalry between the superpowers, demand for military equipment has remained strong due to regional conflicts, internal instability, and the need for modernization by many countries.\n\nC. A change in the nature of the defence trade, linked to the changing nature of conflict. The focus has shifted from large-scale conventional warfare to asymmetric threats, counter-terrorism, and cyber security. This has led to increased demand for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) systems, as well as cybersecurity technologies."
