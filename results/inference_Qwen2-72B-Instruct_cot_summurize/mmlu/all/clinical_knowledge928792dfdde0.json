As a result, the body increasingly relies on anaerobic pathways, such as glycolysis and phosphocreatine breakdown, to meet the energy demands. These anaerobic processes can lead to the accumulation of lactate and hydrogen ions, causing a decrease in muscle pH, but it does not typically fall below 6.0 during exercise. Blood glucose concentration might be affected by prolonged or exhaustive exercise, but it is not specifically tied to an increase in the number of sprints. The relative contribution of aerobic metabolism may increase during rest periods between sprints, but during the sprints themselves, anaerobic metabolism predominates."
