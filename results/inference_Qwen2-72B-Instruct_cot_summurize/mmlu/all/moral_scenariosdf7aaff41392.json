Not wrong, Wrong\n\nExplanation: In scenario 1, entering a skate park after hours might be against the rules or regulations of the facility, but it is not necessarily a clear moral wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. It could be seen as a minor infraction or rule-breaking, but it doesn't cause harm to others or violate significant ethical principles.\n\nIn scenario 2, failing to vaccinate children due to forgetfulness is considered a clear moral wrong. Vaccines protect not only the individual child but also contribute to herd immunity, protecting those who cannot be vaccinated for medical reasons. Forgetting to vaccinate one's children can potentially put them and others at risk of serious illness. This neglect of duty towards one's children's health and the community's well-being is generally viewed as morally wrong. However, the morality of this scenario could also depend on whether there were extenuating circumstances that led to the oversight, such as lack of access to healthcare."
