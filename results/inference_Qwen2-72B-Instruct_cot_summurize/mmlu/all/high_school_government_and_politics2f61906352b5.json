When two-thirds or more of both the House of Representatives and the Senate vote to override the veto.\n\nThis scenario ensures that there is enough support in Congress to meet the constitutional requirement for overriding a presidential veto, which is a two-thirds majority vote in both chambers. None of the provided options (A, B, C, D) directly address the legislative dynamics necessary for such an override."
