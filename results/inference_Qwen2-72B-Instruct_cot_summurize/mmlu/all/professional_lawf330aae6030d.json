It directly relates to the condition of the escalator at the time of the incident, which is relevant to the case. The fact that the other shopper had to jump to avoid injury shortly before the woman's accident suggests that there was indeed a dangerous condition present on the escalator. This testimony could help establish a pattern of malfunction or a pre-existing hazardous state that contributed to the woman's injury.\n\nTherefore, the correct answers are:\n\nC. admissible, because it tends to prove that a dangerous condition was present at the time the woman's foot was crushed in the escalator.\nD. admissible, because of its probative value in establishing that the woman's injury was caused by the malfunctioning escalator."
