                    "text": "The answer to this question depends on the pH of the solution and the pKa values of sulfurous acid. Sulfurous acid has two ionization steps:\n\n1. \\(H_2SO_3 \\rightleftharpoons HSO_3^- + H^+\\) with a pKa1 value around 1.9\n2. \\(HSO_3^- \\rightleftharpoons SO_3^{2-} + H^+\\) with a pKa2 value around 7.2\n\nIn an aqueous solution at standard conditions (pH ~ 7), the second ionization step would be more favored than the first one because the pKa2 is closer to neutral pH. However, considering the pKa values, at most pHs that we'd typically encounter, you'd expect the concentration of \\(H_2SO_3\\) to decrease as it converts to \\(HSO_3^-\\), which then can further convert to \\(SO_3^{2-}\\). The exact distribution between these species will depend on the pH of the solution.\n\nGiven these facts, none of the provided options is universally true for all pH conditions. However, if we assume the question is asking about a typical pH range where sulfurous acid can exist in an aqueous solution, option B: \\([H_2SO_3] > [HSO_3^-] > [SO_3^{2-}]\\) seems most plausible for a slightly acidic environment where the first ionization step is more favored than the second. This scenario would likely occur in a solution where the pH is below the pKa1 value of sulfurous acid, meaning more \\(H_2SO_3\\) than \\(HSO_3^-\\) or \\(SO_3^{2-}\\).\n\nTherefore, the best choice based on the information given and assuming a typical pH for the presence of sulfurous acid in solution is:\n\n**B. \\([H_2SO_3] > [HSO_3^-] > [SO_3^{2-}]\\)**\n\nHowever, it's important to note that this could change depending on the specific pH of the solution. For example, at a pH above pKa2, you might find that the concentration of \\(SO_3^{2-}\\) is higher than that of \\(HSO_3^-\\)."
