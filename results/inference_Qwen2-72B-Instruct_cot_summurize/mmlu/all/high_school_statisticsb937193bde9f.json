The Z-score of 1.5 corresponds to an area of approximately 0.9332 under the curve to the left of that value (or equivalently, about 93.32% of the values fall below this point). This means that about 6.68% of the values fall above this point (since 100% - 93.32% = 6.68%).\n\nThus, the answer is D. 6.68%."
