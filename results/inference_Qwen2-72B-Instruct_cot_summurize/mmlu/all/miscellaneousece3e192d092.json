External combustion engine\n\nThe steam engine used in early-nineteenth-century railroads is an external combustion engine because the fuel (such as coal or wood) is burned outside the engine in a boiler to produce steam, which then powers the engine. This is in contrast to an internal combustion engine, where the fuel is burned inside the engine itself."
