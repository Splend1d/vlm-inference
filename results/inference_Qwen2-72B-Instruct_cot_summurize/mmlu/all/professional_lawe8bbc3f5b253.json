The businessman had slightly grazed against the drunk man's body. \"Man, are you trying to kill me or something?'' said the very drunk man. The businessman did not think anything of it, since he had barely grazed the drunkard. The drunk continued to bully the businessman, calling him made-up names, and saying things that were nonsensical to the businessman and to others at the bar who were listening to the drunk's boisterous and irrational rants. The drunk then took a gun out of his pocket and shot the businessman, killing him. At trial, the defense argued that the man could not form the specific intent to premeditate for first degree murder. Which of the following crimes is the defendant most likely guilty of under these facts?\n\nA. Voluntary Manslaughter\nB. First Degree Murder\nC. Second Degree Murder\nD. Involuntary Manslaughter\n"

                    "text": "Under the given facts, the defendant is most likely guilty of C. Second Degree Murder.\n\nFirst degree murder typically requires premeditation and deliberation, which the defense argues the defendant could not form due to his level of intoxication. Voluntary manslaughter usually involves a heat-of-passion situation where there is provocation by the victim, which does not seem to be the case here as the contact was minimal and unintentionally offensive. Involuntary manslaughter is typically associated with a lack of intent to kill, such as when someone dies as a result of reckless behavior but without any intention to cause death.\n\nSecond degree murder does not require premeditation but does involve an intentional act that causes death. The fact that the defendant intentionally pulled out a gun and shot the businessman suggests a conscious disregard for human life and a willingness to act in a way that could foreseeably result in death, even if the defendant was too intoxicated to premeditate. Therefore, second degree murder seems to be the most applicable charge based on the information provided."
