The friend was angry with the young man and decided to use the opportunity to get even with him by having him arrested. The friend said he would help, and that night, he drove the young man to the neighbor\u00d5s house. The young man broke in while the friend remained out-side. The friend called the police on his cell phone and then drove away. Police officers arrived at the scene just as the young man was carrying the TV out the back door. The jurisdiction defines crimes as at common law. Of what crime, if any, can the friend properly be convicted?\n\nA. No crime.\nB. Conspiracy.\nC. Burglary.\nD. Conspiracy and larceny.\n"

By agreeing to help the young man commit the theft and driving him to the neighbor's house, the friend entered into a conspiracy to commit larceny. When the friend called the police and had the young man arrested, it does not absolve him of his prior agreement to commit the crime. Therefore, the friend is guilty of conspiracy.\n\nAdditionally, the friend is also guilty of larceny because he assisted in the commission of the crime by driving the young man to the neighbor's house and waiting outside while the young man committed the theft. Even though the friend ultimately betrayed the young man by calling the police, he still played an active role in the commission of the crime and can be held liable for larceny as an accomplice.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Conspiracy and larceny."
