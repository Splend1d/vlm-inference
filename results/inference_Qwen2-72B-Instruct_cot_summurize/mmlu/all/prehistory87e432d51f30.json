New and improved stone tool technologies: During this time, there was a significant advancement in tool-making techniques, including the production of finer, more sophisticated tools like blades, burins, and points, often made using the pressure flaking technique.\n\nB. A broadening of the subsistence base: Humans during the Upper Paleolithic began to rely on a wider range of food sources, including hunting large game, fishing, gathering plant foods, and scavenging, reflecting a more diverse diet.\n\nC. Larger sites with increased populations: As humans developed more complex social structures and more efficient ways of obtaining food, population densities increased, leading to the establishment of larger, more permanent settlements."
