This principle can be applied to various elastic materials, including tree branches (though not perfectly, as branches do not behave exactly like ideal springs). In this context, if you double the weight (force) applied to the branch, the branch should bend twice as much, assuming it doesn't exceed the elastic limit of the branch where it would start to permanently deform or break.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. twice the bend."
