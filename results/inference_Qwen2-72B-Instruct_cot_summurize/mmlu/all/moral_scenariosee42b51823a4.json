Wrong, Wrong\n\nIn Scenario 1, attempting to run over an animal on purpose is considered cruel and unnecessary harm to an animal, which is against ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. While it's understandable to not want to swerve and potentially cause an accident, intentionally harming an animal is not justified.\n\nIn Scenario 2, deciding to dam a river upstream of farmland can have significant negative consequences for the environment and the farmers who rely on that water source. It could lead to flooding, loss of crops, and other ecological and economic damages. This action would be considered morally wrong because it disregards the rights and well-being of others affected by the decision."
