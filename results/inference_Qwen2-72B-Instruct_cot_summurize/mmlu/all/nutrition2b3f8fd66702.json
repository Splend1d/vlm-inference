It is a selenium-dependent enzyme that plays a role in protecting cells from oxidative damage by reducing hydrogen peroxide and organic hydroperoxides. \n\nHere's a brief overview of the other enzymes mentioned:\n\nA. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) - This enzyme is involved in the dismutation of superoxide radicals into oxygen and hydrogen peroxide, which helps protect cells from oxidative stress. Some forms of SOD require zinc as a cofactor.\n\nB. Alkaline phosphatase - This enzyme catalyzes the dephosphorylation of various substrates and is found in many tissues, including liver, bone, and intestinal cells. Zinc is an essential cofactor for alkaline phosphatase activity.\n\nD. DNA polymerase - This enzyme is responsible for synthesizing DNA strands during replication. While there are several types of DNA polymerases, many of them require divalent cations such as magnesium or manganese for their activity, but some may also require zinc as a cofactor. However, the presence of zinc is less critical for DNA polymerase compared to the other enzymes listed. Nonetheless, since the question asks for the enzyme that is NOT zinc-dependent, DNA polymerase does not fit the criteria as strictly as glutathione peroxidase."
