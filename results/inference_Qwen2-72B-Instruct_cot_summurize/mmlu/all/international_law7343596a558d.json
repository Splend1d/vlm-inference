Recognition of governments has largely been replaced by functional recognition.\n\nIn contemporary international practice, the concept of recognizing a government has evolved. While formal recognition used to be a significant aspect of diplomatic relations, it has increasingly been replaced by what is known as \"functional recognition.\" This means that states may engage with de facto authorities or governments without necessarily granting them formal recognition. The focus has shifted towards practical cooperation and engagement based on the reality on the ground rather than on formal declarations of recognition. This approach allows for greater flexibility in dealing with complex political situations, including those involving rebel entities or transitional governments. However, this does not mean that formal recognition has disappeared entirely; it still plays a role in certain contexts, but its importance has diminished compared to past decades."
