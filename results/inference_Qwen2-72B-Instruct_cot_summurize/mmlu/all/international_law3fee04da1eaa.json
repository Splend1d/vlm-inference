The outcome arising from legal methods, i.e., arbitration or adjudication by the International Court of Justice (ICJ), is final and binding upon the parties, whereas this is not necessarily the case with diplomatic or political methods. \n\nIn political methods of dispute settlement, such as negotiation, mediation, and good offices, the outcome depends on the willingness of the parties to accept and abide by the terms agreed upon. These methods often rely on the parties' good faith and may not result in a legally binding resolution. In contrast, legal methods typically involve an impartial third party that has the authority to make a binding decision, which the disputing parties must follow.\n\nOption B is incorrect because both political and legal methods require the consent of the parties to engage in the process, although the nature of the consent might differ. For legal methods, consent is usually to submit to the jurisdiction of a court or arbitrator, while for political methods, consent might be to participate in negotiations or mediation.\n\nOption C is incorrect because both political and legal methods can lead to a final settlement of a dispute. However, the legal methods tend to offer more formal and enforceable outcomes.\n\nOption D is incorrect because there is no inherent rule that legal methods are reserved only for significant disputes. The choice between legal and political methods can depend on various factors, including the nature of the dispute, the relationship between the parties, and their preferences regarding confidentiality, speed, and the form of the resolution. Political methods can be used in any type of dispute, and legal methods can also be applied to a wide range of issues, not just those considered significant."
