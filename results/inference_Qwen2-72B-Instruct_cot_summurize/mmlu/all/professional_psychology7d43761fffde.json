A value of p = 0.5 indicates that half of the examinees answered the question correctly, while the other half did not. This means that the item is neither too easy nor too difficult for the group, and it effectively discriminates between those who have mastered the content and those who have not.\n\nItems with p values close to 0 or 1 are less effective at discrimination because they are either too difficult (everyone gets them wrong) or too easy (everyone gets them right). These items do not provide much information about the examinee's ability relative to others in the group.\n\nTherefore, an item difficulty level of 0.5 is considered optimal for differentiating between high- and low-performing examinees."
