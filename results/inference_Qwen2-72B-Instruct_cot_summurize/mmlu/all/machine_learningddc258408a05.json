Unsupervised learning\n\nThis is an unsupervised learning problem because you're trying to identify patterns or structures in the data without having predefined labels or outcomes to guide the model. The goal is to discover hidden structures, such as groups or clusters of patients with similar characteristics, which could potentially help in tailoring separate treatments. Supervised learning would require labeled data, where each record is associated with a known outcome or category, which is not the case here."
