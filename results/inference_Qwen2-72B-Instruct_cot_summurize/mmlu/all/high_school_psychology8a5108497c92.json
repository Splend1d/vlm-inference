Two-factor theory\n\nThe two-factor theory of emotion, also known as the Schachter-Singer or cognitive arousal theory, is more aligned with cognitive psychology because it emphasizes the role of cognition in the experience of emotion. According to this theory, an emotional experience has two components: physiological arousal and a cognitive label for that arousal. Cognitive psychologists would be more likely to support this theory because it highlights the importance of mental processes in emotion, which is a central theme in cognitive psychology.\n\nA. Social facilitation theory deals with how the presence of others affects performance on tasks, not directly related to emotions.\nC. Thalamic theory refers to older models of emotion that focus on the role of the thalamus in emotional processing, but it does not emphasize cognitive factors as much as newer theories do.\nD. The James-Lange theory proposes that our experience of emotion follows our awareness of our bodily reactions (e.g., we cry, then feel sad), which is more closely associated with physiological psychology than cognitive psychology."
