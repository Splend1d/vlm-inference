Bleeding hemorrhoids do not typically lead to melaena (dark, tarry stools), which is usually associated with upper gastrointestinal bleeding.\nC. Bleeding from first-degree hemorrhoids is not typically associated with pain. Pain is more common with thrombosed external hemorrhoids or with more advanced stages of internal hemorrhoids.\nD. Second-degree hemorrhoids can be returned to the anal canal either spontaneously or manually. They only prolapse during bowel movements and then return on their own or with gentle manual assistance."
