Prohibiting the introduction into commerce food containing contaminants at levels greater than a specified level (a risk-based MRL or tolerance)\n\nRisk management for chemical contaminants in food typically involves setting Maximum Residue Limits (MRLs) or tolerances based on scientific risk assessments. These limits are established to ensure that the levels of contaminants in food do not pose unacceptable health risks to consumers. This approach allows for a practical and science-based method of controlling contaminants, recognizing that some level of exposure may be unavoidable due to environmental or technological factors, but ensuring that such exposures are kept as low as reasonably achievable and within safe limits."
