The mechanism by which non-esterified fatty acids are taken up by cells is by a combination of diffusion and carrier-mediated transport involving fatty acid binding, translocase, and transport proteins.\n\nThis statement is correct because non-esterified fatty acids (NEFAs) can enter cells through both passive diffusion across the cell membrane and active transport mechanisms. Passive diffusion occurs due to the hydrophobic nature of NEFAs, allowing them to traverse the lipid bilayer of the cell membrane without assistance. However, for more efficient uptake, especially in tissues with high demand for fatty acids such as muscle and adipose tissue, carrier proteins play a crucial role. These include fatty acid binding proteins (FABPs), fatty acid translocase (FAT/CD36), and other transport proteins that facilitate the uptake of NEFAs into the cell."
