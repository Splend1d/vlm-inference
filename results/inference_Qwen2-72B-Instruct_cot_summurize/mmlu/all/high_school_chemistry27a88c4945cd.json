How would the first ionization energy value for a neutral atom of potassum compare to those values?\n\nA. It would be greater than both because potassium carries a greater nuclear charge then either chlorine or argon.\nB. It would be greater than both because the size of a potassium atom is smaller than an atom of either chlorine or argon.\nC. It would be less than both because there are more electrons in potassium, meaning they repel each other more effectively and less energy is needed to remove one.\nD. It would be less than both because a valence electron of potassium is farther from the nucleus than one of either chlorine or argon.\n"

The first ionization energy of potassium would be less than both chlorine and argon because a valence electron of potassium is farther from the nucleus than one of either chlorine or argon. This is due to the fact that potassium has a larger atomic radius compared to chlorine and argon, which means that the outermost electron is less strongly attracted to the nucleus and can be removed with less energy.\n\nPotassium has an electron configuration of [Ar]4s^1, meaning it has an additional shell of electrons compared to chlorine (which has an electron configuration of [Ne]3s^23p^5) and argon ([Ne]3s^23p^6). This extra shielding effect reduces the effective nuclear charge felt by the valence electron, making it easier to remove and thus resulting in a lower first ionization energy."
