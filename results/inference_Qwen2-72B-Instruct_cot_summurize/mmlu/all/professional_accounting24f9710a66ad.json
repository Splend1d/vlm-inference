Since the pre-tax cost of debt is 5%, and the tax rate is 21%, the after-tax cost of debt can be calculated using the formula:\n\nAfter-tax cost of debt = Pre-tax cost of debt * (1 - Tax rate)\n\nAfter-tax cost of debt = 5% * (1 - 0.21) = 5% * 0.79 = 3.95%\n\nNow, we can calculate the WACC using the formula:\n\nWACC = (Weight of Equity * Cost of Equity) + (Weight of Debt * After-tax Cost of Debt)\n\nGiven that the capital structure is 20% equity and 80% debt:\n\nWACC = (0.20 * 10%) + (0.80 * 3.95%) = (0.20 * 0.10) + (0.80 * 0.0395) = 0.02 + 0.0316 = 0.0516 or 5.16%\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. 5.16%"
