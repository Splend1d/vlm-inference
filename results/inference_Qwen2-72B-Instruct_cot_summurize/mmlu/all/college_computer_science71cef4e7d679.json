The search for the method then traverses up the inheritance hierarchy through subclass links until it finds the method in one of the superclasses or reaches the topmost class (usually called `Object` or similar), where a default method might be found or an error occurs if no suitable method exists.\n\nThis process is known as **dynamic dispatch** in object-oriented programming, where the actual method to be executed is determined at runtime based on the type of the object to which the message is sent."
