But . . . I conceive great hope that the time approacheth and now is that we of England may share and part stakes [divide the prize] (if we will ourselves) both with the Spaniard and the Portuguese in part of America and other regions as yet undiscovered.\n\"And surely if there were in us that desire to advance the honor of our country which ought to be in every good man, we would not all this while have [neglected] the possessing of these lands which of equity and right appertain unto us, as by the discourses that follow shall appear most plainly.\"\n\u2014Richard Hakluyt, Divers Voyages Touching the Discovery of America and the Islands Adjacent, 1582\nBy following the ideas of Richard Hakluyt, England was eventually able to\n\nA. drive the French and Portuguese governments into bankruptcy.\nB. conquer large parts of Africa in the eighteenth century.\nC. establish several colonies along the Atlantic coastline of North America.\nD. destroy the Dutch commercial empire.\n"

His writings emphasized the importance of establishing colonies in the Americas for economic gain, strategic advantage, and the spread of Christianity. As a result of following his ideas, England was able to establish several successful colonies along the Atlantic coastline of North America, including Jamestown in Virginia (1607) and the Massachusetts Bay Colony (1629). These early settlements laid the foundation for the eventual establishment of the British colonies that would later become the United States."
