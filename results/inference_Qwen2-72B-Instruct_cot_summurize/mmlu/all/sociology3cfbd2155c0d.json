This power was exerted through discipline and surveillance, which allowed for the constant monitoring and control of inmates. The process of entering prison involved a stripping away of an individual's former identity and social ties, as they were subsumed into the role of the prisoner. This transformation was facilitated by the isolation of individuals within the prison system and the constant surveillance they were subjected to."
