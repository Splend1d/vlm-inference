Soundness: If a formula is proved to be unsatisfiable using resolution, then it truly is unsatisfiable. There does not exist a proof of the unsatisfiability of a satisfiable formula using resolution. This property ensures that the proof system does not generate false negatives.\n\nII. Completeness: If a formula is unsatisfiable, then there exists a proof of its unsatisfiability using resolution. This property ensures that the proof system can handle all cases of unsatisfiability.\n\nIII. Succinctness: While resolution theorem proving is a powerful technique, it is not necessarily a succinct proof system. The length of a resolution proof can grow exponentially with the size of the formula being proved. Therefore, this statement is not true in general.\n\nHence, the correct answer is C. I and II only."
