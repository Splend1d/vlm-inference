This is considered morally wrong due to the potential danger it poses to innocent lives.\n\nScenario 2 involves serving urine to someone under false pretenses, which is a violation of trust and consent, and can be considered assault. It is also unsanitary and potentially harmful to the health of the person consuming it. This action is also clearly morally wrong."
