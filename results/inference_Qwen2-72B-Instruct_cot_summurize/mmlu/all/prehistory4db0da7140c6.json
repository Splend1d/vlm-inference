This strategy is typically associated with seasonal or migratory settlement patterns, where groups move between different resource-rich areas throughout the year to exploit various resources at their peak availability. This approach contrasts with opportunistic foraging, which involves taking advantage of resources as they become available without much planning or foresight."
