Peter Singer, an influential philosopher, argues in favor of A or B, suggesting that large organizations can often distribute aid more effectively on a larger scale than individuals might be able to do themselves, even when the recipients are far away.\n\nSinger's argument is based on the idea that these organizations have established networks, expertise, and resources that enable them to reach people in need, sometimes more efficiently than local or individual efforts. He advocates for a duty to help those in extreme poverty, regardless of proximity, and suggests that contributing to effective aid organizations can be one of the most impactful ways to fulfill this moral obligation.\n\nHowever, his views also acknowledge the importance of assessing the efficiency and effectiveness of such organizations, which aligns with option C. While some organizations may operate with high overhead costs or face challenges in delivering aid directly to those in need, Singer still maintains that supporting these organizations can be morally justified due to the significant positive impact they can have.\n\nOption D represents a perspective that is critical of aid organizations' inefficiencies, arguing against donating to them. This view contrasts with Singer's philosophy, which generally supports charitable giving to alleviate suffering, provided the organizations use funds responsibly and effectively."
