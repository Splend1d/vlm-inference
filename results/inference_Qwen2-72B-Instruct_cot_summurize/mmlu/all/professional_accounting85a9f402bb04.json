Review the client's cutoff bank statements for several months after the year end.\n\nThis is because reviewing cutoff bank statements after the year-end can help the auditor identify any discrepancies or transactions that should have been recorded in the period under audit but were not, and also to identify any material events that may require adjustment or disclosure in the financial statements.\n\nRegarding the other options:\nA. Inspecting inventory items that were ordered before the year end but arrived after the year end is part of the normal audit procedures for inventory, but it is not specifically related to subsequent events.\nB. Testing internal control activities that were previously reported to management as inadequate is part of the normal audit procedures for assessing the effectiveness of internal controls, but it is not specifically related to subsequent events.\nD. Comparing the latest available interim financial statements with the statements being audited can be useful in identifying trends or unusual fluctuations, but it is not specifically related to subsequent events. However, if there are significant differences between the interim and annual financial statements that may indicate a subsequent event, the auditor may need to investigate further."
