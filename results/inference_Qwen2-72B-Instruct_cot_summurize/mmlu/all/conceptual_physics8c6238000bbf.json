Since there are four loops, this means there are eight halves of a wavelength along the length of the string.\n\nLet's denote the wavelength as \\(\\lambda\\). The total length of the string, \\(L\\), which is 12.00 m, is equal to four full wavelengths (because each loop is half a wavelength and there are four loops, making it four full wavelengths):\n\n\\[L = 4\\lambda\\]\n\nSolving for \\(\\lambda\\), we get:\n\n\\[\\lambda = \\frac{L}{4} = \\frac{12.00\\,m}{4} = 3.00\\,m\\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. 3.00 m"
