Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn scenario 1, while letting a dog hump other dogs might be considered inappropriate or irresponsible by some pet owners, especially if it leads to unwanted breeding or if the other dogs are distressed, it is not necessarily \"clearly morally wrong\" according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. Dog behavior can include mating behaviors, and unless it causes harm or distress to the other dogs or their owners, it may not be seen as morally wrong. However, it is generally expected that owners should have control over their pets and be mindful of others' comfort and property.\n\nIn scenario 2, putting your son's dishes in the dishwasher and starting it is a routine household task and is not considered morally wrong. It is a normal part of maintaining a clean home and ensuring hygiene."
