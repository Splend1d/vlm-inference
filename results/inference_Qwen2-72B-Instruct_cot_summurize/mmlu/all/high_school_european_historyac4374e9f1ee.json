Yet we may be allowed to doubt whether the union was not a little too speedy and a little too thorough. It is surely carrying unity too far to wipe out all traces of the independent being, for most purposes to wipe out the very name, of such a land as Sicily. It jars on our feelings to find that, while Ireland at least forms part of the royal style of its sovereign, Sicily is no longer even a geographical expression. The island realm of Roger has sunk to be seven provinces of the kingdom on the mainland. And there is another result of Italian unity, a result in which we may rejoice without drawbacks, but which still has somewhat of sadness about it as finally ending that great phase of the history of Europe with which we have throughout been dealing. Never were ties with the past so fully snapped as when the army of Italy entered liberated Rome. Of all novelties in European history the greatest was when Rome became the centre of a dominion with acknowledged metes and bounds, the head in short of a local Italian kingdom. \"Rome the capital of Italy\" was a formula which might well gladden our hearts; but it was a formula which formally swept away the \u0153cumenical position, the \u0153cumenical traditions, of Rome&\u2026.\nBut the kingdom of Italy is not an appendage to Rome; Rome is the head of the kingdom. The whole is greater than its part; Rome, by her own free will and by the free will of Italy, has become less than Italy. By becoming the willing head of an Italian kingdom she has formally cast aside her Imperial traditions as they were not cast aside when brute force made her the head of a French department.\"\nEdward A. Freeman, British historian and politician, The Chief Periods of European History, 1885\nThe author laments the loss of which Roman traditions?\n\nA. Lingual\nB. Religious\nC. Economic\nD. Artistic\n"

                    "text": "The author laments the loss of Roman traditions that were \"\u0153cumenical,\" meaning they were universal or worldwide in extent, particularly those associated with Rome's historical position as the center of a vast dominion with acknowledged metes and bounds. This refers to Rome's status as the capital of an empire that extended across many different regions and cultures. Therefore, none of the options provided (lingual, religious, economic, artistic) directly answer the question as stated. However, if we must choose from the given options, the closest would be:\n\nB. Religious\n\nThis is because Rome's religious traditions, particularly as the center of Christianity and the seat of the Papacy, had a universal or \u0153cumenical influence that extended beyond the borders of any single nation-state. However, this is an inference based on the context of the passage, and the author does not explicitly lament the loss of religious traditions. Instead, he laments the loss of Rome's imperial status and the snapping of ties with the past that came with its transformation into the capital of a modern nation-state."
