Food was the unconditioned stimulus (UCS) which naturally triggered the unconditioned response (UCR) of salivation in the dogs. The sights and sounds of the presenter were the conditioned stimulus (CS), which over time, through repeated pairing with the UCS, came to elicit the conditioned response (CR) of salivation in the dogs."
