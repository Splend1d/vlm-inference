Externalities and should be subsidized.\n\nWhen an individual's actions have positive effects on others that aren't fully accounted for in the market price, these are called positive externalities. In the case of education, the benefits to society (in terms of better workers, voters, parents, and citizens) are not fully reflected in the cost of education to Chris. Thus, education has positive externalities.\n\nWhen a good or service generates positive externalities, it means that society as a whole would benefit from more of that good or service being consumed than what the market would naturally provide at its equilibrium price. This is because the private cost (what Chris pays for his education) is higher than the social cost (the true cost when considering the benefits to society). To encourage the consumption of such goods or services with positive externalities, governments often subsidize them. This helps bring the quantity supplied closer to the socially optimal level, where the social cost equals the social benefit.\n\nTherefore, education should be subsidized to ensure that society reaps the full benefits of having a well-educated populace."
