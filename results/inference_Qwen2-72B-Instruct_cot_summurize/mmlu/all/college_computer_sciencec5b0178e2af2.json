Disallowing any forwarding in the pipeline (Action II) will likely increase the number of stalls in the pipeline, thus worsening the execution time. Doubling the sizes of the instruction cache and the data cache (Action III) could potentially reduce the number of cache misses, decreasing the number of cycles wasted waiting for data from main memory, and therefore improve the execution time.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D.
