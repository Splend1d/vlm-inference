They typically want to observe strangers' activities.\n\nVoyeurism, also known as paraphilic voyeurism, involves obtaining sexual pleasure from observing unsuspecting people who are naked, in the process of disrobing, or engaging in sexual activity. Voyeurs often prefer observing strangers rather than acquaintances. However, it's important to note that not all individuals who occasionally engage in voyeuristic behaviors meet the criteria for a paraphilic disorder, which requires that these behaviors cause significant distress or impairment in functioning or involve non-consenting persons. Also, while some voyeurs may be middle-aged, there is no specific age group that defines all individuals with this interest. And contrary to common misconceptions, most voyeurs do not pose a direct physical danger to their targets; however, their actions can still be deeply intrusive and violate privacy laws."
