Heuristics can provide good-enough solutions within a reasonable amount of time.\n\nIn the context of the given options:\n\nA. A program that calculates a student's grade based on the student's quiz and homework scores does not require a heuristic because the calculation is deterministic and straightforward.\n\nB. A program that encrypts a folder of digital files also does not need a heuristic since encryption algorithms are designed to be deterministic and follow strict rules.\n\nC. A program that finds the shortest driving route between two locations on a map could potentially benefit from the use of a heuristic. Finding the shortest path in a large graph (like a road network) can be a computationally expensive task, especially if the graph is very large. Heuristic algorithms like A* search can help by guiding the search process towards promising areas, thus reducing the number of nodes that need to be explored.\n\nD. A program that sorts a list of numbers in order from least to greatest does not typically require a heuristic. There are many efficient sorting algorithms available that can sort lists deterministically and efficiently.\n\nTherefore, the program that is most likely to benefit from the use of a heuristic is:\n\nC. A program that finds the shortest driving route between two locations on a map."
