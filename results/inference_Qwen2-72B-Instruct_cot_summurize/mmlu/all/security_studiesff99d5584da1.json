They identify various contextual variables such as the global strategic environment, type of provocation, and image of war (option A), as well as conditions favoring success like whether the diplomacy is unilateral or coalitional, the isolation of the adversary, clarity of objectives, strength and asymmetry of motivation (option B). Additionally, they highlight the importance of a sense of urgency, strong leadership, domestic and international support, opponents' fear of unacceptable escalation, and clarity concerning the precise terms of settlement (option C). These factors should be considered by decision-makers at different stages of the policymaking process when engaging in coercive diplomacy."
