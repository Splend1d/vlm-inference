                    "text": "Hydrogen ions (H+) are formed during the process of glycolysis, which is the metabolic pathway that converts glucose into pyruvate and generates some ATP and NADH. However, hydrogen ions specifically accumulate in significant amounts when pyruvate is reduced to lactate under anaerobic conditions, which typically occur during intense exercise when oxygen supply is insufficient for aerobic metabolism.\n\nWhen oxygen is scarce or absent, pyruvate cannot be fully oxidized in the mitochondria through the Krebs cycle and oxidative phosphorylation. Instead, it is reduced by NADH to form lactate in a reaction catalyzed by the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase. This process regenerates NAD+ from NADH, allowing glycolysis to continue producing ATP despite the lack of oxygen. The reduction of pyruvate to lactate also produces H+ ions, leading to an increase in cellular acidity.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer to the question is:\n\nC. pyruvate is converted to lactate.\n\nThis conversion happens during anaerobic glycolysis, which can be considered a major means of resynthesizing ATP under conditions where oxygen availability is limited (option D), but the direct formation of hydrogen ions is more closely associated with the specific step of converting pyruvate to lactate (option C)."
