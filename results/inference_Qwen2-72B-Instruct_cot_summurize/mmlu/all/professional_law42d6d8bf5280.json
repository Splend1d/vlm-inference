The witness can only confirm for the prosecution that a car was stolen, the model and type of car, and that it was missing from the property on a certain date. The defense asks witness \"isn't it possible that my client did not steal the car, that someone else did it, and that the police are lying about the charges against him? The prosecution objected to the question. Will the court likely sustain the objection?\n\nA. Yes, because this is an objectionable question based on pure speculation.\nB. Yes, because it is not permissible to question the credibility of the police without substantial supporting evidence.\nC. No, questioning about the possibility of other perpetrators, or about police misconduct, is always permissible.\nD. No, because the witness may know something that he is not revealing and for that reason, a cross-examiner is given wide latitude in questioning.\n"

No, because the witness may know something that he is not revealing and for that reason, a cross-examiner is given wide latitude in questioning.\n\nIn legal proceedings, the defense has the right to explore alternative theories and question the credibility of witnesses, including law enforcement officers. While the question posed by the defense may be speculative, it is not necessarily objectionable on those grounds alone. Cross-examination allows for the exploration of any information that might affect the reliability of the witness's testimony or suggest alternative explanations for the events in question. The defense attorney's line of questioning could potentially reveal inconsistencies or additional facts that support their client's case. However, the defense would need to provide more concrete evidence if they wish to challenge the credibility of the police officers involved, as mere speculation would not suffice to discredit their testimony."
