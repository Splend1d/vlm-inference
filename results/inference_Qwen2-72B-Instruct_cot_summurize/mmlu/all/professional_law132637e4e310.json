He assigned in writing 25 percent of any future royalties, when and if the screenplay was made into either a movie or a stage play, to his friend, who had subsidized him during his early years as a struggling writer. Shortly after the screenplay was completed, the author was killed in an auto accident. A movie studio then purchased the screenplay from the executors of the author's estate and filmed the movie Quiet Winter, which was a great success. In an action against the executors of the author's estate to recover her percentage of the movie royalties, the friend will most likely\n\nA. lose, because under the circumstances an assignment of future rights is unenforceable.\nB. lose, because the attempted gift of royalties failed for non-delivery.\nC. win, because she was an intended beneficiary.\nD. win, because the assignment of future rights is enforceable.\n"

The author had already assigned in writing 25 percent of any future royalties from the screenplay to his friend before his death. This written agreement should be legally binding and enforceable, so long as it complies with the relevant laws governing such agreements in the jurisdiction where the author lived. Therefore, the correct answer is D.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that this situation can vary depending on the specific laws of the jurisdiction where the author lived and wrote the agreement, as well as other potential factors that may affect the enforceability of the agreement. For example, there may be issues related to whether the agreement meets the requirements for a valid contract (such as consideration, capacity, legality, and mutuality), or whether the friend can prove that she was indeed an intended beneficiary of the agreement. Nonetheless, based on the information provided, the friend should have a strong case for enforcing the agreement and recovering her percentage of the movie royalties."
