The majority of appeals are declined, and the decision of the lower court stands. However, if the Court grants certiorari (agrees to hear the case), it will review the decision of the lower court and may affirm, reverse, or modify the decision. It does not declare mistrials or order retrials directly; these actions would be taken by the lower courts based on the Supreme Court's ruling. Ruling in favor of the defendant is also not an automatic action when an appeal is made; the Court considers the merits of each case."
