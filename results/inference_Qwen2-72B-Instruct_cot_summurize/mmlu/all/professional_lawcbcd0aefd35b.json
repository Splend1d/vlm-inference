The prosecution wishes to introduce a videotape from a pot party Jones left just before his arrest. The recording shows Jones exhaling a giant cloud of smoke and stating, \"that's really great weed, man.\" Jones testifies on his own behalf, \"I'm an honest person. I absolutely did not drive erratically.\" On cross-examination, the prosecutor asks, \"Isn't it true you lied in your divorce trial last year?\" If Jones' attorney objects, the court will likely hold the prosecutor's question is\n\nA.

Not admissible, because specific instances of conduct cannot be proved with extrinsic evidence.\n\nUnder Federal Rules of Evidence 608(b), specific instances of conduct that do not result in a criminal conviction cannot be proven by extrinsic evidence to attack or support a witness's character for truthfulness. In this case, since there is no mention of Jones having been convicted for lying during his divorce trial, the question would not be admissible to prove he lied on that occasion. However, the prosecutor may still ask Jones about the incident if it's relevant to his credibility and if it occurred during the current proceeding or if there was a conviction for perjury or a false statement related to the incident. But based on the information given, option C seems the most appropriate answer."
