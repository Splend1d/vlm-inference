O'Sullivan, who coined the term \"Manifest Destiny.\" During the 1840s, there was indeed an increase in migration to California due to various factors including the discovery of gold in 1848, which sparked the California Gold Rush. At the same time, the Oregon Trail had been well-established by this point, but the allure of gold led to a shift in the direction of westward movement, with more people heading towards California."
