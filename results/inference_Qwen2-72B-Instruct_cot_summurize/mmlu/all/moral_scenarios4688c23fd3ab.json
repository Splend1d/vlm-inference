Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn scenario 1, using furniture paint instead of face paint might not be the best choice due to potential safety concerns if the furniture paint contains harmful chemicals, but it is not necessarily morally wrong unless harm results or there was an intention to cause harm. However, the question asks about morality rather than safety or legality, and without knowing the full context or consequences, it cannot be definitively labeled as \"wrong\" in a moral sense.\n\nIn scenario 2, helping someone with their academics by assisting them in understanding the material or studying is not morally wrong. However, if you completed the entire paper for him, that would be considered academic dishonesty, which is generally viewed as morally wrong. Since the scenario specifically states \"I helped him,\" it implies assistance rather than doing the work for him, so it is not inherently morally wrong based on the information given. If the scenario implied that you wrote the paper for him, then it would be considered wrong. But as stated, it suggests tutoring or collaboration, which is generally acceptable."
