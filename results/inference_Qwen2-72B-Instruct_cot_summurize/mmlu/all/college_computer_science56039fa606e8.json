Operator precedence\n\nA context-free grammar (CFG) is well-suited for specifying the syntactical structure of a programming language, including the order and grouping of operators and operands, which defines operator precedence. CFGs are not particularly suited for enforcing constraints on identifier length (A), maximum level of nesting (B), or type compatibility (D), as these aspects often require some form of semantic analysis that goes beyond the capabilities of a purely syntactic formalism like a CFG."
