Hare, the British philosopher known for his work on ethical theory, particularly in developing the theory of universal prescriptivism, did indeed assert that ethics and science share certain similarities. Here\u2019s how each of the options fits into this perspective:\n\nA. Both seek to provide us with true beliefs about the world.\n   - Science aims to provide true beliefs about the empirical world through observation, experimentation, and hypothesis testing.\n   - Ethics seeks to provide true beliefs about what is right or wrong, good or bad, just or unjust, which can be seen as a part of understanding the world as it pertains to human action and values.\n\nB. Both are essential components of a worthwhile life.\n   - Science contributes to a worthwhile life by expanding our knowledge, enabling technological advancements, and helping us understand and interact with the natural world.\n   - Ethics is essential for guiding our actions, fostering social cooperation, and ensuring justice, thus contributing to a meaningful and morally responsible life.\n\nC. Both involve testing general principles by examining their logical consequences.\n   - In science, hypotheses are tested against data; if the predictions based on a hypothesis do not match the observed results, the hypothesis may need to be revised or discarded.\n   - Similarly, in ethics, moral principles are tested by considering their implications and whether they lead to consistent and acceptable outcomes when applied to various situations. If a principle leads to contradictory or undesirable results, it may require reevaluation or modification.\n\nThese similarities highlight the rational and systematic approaches that both science and ethics employ in their respective domains of inquiry."
