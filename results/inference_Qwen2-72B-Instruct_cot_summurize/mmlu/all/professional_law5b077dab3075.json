The patient's cancer was diagnosed six months later, based on the same X-ray, when the patient sought a second opinion. In the interim, the cancer had spread. Fact and expert discovery have been completed in the action. The hospital has moved for summary judgment. In support of its motion, the hospital has submitted a memorandum identifying facts that it claims are not in dispute. It has also cited and attached supporting exhibits, including a report from the hospital's radiologist, who found no signs of cancer on the X-ray. What is the best way for the patient to raise a genuine dispute of material fact?\n\nA. Submit a report from the patient's expert radiologist contradicting the findings in the report of the hospital's radiologist.\nB. Submit an affidavit from the patient's attorney detailing his conversations with the patient's expert radiologist.\nC. Submit an affidavit from the patient's expert radiologist with findings that contradict the report of the hospital's radiologist.\nD. Submit the patient's medical records showing the patient's current cancer diagnosis.\n"

This would provide direct evidence from a qualified medical professional that there is a genuine issue as to whether the hospital staff failed to properly diagnose the patient's cancer based on the X-ray.\n\nWhile submitting the patient's medical records showing the current cancer diagnosis (Option D) can be relevant, it does not directly address the question of whether the cancer should have been diagnosed from the initial X-ray. An affidavit from the patient's attorney (Option B) would likely carry less weight than one from a medical expert, as attorneys are not typically qualified to make medical judgments. A report from the patient's expert radiologist (Option A) could also be effective, but an affidavit specifically addressing the points raised by the hospital's radiologist would more directly counter the hospital's argument and create a genuine dispute of material fact."
