None of the above can affect the r value.\n\nThe correlation coefficient, r, measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables. It is not affected by changes in measurement units (option A), switching which variable is considered x or y (option B), or adding the same constant to all values of one variable (option C). These transformations do not alter the underlying linear relationship between the variables, and thus, they do not change the value of r."
