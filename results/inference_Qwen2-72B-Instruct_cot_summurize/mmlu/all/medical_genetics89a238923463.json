This is one of the findings that can be detected through routine prenatal screening, often combined with other markers and ultrasound findings to assess the risk of chromosomal abnormalities. The other options listed (exomphalos, neural tube defects, and twin pregnancies) are usually associated with higher than average AFP levels."
