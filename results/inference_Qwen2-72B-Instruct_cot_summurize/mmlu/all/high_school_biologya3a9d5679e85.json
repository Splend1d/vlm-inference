This is where the acetyl-CoA derived from the breakdown of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins enters the cycle to be oxidized and generate high-energy molecules such as ATP, NADH, and FADH2. These molecules are then used in the electron transport chain, which is located in the inner mitochondrial membrane, to produce more ATP through oxidative phosphorylation."
