The man was subsequently tried, convicted, and sentenced to a prison term for the burglary. Three years later, while the man was serving his prison sentence for the burglary, a police detective from a nearby town questioned him about an unsolved homicide. The detective did not know that the man had invoked Miranda at an earlier time. that the man had invoked Miranda at an earlier time. The man waived his Miranda rights and made several incriminating statements to the detective. When he was later charged with the homicide, the man moved to suppress these statements, claiming that his earlier refusal to waive his Miranda rights should have been honored. Should the court suppress the statements?\n\nA. No, because the detective was unaware that the man had originally invoked his Miranda rights.\nB. No, because the man's prior invocation of his Miranda rights did not preclude the later interrogation.\nC. Yes, because the man had earlier invoked his Miranda rights, and the police were not permitted to resume questioning, even after a time lapse of years.\nD. Yes, because the man was incarcerated, and his earlier invocation of his Miranda rights shielded him from further questioning until shielded him from further questioning until he was released.\n"

No, because the man's prior invocation of his Miranda rights did not preclude the later interrogation.\n\nThe key point here is that the man waived his Miranda rights before making the incriminating statements. A suspect can invoke their Miranda rights at any time, but they can also choose to waive those rights at any time. In this case, since the man chose to waive his rights before speaking to the detective about the unsolved homicide, his statements would be admissible in court. It does not matter that he had previously invoked his rights in a different context (the burglary case) as long as he voluntarily and knowingly waived them during the subsequent interrogation."
