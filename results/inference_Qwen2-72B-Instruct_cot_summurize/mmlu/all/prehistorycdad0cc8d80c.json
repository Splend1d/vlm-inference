In many state societies, the elite used their wealth to build grand monuments, palaces, and other structures that served as visible reminders of their power and status. They also often possessed valuable objects such as jewelry, art, and rare materials, which they displayed to demonstrate their wealth and reinforce social hierarchies. This conspicuous consumption helped to legitimize the elite's position at the top of the social hierarchy and maintain control over the rest of society."
