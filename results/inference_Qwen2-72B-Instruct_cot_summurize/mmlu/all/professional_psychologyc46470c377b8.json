However, it may be least predictive of turnover because other factors, such as job opportunities, personal circumstances, or dissatisfaction with specific aspects of the job (like pay, commute, or immediate supervisor) can override an employee's emotional commitment to the organization when deciding whether to leave. Therefore, the answer is D. turnover."
