Changing line 3 to b \u2190 10\n\nChanging line 3 from \"b \u2190 a + 10\" to \"b \u2190 10\" will not affect the results when the code segment is executed if variable 'a' is equal to 0, because in this case, both expressions would result in 'b' being set to 10.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that changing line 3 to \"b \u2190 10\" could potentially change the results if 'a' was any other value than 0. But since we're considering only cases where 'a' is equal to 0 as per the initial condition in line 1, option A does not affect the outcome for that specific case.\n\nOptions B, C, and D would all change the behavior of the code segment:\n\nB. Changing line 3 to \"a \u2190 b + 10\" would change the assignment target from 'b' to 'a', which would likely alter the results depending on the values of 'a' and 'b'.\n\nC. Changing line 7 to \"b \u2190 20\" would set 'b' to a fixed value of 20 instead of adding 20 to 'a', which could change the results depending on the value of 'a'.\n\nD. Changing line 7 to \"a \u2190 b + 10\" would change the assignment target from 'b' to 'a', similar to option B, and would likely alter the results depending on the values of 'a' and 'b'."
