Therefore, the answer that best describes ethical guidelines regarding sexual intimacies with former therapy clients is:\n\nC. Psychologists are prohibited from having sexual intimacies with former therapy clients in certain circumstances (e.g., when there is a risk of exploitation).\n\nHowever, it is important to note that many professional organizations and licensing boards have stricter guidelines, prohibiting such relationships entirely due to the inherent power differential and potential for harm."
