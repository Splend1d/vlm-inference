And Hormizd, King of Kings, conferred on me cap and belt and created for me a higher rank and dignity, and at court and in kingdom after kingdom, place after place, throughout the whole empire he gave me more authority and power in matters of the divine services, and created for me the title \"Kerdir, Ahura Mazda's [Chief Priest]\" after the name of Ahura Mazda, the Deity. And thereupon in kingdom after kingdom, place after place, many divine services were performed in magnificence, and many Warham fires were established, and many magi became happy and prosperous, and many fires and magi were imperially installed\u2026\nAnd then Hormizd, King of Kings, passed away. Then Bahram, King of Kings, son of Shapur, King of Kings, and brother of Hormizd, King of Kings, rose over the empire. And Bahram, King of Kings, also held me in high honor and dignity and at court and in kingdom after kingdom, place after place, gave me authority and power for divine services of every sort.

And Jews, Buddhists, Hindus, Nasoreans [Orthodox Christians], Christians, Maktak [Baptists], and Manichaeans in the empire were smitten, and destruction of idols and scattering of the stores of the demons and god-seats and nests was abandoned.\"\nExcerpt from the inscription of Kerdir at Naqsh-e-Rustam, Persia, late third century C.E.\nThe source best supports which of the following inferences about sources of political authority in the period circa 600 B.C.E.\u2013600 C.E.?\n\nA. Rulers derived legitimacy for their rule by their sponsorship of religion and chief priests.\nB. Rulers were limited in their political authority by powerful religious figures.\nC.

Rulers derived legitimacy for their rule by their sponsorship of religion and chief priests.\n\nThe excerpt indicates that the Persian kings Hormizd and Bahram elevated Kerdir to a position of significant religious authority, and this association with the state-sponsored religion appears to have bolstered their own legitimacy as rulers. The passage mentions that the kings \"gave me authority and power for divine services of every sort,\" which suggests that the rulers' support for the religious establishment was a source of their authority. Additionally, the passage notes that the kings' actions led to \"great dignity\" for the Mazdayanian (Zoroastrian) religion and its priests, implying that the rulers' religious sponsorship helped legitimize their rule."
