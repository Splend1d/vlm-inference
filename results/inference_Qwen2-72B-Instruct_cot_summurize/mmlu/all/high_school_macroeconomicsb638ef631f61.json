This can result in slower economic growth. Labor productivity, which measures output per worker, may actually increase if the remaining workforce becomes more efficient through capital investment, technological advancements, or education and training. However, the overall impact on economic growth is likely to be more significant due to the reduced number of workers contributing to the economy."
