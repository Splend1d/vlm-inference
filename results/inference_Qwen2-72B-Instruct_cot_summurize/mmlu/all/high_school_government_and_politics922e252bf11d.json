Southerners\n\nThe Democratic Party's pursuit of liberal social policies can potentially alienate some of its traditional base in the South, where there may be more socially conservative views on issues such as abortion, same-sex marriage, and gun control.

However, it's important to note that political affiliations and views can be complex and vary widely within any given demographic group."
