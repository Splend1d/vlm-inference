                    "text": "The correct answer is A. Globalization can have both positive and negative effects on food security, but one of the most significant negative impacts is that wealthy countries' subsidies and trade barriers can make it difficult for developing countries to compete in the global market. This can lead to a situation where developing countries are unable to sell their agricultural products at fair prices, which can undermine their ability to invest in their own agricultural sectors and improve food security for their populations. Additionally, global trade can also expose developing countries to price volatility and food price spikes, which can further exacerbate food insecurity.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because while the WTO's Agreement on Agriculture does place some limits on agricultural subsidies, many countries still maintain significant levels of support for their agricultural sectors, which can distort global markets and make it difficult for developing countries to compete.\n\nAnswer C is also incorrect because while supermarkets have certainly played a role in the globalization of food and agriculture, they are not the only way in which these sectors have been affected by globalization.\n\nAnswer D is partially correct in that creating publicly-owned food reserves can be an effective strategy for improving food security in developing countries. However, this alone is not enough to fully realize the potential benefits of globalization for food security. Other factors, such as investment in infrastructure, technology transfer, and capacity building, are also important."
