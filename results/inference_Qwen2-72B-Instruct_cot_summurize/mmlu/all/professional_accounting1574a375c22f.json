Plant assets were retired during the current year.\n\nWhen plant assets are retired, any remaining balance in the accumulated depreciation account associated with those assets is removed, which would result in a debit to the accumulated depreciation account. This action is taken because the asset is no longer in use and will not be depreciated further. The debit to accumulated depreciation would be matched by a credit to the asset account for the book value of the retired asset, and potentially a gain or loss on disposal if the sale proceeds differ from the book value."
