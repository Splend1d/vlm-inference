Here's how each of the factors contributed to this shift:\n\nA. The world was divided into several rival overseas empires: The 19th century was characterized by European powers expanding their influence across the globe through colonization. This led to rivalries over territories and resources, which often escalated into conflicts between nations.\n\nB. Industrialization provided better transport, technology, and administration: The Industrial Revolution brought about advancements in transportation (such as railways and steamships), communication (like the telegraph), and weaponry (including rifled guns and ironclad warships). These innovations allowed for faster mobilization of troops, more efficient logistics, and greater destructive power on the battlefield.\n\nC. There was intense economic, political, and military competition: The scramble for colonies and markets, combined with the desire for national prestige and security, fueled intense competition among European powers. This competition sometimes boiled over into open conflict, as seen in wars such as the Franco-Prussian War and the various colonial wars.\n\nAll these factors together created an environment where war between nation-states was not only possible but also more likely due to the complex web of alliances, economic interests, and imperial ambitions that characterized the international system of the time."
