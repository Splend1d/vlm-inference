Older people generally have a lower energy intake than younger adults.\n\nThis is because as we age, our metabolic rate tends to slow down, and we often become less physically active, which means we need fewer calories to maintain a healthy weight. However, it's important for older people to ensure they still get enough nutrients, such as protein, vitamins, and minerals, even if their overall calorie intake is lower.\n\nRegarding the other options:\nA. This statement may not be universally true, as some older people might consume more fat than recommended, depending on their dietary habits.\nB. While some older individuals may experience specific nutrient deficiencies, it's not necessarily true that multiple micronutrient deficiencies are widespread in high-income countries where access to food and healthcare is generally good.\nD. There is significant variation in dietary intake between older people due to differences in health status, socioeconomic factors, cultural background, personal preferences, and access to food."
