This is known as Malus's Law.\n\nLet I\u2080 be the initial intensity of the unpolarized light. After passing through the first polarizer, the intensity becomes I\u2081 = I\u2080/2.\n\nWhen this partially polarized light passes through the second polarizer that is at an angle \u03b8 with respect to the first one, the intensity is further reduced by a factor of cos\u00b2\u03b8, according to Malus's Law.\n\nSince the angle between the two polarizers is 45\u00b0, we have:\n\nI\u2082 = I\u2081 * cos\u00b2(45\u00b0) = (I\u2080/2) * (cos(45\u00b0))^2\n\nWe know that cos(45\u00b0) = \u221a2/2, so:\n\nI\u2082 = (I\u2080/2) * (\u221a2/2)^2 = (I\u2080/2) * (1/2) = I\u2080/4\n\nThus, the final intensity I\u2082 is 1/4 or 25% of the original intensity I\u2080.\n\nSo the correct answer is D. 25%."
