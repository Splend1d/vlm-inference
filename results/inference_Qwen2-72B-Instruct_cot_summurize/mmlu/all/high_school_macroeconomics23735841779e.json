Allocative efficiency is improved.\n\nWhen a protective tariff on imported steel is removed, it typically leads to an increase in imports as foreign steel becomes relatively cheaper. This reduces the prices for consumers and can lead to lower costs for businesses that use steel as an input. The removal of tariffs also increases competition, which can lead to allocative efficiency as resources are allocated more effectively across the economy.\n\nOptions A and B are incorrect because they describe the opposite effects of removing a tariff. Option C could potentially happen if the removal of the tariff leads to increased demand for domestic steel due to other factors, but it's not a direct or typical consequence of removing a tariff on imported goods. The primary effect is that income is no longer transferred from consumers to domestic producers through the mechanism of the tariff, and instead, there can be a transfer of income from domestic to foreign producers due to increased imports. However, option D is the most accurate answer given the choices provided."
