Marble is a calcite-based stone, which is very sensitive to acid rain. When acid rain comes into contact with marble, it can cause the surface to deteriorate and lose its detail over time. This is because the acid reacts with the calcium carbonate in the marble, causing it to dissolve. Therefore, marble structures, such as tombstones, statues, and buildings, are particularly vulnerable to damage from acid precipitation."
