There is a broad indication of financial reporting fraud.\n\nThe sudden increase in sales at the end of the year followed by a decrease in the next month could indicate that the company may have recognized revenue prematurely to meet targets, inflate performance, or manipulate earnings. This pattern could be a red flag for revenue recognition fraud, which falls under financial reporting fraud. Misappropriation of assets, theft, and embezzlement typically involve direct taking of assets rather than manipulation of accounting records to create fictitious income or assets."
