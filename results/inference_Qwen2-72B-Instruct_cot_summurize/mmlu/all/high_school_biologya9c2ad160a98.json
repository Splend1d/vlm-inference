RNA processing\n\nSmall nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) are essential components of the spliceosome, the complex that removes introns from pre-mRNA during the process of RNA splicing. This is a critical step in the processing of eukaryotic pre-mRNA into mature mRNA, which can then be translated into proteins. Therefore, snRNPs are most closely associated with RNA processing."
