Hierarchy of needs\n\nAbraham Maslow's hierarchy of needs is a theory in psychology proposing that humans can be motivated by a series of hierarchical needs, starting with basic physiological needs such as food and water, followed by safety needs, love and belonging needs, esteem needs, and finally self-actualization. This hierarchy suggests that lower-level needs must be met before higher-level needs can become motivating factors."
