Congruence theory of aging.\n\nCongruence theory posits that successful aging occurs when there is a good fit or congruence between an individual's abilities and demands of their environment. As people age, their abilities may change, and they must adapt to maintain this congruence. This adaptation can involve modifying the environment, changing tasks, or adjusting expectations to better match the individual's current capabilities."
