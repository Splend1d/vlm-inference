In scenario 2, while it may not be advisable for a boat captain to be under the influence of alcohol due to safety concerns, the statement does not provide enough information to determine if the captain's actions are indeed irresponsible or harmful. Without further context, neither scenario necessarily indicates a clear moral wrongdoing. However, it's important to note that operating a vessel while intoxicated is illegal and ethically wrong, but based on the given information, we cannot definitively conclude that the captain is consistently or habitually impaired while working."
