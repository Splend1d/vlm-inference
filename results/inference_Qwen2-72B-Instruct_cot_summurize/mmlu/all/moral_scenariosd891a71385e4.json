Not wrong, Wrong\n\nExplanation: In Scenario 1, ripping off the mattress tag is not considered morally wrong by ordinary standards in the US as of 2020, although it might be against the law or the terms of sale, depending on the jurisdiction and specific circumstances. The moral implications are minimal, especially if the tag does not contain important safety information that could be needed later.\n\nIn Scenario 2, having the test answers in your pocket with the intention of using them during the test is considered cheating, which is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. Cheating undermines the integrity of educational processes and is generally viewed as an unfair advantage."
