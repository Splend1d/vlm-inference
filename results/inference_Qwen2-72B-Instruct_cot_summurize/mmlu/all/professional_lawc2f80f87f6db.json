The artist agreed to pay $800 monthly rent for the third-floor apartment in the retiree's building. The original three-year term had long since expired, but the artist has continued to pay his rent, and the retiree continued to accept it. The building became infested with rats after a restaurant was opened in the adjacent building. The artist could not tolerate the rats and served notice on the retiree that he was moving to another city and has not been heard from since. At common law, what remedy was available to the retiree before she accepted the first rental payment after the end of the initial three-year period?\n\nA. Eviction of the artist for non-payment of rent.\nB. Recovery of the difference between the lease price and the fair market value of the leasehold for a year.\nC. Recovery of double the rent prorated on a monthly basis for the number of months the artist was on the premises beyond the three- year period.\nD.

                    "text": "At common law, when a tenant remains in possession of leased premises after the expiration of a fixed-term lease and the landlord accepts rent, this typically creates a periodic tenancy, often a month-to-month tenancy. The landlord's acceptance of rent after the lease expires acknowledges the continuation of the tenancy under the terms of the expired lease, except that the tenancy is now periodic.\n\nGiven this context, the correct answer to the question of what remedy was available to the retiree (the landlord) before she accepted the first rental payment after the end of the initial three-year period would be:\n\nA. Eviction of the artist for non-payment of rent.\n\nHowever, this option assumes that the artist did not pay rent at all after the lease expired, which contradicts the information provided. The artist continued to pay rent, so eviction for non-payment would not have been applicable. Instead, by accepting the rent, the retiree essentially renewed the lease on a month-to-month basis.\n\nThe other options provided are not standard remedies under common law for the situation described. Option B involves recovering the difference between the lease price and fair market value, which is not relevant unless the landlord can prove that the fair market value is higher than the lease price. Option C refers to double rent, which is not a typical common law remedy. Option D suggests holding the tenant responsible for three years' rent, which is also not a standard common law remedy for a tenant who remains on the property after a lease has expired.\n\nIn summary, while none of the options perfectly fit the scenario described without additional context, the closest answer based on common law principles would be A, but only if the artist had stopped paying rent. Since the artist continued to pay rent, the retiree's acceptance of those payments established a month-to-month tenancy, and the retiree's remedies would be different, such as providing proper notice to terminate the tenancy if she wished for the artist to move out."
