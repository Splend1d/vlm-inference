The male condom\n2. Oral contraceptive pills\n3. Female sterilization (tubal ligation)\n4. Male sterilization (vasectomy)\n\nHowever, since the question specifically asks for the most common method among the options provided, the answer would be:\n\nA. Sterilization\n\nSterilization includes both female and male sterilization procedures. Among married couples, female sterilization (often called \"getting your tubes tied\") has historically been one of the most popular long-term birth control methods. However, it's important to note that the use of intrauterine devices (IUDs) has been increasing in recent years due to their high effectiveness and ease of use. But based on the options given and historical data, sterilization remains the most commonly reported method among these choices."
