Dr. Jones considers Lisa to be a very attractive woman and finds himself having sexual fantasies about her. As an ethical psychologist, Dr. Jones should:\n\nA. recognize that such attraction is normal but proceed with caution.\nB. confess his attraction to Lisa and make it a topic for mutual examination in therapy.\nC. recognize that such attraction is inappropriate and refer Lisa to another therapist without explaining the reason to her.\nD. continue working with Lisa but consult with a colleague if he believes his attraction might be interfering with his objectivity.\n"

If a therapist realizes that their feelings towards a patient might interfere with their professional judgment or ability to provide effective treatment, they should seek consultation from a colleague or supervisor. It's important for therapists to maintain professional boundaries and ensure that their personal feelings do not impact the therapeutic relationship. In this case, Dr. Jones should continue working with Lisa but also consult with a colleague to ensure that he can remain objective and provide appropriate care. Option C is incorrect because it suggests that Dr. Jones should refer Lisa to another therapist without providing an explanation, which could potentially harm the therapeutic relationship and cause confusion for Lisa. Options A and B are also incorrect because they suggest that Dr. Jones should either ignore his feelings or make them a topic of discussion in therapy, which could potentially harm the therapeutic relationship and Lisa's well-being."
