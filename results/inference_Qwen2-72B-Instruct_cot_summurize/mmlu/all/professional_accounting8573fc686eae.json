Nonsampling risk can arise because an auditor failed to recognize misstatements.\nC. Sampling risk is derived from the uncertainty in applying audit procedures to specific risks.\nD.

Nonsampling risk can arise because an auditor failed to recognize misstatements.\n\nExplanation:\nA. This statement describes sampling risk, not nonsampling risk. Sampling risk occurs because the auditor is testing only a portion of the population, and thus there's a chance that the sample may not be representative of the entire population.\nB. Correct. Nonsampling risk is the risk that the auditor's conclusion may be incorrect due to factors unrelated to sampling. It can include the risk of failing to recognize misstatements or errors in the data being audited.\nC. This statement is not accurate as it conflates sampling risk with the concept of audit risk. Sampling risk is specifically related to drawing conclusions based on a sample rather than examining the entire population.\nD. This statement also pertains to nonsampling risk, not sampling risk. The selection of inappropriate audit procedures would be considered a nonsampling risk because it relates to the design and execution of the audit, not the statistical properties of the sample."
