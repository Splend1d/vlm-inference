Animals in zoos are often kept for conservation and educational purposes, and releasing them could result in harm to the animals or people.\n\nIn Scenario 2, whispering to a friend during a movie in a public theater is generally seen as rude but not morally wrong. It might be a breach of etiquette and could disturb other viewers, but it does not rise to the level of a clear moral transgression."
