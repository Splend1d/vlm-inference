Equivocation\n\nThe Dean's response is an example of equivocation, which is a fallacy that occurs when a word or phrase with multiple meanings is used ambiguously, leading to confusion. In this case, the Dean uses the phrase \"one in a hundred\" in two different ways: as a fraction (1/100) and as an estimate of the number of students on campus (which could be interpreted as 1% of some unspecified total). This ambiguity makes it difficult for the visitor to understand the actual number of students on campus."
