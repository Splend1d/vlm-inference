When he was refused admittance, the man angrily shouted to the club's doorman, \"You'll be sorry for this. After I'm through, this club will be reduced to rubble. \" Later that same evening, the man returned to the club with two explosives in his possession. He noticed the defendant leaving the club and followed him into a nearby parking lot. As the defendant was about to enter his car, the man grabbed him, pointed a gun and said, \"Follow me, you punk, or I'll blow your brains out. \" The man led the defendant to the rear of the club, handed him the explosives, and directed him to throw them through an open window of the club. In fear of his life, the defendant tossed the explosives into the club, causing an inferno that killed 25 people. In this jurisdiction, the applicable arson statute includes all buildings. If the defendant is charged with felony murder for the death of the people in the club, he will most likely be found\n\nA. guilty, because they were killings that occurred during the commission of an inherently dangerous felony.\nB. guilty, because duress is not a defense to murder.\nC. not guilty, because duress is a defense to arson.\nD. not guilty, because the defendant was justified under the circumstances.\n"

This means that even if the defendant was coerced into committing the arson by the man with the gun, it would not absolve him of responsibility for the deaths that resulted from the arson.\n\nThus, the correct answer would be:\n\nA. guilty, because they were killings that occurred during the commission of an inherently dangerous felony.\n\nThis choice reflects the legal principle that one cannot claim duress as a defense when charged with murder, even if the killing occurred during the commission of another crime (in this case, arson) that the defendant was forced to commit. Felony murder rules generally hold that anyone participating in a felony can be held liable for any deaths that occur during the commission of that felony, regardless of intent to kill."
