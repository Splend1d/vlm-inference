She delivered her first child spontaneously at 34 weeks' gestation; pregnancy was complicated by iron deficiency anemia. She has no other history of serious illness. Her blood pressure is 100/70 mm Hg. Examination shows no abnormalities. Ultrasonography shows a dichorionic-diamniotic twin intrauterine pregnancy consistent in size with an 8-week gestation. This patient is at increased risk for which of the following complications?\n\nA. Abruptio placentae\nB. Fetal chromosome abnormality\nC. Hyperthyroidism\nD. Preterm labor and delivery\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is D. Preterm labor and delivery.\n\nThis patient has several factors that place her at an increased risk for preterm labor and delivery:\n\n1. **Previous preterm delivery:** A previous spontaneous preterm delivery is a significant risk factor for preterm birth in subsequent pregnancies.\n2. **Twin pregnancy:** Multiple gestations, such as twin pregnancies, are associated with a higher risk of preterm delivery compared to singleton pregnancies due to factors like uterine overdistension and increased frequency of pregnancy-related complications.\n3. **Iron deficiency anemia:** Although not directly causing preterm labor, iron deficiency anemia can contribute to overall maternal health issues that may indirectly increase the risk of preterm delivery.\n\nIt's important to note that while this patient does have an increased risk for preterm labor and delivery, it does not mean that she will definitely experience this complication. Careful prenatal monitoring and management can help reduce risks and improve outcomes. \n\nOptions A (Abruptio placentae) and C (Hyperthyroidism) are not indicated by the given information and are not common complications specifically associated with the patient's history or current pregnancy status. Option B (Fetal chromosome abnormality) could potentially be more common in a twin pregnancy, but this is not necessarily true for all twin pregnancies, and there is no specific indication in the question stem to suggest an increased risk for chromosome abnormalities. However, advanced maternal age (over 35 years old) can increase the risk of chromosomal abnormalities, but since the patient is 32 years old, this is not applicable here."
