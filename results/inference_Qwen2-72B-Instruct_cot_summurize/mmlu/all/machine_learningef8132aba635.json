This usually leads to a reduction in variance because the model becomes less sensitive to the specific examples it is trained on. With more data, the model can generalize better and the variance (the amount by which the model's predictions change if we estimate it using different training sets) tends to decrease. However, it's important to note that this relationship might not always hold perfectly true due to other factors such as model complexity and the presence of noise in the data."
