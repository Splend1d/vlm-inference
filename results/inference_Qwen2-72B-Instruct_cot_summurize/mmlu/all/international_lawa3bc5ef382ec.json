There is no hierarchy among these methods and the choice belongs to the disputing States\n\nThe choice of method for the peaceful settlement of disputes is left to the discretion of the states involved in the dispute. They may choose to use one method over another based on their preferences, the nature of the dispute, and the likelihood of achieving a resolution through that particular method. While political methods like negotiation and mediation can lead to non-binding agreements, legal methods such as arbitration and judicial settlement result in binding decisions. However, the decision on which method to use ultimately rests with the states themselves."
