According to the First Isomorphism Theorem, a homomorphism \\(f: G \\to H\\) between two groups is one-to-one (injective) if and only if its kernel, denoted by \\(\\ker(f)\\), is the trivial subgroup containing just the identity element of \\(G\\). This is because when the kernel contains only the identity, different elements in \\(G\\) map to different elements in \\(H\\), making the function injective.\n\nStatement 2 is False. If a group \\(G\\) has 6 elements and we consider a homomorphism from \\(G\\) to another group, the image of this homomorphism must be a subgroup of the codomain group. By Lagrange's theorem, the order of any subgroup (including the image) must divide the order of the group. Since 4 does not divide 6, it is impossible for the image of a group with 6 elements under a homomorphism to have exactly 4 elements.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. True, False."
