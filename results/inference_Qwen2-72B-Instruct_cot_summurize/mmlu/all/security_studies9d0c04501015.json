To achieve energy security is to ensure that there are currently sufficient energy resources to sustain the current consumption and demand for energy across the globe.\nB. Energy security refers to the ability of the current energy supplies to meet the demands of state military consumption, placing the military at the core of the security paradigm.\nC. To achieve energy security is to secure the supply of energy that is needed in the current context and in the future, with regards to foreseeable changes in demand where relevant.\nD. Energy security refers to the ability of individuals, economic and non-state actors to access the energy required for sustaining their growth and development.\n"

However, option C comes closest to encapsulating the essence of energy security:\n\nC. To achieve energy security is to secure the supply of energy that is needed in the current context and in the future, with regards to foreseeable changes in demand where relevant.\n\nEnergy security generally means ensuring reliable access to adequate, affordable, and sustainable energy supplies for meeting present and future needs. This includes addressing potential disruptions in energy supply, whether due to geopolitical tensions, natural disasters, infrastructure failures, or other factors. It also involves ensuring that energy policies support economic growth, environmental sustainability, and social equity.\n\nWhile military concerns (option B) and individual and economic actor needs (option D) are aspects of energy security, they do not fully capture the broader concept. Option A focuses on current consumption and demand but does not address future needs or the sustainability of energy sources. Therefore, option C best represents a holistic view of energy security."
