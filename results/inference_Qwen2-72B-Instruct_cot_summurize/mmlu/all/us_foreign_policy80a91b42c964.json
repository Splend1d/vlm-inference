On one hand, it reinforced and enhanced the idea of American exceptionalism as the United States positioned itself as the leader of the \"free world\" in opposition to the communist bloc led by the Soviet Union. This narrative of exceptionalism was rooted in the belief that America's democratic values, economic system, and commitment to freedom made it uniquely suited to lead the global struggle against communism.\n\nOn the other hand, the global extension of American power during the Cold War also challenged some core assumptions of exceptionalism. The U.S. involvement in various proxy wars, covert operations, and interventions around the world sometimes contradicted the idealistic rhetoric of spreading democracy and freedom. This often led to criticisms both domestically and internationally that the U.S. was acting more like an imperial power than a benevolent leader. Moreover, the need to maintain a balance of power with the Soviet Union sometimes required compromises on human rights and democratic principles, which clashed with the exceptionalist ideals of American foreign policy.\n\nTherefore, while the Cold War certainly bolstered the narrative of American exceptionalism in many ways, it also complicated this narrative through the realities of superpower politics and global power projection."
