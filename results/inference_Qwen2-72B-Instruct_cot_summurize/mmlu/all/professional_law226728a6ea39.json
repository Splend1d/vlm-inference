That was reasonably foreseeable at the time of contract formation.\n\nFor a contract to be discharged due to frustration of purpose, the supervening event must not have been reasonably foreseeable at the time of contract formation. If the event was foreseeable, then the parties should have taken steps to protect themselves against it in the contract, and frustration of purpose would not apply. Therefore, the fact that an event was reasonably foreseeable would actually argue against discharging the contract on the grounds of frustration of purpose."
