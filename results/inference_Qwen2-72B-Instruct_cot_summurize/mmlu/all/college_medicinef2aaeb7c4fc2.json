Low self-esteem, strong self-efficacy, internal locus of control\n\nHere's why:\n- **Low self-esteem:** David is described as being very hard on himself when he cannot master a section of one of his pieces, which suggests that he may have a negative view of himself or his abilities when he doesn't meet his own high standards.\n- **Strong self-efficacy:** The fact that David is a nationally ranked cellist who was offered a scholarship indicates that he likely believes in his ability to successfully execute tasks related to playing the cello (self-efficacy). This belief is supported by his actual accomplishments and skills.\n- **Internal locus of control:** David's perfectionism and his tendency to compare himself to better players suggest that he believes he has control over his outcomes through his own efforts and abilities. This is indicative of an internal locus of control, where individuals believe that their actions directly influence the events in their lives.\n\nTherefore, option A fits David's characteristics best. However, it's important to note that self-esteem and self-efficacy can vary across different domains of life. In this case, we're only considering David's musical abilities and performance."
