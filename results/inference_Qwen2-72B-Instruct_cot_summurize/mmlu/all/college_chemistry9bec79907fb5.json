However, based on the calculations, it seems there might have been a misunderstanding in interpreting the question or an error in the provided options since the calculated value does not match any of them. Given the problem setup and the calculations, the closest answer is A, but it's important to note that the calculation does not yield one of the exact values provided. \n\nFor the sake of answering the question with the given options, the correct choice based on the closest match would be:\n\nA. 3.02 ppm\n\nHowever, it's crucial to recognize that the calculation suggests the actual chemical shift should be around 7.15 ppm, which does not align with any of the provided options. This discrepancy might be due to rounding errors or a misinterpretation of the question's intent."
