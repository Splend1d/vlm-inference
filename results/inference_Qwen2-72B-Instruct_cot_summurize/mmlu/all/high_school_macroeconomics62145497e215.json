This leads to an increase in borrowing as companies seek to finance these activities. Therefore, the demand for loanable funds increases. According to the laws of supply and demand, when demand increases while supply remains constant, the price (in this case, the interest rate) also increases.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\nD. An increase in demand increasing the interest rate."
