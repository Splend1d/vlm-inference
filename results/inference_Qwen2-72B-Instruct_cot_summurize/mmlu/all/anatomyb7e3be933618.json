It's indeed derived from the second pharyngeal pouch. And it's opened by the action of the levator veli palatini muscle during swallowing or yawning to equalize air pressure on both sides of the tympanic membrane.\n\nHowever, option D is incorrect because the Eustachian tube is actually opened by the relaxation of the tensor veli palatini muscle, not closed by its action. When this muscle contracts, it helps to close the tube."
