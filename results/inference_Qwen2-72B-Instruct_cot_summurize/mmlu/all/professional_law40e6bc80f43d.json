No, provided that the government can show that the agent\u00d5s presence is essential to the presentation of its case.\nB. No, because the government has a right to have its designated representative remain in the courtroom through-out the trial.\nC. Yes, because the agent\u00d5s testimony might be influenced by the testimony of other witnesses.\nD. Yes, because the defendant has a right to exclude all persons who may be called as government witnesses.\n"

No, provided that the government can show that the agent's presence is essential to the presentation of its case.\n\nThe rule regarding the exclusion of witnesses (often referred to as the \"sequestration\" of witnesses) is designed to prevent witnesses from tailoring their testimony based on what they hear other witnesses say. However, there are exceptions to this rule, including situations where the government can demonstrate that a particular witness's presence is necessary for the proper presentation of its case. This could include an investigating officer who coordinates multiple aspects of the prosecution or who possesses unique knowledge critical to the case. Thus, if the government can show that the FBI agent's presence is essential, the defendant's motion to exclude the agent may not be granted."
