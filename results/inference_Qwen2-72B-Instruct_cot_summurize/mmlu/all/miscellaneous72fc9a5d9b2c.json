However, it's important to note that while Jackie Robinson was acquitted of insubordination in a military court-martial during World War II, the charges against him were actually related to his refusal to move to the back of a segregated bus on a military base, not for insubordination in the traditional sense. Robinson's actions and the subsequent trial were seen as an early act of defiance against racial segregation in the military."
