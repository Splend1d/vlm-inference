If the null hypothesis is rejected, the alternative is accepted.\n\nExplanation: While it is true that rejecting the null hypothesis lends support to the alternative hypothesis, it does not automatically mean that the alternative hypothesis is accepted as true. In hypothesis testing, we do not \"accept\" hypotheses but rather fail to reject them. The failure to reject the null hypothesis does not necessarily mean that it is true, just that there is insufficient evidence to conclude that it is false. Similarly, rejecting the null hypothesis means there is sufficient evidence against it, but this does not guarantee that the alternative hypothesis is true beyond any doubt."
