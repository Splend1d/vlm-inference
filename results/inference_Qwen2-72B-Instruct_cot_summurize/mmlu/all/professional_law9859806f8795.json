After telling his employer by phone that he was going for lunch and getting approval, he pulled into the entrance of a restaurant where he intended to have his usual 30- minute lunch break. While entering the parking lot, the driver carelessly ran over and seriously injured a pedestrian. The injured person sued the driver and the driver's employer for negligence in causing her injuries. Is the employer liable?\n\nA. Yes, because of the doctrine of vicarious liability.\nB. Yes, because the employer owned the truck.\nC. No, because the employee was not within the scope of his employment.\nD. No, because liability cannot be imputed from one person to another.\n"

No, because the employee was not within the scope of his employment.\n\nIn general, an employer can be held liable for the actions of their employees under the doctrine of vicarious liability if the employee was acting within the scope of their employment when the incident occurred. However, in this case, the driver was on a lunch break approved by his employer and was not performing work-related duties at the time of the accident. Therefore, the employer may not be held liable for the driver's actions as they were outside the scope of employment.\n\nHowever, it should be noted that whether the employer is ultimately held liable could depend on the specific circumstances of the case and the laws of the jurisdiction in which the incident occurred. For example, if the employer had reason to believe that the driver was not a safe driver or had a history of negligent driving, the employer might still be held liable under a theory of negligent hiring or retention. But based on the information provided, the most direct answer would be that the employer is not liable because the employee was not within the scope of his employment at the time of the incident."
