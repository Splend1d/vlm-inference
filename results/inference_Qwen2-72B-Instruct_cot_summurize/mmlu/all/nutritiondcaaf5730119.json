Alcohol is metabolized in the liver by alcohol dehydrogenase to acetaldehyde, which is then further broken down to acetate. Acetaldehyde is a toxic compound that can cause DNA damage and lead to mutations, contributing to the development of various cancers, including those of the mouth, throat, esophagus, liver, and breast."
