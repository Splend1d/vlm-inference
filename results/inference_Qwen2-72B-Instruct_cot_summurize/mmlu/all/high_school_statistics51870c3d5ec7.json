The formula for calculating the z-score is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{{X - \\mu}}{{\\sigma}} \\]\n\nwhere \\( X \\) is the value of the variable, \\( \\mu \\) is the mean of the population, and \\( \\sigma \\) is the standard deviation of the population.\n\nWhen you change the units from seconds to minutes, you are simply dividing every value, including the mean and the individual score, by 60. This means that both the numerator (\\( X - \\mu \\)) and the denominator (\\( \\sigma \\)) in the z-score formula will be divided by the same factor (60). As a result, the z-score will remain unchanged because the division cancels out in the ratio.\n\nTherefore, regardless of whether the data is expressed in seconds or minutes, the z-score for the student's time remains z = 2.40."
