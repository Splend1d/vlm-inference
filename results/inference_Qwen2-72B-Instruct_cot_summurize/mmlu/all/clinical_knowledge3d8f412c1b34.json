Timing the pulsation with the radial pulse\n\nTiming the pulsation of the jugular venous pulse with the radial pulse is not necessary when examining the jugular venous pulse. The examination of the jugular venous pulse typically involves observing the neck veins while the patient is in a semi-recumbent position (lying at about a 30-45 degree angle), with their neck relaxed and slightly extended, under good lighting conditions. Comparing the jugular venous pulsation to the radial pulse does not contribute to the assessment of central venous pressure or other clinical information that can be obtained from observing the jugular venous pulse."
