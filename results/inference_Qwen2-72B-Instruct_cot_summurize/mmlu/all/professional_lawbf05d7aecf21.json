City residents have recently complained that the surfers are creating a public nuisance by littering the beaches, harassing sunbathers, and injuring swimmers with their surfboards. As a consequence, the city adopted an ordinance prohibiting all surfing on its beaches. The newly enacted ordinance further prohibited the sale of surfboards within the city's limits. An out of state surfboard manufacturer had planned to sell a new line of fiberglass surfboards in the city in the upcoming year. This is now precluded by the recently adopted measure. If the manufacturer seeks to enjoin application of the city ordinance, which of the following is the WEAKEST defense for the city?\n\nA. There is no case or controversy.\nB. The manufacturer's case is moot.\nC. The manufacturer lacks standing.\nD. The case is not ripe.\n"

The manufacturer's case is moot.\n\nA case becomes moot when the issues presented are no longer live or the party bringing the suit no longer has a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy. In this scenario, the manufacturer still has a direct interest in challenging the ordinance because it directly affects their ability to sell their products in the city. The ordinance is currently in place and actively preventing the manufacturer from selling surfboards, so the case is not moot. The controversy is ongoing and the manufacturer has a clear financial incentive to challenge the law."
