They can be transmitted when an infected person coughs or sneezes, releasing droplets that contain the virus into the air. These droplets can then be inhaled by others nearby. Additionally, surfaces contaminated with the virus can also serve as a source of infection if someone touches the surface and then touches their nose, mouth, or eyes."
