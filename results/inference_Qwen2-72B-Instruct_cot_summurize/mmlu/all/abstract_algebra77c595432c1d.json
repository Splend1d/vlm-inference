If an element has order 15, then its powers until reaching the identity form a cyclic subgroup of order 15. Specifically, if \\(a\\) is an element of order 15, then \\(\\langle a \\rangle = \\{e, a, a^2, \\ldots, a^{14}\\}\\) forms a cyclic subgroup of order 15.\n\nHowever, not all elements in this subgroup will necessarily have order 15. In fact, the only elements with order 15 are those that generate the entire subgroup, which are precisely the elements \\(a^k\\) for \\(\\gcd(k, 15) = 1\\). The numbers less than 15 that are coprime to 15 are 1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 11, 13, and 14, making exactly 8 such elements. Therefore, **Statement 1 is True**.\n\n### Statement 2\n\nIf a group has more than 8 elements of order 15, does it mean the group must have at least 16 elements of order 15?\n\nGiven that we've established there are exactly 8 elements of order 15 in any cyclic subgroup generated by an element of order 15, having more than 8 elements of order 15 implies that there must be another (disjoint) set of elements of order 15. This additional set would also contain exactly 8 elements of order 15 (for the same reason as above), leading to a total of at least 16 elements of order 15. Therefore, **Statement 2 is True**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth statements are true, so the correct answer is **A. True, True**."
