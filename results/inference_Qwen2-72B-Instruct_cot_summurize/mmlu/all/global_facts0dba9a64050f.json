This is not an exact match to any of your options, but it's closest to option A (60%). However, it's important to note that this number refers specifically to the favorable view of the German people and their country, rather than the relationship between the two countries. As of my last update, no precise figure for the percentage of Americans who say the relationship between the U.S. and Germany is \"good\" was available, but it's likely to be similar. So, the answer would be:\n\nA. 60% (as the closest approximation based on the available data)."
