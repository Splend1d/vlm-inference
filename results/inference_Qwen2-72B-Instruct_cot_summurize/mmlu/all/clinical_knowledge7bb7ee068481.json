It is mild and does not cause irritation to oral tissues. While hydrogen peroxide can be used as a mouth rinse in diluted form, it's not typically recommended for general mouth cleaning due to its potential to irritate sensitive tissues. Water is also commonly used for rinsing the mouth but may not have the same cleansing properties as saline. Lemon and glycerine swabs are not standard for mouth cleaning and could potentially cause irritation or other issues."
