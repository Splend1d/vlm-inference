                    "text": "The principle that governs the balance of a see-saw is the conservation of torque (rotational force) around the fulcrum. The torque produced by each person is given by the product of their mass and the perpendicular distance from the fulcrum. For the see-saw to be balanced, the torques on both sides must be equal.\n\nLet's denote the initial distance of each child from the fulcrum as \\(d\\).\n\nFor the initial condition:\n- Torque by the girl = \\(m \\times d\\)\n- Torque by the boy = \\(2m \\times d = 2md\\)\n\nSince the boy's torque is greater than the girl's, the see-saw tilts in favor of the boy.\n\nNow let's evaluate the options:\n\nA. Move the boy to half his original distance from the fulcrum.\nNew torque by the boy = \\(2m \\times \\frac{d}{2} = md\\). This balances the see-saw because the girl's torque remains \\(md\\).\n\nB. Move the girl to double her original distance from the fulcrum.\nNew torque by the girl = \\(m \\times 2d = 2md\\). This also balances the see-saw because the boy's torque remains \\(2md\\).\n\nC. Allow a second girl of mass \\(m\\) to join the first.\nTotal torque by the girls = \\(2m \\times d = 2md\\). This balances the see-saw because the boy's torque remains \\(2md\\).\n\nD. Move the fulcrum to half its original distance from the boy.\nIf you move the fulcrum closer to the boy, you're decreasing the distance \\(d\\) for the boy but increasing it for the girl. However, since the boy's mass is twice the girl's, simply halving the distance won't balance the see-saw. Let's calculate the new torques:\n- New distance for the boy = \\(\\frac{d}{2}\\), so his torque becomes \\(2m \\times \\frac{d}{2} = md\\).\n- New distance for the girl = \\(\\frac{3d}{2}\\) (since the fulcrum is moved halfway towards the boy, effectively making her distance 1.5 times what it was before), so her torque becomes \\(m \\times \\frac{3d}{2} = \\frac{3md}{2}\\).\n\nThus, the see-saw would still tilt in favor of the girl because her torque (\\(\\frac{3md}{2}\\)) is greater than the boy's (\\(md\\)) after moving the fulcrum.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **D**. Moving the fulcrum to half its original distance from the boy would not balance the see-saw."
