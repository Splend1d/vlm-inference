These acts specifically aimed to restrict the use of foreign ships for trade between England and its colonies, thereby promoting English shipping and commerce.\n\nAmong the options provided:\n\nA. Thomas Malthus is best known for his theory on population growth outpacing food supply, which does not directly relate to the Navigation Acts.\n\nB. Josiah Child was a merchant and economist who advocated for free trade, lower interest rates, and the reduction of taxes, which contrasts with the restrictive measures imposed by the Navigation Acts.\n\nC. Adam Smith is often considered the father of modern economics and is famous for advocating free trade and criticizing mercantilism. His theories emphasize the benefits of the division of labor and the invisible hand of the market. The Navigation Acts would certainly conflict with his belief in free trade.\n\nD. Jean-Baptiste Colbert was a French statesman who served as the Minister of Finances under King Louis XIV. He was a proponent of mercantilism, so his theories would align more closely with the spirit of the Navigation Acts rather than conflict with them.\n\nGiven these options, the answer that most clearly conflicts with the Navigation Acts is **C. Adam Smith**, due to his advocacy for free trade and criticism of mercantilist policies."
