Captives selected for sacrifice were often well-fed and treated with relative care before their sacrifice as a way to honor the gods with the best offerings possible. This treatment included the use of coca leaves, which had religious and medicinal significance, and the consumption of chicha, a fermented maize beverage. However, it's important to note that while some sources suggest this improved diet and treatment, others describe more gruesome preparations, so the specific practices could vary."
