To account for all possible referent objects and expand the definition of security so far as to allow for a broadening of the school to encompass any agent that threatens those referent objects. This approach seeks to broaden the scope of security studies beyond traditional military concerns and state-centric perspectives, allowing for a more inclusive and comprehensive understanding of security threats and challenges. This includes considering non-traditional security issues such as environmental, economic, and human security, and recognizing a wider range of actors that can affect security outcomes."
