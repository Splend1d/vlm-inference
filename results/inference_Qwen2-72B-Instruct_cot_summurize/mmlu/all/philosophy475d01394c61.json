She argues against the Kantian idea that moral agents can create their own moral laws, suggesting instead that moral obligations arise from the nature of actions and the world, not from self-imposed rules. This criticism is part of Anscombe's broader argument against modern moral philosophy, which she believes has been misguided since the time of Kant."
