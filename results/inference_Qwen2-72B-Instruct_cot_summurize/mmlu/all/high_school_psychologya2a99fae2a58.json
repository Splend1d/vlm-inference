It indicates that the child has formed an attachment to their caregiver and becomes upset when that person is not present. This is different from attachment anxiety, which refers to a general worry or fear about the availability or responsiveness of the attachment figure, and reactive attachment disorder, which is a more severe condition involving problems in forming healthy attachments, usually due to early neglect or abuse. Object permanence, while also developing around this age, refers to the understanding that objects continue to exist even when they cannot be seen, heard, or touched."
