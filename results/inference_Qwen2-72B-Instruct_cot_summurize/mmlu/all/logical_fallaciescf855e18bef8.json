The fallacy of extension, also known as the fallacy of composition, occurs when someone assumes that what is true for the parts must also be true for the whole. For example, if every player on a football team is good, then the team as a whole must be good. This is not necessarily true, as the performance of a team depends on how well the players work together, not just on their individual abilities.\n\nHowever, if we have to choose from the given options, option D comes closest to describing a different fallacy, the fallacy of complex question (also known as many questions fallacy), which involves asking a question that contains several assumptions or propositions, and treating an answer to any part of the question as an answer to the whole. But this is not the fallacy of extension."
