Her temperature is 36.7\u00b0C (98\u00b0F), pulse is 130/min and irregularly irregular, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 98/60 mm Hg. Jugular venous pressure is not increased. Bilateral crackles are heard at the lung bases. There is an opening snap followed by a low-pitched diastolic murmur at the third left intercostal space. An x-ray of the chest shows left atrial enlargement, a straight left cardiac border, and pulmonary venous engorgement. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for these findings?\n\nA. Aortic valve insufficiency\nB. Aortic valve stenosis\nC. Mitral valve insufficiency\nD. Mitral valve stenosis\n"

The opening snap heard on auscultation is caused by the sudden opening of the stenotic mitral valve in early diastole, followed by a low-pitched diastolic murmur due to turbulent blood flow across the narrowed valve. The chest x-ray findings of left atrial enlargement, a straight left cardiac border, and pulmonary venous engorgement also support the diagnosis of mitral valve stenosis."
