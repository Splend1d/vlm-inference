Assign numbers 0, 1 to successfully selling a policy to a customer and numbers 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 to failing to sell a policy to a customer.\n\nThis is because the probability of success (selling a policy) is 20%, or 0.2. In order to simulate this using a random digit generator (which usually generates digits from 0 to 9), we need to have 2 digits out of 10 (i.e., 20% of the total) represent a successful sale. Therefore, assigning 0 and 1 to represent a successful sale and the remaining digits (2 through 9) to represent a failure accurately reflects the given probability."
