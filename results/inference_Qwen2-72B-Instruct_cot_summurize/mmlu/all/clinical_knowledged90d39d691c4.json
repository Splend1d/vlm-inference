If a blood unit has been out of refrigeration for longer than the accepted time limit, you should return it to the blood bank and inform them of why you have done so. Blood products must be stored and handled properly to maintain their safety and efficacy. Once a blood product has been out of controlled temperature storage for too long, it can no longer be considered safe for transfusion due to the risk of bacterial growth or other degradation that could harm the patient. The blood bank will then follow their procedures for handling such situations, which may include testing the unit or discarding it."
