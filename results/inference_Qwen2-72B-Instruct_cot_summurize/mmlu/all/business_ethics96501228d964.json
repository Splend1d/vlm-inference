Carroll's widely recognized model, Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) can be divided into four interrelated categories: economic, legal, ethical, and philanthropic responsibilities. This model is often referred to as the \"Pyramid of CSR.\" Here's a brief explanation of each category:\n\n1. **Economic Responsibility**: This refers to the company's obligation to be profitable, maintain sound financial health, and provide goods and services that society wants and needs.\n\n2. **Legal Responsibility**: This involves the company's duty to abide by all laws and regulations applicable to its operations.\n\n3. **Ethical Responsibility**: This pertains to the company's responsibility to do what is right, fair, and just beyond what the law requires. It includes treating stakeholders with respect, avoiding harm, and acting in ways that are consistent with societal norms and values.\n\n4. **Philanthropic Responsibility**: This is the company's voluntary commitment to contribute to society and engage in activities that improve community welfare, which may not necessarily have any direct impact on the company's profitability.\n\nThis model suggests that businesses should not only focus on making profits but also consider their broader impact on society and take steps to address social issues through these four dimensions of responsibility."
