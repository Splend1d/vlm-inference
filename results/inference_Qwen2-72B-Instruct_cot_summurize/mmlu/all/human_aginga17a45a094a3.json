Quasi-experimental\n\nQuasi-experimental designs are often used when it's not possible or ethical to randomly assign participants to different groups (as would be done in a true experimental design). Instead, researchers compare existing groups that differ on some variable of interest. This approach can help determine if there are differences between groups and suggest possible causal relationships, although it may not definitively establish causality due to potential confounding variables.\n\nWhile longitudinal, correlational, and cross-sequential studies can also be useful for comparing groups, they are not primarily designed to examine group differences in the context of quasi-experimental manipulation. Longitudinal studies follow the same subjects over time, correlational studies look at associations between variables without manipulating them, and cross-sequential studies combine elements of both longitudinal and cross-sectional designs to examine age-related changes across different cohorts."
