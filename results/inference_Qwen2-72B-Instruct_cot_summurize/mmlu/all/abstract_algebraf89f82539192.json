In a finite-dimensional vector space, any linearly independent set of vectors can be extended to a basis by adding more linearly independent vectors until the set spans the entire vector space. This is a fundamental theorem in linear algebra.\n\nStatement 2: This statement is also true. It is known as the \"dimension theorem\" or \"invariance of domain,\" which states that all bases of a given vector space have the same number of elements. This number is called the dimension of the vector space. Thus, if \\(B_1\\) and \\(B_2\\) are bases for the same vector space, then \\(|B_1| = |B_2|\\)."
