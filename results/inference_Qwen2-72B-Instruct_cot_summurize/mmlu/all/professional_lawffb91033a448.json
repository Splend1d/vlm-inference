                    "text": "The applicable doctrine in this case is C. Doctrine of Worthier Title.\n\nThe doctrine of worthier title holds that when an estate is granted to someone and then to their heirs, the grantor cannot reserve a future interest in the heirs because it is a lesser interest than what was granted to the first party. In other words, the title that passes to the heir is \"worthier\" or more valuable than the reversionary interest reserved by the grantor.\n\nIn this scenario, the homeowner conveyed the property to his cousin for life, with remainder to the homeowner's heirs. The cousin then conveyed the property to the farmer for as long as he would continue to farm the property. When the cousin died, the homeowner's heirs claimed the property. However, under the doctrine of worthier title, the conveyance to the farmer took precedence over the remainder interest of the homeowner's heirs because the farmer's interest was a present possessory interest, while the heirs' interest was a future interest. Therefore, the court would likely rule that the farmer has a better claim to the property than the homeowner's heirs."
