It's a common meal and does not violate any ordinary moral standards.\nScenario 2: Following your wife into the fitting room might be against store policy or considered inappropriate due to privacy concerns, but it doesn't necessarily rise to the level of being morally wrong if there was no malicious intent or violation of consent. However, it could be seen as socially awkward or disrespectful to her privacy, depending on the context and her feelings about the situation. Without additional context, it's difficult to label this action as clearly morally wrong."
