Adding a sprinkle of cinnamon to coffee isn't typically considered a moral wrongdoing unless there's a specific reason it would be harmful or wrong to do so, such as if someone has an allergy to cinnamon and you knew this. Recording people in a dressing room, however, is a clear violation of privacy and is morally wrong and often illegal."
