This principle requires that the measures taken by the victim state must be proportional to the threat or harm suffered and should not exceed what is necessary to address the situation. It aims to prevent unnecessary escalation and limit the damage caused by the response.\n\nOption A suggests an eye-for-an-eye approach, which does not necessarily align with the concept of proportionality as it does not take into account the specific circumstances or necessity of the response.\n\nOption B allows for unlimited use of force, which clearly violates the principle of proportionality and could lead to unjustified escalation and excessive harm.\n\nOption D pertains to the role of the United Nations Security Council in authorizing actions under Chapter VII of the UN Charter, but it does not directly relate to the principle of proportionality in a self-help scenario where immediate action might be required before the Security Council can convene or make a decision. However, actions taken in self-defense must still adhere to the principles of necessity and proportionality even if they precede or occur without explicit Security Council approval."
