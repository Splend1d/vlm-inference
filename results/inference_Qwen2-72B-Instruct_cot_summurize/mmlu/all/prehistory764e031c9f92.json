This is a rare opportunity in paleoanthropology, as finding remains of multiple individuals from the same species in one location is uncommon. The site, known as the \"Cave of the Bones\" or Sima de los Huesos in Spanish, has been crucial for understanding the evolutionary history of the Neanderthals."
