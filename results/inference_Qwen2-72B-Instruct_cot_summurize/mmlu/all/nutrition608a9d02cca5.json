Transaminases require a coenzyme derived from vitamin B6.\n\nTransamination is a reversible enzymatic process in which an amino group is transferred from one amino acid to a keto acid, forming another amino acid and a new keto acid. The reaction is catalyzed by enzymes called transaminases, which require pyridoxal phosphate, a coenzyme derived from vitamin B6, as a cofactor. This process plays a crucial role in amino acid metabolism, allowing for the interconversion of amino acids and the recycling of nitrogen groups."
