In this stage, therapists have a well-developed understanding of their own racial identity and how it influences their perceptions and interactions. They are able to integrate this awareness into their therapeutic practice, allowing them to work effectively with individuals from diverse backgrounds.\n\nIt's important to note that while this model can provide a framework for understanding how racial identity might affect a therapist's effectiveness, it's not a hard-and-fast rule. Many other factors also contribute to the success of therapy, including the specific needs of the client, the therapeutic relationship, and the therapist's overall skill and experience."
