In Scenario 2, while it might initially seem like a mistake, if the individual realizes the error and does not make an effort to return the luggage or report the mix-up, it could be seen as morally wrong due to the failure to rectify the mistake. However, since the question assumes only the act of grabbing the wrong luggage, without further context about whether the individual realized the mistake and what they did next, the initial action itself may not be inherently morally wrong, especially if done unintentionally."
