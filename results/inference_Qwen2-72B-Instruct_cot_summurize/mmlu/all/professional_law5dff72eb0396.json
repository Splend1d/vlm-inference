This privilege can extend to others present if they are necessary for the consultation or are representatives of the client or the attorney. In this case, the secretary was taking notes as part of her job, and the law clerk was present with the client's permission to observe the process. Therefore, the secretary's proposed testimony would likely be considered inadmissible due to the attorney-client privilege."
