When one of her tenants vacated his apartment, the woman placed an advertisement in the local paper that read as follows: \"Large two-bedroom apartment available for rent. White male preferred.\" The woman's preference was motivated by the fact that she liked to have a mix of tenants of both genders and from various racial and ethnic backgrounds in her building, and of the remaining rented units, one was rented to an African American man and the other to a Pacific Islander woman. Based upon these facts, which of the following statements is true?\n\nA. The federal Fair Housing Act makes it illegal for the woman to refuse to rent her units to prospective tenants because of their race or gender.\nB. The woman's motive absolves her from any liability under the federal Fair Housing Act.\nC. There are no violations of any federal laws under these facts.\nD. Under the federal Fair Housing Act, the woman was not permitted to state a racial or gender preference in the advertisement.\n"

Under the federal Fair Housing Act, the woman was not permitted to state a racial or gender preference in the advertisement.\n\nThe Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination in housing on the basis of race, color, national origin, religion, sex, familial status, or disability. This includes making statements that express a preference for or limitation based on these protected characteristics in advertisements for housing. While the woman's motive may have been to create a diverse mix of tenants, stating a preference for a \"white male\" in the advertisement is a violation of the Fair Housing Act."
