                    "text": "The correct answer is B. Gene flow between Neandertals and anatomically modern humans occurred after anatomically modern humans migrated out of Africa.\n\nThis is because the genetic evidence suggests that Neandertal DNA is found in non-African populations, which implies that gene flow between Neandertals and anatomically modern humans occurred after the latter left Africa and encountered Neandertals in Eurasia. This is consistent with archaeological evidence that suggests that anatomically modern humans migrated out of Africa around 60,000-70,000 years ago, while Neandertals were already present in Eurasia at that time. Therefore, any gene flow between the two groups would have occurred outside of Africa."
