Ask them to hold their breath at the end of the inspiration on using the inhaler.\n\nTo ensure that a large proportion of the drug from an inhaler reaches the lower airways, it's important to have the patient use proper inhalation technique. This includes:\n\n1. **Exhale completely before bringing the inhaler to their mouth.**\n2. **Inhale slowly and deeply through the inhaler while pressing down on the canister to release the medication.**\n3. **Hold the breath for 10 seconds after inhaling the medication to allow the medication to settle in the lungs.**\n4. **Wait at least one minute between puffs if multiple puffs are needed.**\n\nHolding the breath after inhalation helps to maximize the deposition of the medication in the lower airways by allowing time for the aerosol particles to settle rather than being exhaled immediately. Taking slow, deep breaths also helps to achieve better delivery of the medication compared to quick, shallow breaths."
