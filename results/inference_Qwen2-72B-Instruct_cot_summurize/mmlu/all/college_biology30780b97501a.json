                    "text": "The correct answer is B. C4 plants fix CO2 in the mesophyll cells using the enzyme PEP carboxylase to form a 4-carbon compound that is then transported to the bundle sheath cells where the Calvin cycle takes place. This spatial separation reduces photorespiration because the high CO2 concentration in the bundle sheath cells favors the action of Rubisco for carboxylation over oxygenation. In contrast, CAM plants also use PEP carboxylase to fix CO2, but they do so at night when stomata are open and CO2 can enter the leaf. The fixed CO2 is stored as malate (a 4-carbon compound) in vacuoles of mesophyll cells. During the day, when stomata close to conserve water, the malate is decarboxylated, releasing CO2 for the Calvin cycle in the mesophyll cells. This temporal separation of CO2 fixation and the Calvin cycle also reduces photorespiration by creating a high CO2 environment during the day when photorespiration would otherwise be high due to high temperatures and light intensity."
