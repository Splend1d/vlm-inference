A business owner owns the central parcel in fee simple and maintains his dwelling house thereon. He has a right-of-way, granted in a written agreement, across the eastern parcel for crossing the eastern parcel on foot, by bicycle, or automobile. A landscaper is the owner of the eastern parcel. An investor owns the western parcel and conveys it to the business owner in fee simple. The business owner then builds a 15-story office building, covering the western parcel and the central parcel, which houses 6,000 persons during working hours each day. All of these persons use the right-of-way over the eastern parcel, and the business owner uses the way for delivering as many as 30 loads of supplies per day to the office building. In an action by the landscaper to enjoin the business owner and the office workers from using the right- of-way across the eastern parcel, the court will most likely hold that\n\nA. the business owner's right-of-way would be extinguished due to excessive use by the office workers.\nB. the business owner's right-of-way would be forfeited due to the unauthorized use by the office workers.\nC. the business owner, by making use of the right-of-way beyond the scope of the original privilege, would permanently be enjoined from using the servient tenement.\nD. Although the business owner may continue to use the right-of-way, the office workers would be enjoined from making such use.\n"

Although the business owner may continue to use the right-of-way, the office workers would be enjoined from making such use.\n\nThe business owner has a right-of-way for crossing the eastern parcel by foot, bicycle, or automobile, but this right-of-way was likely intended for personal use and not for the use of thousands of people daily or for commercial deliveries. The court may rule that the business owner can still use the right-of-way as originally agreed upon, but the office workers and commercial deliveries would be considered an excessive and unauthorized use of the easement, and thus could be enjoined from using it. This would prevent the landscaper's property from being overburdened by the additional traffic and use that was not contemplated when the right-of-way was granted."
