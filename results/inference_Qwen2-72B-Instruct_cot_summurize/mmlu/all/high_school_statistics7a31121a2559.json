A p-value less than 0.1 (10%) does not imply that the p-value will also be less than 0.05 (5%). The level of significance for hypothesis testing is chosen before conducting the test, and if the p-value is less than the chosen level, you can reject the null hypothesis. However, a p-value that is less than 0.1 but greater than 0.05 would not allow you to reject the null hypothesis at the 5% level.\n\nB. This statement is false. The decision to use a one- or two-sided test should be made based on the research question and prior knowledge, not the data. A one-sided test assumes a directional hypothesis, while a two-sided test does not assume a direction.\n\nC. This statement is misleading. If a hypothesis test is conducted at the 1% level, it means that if the null hypothesis is true, the probability of obtaining a result as extreme or more extreme than the observed result is less than or equal to 1%. This is known as the Type I error rate, not the chance of rejecting the null hypothesis. Rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true is called a Type I error.\n\nD. This statement is true. The power of a statistical test is the probability that the test will correctly reject the null hypothesis when the alternative hypothesis is true. It is the ability of the test to detect an effect, given that there is an effect to detect. High power is desirable because it increases the likelihood of finding a significant effect when one exists."
