Menarche was at the age of 12 years, and her last menstrual period was 2 weeks ago. She is sexually active with one male partner and uses a combination contraceptive patch. Her temperature is 37.8\u00b0C (100\u00b0F), pulse is 90/min, respirations are 22/min, and blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg. Abdominal examination shows severe lower quadrant tenderness bilaterally. Pelvic examination shows a purulent cervical discharge, cervical motion tenderness, and bilateral adnexal tenderness. Her hemoglobin concentration is 10.5 g/dL, leukocyte count is 13,000/mm3 , and platelet count is 345,000/mm3 . A urine pregnancy test is negative. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy?\n\nA. Oral azithromycin\nB. Vaginal clindamycin\nC. Intravenous penicillin and vancomycin\nD. Intramuscular ceftriaxone and oral doxycycline\n"

                    "text": "The symptoms and findings described in this case are consistent with pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), which is an infection of the upper genital tract in women. PID can be caused by a variety of bacteria, including sexually transmitted infections such as Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae.\n\nThe most appropriate pharmacotherapy for treating PID includes antibiotics that cover both anaerobic and aerobic organisms, as well as those that target sexually transmitted pathogens. The recommended treatment for PID involves intramuscular or intravenous administration of a cephalosporin (such as ceftriaxone) combined with oral doxycycline or another antibiotic effective against Chlamydia and other common causative agents.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Intramuscular ceftriaxone and oral doxycycline\n\nThis regimen is chosen over the others because it provides broad-spectrum coverage for the likely pathogens involved in PID, including both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, as well as the most common sexually transmitted pathogens. It is also administered systemically rather than vaginally, which is more appropriate for treating an established systemic infection like PID."
