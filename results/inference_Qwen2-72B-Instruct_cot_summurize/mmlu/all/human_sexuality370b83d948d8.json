Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Bartholin glands\n\nHowever, Masters and Johnson's research showed that vaginal lubrication actually comes from transudation, which is the process where fluid is \"squeezed out\" of the tissues of the vagina as they become engorged with blood during sexual arousal. The Bartholin glands do secrete a small amount of mucus, but this is not the primary source of vaginal lubrication during sexual activity."
