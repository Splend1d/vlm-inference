In his famous essay \"The Tragedy of the Commons,\" Hardin argues that providing aid to the hungry and poor may have unintended negative consequences, such as overpopulation and depletion of resources. He suggests that we should consider the long-term consequences of our actions and prioritize sustainable solutions rather than short-term relief. This perspective aligns with a consequentialist approach, which evaluates the morality of actions based on their outcomes or consequences."
