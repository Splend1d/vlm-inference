Sensory adaptation refers to the process by which our sensory receptors adjust to a constant stimulus over time, causing a decrease in sensitivity. In this case, the person who has been sunbathing has become accustomed to a higher temperature, so the pool water feels cooler in comparison. Conversely, the person who has been inside in the air conditioning has become accustomed to a lower temperature, so the pool water feels warmer in comparison. This is an example of how our perception can be influenced by our recent experiences and environment."
