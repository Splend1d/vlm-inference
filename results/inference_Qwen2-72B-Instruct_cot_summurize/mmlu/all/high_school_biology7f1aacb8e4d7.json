Most CO2 produced during cellular respiration is not released from glycolysis, but rather from the citric acid cycle (Krebs cycle).\nB. Protons do not pump through ATP synthase; instead, protons flow down their concentration gradient through ATP synthase, which generates ATP in a process called chemiosmosis.\nC. The final electron acceptor of the electron transport chain is oxygen, not NAD+. Oxygen is reduced to form water at the end of the electron transport chain.\nD. This statement is correct. ATP synthesis occurs when an endergonic reaction (a reaction that requires energy) is coupled with an exergonic reaction (a reaction that releases energy). In cellular respiration, the energy released from the breakdown of glucose is used to drive the synthesis of ATP."
