They are not theoretically motivated\n\nPure time-series models, such as ARIMA or exponential smoothing, are based on patterns found within the historical data itself and do not necessarily incorporate underlying economic or theoretical relationships. Structural models, on the other hand, are built based on economic theory and include explanatory variables that have a theoretical basis for affecting the variable being forecasted. This theoretical foundation can provide a clearer understanding of why certain predictions are made, which can be an advantage in some contexts."
