Three months ago, he underwent cadaveric renal transplantation resulting in immediate kidney function. At the time of discharge, his serum creatinine concentration was 0.8 mg/dL. He is receiving cyclosporine and corticosteroids. Examination shows no abnormalities. His leukocyte count is 2700/mm3 , and serum creatinine concentration is 1.6 mg/dL; serum cyclosporine concentration is in the therapeutic range. A biopsy of the transplanted kidney shows intracellular inclusion bodies. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?\n\nA. Increase the dosage of corticosteroids\nB. Increase the dosage of cyclosporine\nC. Begin amphotericin therapy\nD. Begin ganciclovir therapy\n"

Ganciclovir is an antiviral medication used to treat CMV infections.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate next step in management would be:\n\nD. Begin ganciclovir therapy\n\nIncreasing the dosage of corticosteroids or cyclosporine could worsen the patient's condition by suppressing the immune system further and allowing the virus to proliferate more. Amphotericin is an antifungal medication and would not be effective against a viral infection."
