This aligns with option D: \"will produce someone who does the right thing simply because it is right.\"\n\nFeinberg argued that moral education should not rely solely on the use of pleasure and pain as sanctions (eliminating option B), nor should it produce individuals who act morally only out of deference to authority (eliminating option C). He was critical of approaches to moral education that used external rewards or punishments as the primary means of encouraging moral behavior, suggesting that such methods could undermine the development of genuine moral motivation.\n\nWhile Feinberg did not necessarily argue that a good moral education would make no use of pleasure or pain as sanctions (eliminating option A), he did emphasize that the ultimate goal of moral education should be to foster in individuals a sense of moral obligation and a commitment to doing what is right for its own sake. Therefore, option D best represents Feinberg's view on what constitutes a good moral education."
