While the thief was exiting with a sack of chickens, the homeowner got his hunting rifle and shot him dead. The authorities charged the homeowner with homicide. At the trial, he defended on the basis that he was in fear for his safety, and was legally authorized to use deadly force to defend his dwelling and person from the illegal threat. Is the defense to homicide valid under these facts?\n\nA. Yes, he was authorized to use deadly force where he reasonably believed that the thief had a gun and would harm him.\nB. No, because it is not reasonable to use deadly force to prevent the theft of the chickens.\nC. No, because a homeowner can never legally use deadly force to stop a theft.\nD. Yes, because a dwelling owner can always use deadly force to protect his property and person from an illegal trespasser or thief.\n"

No, because it is not reasonable to use deadly force to prevent the theft of the chickens.\n\nWhile the homeowner has the right to defend himself and his property, the use of deadly force must be justified by a reasonable belief that there is an imminent threat of serious bodily harm or death. In this case, the fact that the homeowner thought he saw a gun does not automatically justify the use of deadly force, especially if the perceived threat was not confirmed. Moreover, the value of the chickens being stolen does not warrant the use of deadly force. Therefore, the defense of using deadly force to protect property is not valid in this scenario."
