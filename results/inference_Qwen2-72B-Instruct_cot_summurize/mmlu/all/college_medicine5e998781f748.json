When examining the correlates of admission acceptance, two obvious factors that strongly correlated with admissions were GPA and standardized test scores, with correlation values of +0.41 and +0.55 respectively. However, the study also demonstrated that those students who had social networks that overlapped with the alumni networks of the selective colleges were even more likely to be admitted, with a correlation between social network and alumni network of +0.61. This correlation demonstrates:\n\nA. the value of cultural capital.\nB. a meritocracy. \nC. he value of social capital.\nD. a false association.\n"

Social capital refers to the resources and advantages that individuals can access through their social networks and relationships. In this case, having connections to alumni of selective colleges appears to increase one's chances of being admitted, suggesting that social networks play a significant role in college admissions beyond just academic achievement.\n\nWhile high GPAs and standardized test scores certainly contribute to college admissions, the higher correlation between social network overlap and admissions suggests that social capital may have an even greater influence. This finding challenges the notion of a pure meritocracy (option B), where admissions would be based solely on individual merit and achievement, and highlights the importance of social connections in accessing educational opportunities."
