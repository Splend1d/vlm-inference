A Union of African states will project more effectively the African personality. It will command respect from a world that has regard only for size and influence. The scant attention paid to African opposition to the French atomic tests in the Sahara, and the ignominious spectacle of the U.N. in the Congo quibbling about constitutional niceties while the Republic was tottering into anarchy, are evidence of the callous disregard of African Independence by the Great Powers.\"\nKwame Nkrumah, Ghanian leader, 1961\nBased on the speech, the French saw Africa as which of the following?\n\nA. A collection of republics tottering into anarchy\nB. A resource for enhancing French power in the Cold War\nC. Important due to the Sahara's natural resources\nD. A strong political union\n"

Kwame Nkrumah criticizes the French for conducting atomic tests in the Sahara, which suggests that the French saw Africa primarily as a place where they could conduct such tests, likely due to the Sahara's vast, sparsely populated areas. This implies that the French were exploiting Africa's natural resources (in this case, its uninhabited land) for their own purposes. Therefore, the closest answer would be:\n\nC. Important due to the Sahara's natural resources\n\nIt's important to note that while the passage doesn't explicitly say the French viewed Africa solely as a resource for enhancing French power in the Cold War (option B), the use of the Sahara for atomic testing could be seen as a move to strengthen French military capabilities, which would have been relevant in the context of the Cold War. However, option C is the most directly supported by the text."
