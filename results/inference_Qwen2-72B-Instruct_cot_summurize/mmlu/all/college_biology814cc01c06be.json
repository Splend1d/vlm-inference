An early human embryo has features in common with early fish and avian embryos.\n\nThis statement aligns with Haeckel's theory of recapitulation, often summarized as \"ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny,\" although it's important to note that this theory has been refined and corrected over time. While not every detail of an organism's evolutionary history is repeated during its development (thus making option A an oversimplification), there are indeed stages in embryonic development where similarities can be observed across different species, reflecting common ancestral traits. For example, the presence of pharyngeal pouches and gill slits in early human embryos, which are reminiscent of features found in fish embryos, supports this conclusion."
