This means that \\(A\\) is an orthogonal matrix (though not necessarily all orthogonal matrices satisfy \\(A = A^{-1}\\)).\n\nNow, let's consider the form of \\(A\\) as a \\(2 \\times 2\\) matrix:\n\n\\[A = \\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix}\\]\n\nSince \\(A^2 = I\\), we have:\n\n\\[A^2 = \\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} a^2 + bc & ab + bd \\\\ ac + cd & bc + d^2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\\]\n\nThis implies:\n\n1. \\(a^2 + bc = 1\\)\n2. \\(ab + bd = 0\\)\n3. \\(ac + cd = 0\\)\n4. \\(bc + d^2 = 1\\)\n\nFrom equation 2 and 3, we get \\(b(a + d) = 0\\) and \\(c(a + d) = 0\\). Since \\(A \\neq \\pm I\\), we know that \\(a + d \\neq 0\\) (otherwise, \\(A\\) would be a scalar multiple of the identity matrix, which contradicts the given conditions). Therefore, \\(b = 0\\) and \\(c = 0\\).\n\nSubstituting \\(b = 0\\) and \\(c = 0\\) into equations 1 and 4 gives us:\n\n1. \\(a^2 = 1\\)\n2. \\(d^2 = 1\\)\n\nSo, \\(a = \\pm1\\) and \\(d = \\pm1\\).\n\nHowever, we also need to ensure that \\(A \\neq I\\) and \\(A \\neq -I\\). The only way for \\(A\\) to not be equal to either \\(I\\) or \\(-I\\) with \\(a = \\pm1\\) and \\(d = \\pm1\\) is if \\(a\\) and \\(d\\) have opposite signs (since \\(b = 0\\) and \\(c = 0\\)).\n\nTherefore, without loss of generality, let \\(a = 1\\) and \\(d = -1\\) or \\(a = -1\\) and \\(d = 1\\). In either case, the trace of \\(A\\) (\\(tr(A)\\)) is:\n\n\\[tr(A) = a + d = 1 - 1 = 0\\]\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\nC. 0"
