However, genetic evidence from ancient and contemporary Native American populations has consistently shown a closer genetic affinity with populations from central Siberia than with those from Europe. This supports the more widely accepted Beringian model, which posits that the first peoples to reach the Americas did so via a land bridge connecting Siberia and Alaska during the Pleistocene."
