So, we solve for $x$ in:\n\n\\[0 = \\frac{(x-2)^2 - 9}{3}\\]\n\nMultiplying both sides by 3 gives:\n\n\\[(x-2)^2 - 9 = 0\\]\n\nAdding 9 to both sides:\n\n\\[(x-2)^2 = 9\\]\n\nTaking the square root of both sides (remembering to consider both positive and negative roots):\n\n\\[x-2 = \\pm3\\]\n\nSo, we have two solutions:\n\n\\[x = 2 + 3 = 5\\] \nand \n\\[x = 2 - 3 = -1\\]\n\nThus, the x-intercepts are at $x=5$ and $x=-1$.\n\n### Step 2: Find the y-intercept\n\nThe y-intercept occurs when $x=0$. Plugging this into our function:\n\n\\[y = f(0) = \\frac{(0-2)^2 - 9}{3} = \\frac{4 - 9}{3} = \\frac{-5}{3}\\]\n\nThus, the y-intercept is at $y=\\frac{-5}{3}$.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the shape of the polygon\n\nGiven the intercepts, we have three points: $(5, 0)$, $(-1, 0)$, and $(0, -\\frac{5}{3})$. Connecting these points forms a triangle with vertices at these points.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the area of the triangle\n\nThe base of the triangle is the distance between the x-intercepts, which is $|5 - (-1)| = 6$. The height of the triangle is the absolute value of the y-intercept, which is $\\left|-\\frac{5}{3}\\right| = \\frac{5}{3}$.\n\nThe area of a triangle is given by $\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height}$. Substituting the base and height:\n\n\\[A = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 6 \\times \\frac{5}{3} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 10 = 5\\]\n\nTherefore, the area of the polygon is $\\boxed{5}$, which corresponds to choice A."
