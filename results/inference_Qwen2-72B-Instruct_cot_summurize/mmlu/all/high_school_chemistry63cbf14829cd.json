This configuration arises from the VSEPR theory (Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion), which predicts molecular shapes based on the number of electron pairs around a central atom.\n\nIn this case, there are six total electron pairs (five bonding pairs and one lone pair) around the central atom. According to VSEPR theory, the ideal arrangement for six electron pairs would be an octahedral shape, but the presence of the lone pair distorts this geometry. The lone pair occupies more space than a bonding pair, pushing the bonded atoms slightly away, resulting in a square pyramid shape with the lone pair at the apex and the five bonded atoms forming the base."
