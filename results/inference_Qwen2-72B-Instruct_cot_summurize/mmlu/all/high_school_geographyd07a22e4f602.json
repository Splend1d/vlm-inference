Spread effects typically refer to the positive or negative impacts that spread from the core region to the periphery as a result of economic activities and development. Among the options given:\n\nA. Congestion in the core - This can be seen as a direct effect within the core, not a spread effect on the periphery.\nB. High cost of labor in the core - This can also be considered an effect within the core, but it can potentially lead to higher wages in the periphery as industries move to take advantage of lower labor costs, making it indirectly a spread effect.\nC. High density in the core - This is again a direct effect within the core region, not a spread effect.\nD. More infrastructure in the core - This could lead to better infrastructure development in the periphery through various mechanisms such as technology transfer, investment, or policy diffusion.\n\nGiven these explanations, the most accurate answer to which is NOT a spread effect would be:\n\nA. Congestion in the core\n\nThis is because congestion does not typically spread directly from the core to the periphery; instead, it remains a localized issue within the core itself. The other effects listed could potentially have indirect implications for the periphery. However, it's important to note that the question focuses on what is NOT a spread effect, and congestion fits this criterion best among the provided choices."
