However, based on common knowledge about disadvantages of longitudinal developmental research, typical issues include:\n\n1. High costs and time-consuming nature due to the extended period over which data is collected.\n2. Participant attrition, where subjects may drop out of the study over time, leading to incomplete data.\n3. The possibility of historical or cultural changes affecting the outcomes of the study.\n\nIf we assume that \"I\" refers to high costs and time consumption, \"II\" refers to participant attrition, and \"III\" refers to the impact of historical or cultural changes, then the correct answer would likely be:\n\nD. I and II only\n\nHowever, if all three points are indeed disadvantages listed in your question, and you need to choose all that apply, then none of the provided options (A, B, C) would be correct, as they don't include an option for all three. In that case, the answer would be an unlisted option that includes all three disadvantages."
