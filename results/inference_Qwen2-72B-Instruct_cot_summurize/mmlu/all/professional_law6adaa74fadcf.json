The neighbor's predecessor had received an easement from the woman's predecessor in title to cross the woman's land for access to the public highway. This access was desired even though the neighbor and his predecessor had other access to public roads. Recently, the woman erected a large solar collector on a portion of her land subject to the easement, even though the woman has other power resources. The location was essential to acquire the maximum sunlight. However, by erecting the collector there, the woman effectively cut off the neighbor's ability to use the easement. The local zoning code permits the use of solar collectors. The neighbor immediately sued to compel the woman to remove the solar collector. Must the solar collector be removed?\n\nA. No, because the neighbor has other means of access.\nB. No, because the zoning code permits the use of solar collectors.\nC. Yes, because the easement remains valid.\nD. Yes, because the woman has other power resources.\n"

Yes, because the easement remains valid.\n\nThe existence of the easement grants the neighbor the right to use the portion of the woman's land for access to the public highway, regardless of whether alternative access routes exist or whether the zoning code permits the use of solar collectors. The easement is a property right that restricts the owner's use of the land in favor of the easement holder. Therefore, the woman cannot obstruct the easement by erecting the solar collector in such a way that it prevents the neighbor from using it. The fact that the woman has other power resources is not relevant to the validity of the easement."
