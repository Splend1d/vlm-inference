The formula for impulse is \\( I = F \\Delta t \\), where \\( F \\) is force and \\( \\Delta t \\) is the time interval.\n\nForce can be expressed using Newton's second law, \\( F = ma \\), where \\( m \\) is mass (M) and \\( a \\) is acceleration (\\( L/T^2 \\)). Therefore, the dimensions of force are \\( ML/T^2 \\).\n\nMultiplying these dimensions by time (T) to account for the \\( \\Delta t \\) in the impulse formula, we get:\n\n\\[ [I] = \\left[ \\frac{ML}{T^2} \\right] [T] = \\frac{ML}{T} \\]\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\nC.
