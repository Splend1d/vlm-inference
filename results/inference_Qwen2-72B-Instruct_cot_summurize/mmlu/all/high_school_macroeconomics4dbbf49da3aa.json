The euro has appreciated.\n\nWhen the euro was trading at $1.36 U.S. and now it's trading at $1.40 U.S., this means that it takes more U.S. dollars to buy the same amount of euros. This indicates that the value of the euro has increased relative to the U.S. dollar, hence the euro has appreciated. Conversely, the U.S. dollar has depreciated because its value has decreased relative to the euro. The information provided does not give any indication about interest rate changes."
