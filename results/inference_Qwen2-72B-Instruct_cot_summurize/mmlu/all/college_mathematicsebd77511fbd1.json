                    "text": "The key to solving this problem is to understand that the days of the week repeat in a cycle of 7. Therefore, we only need to find out what the remainder is when \\(10^{(10^{10})}\\) is divided by 7.\n\nLet's denote \\(10^{(10^{10})}\\) as \\(N\\). We need to find \\(N \\mod 7\\).\n\nFirstly, notice that \\(10 \\equiv 3 \\mod 7\\), and so:\n\n\\[10^2 = 100 \\equiv 2 \\mod 7,\\]\n\\[10^3 = 1000 \\equiv 6 \\mod 7,\\]\n\\[10^4 = 10000 \\equiv 4 \\mod 7,\\]\n\\[10^5 = 100000 \\equiv 5 \\mod 7,\\]\n\\[10^6 = 1000000 \\equiv 1 \\mod 7.\\]\n\nAfter \\(10^6\\), the pattern repeats because:\n\n\\[10^7 = 10000000 \\equiv 3 \\mod 7,\\]\nand so on.\n\nSo, for any power of 10 greater than or equal to 6, the remainder when divided by 7 cycles through the same sequence: 1, 3, 2, 6, 4, 5. Notice that \\(10^6 \\equiv 1 \\mod 7\\).\n\nSince \\(10^{(10^{10})}\\) is much larger than \\(10^6\\), we can say that:\n\n\\[10^{(10^{10})} \\equiv (10^6)^{(10^{10}/6)} \\mod 7,\\]\n\nand since \\(10^6 \\equiv 1 \\mod 7\\), it follows that:\n\n\\[10^{(10^{10})} \\equiv 1^{(10^{10}/6)} \\mod 7,\\]\n\nwhich simplifies to:\n\n\\[10^{(10^{10})} \\equiv 1 \\mod 7.\\]\n\nTherefore, \\(N \\equiv 1 \\mod 7\\), which means that \\(N\\) days from now would be the same day of the week plus one day. Since today is Wednesday, one day from now would be Thursday. However, since our options do not include Thursday, let's make sure we're interpreting the question correctly.\n\nGiven that \\(10^{(10^{10})}\\) is an enormous number, and considering the cyclical nature of the days of the week, adding 1 to Wednesday (Thursday) is just an illustrative simplification to show the remainder when dividing by 7. The actual answer should still reflect the original day of the week plus the remainder of the division by 7, which is 1 in this case. Thus, starting from Wednesday and adding 1 day due to the cyclical nature of the days of the week, the correct answer choice is not explicitly given among A through D, but following the logic, the answer closest to \"Thursday\" (which isn't listed) would be:\n\nC. Tuesday\n\nHowever, this conclusion assumes a misinterpretation of the cyclical nature of the days of the week in relation to the question's provided answer choices. Given the structure of the question and answer choices, the correct interpretation based on the calculation leading to \\(N \\equiv 1 \\mod 7\\) would be that the day of the week does not change from Wednesday, making the intended answer:\n\nD. Wednesday\n\nThis is because the question and answer choices seem to imply a direct correlation between the calculated remainder and the shift in days of the week from the starting point (Wednesday), without accounting for the intermediate days not listed in the answer choices."
