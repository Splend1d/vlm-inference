Does personality change with age?\n\nThis question addresses the central concern about how personality traits may evolve or remain stable throughout the lifespan, particularly in older adulthood. Research in this area has shown that some aspects of personality can indeed change with age, while others tend to remain relatively stable. For example, studies suggest that traits such as neuroticism may decline, while agreeableness and conscientiousness may increase as people age. However, individual differences play a significant role, and not all older adults will experience these changes in the same way."
