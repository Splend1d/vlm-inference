This discrimination could manifest in various forms, such as segregation, unequal access to employment, education, housing, and public services, and violence from white mobs or authorities. While some degree of assimilation and adaptation did occur over time, it was often hindered by systemic racism and prejudice. Compensation for the injustices of slavery has been a subject of debate but was not generally provided to former slaves after abolition."
