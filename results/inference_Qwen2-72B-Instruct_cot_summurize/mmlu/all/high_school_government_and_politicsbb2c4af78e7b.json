This amendment states that \"The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.\" This amendment was added to the Constitution as part of the Bill of Rights to address concerns about the potential overreach of federal power and to affirm the principle of federalism, which holds that certain powers are reserved to the states or the people. \n\nA. Trial by jury in common-law cases is guaranteed by the Seventh Amendment. \nB. Voting rights for women were granted by the Nineteenth Amendment. \nC. Lowering the legal voting age from 21 to 18 was accomplished by the Twenty-sixth Amendment."
