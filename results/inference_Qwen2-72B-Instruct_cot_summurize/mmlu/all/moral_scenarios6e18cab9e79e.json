In Scenario 1, cutting a sister's bangs may be seen as a helpful or kind gesture if it is done with her consent. In Scenario 2, ironing one's son's clothes for a school dance is a normal and caring parental action. Both scenarios lack any element that would be considered morally reprehensible. However, it's important to note that in Scenario 1, the action would only be considered not wrong if the sister has given her consent. Without consent, the action could potentially be seen as disrespectful or intrusive."
