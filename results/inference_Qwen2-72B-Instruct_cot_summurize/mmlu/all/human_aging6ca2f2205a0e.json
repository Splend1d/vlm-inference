Our own interpretation.\n\nMemory is not a perfect recording of events, but rather a reconstruction of past experiences based on our perceptions, emotions, and cognitive processes. Research has shown that memories can be influenced by various factors such as suggestibility, bias, and misinformation, leading to inaccuracies and distortions. Therefore, the information stored in memory is often our own interpretation of events rather than an exact representation of reality."
