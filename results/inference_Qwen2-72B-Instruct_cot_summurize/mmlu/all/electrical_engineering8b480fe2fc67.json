The energy stored in an inductor is in the form of a magnetic field, which can be recovered later and does not result in power loss as heat, unlike resistors. In practical scenarios, real-world inductors do have some resistance and thus will dissipate some power, but in theoretical or ideal cases, the power dissipation is considered to be zero."
