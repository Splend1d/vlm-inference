Appellate courts do not usually conduct new trials or hear witnesses, but instead review the trial court's application of the law to determine if there were any legal errors that affected the outcome of the case. They may also review the factual findings of the lower court, but they generally defer to those findings unless there is clear error. The stare decisis principle, which means \"to stand by things decided,\" is often used by appellate courts to ensure consistency and predictability in the law by adhering to precedents set in previous cases. Appellate trials are not usually jury trials; they are conducted before a panel of judges who make their decision based on the written and oral arguments of the parties' attorneys and the record of the proceedings in the lower court."
