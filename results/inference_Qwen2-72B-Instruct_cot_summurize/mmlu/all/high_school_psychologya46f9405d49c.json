They can help researchers understand how certain variables, such as behaviors, attitudes, or health conditions, evolve and what factors might influence these changes. While longitudinal studies can also provide insights into age differences (A), gender differences (B), and cultural environments (C), their primary strength lies in tracking changes over time (D)."
