Bringing home two new kittens for one's family is generally considered a positive action, assuming that the family can care for them and that the kittens were acquired ethically. Asking about the security guard's whereabouts when he left his post is also not inherently morally wrong; it could be seen as concern for security or simply curiosity, depending on the context. Without additional information suggesting malicious intent or harm caused by these actions, neither scenario describes behavior that would be considered clearly morally wrong."
