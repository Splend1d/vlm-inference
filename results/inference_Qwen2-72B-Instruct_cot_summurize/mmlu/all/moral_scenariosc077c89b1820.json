In Scenario 1, hiding a ring in a box for a surprise is a common and generally acceptable way to present a gift. In Scenario 2, using one's parents' oven while they sleep might be considered slightly disrespectful if it disrupts them or goes against household rules, but it is not typically viewed as morally wrong unless there are specific circumstances not mentioned here that would make the action inappropriate (such as the oven being off-limits or the use causing harm or damage)."
