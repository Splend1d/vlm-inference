Difference threshold\n\nThe difference threshold, also known as the just noticeable difference (JND), is the minimum level of difference in stimulation required for a person to notice that two stimuli are different. In this case, it refers to the ability to perceive the distinct tastes of Coke and Pepsi, which have slightly different flavor profiles. This difference is usually above the absolute threshold (the minimum level of stimulation required to detect a stimulus) for taste, so most people can distinguish between the two beverages based on their taste preferences and sensitivity to the specific flavors."
