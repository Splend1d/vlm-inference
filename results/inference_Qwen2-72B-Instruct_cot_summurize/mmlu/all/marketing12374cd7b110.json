Generally cheaper to gather than primary data and takes less time to find.\n\nSecondary data is pre-existing information that has already been collected for other purposes. It can be gathered from various sources such as government publications, industry reports, academic journals, and online databases. Since this data has already been collected, it is often cheaper and faster to obtain than collecting primary data through surveys, interviews, or experiments. However, secondary data may not always fit the specific needs of your research problem, and its reliability and validity must be assessed before using it."
