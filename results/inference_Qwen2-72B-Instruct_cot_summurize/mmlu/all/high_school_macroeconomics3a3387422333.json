This reduces competition for domestic automobile producers, allowing them to charge higher prices without losing market share to foreign competitors. As a result, the price of automobiles (both domestic and imported) tends to rise, benefiting domestic producers but hurting consumers who have to pay more for their vehicles. The foreign producers may also be negatively affected as their sales in the domestic market are restricted by the quota."
