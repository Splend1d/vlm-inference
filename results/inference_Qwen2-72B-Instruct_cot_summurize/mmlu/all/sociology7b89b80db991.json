The theory posits that individuals learn their social roles by observing and imitating others within the context of society's established norms and expectations (A). Through social interactions, people also actively construct and redefine these roles (B), which can vary across different situations and over time, reflecting the dynamic nature of social life (C).\n\nThe statement D is not directly related to role-learning theory. It seems more aligned with psychoanalytic theories that focus on unconscious motivations and how they might be managed through various mechanisms, including the adoption of certain roles. However, this is not the primary focus of role-learning theory."
