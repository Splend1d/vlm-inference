Consider a matrix \\( A \\) such that:\n\\[\nA = \\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & 1 \\\\\n-1 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nThen,\n\\[\nA^2 = \\begin{pmatrix}\n-1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & -1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nThe trace of \\( A^2 \\) is \\( -2 \\), which is negative. Therefore, statement I is false.\n\nII. If \\( A^2 = A \\), then the trace of \\( A \\) is nonnegative.\n\nThis statement is true. If \\( A^2 = A \\), then every eigenvalue \\( \\lambda \\) of \\( A \\) satisfies \\( \\lambda^2 = \\lambda \\). This implies that \\( \\lambda (\\lambda - 1) = 0 \\), so \\( \\lambda = 0 \\) or \\( \\lambda = 1 \\). Since the trace of a matrix is the sum of its eigenvalues, and since all eigenvalues in this case are either 0 or 1, the trace of \\( A \\) is indeed nonnegative. Statement II is true.\n\nIII. The trace of \\( AB \\) is the product of the traces of \\( A \\) and \\( B \\).\n\nThis statement is false. The trace of the product of two matrices is not equal to the product of their traces. In general, for matrices \\( A \\) and \\( B \\):\n\\[\n\\text{trace}(AB) \\neq \\text{trace}(A)\\text{trace}(B)\n\\]\nHowever, it is true that:\n\\[\n\\text{trace}(AB) = \\text{trace}(BA)\n\\]\nBut this does not imply that the trace of the product is the product of the traces.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA.
