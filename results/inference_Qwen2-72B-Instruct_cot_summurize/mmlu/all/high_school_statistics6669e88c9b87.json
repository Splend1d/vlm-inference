A reasonable time-and-cost-saving procedure would be to use systematic sampling on an available list of all AAA (Automobile Association of America) members in the city.\nB. A reasonable time-and-cost-saving procedure would be to randomly choose families and include all drivers in each of these families in the sample.\nC. To determine the mean number of years between accidents, randomness in choosing a sample of drivers is not important as long as the sample size is very large.\nD.

A reasonable time-and-cost-saving procedure would be to randomly choose families and include all drivers in each of these families in the sample.\n\nExplanation:\n\nA. Using systematic sampling on an available list of all AAA members may introduce bias if there are differences between AAA members and non-members that affect the likelihood of having accidents.\nB. This approach can save time and cost by reducing the number of households that need to be contacted while still providing a random sample of drivers. It assumes that drivers within a family are not more similar to each other than they are to drivers in other families with respect to accident rates.\nC. Randomness in choosing a sample of drivers is essential to ensure that the sample is representative of the population. Without randomness, the sample may be biased and not accurately reflect the population's characteristics.\nD. Since option B is a true statement, this option is incorrect."
