However, some reactions proceed to such a high degree in one direction that they are considered practically irreversible under normal conditions. Among the given options, option A (CH4(g) + O2(g) \u2192 CO2(g) + H2O(l)) is often considered irreversible because it represents the combustion of methane, which releases a large amount of energy and proceeds very far to the right. The products (CO2 and H2O) do not easily recombine to form methane and oxygen under normal conditions."
