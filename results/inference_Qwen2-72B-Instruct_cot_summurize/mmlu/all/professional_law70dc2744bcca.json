The president of a development company is interested in purchasing three of the four parcels. The president buys the three parcels from the retiree and begins formulating plans for constructing single- family dwelling units. The original deed between the retiree and the development company contains a provision expressly binding \"upon all subsequent grantees, their heirs, and assigns,\" stipulating that any further subdivisions by any such persons shall be restricted to minimum two-acre lots to be used for single-family dwelling units only. The development company immediately subdivided two of the parcels into lots of three, four, and five acres, and began construction of homes thereon. The original deed restrictions were enumerated within the special warranty deeds and were given to the purchasers of the homes in the new development, called tract I. Two years later, the president sold the remaining 250-acre parcel, which had not been included in the tract 1 subdivision plan, to a contractor. The deed between the president and the contractor included the same restriction as was in the original deed between the retiree and the president. The contractor, in turn, drafted a subdivision plan for the last 250-acre parcel, dividing it into one-acre lots. The contractor then commenced construction of single- family dwelling units in the new development, to be known as tract 2. There was no mention of the restriction for two-acre minimum lots in the deeds to the purchasers of the new homes in tract 2. In a subsequent action to enjoin the contractor from subdividing the parcel into one-acre lots by any of the present owners of lots in the tract 1 development, the most probable judicial determination would be\n\nA. that the action should be dismissed because the owners lack standing to sue.\nB. that the action should be dismissed because there is no privity of estate between the owners of the lots in tract 1 and the contractor.\nC. that the action would be successful if tract 2 were considered by the court as part of a common development scheme.\nD. that the action would be successful because the restrictions in the original deed between the retiree and the president will be enforceable.\n"

If the court finds that both tract 1 and tract 2 were intended to be part of a single development with uniform restrictions, the restrictions could be enforced against the contractor. This is because the original deed contained provisions binding \"all subsequent grantees, their heirs, and assigns,\" which suggests an intention to create a uniform set of rules governing the use of the land.\n\nAdditionally, the fact that the contractor's deed included the same restriction as the original deed indicates that the restriction was intended to run with the land and bind future owners. However, for the restriction to be enforceable against the contractor, it must be shown that there was a clear intention to create a common scheme where all lots would be subject to the same restrictions.\n\nTherefore, if the court determines that the development of tract 2 is part of the same common scheme as tract 1, the action to enforce the two-acre minimum lot size restriction would likely be successful."
