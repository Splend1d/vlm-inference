Management's unwillingness to make all financial records available to the CPA.\n\nThis is because access to complete and accurate financial records is essential for an auditor to perform their duties effectively and to be able to form an opinion on the fairness of the financial statements. Without full access to financial records, the CPA cannot adequately assess the financial position of the entity and thus cannot fulfill the requirements of an audit engagement."
