To be among the richest one percent in the world as of 2020, you would need to have a net worth of around $1 million or more, according to Credit Suisse's Global Wealth Report 2020. However, if we're talking about income instead of net worth, then the threshold for being in the top 1% globally was approximately $100,000 per year, according to a 2020 report by the World Inequality Database. So neither of these figures matches any of the options you provided."
