He argues that people agree to be just because they lack the power to act unjustly and get away with it. According to Glaucon, if someone had the power to do whatever they wanted without fear of punishment, they would not choose to be just. Thus, justice is seen as a compromise or an agreement among individuals who recognize that it is in their best interest to abide by certain rules for the sake of living harmoniously in society."
