To solve for the mass of the second object (m2), we need at least one of its velocities (initial or final) and one velocity of the first object (initial or final). However, since the second object is initially stationary, its initial velocity is zero. Therefore, the minimum necessary information to determine the mass of the second object is the mass of the first object (which is given), the initial velocity of the first object, and either the final velocity of the first object or the final velocity of the second object.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Any 2 of the above values\n\nThis allows us to use the conservation of momentum and/or conservation of kinetic energy equations to solve for the unknown mass."
