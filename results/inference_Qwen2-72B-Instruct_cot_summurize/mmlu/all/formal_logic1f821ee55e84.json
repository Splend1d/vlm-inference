However, this formulates the statement in reverse order and with an incorrect direction of sweetness comparison. The correct but not listed formulation should be: \n\n\"\u2200x(Fx \u2192 \u2200y(Jy \u2192 Syx))\"\n\nWhich means \"For all x, if x is a fruit, then for all y, if y is a jellybean, y is sweeter than x\". \n\nBut among the provided options, option A is the closest to the correct translation, assuming the error in the original problem statement. \n\nThe other options are incorrect because:\nB. This states that for all x and y, if x is a fruit and y is a jellybean, then x is sweeter than y. This incorrectly assumes that every single fruit is compared to every single jellybean.\nC. This states that for all x and y, if x is sweeter than y, then y is a fruit and x is a jellybean. This is incorrect as it does not express the relationship between all fruits and jellybeans.\nD. This states that for all x, if x is a jellybean, then for all y, if y is a fruit, x is sweeter than y. Similar to option A, this also formulates the statement in reverse order and with an incorrect direction of sweetness comparison."
