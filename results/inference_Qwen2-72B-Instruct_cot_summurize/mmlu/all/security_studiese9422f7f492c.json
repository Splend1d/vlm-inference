Looting and theft, especially where corruption is endemic, states are weak, and weapons stockpiles are not properly secured.\n\nWhile it's ideal for states to maintain strict control over their military and police force weapons, the reality is often different. Weapons can end up on the illicit arms market through various means:\n\n1. **Looting and Theft**: During conflicts or in regions with high levels of crime, poorly secured armories can be targeted by criminals or opposing forces, leading to the theft of weapons that then enter the illicit market.\n\n2. **Corruption**: Corruption within the military or police forces can lead to the deliberate sale or transfer of weapons to unauthorized individuals or groups. This can happen at any level, from low-ranking officers to high-level officials.\n\n3. **Diversion from Legal Sales**: Sometimes, weapons sold legally to one country may be diverted to another without authorization. This can happen when middlemen or brokers involved in the transaction sell the weapons to third parties instead of the intended recipients.\n\n4. **Losses in Combat**: Weapons can also end up in the wrong hands during combat operations. When military units are defeated or retreat, they may leave behind operational weapons that can be picked up and used by enemy forces or sold on the black market.\n\n5. **Decommissioning and Disposal**: Ineffective or improper decommissioning processes can lead to weapons being improperly stored or destroyed, making them vulnerable to theft and ending up on the illicit market.\n\n6. **Surplus Sales**: Governments sometimes sell surplus weapons to private companies or other countries. If proper oversight is lacking, these weapons can be resold or otherwise diverted to the illicit market.\n\nIt's important to note that while illegal trading by states does occur (option C), it is not necessarily the primary method by which weapons end up on the illegal arms market. The illicit trade often involves a complex web of actors, including non-state armed groups, criminal networks, corrupt officials, and sometimes even legitimate businesses acting outside legal frameworks."
