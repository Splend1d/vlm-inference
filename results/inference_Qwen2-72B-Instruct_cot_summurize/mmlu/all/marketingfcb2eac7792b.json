They provide a secure and controlled environment for storing products until they are needed for distribution or sale. Distribution centers, on the other hand, are typically used for shorter-term storage and are focused on quickly moving products in and out of the facility. Haulage transport refers to the transportation of goods by road, rail, sea, or air, and electronic data interchange (EDI) is a method of exchanging business documents between companies in a standardized electronic format."
