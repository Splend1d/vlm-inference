It is believed that during this time, the spirits of deceased family members return home to be reunited with their living relatives and to enjoy the offerings made in their honor. The festival typically includes cleaning gravesites, lighting lanterns to guide the spirits, and performing traditional dances called Bon Odori. The exact dates for Obon can vary, but it usually takes place in mid-July or mid-August, depending on the region and the lunar calendar."
