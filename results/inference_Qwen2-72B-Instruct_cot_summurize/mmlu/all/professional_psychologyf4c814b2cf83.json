In transactional analysis, a form of psychotherapy developed by Eric Berne, self-disclosure can be a part of the treatment process. The therapist may share personal experiences to help the patient understand different life positions or to model healthy communication and vulnerability. However, it's important to note that while self-disclosure can be a tool in therapy, its use is always guided by professional ethics and the best interest of the client."
