This is not a valid reason because in reality, House races are very rarely uncontested, and when they are, it's usually due to special circumstances rather than a general trend. In fact, House races typically see more candidates and competition than Senate races, especially in terms of primary challenges. The other options are valid reasons why incumbents in the House might have an easier time getting reelected compared to Senators."
