The leaks resulted from the carelessness of the installer during the from the carelessness of the installer during the installation of the roof. The installer's truck, which had been parked in front of the homeowner's house during the roof installation, bore the manufacturer's logo. The manufacturer was aware that the truck and the literature supplied by the installer both displayed the manufacturer's logo. Is there any basis for a claim by the homeowner against the manufacturer?\n\nA. No, because a franchisor has no duty to supervise the conduct of a franchisee.\nB. No, under the rule that a manufacturer is liable only for defects in a product that existed at the time the product left the hands of the manufacturer.\nC. Yes, because the installer was a franchisee of the manufacturer.\nD. Yes, under the rule of apparent agency.\n"

Yes, under the rule of apparent agency.\n\nThe rule of apparent agency can apply if the principal (in this case, the manufacturer) has held the agent (the franchisee/installer) out as being capable of acting on behalf of the principal or if circumstances exist that would reasonably lead a third party to believe that the agent has the authority to act on behalf of the principal. In this scenario, since the installer's truck bore the manufacturer's logo and the manufacturer was aware that the truck and the literature supplied by the installer both displayed its logo, it could be argued that the manufacturer represented to the public that the installer was authorized to act on its behalf. This could create an impression that the installer was an agent of the manufacturer, leading to potential liability for the manufacturer under the doctrine of apparent agency."
