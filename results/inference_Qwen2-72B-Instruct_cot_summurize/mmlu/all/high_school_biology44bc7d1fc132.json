Phosphorus is cycled through the lithosphere (rocks and sediments), hydrosphere (water), and biosphere (living organisms) primarily in solid or aqueous forms. This is unlike carbon, sulfur, and water, which all have significant gaseous phases (CO2, SO2, H2O vapor, respectively) that play key roles in their respective cycles."
