Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been shown to achieve very high accuracy on the CIFAR-10 dataset, often exceeding 95% accuracy with proper model architecture, training techniques, and hyperparameter tuning.\n\nStatement 2 is false. Ensembles of neural networks can indeed improve classification accuracy by combining multiple models' predictions. This is because different models might learn different aspects of the data, and their errors tend to be uncorrelated. By averaging or voting among the predictions of multiple models, an ensemble can reduce both bias and variance, leading to better generalization performance."
