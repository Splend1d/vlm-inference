So, for every 5 units sold, 4 are DVD players and 1 is a home entertainment system.\n\nWeighted average contribution margin = (Number of DVD players * Contribution margin per DVD player + Number of home entertainment systems * Contribution margin per home entertainment system) / Total number of units\n\n= (4 * $40 + 1 * $140) / 5\n= ($160 + $140) / 5\n= $300 / 5\n= $60\n\nNext, we'll calculate the break-even point in units:\n\nBreak-even point (in units) = Fixed costs / Weighted average contribution margin per unit\n= $90,000 / $60\n= 1,500 units\n\nHowever, this calculation gives us the total number of units needed to break even. Since the ratio of DVD players to home entertainment systems is 4:1, we can determine the number of DVD players as follows:\n\nNumber of DVD players = (4/5) * Total units\n= (4/5) * 1,500\n= 1,200\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. 1200 DVD players need to be sold for the company to break even."
