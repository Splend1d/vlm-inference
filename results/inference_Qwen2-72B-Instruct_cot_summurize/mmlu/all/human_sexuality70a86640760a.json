Most girls and women discover masturbation on their own, often during childhood or adolescence, as they explore their bodies and sexuality. This can happen through touch, rubbing against objects or bedding, or other means of self-stimulation. While some may learn about masturbation from reading, peers, or observing others, self-discovery is the most common way that girls and women come to understand and engage in this practice. It's important to note that masturbation is a normal and healthy part of human sexuality, and can be a positive way for individuals to learn about their bodies and sexual desires."
