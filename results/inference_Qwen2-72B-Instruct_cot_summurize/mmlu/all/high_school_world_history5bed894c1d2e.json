The song references the \"Winter King,\" which is a title given to Frederick V, who was briefly the King of Bohemia during the early part of the Thirty Years' War (1618-1648). He earned the epithet \"Winter King\" because his reign in Bohemia lasted for only one winter before he was defeated by the Catholic forces loyal to the Holy Roman Emperor, Ferdinand II."
