The Creel Committee\n\nThe Creel Committee, formally known as the Committee on Public Information, was established by President Woodrow Wilson in April 1917 to promote U.S. participation in World War I. It was the first large-scale propaganda effort by the U.S. government and introduced decentralized publicity \"drives\" as a strategy to mobilize public opinion to support the war effort. These drives involved local committees across the country organizing events and distributing information to ensure broad public engagement and support for the war."
