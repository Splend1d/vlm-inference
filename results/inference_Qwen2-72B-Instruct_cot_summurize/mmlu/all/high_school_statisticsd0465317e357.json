We need to find out how many employees have incomes between $13,000 and $28,000.\n\nFirst, let's standardize these values using the z-score formula:\n\nz = (X - \u03bc) / \u03c3\n\nwhere X is the value, \u03bc is the mean, and \u03c3 is the standard deviation.\n\nFor $13,000:\nz1 = ($13,000 - $20,500) / $3,750 = -$7,500 / $3,750 = -2\n\nFor $28,000:\nz2 = ($28,000 - $20,500) / $3,750 = $7,500 / $3,750 = 2\n\nNow, we need to find the area under the standard normal curve between z1 = -2 and z2 = 2. Using the standard normal table or calculator, we find that:\n\nP(z < -2) \u2248 0.0228\nP(z < 2) \u2248 0.9772\n\nThe probability of an employee having an income between $13,000 and $28,000 is given by:\n\nP(-2 < z < 2) = P(z < 2) - P(z < -2) = 0.9772 - 0.0228 = 0.9544\n\nFinally, we multiply this probability by the total number of employees to find the expected number of employees with incomes between $13,000 and $28,000:\n\nExpected number of employees = 0.9544 * 400 \u2248 382\n\nNone of the provided options exactly matches 382, but option D (390) is the closest.\n\nSo, the answer is D. 390."
