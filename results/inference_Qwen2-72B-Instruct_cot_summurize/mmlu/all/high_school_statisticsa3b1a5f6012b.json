No matter how the population is distributed, as the sample size increases, the mean of the sample means becomes closer to the mean of the population AND \nB. No matter how the population is distributed, as the sample size increases, the standard deviation of the sample means becomes closer to the standard deviation of the population divided by the square root of the sample size.\n\nThese two statements together encapsulate the essence of the Central Limit Theorem (CLT). However, option C is not entirely accurate because the CLT states that the sampling distribution of the sample mean will approach a normal distribution regardless of the population distribution, as long as the sample size is large enough, not specifically requiring the population to be normally distributed. Option D is incorrect as it dismisses the concept without providing an alternative explanation."
