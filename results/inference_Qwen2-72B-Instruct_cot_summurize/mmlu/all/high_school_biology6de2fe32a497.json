For example, skeletal muscle cells convert pyruvate into lactic acid when no oxygen is present. Yeast cells can produce alcohol and carbon dioxide under the same circumstances. However, regardless of the specific reactions, the purpose of glycolysis is an important one. Which statement best describes the importance of glycolysis?\n\nA. It produces large amounts of ATP by substrate level phosphorylation.\nB. It reoxidizes NADH so that glycolysis can continue.\nC. It produces pyruvate, which is the raw material for oxidative phosphorylation.\nD. It occurs in the cytoplasm.\n"

However, it's worth noting that glycolysis also generates a net gain of 2 ATP molecules per glucose molecule through substrate-level phosphorylation (making option A partly true), and it does indeed reoxidize NADH to NAD+ allowing glycolysis to continue (making option B partly true as well). Glycolysis does occur in the cytoplasm (option D) but this is not its primary importance. The most crucial aspect of glycolysis is its production of pyruvate, which can then enter the mitochondria and be converted into acetyl-CoA for the Krebs cycle and subsequent oxidative phosphorylation, or it can be used in other metabolic pathways depending on the organism and environmental conditions."
