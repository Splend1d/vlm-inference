The Founders' primary objective when they met in 1787 to write the Constitution was to replace the weak central government created by the Articles of Confederation with a stronger one. The Articles of Confederation had created a loose confederation of sovereign states, and the central government lacked the power to effectively manage national affairs. The Constitution established a federal government with three branches and a system of checks and balances, providing a stronger framework for governing the nation. While the Bill of Rights was added later as amendments to the Constitution, it was not the primary objective of the Constitutional Convention."
