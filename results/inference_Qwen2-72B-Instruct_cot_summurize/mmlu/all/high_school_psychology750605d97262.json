This is because he collected data from a large group of people (2,000 randomly selected participants) by presumably asking them questions about their work habits and academic performance. This method allows researchers to gather information on people's behaviors, attitudes, and experiences without directly manipulating any variables, as would be done in an experiment. Naturalistic observation involves watching subjects in their natural environment without interference, and a case study typically focuses on a single individual or a small group in depth."
