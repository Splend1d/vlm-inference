CBr4\n\nIn a tetrahedral arrangement, there are four atoms or groups of atoms bonded to a central atom, with each bonded atom separated by approximately 109.5 degrees. This geometry is typical for molecules where the central atom has sp3 hybridization.\n\n- A. PCl4F does not have a tetrahedral shape because it has five atoms bonded to the central phosphorus atom, which would result in a trigonal bipyramidal or distorted geometry.\n- B. BF3 has a trigonal planar shape because boron has sp2 hybridization and forms three bonds with fluorine atoms.\n- C. CO2 has a linear shape due to the sp hybridization of the carbon atom and the presence of two double bonds with oxygen atoms.\n- D. CBr4 is the correct answer as carbon has sp3 hybridization and forms four single bonds with bromine atoms, resulting in a tetrahedral shape."
