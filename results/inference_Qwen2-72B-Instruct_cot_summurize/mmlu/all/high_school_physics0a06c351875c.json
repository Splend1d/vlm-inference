                    "text": "When objects slide down an incline with negligible friction, their acceleration is determined by the force of gravity acting along the incline and their mass does not affect their acceleration (as per Newton's second law, \\(F = ma\\), and the gravitational force can be written as \\(mg\\sin(\\theta)\\), where \\(m\\) is the mass, \\(g\\) is the acceleration due to gravity, and \\(\\theta\\) is the angle of the incline). Since the force due to gravity is proportional to the mass, and the acceleration is the force divided by the mass, the mass cancels out, meaning all objects, regardless of shape or mass, will accelerate at the same rate down the incline.\n\nGiven this, the sphere, the cube, and the cylinder will all slide down the incline with the same acceleration if there is no rolling motion and the only force acting on them is gravity. Therefore, they will all reach the base of the incline at the same time.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nD. All reach the base at the same time."
