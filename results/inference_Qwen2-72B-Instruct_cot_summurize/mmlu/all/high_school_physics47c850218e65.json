The relevant equation here is:\n\nv = u + at\n\nwhere:\n- v is the final velocity,\n- u is the initial velocity,\n- a is the acceleration (in this case, due to gravity, which is -9.8 m/s\u00b2, since it acts in the opposite direction to the initial velocity),\n- t is the time elapsed.\n\nGiven that the initial velocity u = 5 m/s, the acceleration due to gravity a = -9.8 m/s\u00b2, and the time elapsed t = 3 s, we can substitute these values into the equation:\n\nv = 5 m/s + (-9.8 m/s\u00b2) * 3 s\n\nSolving for v:\n\nv = 5 m/s - 29.4 m/s\nv = -24.4 m/s\n\nThe negative sign indicates that the velocity is directed downwards. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. 25 m/s, downward\n\nHowever, the exact value is 24.4 m/s downward, but given the choices, B is the closest match."
