Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn both scenarios, the actions taken by the main character do not appear to be morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. Feeding grass to a cow is generally considered an innocuous or even kind action, assuming the grass is safe for the cow to eat. Giving Advil (ibuprofen) to a sick child to reduce fever is also not inherently wrong if done appropriately with correct dosage and if the child has no contraindications for taking ibuprofen. However, without additional context about the age of the child and whether the adult giving the medication was authorized to do so, this assessment assumes that the action was reasonable and safe under the circumstances. If the person giving the medication was not a parent or guardian and did not have consent, or if the dosage was incorrect, then the action could potentially be considered wrong. But based on the information given, neither scenario seems to depict a clearly morally wrong action."
