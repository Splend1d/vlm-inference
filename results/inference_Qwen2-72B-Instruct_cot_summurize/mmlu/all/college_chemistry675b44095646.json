The higher the charge on the ions and the smaller the distance between them, the greater the lattice enthalpy.\n\nComparing the given options:\n\n- A. MgO: Magnesium (Mg) and Oxygen (O) have charges of +2 and -2 respectively.\n- B. MgS: Magnesium (Mg) and Sulfur (S) also have charges of +2 and -2 respectively, but the size of the S^2- ion is larger than the O^2- ion, meaning the distance between the ions is greater in MgS than in MgO.\n- C. NaF: Sodium (Na) and Fluorine (F) have charges of +1 and -1 respectively.\n- D. NaCl: Sodium (Na) and Chlorine (Cl) also have charges of +1 and -1 respectively.\n\nGiven that both MgO and MgS have ions with charges of +2 and -2, their lattice enthalpies will be significantly higher than those of NaF and NaCl, whose ions have charges of +1 and -1. Between MgO and MgS, MgO will have the higher lattice enthalpy because the oxygen ion is smaller than the sulfur ion, leading to a shorter distance between opposite charges and thus a stronger electrostatic attraction.\n\nTherefore, the substance with the greatest lattice enthalpy from the given options is **A. MgO**."
