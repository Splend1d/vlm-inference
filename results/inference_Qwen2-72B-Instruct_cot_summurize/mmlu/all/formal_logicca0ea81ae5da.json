This formula represents the disjunction (or) of three propositions: P (the restaurant serves pie), C (the restaurant serves cheesecake), and I (the restaurant serves ice cream). Options A and B are also correct, as they are logically equivalent to option C due to the associativity of the disjunction operator. However, since the question asks for the \"best\" symbolization, option C is the most concise and straightforward representation of the sentence. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nC. P \u2228 C \u2228 I"
