Complex question\n\nAsking a question that includes an unproven assumption can lead to a complex question fallacy, also known as many questions fallacy or plurium interrogationum. This fallacy occurs when a single question presupposes several other questions or assumptions, making it difficult for the respondent to address all parts of the question without first accepting the unproven assumptions."
