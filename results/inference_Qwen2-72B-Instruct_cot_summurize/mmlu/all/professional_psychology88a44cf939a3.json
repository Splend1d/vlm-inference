Eventually the infant settles down and returns to playing, apparently happily, with the toys provided. Which attachment classification is most likely to be appropriate for this infant\n\nA.

This behavior is most consistent with an infant who has an anxious-resistant (also known as ambivalent) attachment style.\n\nAn infant with an anxious-resistant attachment typically shows distress when the caregiver leaves, is not easily comforted upon reunion, and may resist contact or show contradictory behaviors such as reaching out but then pulling away when the caregiver tries to pick them up. They may also have difficulty settling back into play immediately after the caregiver's return.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Anxious resistant"
