The term \"pinch\" refers to the situation where the team is in a \"pinch\" or difficult situation and needs a better batter to replace the one currently due up in the lineup. Pinch hitters are often used as strategic substitutions to gain an advantage based on the opposing pitcher's strengths and weaknesses."
