This historical era was characterized by major changes in agriculture, manufacturing, mining, and transportation, and had a profound effect on the socioeconomic and cultural conditions of the time. The Industrial Revolution began in the late 18th century and continued into the 19th century. The reference to factories and child labor is particularly indicative of this period, as these were significant features of the Industrial Revolution.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. The Industrial Revolution"
