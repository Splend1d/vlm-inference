The Alamodome is primarily used by the NCAA's UTSA Roadrunners football team, and has been previously used by several professional teams on a temporary basis. However, the most well-known professional team associated with San Antonio is the San Antonio Spurs of the NBA, but they play at the AT&T Center, not the Alamodome. Therefore, none of the options you provided (A. New York Jets, B. Detroit Tigers, C. Boston Bruins, D. San Antonio Spurs) play their home games in the Alamodome. \n\nTo answer your question accurately: there is currently no professional sports team that calls the Alamodome their permanent home venue."
