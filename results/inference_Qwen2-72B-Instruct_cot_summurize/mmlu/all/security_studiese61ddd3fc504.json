Contemporary challenges to energy security include not only resource scarcity but also geopolitical tensions, infrastructure vulnerabilities, environmental concerns, and technological disruptions. These factors can lead to supply disruptions, price volatility, and market uncertainty, all of which can impact national and international security.\n\nB. Reliable energy supplies are essential for economic development. Energy is a critical input for industrial production, transportation, and other sectors that drive economic growth. Without secure access to energy, countries may struggle to maintain or improve their standard of living, which can lead to social unrest and political instability.\n\nC. Energy security involves a wide range of issues that span different scales, from individual households' access to electricity to the global geopolitics of oil and gas. It intersects with other security domains such as economic, environmental, and military security, making it a complex and integral part of overall national and international security strategies.\n\nGiven the interdependencies between energy and various aspects of modern life, ensuring energy security is a critical component of maintaining stability and prosperity at local, national, and global levels."
