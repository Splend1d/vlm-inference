Since there are seven oxygens in the dichromate ion, they contribute a total of -14 to the overall charge.\n\nTo balance the charge and make the overall charge of the dichromate ion -2, the two chromium atoms must have a combined oxidation state that contributes +12. Therefore, each chromium atom in the dichromate ion has an oxidation state of +6 because \\(2 \\times +6 = +12\\).\n\nWhen the dichromate ion reacts to form Cr3+, chromium's oxidation state changes from +6 to +3. This means that chromium gains electrons, which is a process known as reduction.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\nC. 6+, reduction"
