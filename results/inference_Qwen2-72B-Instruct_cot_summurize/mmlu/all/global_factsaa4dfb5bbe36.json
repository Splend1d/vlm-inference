                    "text": "The answer to your question would depend on the specific president you are referring to, as different presidents have had varying levels of approval when considering or attempting to run for a third term. However, it's important to note that the 22nd Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, ratified in 1951, limits the president to two terms. Before this amendment, some presidents did serve more than two terms, most notably Franklin D. Roosevelt, who was elected to four terms.\n\nIf we look at historical approval ratings before the 22nd Amendment, Franklin D. Roosevelt's approval ratings were quite high when he ran for his third term in 1940. According to Gallup polls, his approval rating was around 67% in October 1940, which is closest to option C (60%).\n\nHowever, since the question is phrased in a way that suggests it could apply to any president before being reelected for a third term, and given that no president has officially run for a third term under the current constitutional restrictions, it's not possible to give a definitive answer without additional context.\n\nIf we consider hypothetical scenarios after the ratification of the 22nd Amendment, no president has been in a position to run for a third term, so there are no approval ratings to reference for such a situation. \n\nTherefore, without specifying a particular president or time period, the question cannot be accurately answered with the options provided. If you meant to ask about a specific president, please provide more details."
