Institutional constraints limit the amount of resources to be spent on some good and force actors to choose how to manage the limited wealth available to them.\nB. Institutions are the social norms and expectations that affect an actor's goals and ambitions.\nC. Institutional constraints refer to tools of the state such as schools, prisons, and hospitals; the provision of resources for these institutions makes demands on political leaders.\nD. Institutions are humanly devised constrains that structure human interaction, they are man-made rules that guide decision making and govern behaviour.\n"

These can include formal constraints like laws, regulations, and constitutions, as well as informal constraints like social norms, customs, and traditions. Institutional constraints affect behaviour by setting the boundaries within which individuals and groups operate, shaping incentives and disincentives, and determining the costs and benefits associated with different actions. This can influence everything from economic activity and political participation to cultural practices and personal relationships."
