Railroad construction. In the late 19th century, there was a significant demand for labor to build the transcontinental railroad in the United States, which attracted many Chinese immigrants. These workers were often employed under harsh conditions and low wages but played a crucial role in completing the railroad projects that connected the East Coast to the West Coast. This influx of Chinese laborers contributed to anti-Chinese sentiment and fears of job competition among white workers, ultimately leading to the passage of the Chinese Exclusion Act, which sought to limit further Chinese immigration."
