Each molecule of Hb A is made up of four protein subunits: two alpha chains and two beta chains. These chains are held together by non-covalent bonds and contain heme groups that can bind oxygen molecules. Hemoglobin with this structure is responsible for oxygen transport in adults. In contrast, fetal hemoglobin (Hb F) contains two alpha chains and two gamma chains, while some forms of hemoglobin found in infants and young children contain two alpha chains and two delta chains."
