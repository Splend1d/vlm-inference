This can be seen as a positive development as it brings these dynamics into awareness where they can be addressed and integrated. However, it's important to note that while transference can be an indicator of progress, how it is handled by the therapist can greatly affect its therapeutic value. The goal is not to interpret or analyze the transference but rather to use it as a tool for here-and-now awareness and experimentation within the therapeutic relationship."
