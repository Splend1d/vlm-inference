In this essay, Thomson uses thought experiments, such as the famous violinist analogy, to argue that even if the fetus has a right to life, the mother's rights and moral considerations can sometimes outweigh the fetus's rights. By invoking virtues like compassion and selflessness, she suggests that there may be circumstances where it would not be morally wrong for a woman to choose an abortion, even if doing so could be seen as callous or self-centered from certain perspectives.\n\nIt is important to note that Thomson's argument is not strictly confined to any one ethical framework but draws on elements of various approaches. However, her emphasis on the moral character and virtues of the individuals involved aligns with virtue ethics, which focuses on the moral character of the person performing an action rather than on the action itself or its consequences."
