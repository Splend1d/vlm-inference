In this context, an intervening opportunity is a location that falls between an origin and destination where a person might choose to stop instead of continuing on to their original destination because it meets their needs sufficiently. Ralph chooses to buy the garden fertilizer at the nearby shop instead of driving further to the neighboring town because the nearby shop offers him the product he needs, thus intervening in his potential trip to the more distant location."
