Antibiotic use can disrupt the normal gut flora, allowing overgrowth of C. difficile which can cause antibiotic-associated diarrhea and pseudomembranous colitis. The other options (B, C, D) are less likely given the patient's recent history of antibiotic use and lack of specific symptoms or epidemiological risk factors associated with those infections."
