He is considering the purchase of a different type of hen, so he took a random sample of 18 eggs laid by this type of hen. The distribution of the masses is symmetric and mound-shaped with a mean of 54.1 grams and no outliers. The farmer conducted a t-test to see if there is evidence that the eggs from these hens have a mean mass that is different from 56 g and got a test statistic of t= -1.973. If he uses a 5% significance level, which is the correct conclusion and reason?\n\nA. Because tis more extreme than \u00b11.96, he should reject the null hypothesis. He has convincing evidence at the 5% significance level that the mean mass of eggs from these hens is different from 56 grams.\nB. Because tis less extreme than the critical value of t for 17 degrees of freedom, he should not reject the null hypothesis. He does not have convincing evidence at the 5% significance level that the mean mass of eggs from these hens is different from 56 grams.\nC. Because tis less extreme than the critical value of t for 18 degrees of freedom, he should not reject the null hypothesis. He does not have convincing evidence at the 5% significance level that the mean mass of eggs from these hens is different from 56 grams.\nD.

Because t is less extreme than the critical value of t for 17 degrees of freedom (since there were 18 eggs in the sample, the degrees of freedom are n-1 = 17), he should not reject the null hypothesis. He does not have convincing evidence at the 5% significance level that the mean mass of eggs from these hens is different from 56 grams.\n\nAt a 5% significance level, we need to compare the calculated t-value to the critical t-value for a two-tailed test (since the alternative hypothesis is that the mean is different from 56 grams, not just greater or less). For 17 degrees of freedom and a 5% significance level, the critical t-value is approximately \u00b12.110 (you would typically look this up in a t-distribution table or use statistical software). Since the calculated t-value (-1.973) is not more extreme than \u00b12.110, we fail to reject the null hypothesis."
