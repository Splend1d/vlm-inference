To eliminate the repeating decimal, we can multiply $x$ by a power of 10 that aligns the repeating digits. In this case, multiplying by 10 will not align the repeating part since the first digit is non-repeating, so we need to multiply by 100 to move both the non-repeating and repeating parts:\n\n\\[100x = 17.\\overline{7}\\]\n\nNow, subtracting the original equation from this new equation will eliminate the repeating part:\n\n\\[100x - x = 17.\\overline{7} - 0.1\\overline{7}\\]\n\n\\[99x = 17.6\\]\n\n\\[99x = \\frac{176}{10}\\]\n\n\\[99x = \\frac{88}{5}\\]\n\n\\[x = \\frac{88}{5 \\times 99}\\]\n\n\\[x = \\frac{88}{495}\\]\n\nSimplifying $\\frac{88}{495}$, we see that both the numerator and denominator are divisible by 11:\n\n\\[x = \\frac{8}{45}\\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. $\\boxed{\\frac{8}{45}}$."
