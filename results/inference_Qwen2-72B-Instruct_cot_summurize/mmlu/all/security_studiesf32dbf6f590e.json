Security is best defined using the traditional paradigm, with the state as the referent object to be secured using extraordinary measures where possible.\nC. To best understand security one must adopt a constructivist approach, threats exist only when articulated by a wider audience and may warrant the implementation of emergency measures.\nD. Security exists as an empirically verifiable and independent condition that changes only slightly, if at all, with regards to the social context in which it is applied.\n"

Security is a socially constructed concept, relative to the society in which it exists, and what will constitute an existential threat is accordingly subjective.\n\nThis statement aligns with the Copenhagen School's securitization theory, which posits that security is not an objective or fixed condition but rather a discursive process through which certain issues are framed as existential threats requiring extraordinary measures. This perspective emphasizes the role of language and speech acts in constructing security issues and the importance of societal context in defining what constitutes a threat."
