The formula for the frequency received by an observer (in this case, the wall) when both the source (the police car) and the observer are moving towards each other is:\n\n\\[f' = f \\left( \\frac{v + v_{obs}}{v - v_{src}} \\right)\\]\n\nHowever, since the wall is not moving, \\(v_{obs} = 0\\), so the equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[f' = f \\left( \\frac{v}{v - v_{src}} \\right)\\]\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\n\\[f' = 600 \\left( \\frac{350}{350 - 3.5} \\right) = 600 \\left( \\frac{350}{346.5} \\right) \\approx 600 \\times 1.00976 \\approx 605.856 \\text{ Hz}\\]\n\nThis is the frequency of the wave as it reaches the wall.\n\nNow, the wave reflects off the wall and travels back to the police car, which is still moving at 3.5 m/s towards the wave. This time, the formula will be:\n\n\\[f'' = f' \\left( \\frac{v + v_{src}}{v} \\right)\\]\n\nSubstituting the calculated \\(f'\\) and given values:\n\n\\[f'' = 605.856 \\left( \\frac{350 + 3.5}{350} \\right) = 605.856 \\left( \\frac{353.5}{350} \\right) \\approx 605.856 \\times 1.01 \\approx 611.915 \\text{ Hz}\\]\n\nSo, the frequency of the echo heard by the driver is approximately 612 Hz, making the answer closest to option C. 612 Hz."
