Changing the pressures of reactants or products (A and B) or the total mass of the chemicals present (D) will not change the value of K but will shift the position of the equilibrium to counteract the change according to Le Chatelier's principle.\n\nTherefore, changing option C, the temperature, will change the numerical value of the equilibrium constant. So the answer is:\n\nC. The temperature"
