Past medical history reveals cystic fibrosis. Examination of the knee reveals fluctuance on palpation of the joint but no increased warmth; mild restriction in range of motion due to the swelling is also noted. Numerous bruises are noted in various stages of resolution. Further history reveals easy bruising and bleeding from the gums over the past month. The most likely explanation for these findings is\n\nA. acquired factor VIII deficiency\nB. diffuse intravascular coagulation secondary to infection\nC. hypocomplementemia\nD. malabsorption of vitamins A, D, E, and K\n"

Vitamin K is essential for normal blood clotting, and its deficiency can lead to symptoms such as easy bruising and bleeding. The knee swelling could be due to a bleeding episode into the joint (hemarthrosis) secondary to the vitamin K deficiency.\n\nAcquired factor VIII deficiency (A), diffuse intravascular coagulation (B), and hypocomplementemia (C) do not typically present with the constellation of symptoms described here and are less likely explanations given the patient's history of cystic fibrosis and the absence of other typical signs of those conditions."
