Instead, its constitutional framework is made up of various sources including Acts of Parliament, common law, conventions, and works of authority. This means that there isn't a single document that sets out the laws and principles that govern the country like in countries with a codified constitution. Therefore, option C is the most accurate statement about the UK Constitution."
