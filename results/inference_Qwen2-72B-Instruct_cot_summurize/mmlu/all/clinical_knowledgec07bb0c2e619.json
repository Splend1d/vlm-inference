More prominent in expiration\n\nPleural friction rubs are often described as sounding like \"two pieces of leather rubbing together\" and are typically heard during both inspiration and expiration, but they can sometimes be more prominent during expiration. Crackles, on the other hand, are usually heard during inspiration and are associated with conditions such as heart failure or pneumonia.\n\nThe other options do not specifically differentiate between pleural friction rubs and crackles:\n- B. Alters with coughing: Both pleural friction rubs and crackles can alter with coughing.\n- C. No pain over the area: Pleural friction rubs may be associated with pleuritic chest pain, but absence of pain does not rule out either condition.\n- D. Clubbing: This refers to changes in the fingers or toes and is not directly related to the differentiation between pleural friction rubs and crackles. Clubbing can be a sign of underlying lung disease but is not specific to either of these breath sounds."
