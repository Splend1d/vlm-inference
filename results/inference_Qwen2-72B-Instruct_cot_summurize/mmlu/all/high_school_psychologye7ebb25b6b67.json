It includes structures such as the amygdala, hippocampus, thalamus, hypothalamus, and cingulate gyrus. The limbic system is particularly involved in the processing of emotions, including fear, pleasure, and anger, and in the formation of emotional memories. It also has a role in motivation, arousal, and the regulation of autonomic functions such as heart rate and blood pressure."
