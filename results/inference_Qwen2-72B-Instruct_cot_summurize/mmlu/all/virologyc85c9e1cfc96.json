Concurrently with antiretroviral drugs\n\nHowever, the exact timing can be complex and depends on several factors including the severity of the patient's immune suppression, the presence of drug-drug interactions between the TB and HIV medications, and the risk of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). According to current guidelines, in patients with severe immunosuppression (CD4 count <50 cells/mm\u00b3), antiretroviral therapy should be initiated 4-6 weeks after starting TB treatment. In those with less severe immunosuppression, ART can be started concurrently with TB treatment or even before TB treatment if there is a delay in initiating TB therapy. Always consult the latest clinical guidelines and consider consulting with an infectious disease specialist for individualized patient management."
