These disorders cause a loss of recall of learned information = anterograde amnesia.\n\nThis statement is not entirely incorrect, but it is misleading because it implies that amnesic disorders only cause anterograde amnesia (the inability to form new memories after the onset of the disorder). In fact, amnesic disorders can also cause retrograde amnesia (loss of memories formed before the onset of the disorder) or both anterograde and retrograde amnesia, depending on the specific nature and extent of the pathology involved. Therefore, while anterograde amnesia is a common symptom of amnesic disorders, it is not the only type of memory impairment that can occur."
