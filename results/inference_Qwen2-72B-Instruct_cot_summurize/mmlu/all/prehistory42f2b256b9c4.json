However, it should be noted that the capital of the Tiwanaku state was actually the city of Tiwanaku itself, not Titicaca. Lake Titicaca is nearby, but it was not the capital. The Tiwanaku civilization flourished between approximately 600 and 1000 AD and had a significant influence on Andean culture."
