Apoptosis is a programmed cell death mechanism that can be triggered by various stimuli, including viral infection. Many viruses have evolved mechanisms to induce apoptosis in infected cells as a way to promote their own replication and spread. This process involves the activation of caspases, which are enzymes that cleave specific proteins within the cell, leading to its eventual demise. While other mechanisms listed (A, C, and D) can also contribute to cell death in certain contexts, apoptosis is a particularly common and well-studied pathway for virus-induced cell death."
