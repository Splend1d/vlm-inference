The wear patterns on the teeth and the chemical analysis of tooth enamel suggest that these early hominids had a predominantly vegetarian diet, with an emphasis on foods typical of forested environments, such as fruits, leaves, and other vegetation associated with C3 photosynthetic pathways (as opposed to C4 grasses). While there might have been some inclusion of harder objects like seeds or small bones, the primary dietary components were soft plant materials."
