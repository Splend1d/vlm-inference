This is because if \\(I\\) is a maximal ideal and \\(ab \\in I\\), then either \\(a \\in I\\) or \\(b \\in I\\). This is due to the fact that if neither \\(a\\) nor \\(b\\) were in \\(I\\), then \\(I + (a)\\) and \\(I + (b)\\) would be ideals properly containing \\(I\\), contradicting the maximality of \\(I\\).\n\nStatement 2: If \\(I\\) is a maximal ideal of a commutative ring \\(R\\), then \\(R/I\\) is indeed a field. This is because the only ideals of \\(R/I\\) are the zero ideal \\(\\{0 + I\\}\\) and \\(R/I\\) itself, which are exactly what you need for \\(R/I\\) to be a field (every nonzero element has a multiplicative inverse). The maximality of \\(I\\) ensures there are no nontrivial ideals in \\(R/I\\)."
