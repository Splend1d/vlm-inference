Not wrong, Wrong\n\nExplanation: In scenario 1, putting a 2-cent stamp on a bill doesn't cause harm or break any laws, although it might not serve its intended purpose since bills typically aren't mailed back to the payer. In scenario 2, coughing into food at a grocery store is both morally and legally wrong, as it can contaminate the food and potentially harm others, especially during a pandemic like COVID-19."
