Crete was populated by Greeks and others, but Minoan culture was a local development.\n\nThis answer reflects the current understanding that the Minoan civilization developed independently on the island of Crete, although it had contact with other cultures such as the Egyptians and Mesopotamians. There is no evidence to support that Crete was colonized by the Egyptians or that early humans crossed a land bridge to Crete around 150,000 years before present (B.P.). While there were influences from other cultures, Minoan civilization is considered to have been a distinct and indigenous development."
