Given a commutative ring \\(R\\) and an ideal \\(I\\) of \\(R\\), the quotient ring \\(R/I\\) is defined as the set of cosets \\(\\{r + I : r \\in R\\}\\). The operation of addition in \\(R/I\\) is given by \\((r + I) + (s + I) = (r + s) + I\\), which is clearly commutative since addition in \\(R\\) is commutative. Multiplication in \\(R/I\\) is defined by \\((r + I)(s + I) = rs + I\\). Since multiplication in \\(R\\) is commutative, we have that \\((r + I)(s + I) = rs + I = sr + I = (s + I)(r + I)\\), showing that \\(R/I\\) is also a commutative ring.\n\n**Statement 2**: \"An ideal \\(N\\) in a ring \\(R\\) with unity \\(1\\) is all of \\(R\\) if and only if \\(1 \\in N\\).\"\n\nThis statement is also true. If \\(N = R\\), then \\(1 \\in R\\) implies \\(1 \\in N\\) because \\(N\\) contains all elements of \\(R\\). Conversely, if \\(1 \\in N\\), then for any element \\(r \\in R\\), we have \\(r = r \\cdot 1 \\in N\\) because \\(N\\) is an ideal and thus closed under multiplication by any element of \\(R\\). This shows that \\(N\\) must contain all elements of \\(R\\), so \\(N = R\\).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **A. True, True**."
