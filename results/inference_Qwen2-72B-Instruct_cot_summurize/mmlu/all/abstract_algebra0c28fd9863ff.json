According to Sylow's Theorems, for every prime factor p of the order of a group G, there exists a Sylow p-subgroup of G whose order is \\(p^k\\), where \\(p^k\\) is the highest power of p that divides the order of G.\n\nFor a group G of order 42, the number of Sylow 7-subgroups (n_7) must divide the index [G : P] = 42/7 = 6 and also be congruent to 1 modulo 7. The only possibility here is n_7 = 1, which means there is exactly one Sylow 7-subgroup, and it must be normal (since all Sylow p-subgroups are conjugate and if there is only one, it cannot be conjugate to any other).\n\nTherefore, **Statement 1 is True**.\n\n**Statement 2: Every group of order 42 has a normal subgroup of order 8.**\n\nHowever, 8 does not divide 42, so there cannot be a subgroup of order 8 in a group of order 42 by Lagrange's theorem, which states that the order of any subgroup must divide the order of the group.\n\nTherefore, **Statement 2 is False**.\n\nSo, the correct answer is **C. True, False**."
