The title search revealed an open mortgage from a previous owner to a local bank. It was recorded 25 years ago. The mortgagor could not be found and the bank lost its records. The purchase agreement gave the seller 90 days extra in such a situation to clear title by bringing a quiet title action. The seller did not follow that provision and went to settlement with the bad title and demanded more extra time to file a quiet title action. The buyer decided not to wait and demanded her down payment be returned and that the deal be rescinded. Will litigation most likely favor the buyer's position?\n\nA. Yes, because the seller breached the agreement by not following the procedure stated in the purchase agreement.\nB. No, because the seller always has the right to bring an action for adverse possession against the holder of the open mortgage.\nC. Yes, because the open mortgage is so old that it would be declared void by all courts.\nD. No, because the buyer did not act in good faith when it refused to give the seller additional time at the closing.\n"

Yes, because the seller breached the agreement by not following the procedure stated in the purchase agreement.\n\nThe seller had a contractual obligation to convey good and marketable title to the buyer within the agreed-upon timeframe, including any additional 90-day period specified for resolving title issues. By failing to initiate a quiet title action as stipulated in the agreement, the seller violated the terms of the contract. The buyer, having fulfilled their part of the agreement (including making the down payment), is entitled to have their deposit returned and the deal rescinded due to the seller's breach of contract. The seller's failure to act according to the specific provisions set out in the purchase agreement regarding title defects is a material breach, giving the buyer grounds to seek rescission of the contract."
