Human security is threatened by global inequality, because 3s of the world population do not share the benefits of globalisation. However, this inequality does not translate into political instability or involve military action.\nB. Global inequality creates disenfranchised populations who, although discontent with their situation, lack the agency to rebel or protest.\nC. Revolutionary uprisings are likely to occur; people of the world who have been left behind by neoliberal globalisation can become radicalised and rebel against those who have benefitted from the economic policies that have failed them.\nD.

Revolutionary uprisings are likely to occur; people of the world who have been left behind by neoliberal globalisation can become radicalised and rebel against those who have benefitted from the economic policies that have failed them.\n\nGlobal inequality can indeed pose a threat to global security by creating conditions that foster political instability, social unrest, and conflict. When large portions of the world's population feel disenfranchised and perceive that they are not benefiting from economic growth and globalization, it can lead to frustration and anger. This sense of injustice can be exploited by extremist groups or leaders who promise to address these grievances, potentially leading to radicalization and violent uprisings. Additionally, inequality can exacerbate tensions between countries, as poorer nations may resent wealthier ones for perceived exploitation or neglect, which could escalate into international conflicts."
