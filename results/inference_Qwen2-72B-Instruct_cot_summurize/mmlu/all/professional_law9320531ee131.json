When a preliminary injunction hearing could not be scheduled within the original 14-day period, the court extended the TRO for another 30 days. The lender appealed the court's order extending the TRO. The homeowner has moved to dismiss the appeal. Is the appellate court likely to dismiss the appeal?\n\nA. No, because a TRO is immediately appealable.\nB. No, because the 30-day extension makes the TRO equivalent to a preliminary injunction and therefore appealable.\nC. Yes, because a TRO is not appealable under the interlocutory appeals statute.\nD. Yes, because there is no final judgment from which an appeal may be taken.\n"

No, because the 30-day extension makes the TRO equivalent to a preliminary injunction and therefore appealable.\n\nTypically, temporary restraining orders (TROs) are not appealable because they are considered temporary measures that do not resolve any of the parties' rights on the merits of the case. However, when a TRO is extended beyond its usual short duration and begins to resemble a preliminary injunction in terms of its length and effect, it may become appealable. This is because such an extension can have significant consequences for the parties involved and may be seen as effectively granting injunctive relief, which is generally appealable under the interlocutory appeals statute. Therefore, the appellate court is likely to consider the appeal based on the argument that the extended TRO functions similarly to a preliminary injunction."
