All of the above\n\nResearch has shown that diets high in glycaemic index carbohydrates, high n-6:n-3 fat ratios, and long-chain saturated fats may contribute to accelerated cognitive decline. These dietary patterns can lead to inflammation, oxidative stress, and insulin resistance, all of which have been linked to cognitive impairment and neurodegeneration.\n\nA. High glycaemic index (GI) carbohydrates: Diets high in GI foods like refined grains, sugars, and processed foods can lead to chronic hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, and inflammation, all of which can negatively impact brain health.\n\nB. A high n-6:n-3 fat ratio: The balance between omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids is important for maintaining optimal health. An imbalance with a higher proportion of omega-6 fatty acids can lead to inflammation, which has been linked to cognitive decline.\n\nC. Long chain saturated fats: Consuming excessive amounts of saturated fats, particularly those found in animal products like red meat and full-fat dairy, has been associated with an increased risk of cognitive decline and dementia.\n\nIt's worth noting that while these dietary components may increase the risk of cognitive decline, a balanced diet rich in whole foods, healthy fats, and antioxidants can help protect against cognitive impairment and promote overall brain health."
