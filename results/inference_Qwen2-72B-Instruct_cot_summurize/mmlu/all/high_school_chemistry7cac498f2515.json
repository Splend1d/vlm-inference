A buffer solution is made by combining a weak acid with its conjugate base or a weak base with its conjugate acid. Since the student already has a strong acid (which will fully dissociate in solution), adding a weak base will allow some of the strong acid to react with the weak base and form the conjugate acid of that weak base. This mixture will then act as a buffer, resisting changes in pH when small amounts of acid or base are added.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. a weak base"
