There will be less precipitation in those clear-cut areas.\n\nTropical rain forests play a significant role in the water cycle, as trees absorb water through their roots and release it into the atmosphere through a process called transpiration. When forests are cleared, this process is disrupted, leading to reduced rainfall in the area. This can result in drier conditions, affecting local ecosystems, agriculture, and water resources."
