After the power stroke, the myosin head must detach from the actin filament to allow the thin filaments to slide back to their original position, readying the myosin head for another cycle. This detachment requires energy in the form of ATP. The myosin head binds to ATP, causing it to release the actin filament. Once ATP is hydrolyzed to ADP and inorganic phosphate (Pi), the myosin head undergoes a conformational change that allows it to bind to actin again, initiating another cross-bridge cycle."
