                    "text": "The correct answer is C. The density of the hydrogen gas is less than the nitrogen gas.\n\nExplanation:\nA. The average kinetic energy of both gases would be the same because they are at thermal equilibrium with the same temperature. Kinetic energy is directly proportional to temperature, not molecular mass.\nB. The average force exerted on the container by the gas (pressure) depends on the number of molecules and their speed, not just the type of molecule. Without knowing the number of molecules in each container, we can't compare the pressures directly.\nC. Density is mass per unit volume. Nitrogen has a greater molar mass than hydrogen, so for the same number of moles, nitrogen will have a higher density.\nD. While it's true that pressures can't be compared without knowing the number of molecules, this option is more of a clarification than an assertion about the properties of the gases in question. Since C is a direct comparison of a property of the two gases, it is the best answer."
