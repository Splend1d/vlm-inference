The principle of military necessity allows for the use of force to achieve military objectives but requires that such force be necessary and proportionate to the military advantage gained. Jus ad bellum, on the other hand, concerns the morality of going to war in the first place. Moral nihilism is an entirely different concept, denying the existence of any objective moral truths or values."
