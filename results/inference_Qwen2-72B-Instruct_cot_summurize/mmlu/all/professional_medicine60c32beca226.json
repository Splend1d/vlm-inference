When these two individuals have children, we can use a Punnett square to determine the possible genotypes of their offspring.\n\nLet's denote:\n- \u03b1\u03b1 as the normal genotype with no deletions.\n- \u03b1- as a deletion.\n\nThe mother's genotype: \u03b1-/\u03b1\u03b1\nThe father's genotype: \u03b1-/\u03b1-\n\nWhen they have children:\n\n1. There's a 25% chance that the child will inherit \u03b1- from both parents (\u03b1-/\u03b1-), resulting in a two-gene deletion phenotype.\n2. There's a 25% chance that the child will inherit \u03b1\u03b1 from the mother and \u03b1- from the father (\u03b1\u03b1/\u03b1-), which would be a one-gene deletion phenotype.\n3.
