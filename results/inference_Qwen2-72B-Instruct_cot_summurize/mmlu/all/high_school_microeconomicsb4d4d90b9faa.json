Their primary focus is on negotiating better wages, benefits, and working conditions for their members through collective bargaining. They may also use restrictive membership policies or featherbedding (rules that require unnecessary workers or work processes) to maintain higher wages by limiting labor supply or increasing demand for union labor, but they do not directly manipulate the prices of substitute resources."
