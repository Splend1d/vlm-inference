According to the question, five years ago, there was a computer that worked half as fast (\\(\\frac{1}{2}S\\)) and cost twice as much (\\(2P\\)).\n\nThe speed-to-price ratio for the current computer is \\(\\frac{S}{P}\\).\n\nThe speed-to-price ratio for the older computer is \\(\\frac{\\frac{1}{2}S}{2P} = \\frac{S}{4P}\\).\n\nTo find how much the current computer's speed-to-price ratio is compared to the older computer's, we divide the two ratios:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\frac{S}{P}}{\\frac{S}{4P}} = \\frac{S}{P} * \\frac{4P}{S} = 4.\n\\]\n\nThis means the current computer's speed-to-price ratio is 4 times or 400% of the older computer's speed-to-price ratio.\n\nSo, the answer is B. 400."
