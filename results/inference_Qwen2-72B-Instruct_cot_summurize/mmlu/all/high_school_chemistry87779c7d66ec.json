Mathematically, this relationship is expressed as:\n\n\\[V_1 / T_1 = V_2 / T_2\\]\n\nwhere \\(V_1\\) and \\(T_1\\) are the initial volume and temperature, and \\(V_2\\) and \\(T_2\\) are the final volume and temperature, respectively.\n\nGiven:\n- Initial volume (\\(V_1\\)) = 5.00 L\n- Initial temperature (\\(T_1\\)) = 127\u00b0C = 127 + 273.15 K = 400.15 K (converting Celsius to Kelvin)\n- Final volume (\\(V_2\\)) = 10.00 L\n\nWe need to find the final temperature (\\(T_2\\)) in Kelvin and then convert it back to Celsius.\n\nUsing Charles's Law:\n\n\\[\\frac{5.00 \\text{ L}}{400.15 \\text{ K}} = \\frac{10.00 \\text{ L}}{T_2}\\]\n\nSolving for \\(T_2\\):\n\n\\[T_2 = \\frac{(10.00 \\text{ L}) \\times (400.15 \\text{ K})}{5.00 \\text{ L}} = 800.30 \\text{ K}\\]\n\nConverting \\(T_2\\) from Kelvin back to Celsius:\n\n\\[T_2 = 800.30 \\text{ K} - 273.15 = 527.15^\\circ C\\]\n\nRounding to the nearest whole number gives us 527\u00b0C.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. 527\u00b0C."
