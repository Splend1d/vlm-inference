Aquinas believed that moral principles can be derived from an understanding of human nature and its purpose or end (telos). This is known as natural law theory, which holds that there are certain actions that are inherently good or bad based on their conformity to human nature and its proper functioning. Aquinas also emphasized the role of reason in discerning these moral principles and applying them to specific situations. While virtues are important in Aquinas's moral theory, they are not the ultimate ground of morality, but rather dispositions that enable a person to act in accordance with the moral law."
