Decrease price as demand is elastic.\n\nWhen demand is elastic (price elasticity of demand > 1), a decrease in price leads to a proportionally larger increase in quantity demanded, which can result in an increase in total revenue. Conversely, increasing prices when demand is elastic would likely lead to a decrease in total revenue because the drop in quantity demanded would outweigh the higher price per unit."
