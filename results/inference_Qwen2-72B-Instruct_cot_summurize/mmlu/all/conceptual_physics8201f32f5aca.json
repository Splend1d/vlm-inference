This is because each additional lamp provides an alternative path for the current to flow, effectively reducing the overall resistance.\n\nAccording to Ohm's Law (V=IR), where V is voltage, I is current, and R is resistance, if the voltage across the circuit remains constant (as it would from a standard power source like a battery or a wall outlet), then as the total resistance (R) decreases, the current (I) must increase to keep the equation balanced.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Increases."
