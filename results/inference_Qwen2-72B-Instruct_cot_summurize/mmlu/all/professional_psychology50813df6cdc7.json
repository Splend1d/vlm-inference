In this style of communication, the context plays a lesser role in conveying meaning. Therefore, option B (It relies heavily on nonverbal cues) is not true.\n\nThe statement that is true about low-context communication among the options provided is:\n\nD. It is more typical of culturally diverse groups in the United States\n\nThis is because low-context communication is often associated with individualistic cultures, where people tend to be more direct and explicit in their communication. Culturally diverse groups in the U.S., which include many individuals from individualistic backgrounds, are more likely to use low-context communication styles. However, it's important to note that communication styles can vary widely within any given group, and cultural generalizations should be applied cautiously."
