Therefore, the correct answer is C. This perspective aligns with the idea that certain fundamental human rights are essential and that legal and economic structures must respect and protect them to be considered just. While the other options may also be important considerations for evaluating justice, Ashford specifically emphasizes the importance of human rights in this context."
