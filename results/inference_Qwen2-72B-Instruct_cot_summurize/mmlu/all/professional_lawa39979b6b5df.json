The parties entered into a contract whereby the seller agreed to deliver to the buyer 1,000 flanges for $10,000. The contract stipulated that it was FOB at the seller's place of business. The seller then delivered the flanges to a delivery company, which was to transport them to the buyer. While en route, the vehicle that was transporting the flanges was involved in an accident and the flanges were destroyed. When the buyer received notice of the accident, the buyer immediately contacted the seller and demanded that it ship replacement flanges. The seller refused to do so. In an action by the buyer against the seller for breach of contract, the buyer will\n\nA. succeed, because the risk of loss was on the seller.\nB. succeed, because the carrier was the seller's agent.\nC. not succeed, because the risk of loss was on the buyer.\nD. not succeed, because of frustration of purpose.\n"

This means that the risk of loss passes from the seller to the buyer once the goods are placed with the carrier at the seller's location. Since the flanges were already in transit and thus had been delivered to the carrier, the risk of loss had already passed to the buyer. Therefore, when the accident occurred and the flanges were destroyed, the buyer bore the risk of that loss, not the seller. As such, the seller did not breach the contract by refusing to ship replacement flanges."
