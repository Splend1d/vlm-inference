One night, the retiree and his wife were returning home from dinner when they were accosted by a man outside their apartment building. The man brandished a gun and told the retiree and his wife to take him to their apartment. Upon entering the apartment, the man blindfolded the retiree and his wife and tied them up with duct tape to chairs in the living room. The man then stole the retiree's wallet and assorted jewelry from the bedroom. After the man exited the apartment, the retiree and his wife tried desperately to free themselves from their constraints. As the retiree was struggling, he suffered a heart attack and died. The man should be found guilty of\n\nA. burglary.\nB. robbery and burglary.\nC. robbery and murder.\nD. burglary, robbery, and murder.\n"

Burglary: The man entered the retiree's apartment with the intent to commit a crime, which is theft in this case. This constitutes burglary.\n\n2. Robbery: The man used force or threat of force (brandishing a gun) to steal property (wallet and jewelry) directly from the person or presence of the retiree and his wife. This constitutes robbery.\n\n3. Murder: The retiree died as a result of the events that transpired during the commission of the crimes. In many jurisdictions, if someone dies during the commission of a felony, such as a robbery or burglary, the perpetrator can be charged with felony murder. Even if the death was not intentional, the fact that it occurred during the commission of a dangerous felony can lead to a murder charge.\n\nTherefore, the man could be charged with burglary, robbery, and murder."
