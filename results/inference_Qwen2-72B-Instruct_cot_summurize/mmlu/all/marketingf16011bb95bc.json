It's a marketing term that describes the stages that an individual passes through before making a purchase. The model suggests that before a customer can take action (make a purchase), they must first be made aware of a product (Attention), become interested in it (Interest), develop a desire for it (Desire), and then take action (Action).\n\nA. ADD does not represent any known sequential model in advertising.\n\nC. PESTLE (Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Legal, Environmental) is a framework used to analyze the macro-environmental factors that may impact an organization.\n\nD. SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) is a strategic planning technique used to help a person or organization identify strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats related to business competition or project planning."
