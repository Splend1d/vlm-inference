After this period, the blood product can start to deteriorate, potentially leading to bacterial growth or other adverse effects that could harm the recipient. It's important to note that these guidelines may vary slightly depending on local protocols or specific circumstances, but generally, the four-hour window is widely accepted as the safe limit for initiating a transfusion after removing a blood product from refrigeration."
