When investors feel optimistic about the economy or specific investment opportunities, they are more likely to increase their investment spending. This can lead to higher demand for capital goods, which in turn can stimulate economic growth.\n\nA. Real GDP decreasing would generally have a negative impact on investment demand as it suggests a contracting economy with less potential for profit.\nB. An increase in the cost of acquiring and maintaining capital equipment would also likely reduce investment demand, as it raises the cost of doing business.\nD. A rise in the real rate of interest would typically discourage investment because borrowing costs increase, making it more expensive to finance new projects."
