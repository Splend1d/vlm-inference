The other three options (innovation, diffusion, and acculturation) are all processes that can lead to cultural change. Innovation refers to the creation of new ideas or practices within a culture. Diffusion refers to the spread of cultural elements from one group to another. Acculturation refers to the process by which a person or group adopts the customs, language, values, and behaviors of another culture."
