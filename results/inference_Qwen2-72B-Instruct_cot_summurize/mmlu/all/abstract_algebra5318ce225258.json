                    "text": "To determine the correctness of these statements, we need to understand what it means for an abelian group to be free and what constitutes a basis for such a group.\n\nA **free abelian group** is one that can be constructed from a set of generators with no relations between them other than those implied by the group operation being commutative (abelian). A basis for a free abelian group is a set of elements in the group such that every element of the group can be uniquely written as a linear combination of these basis elements with integer coefficients.\n\n### Statement 1: Every nonzero free abelian group has an infinite number of bases.\n\nThis statement is true. Consider a free abelian group generated by a single element, say \\( \\langle a \\rangle \\), where \\(a\\) is not the identity element. This group is isomorphic to \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\), the integers under addition. Any non-zero multiple of \\(a\\) also generates this group, meaning \\(na\\) for any non-zero integer \\(n\\) can serve as a basis for this group. Since there are infinitely many non-zero integers, there are infinitely many possible bases for this group. For free abelian groups of higher rank, the situation is similar but more complex; each generator can be replaced by any non-zero multiple of itself, leading to an infinite number of possible bases.\n\n### Statement 2: Every free abelian group of rank at least 2 has an infinite number of bases.\n\nThis statement is also true. In a free abelian group of rank \\(n \\geq 2\\), consider a basis \\(\\{b_1, b_2, ..., b_n\\}\\). For any two distinct elements \\(b_i\\) and \\(b_j\\) in the basis, you can replace them with \\(mb_i + nb_j\\) and \\(-nb_i + mb_j\\) for any non-zero integers \\(m\\) and \\(n\\), and the resulting set will still be a basis for the group. Since there are infinitely many choices for \\(m\\) and \\(n\\), and since this operation can be applied to any pair of basis elements, there are indeed infinitely many possible bases for any free abelian group of rank at least 2.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nA. True, True"
