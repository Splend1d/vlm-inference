The plaintiff alleges only a cause of action arising under a federal statute, although state law provides a similar cause of action. The federal statute provides that claims under the statute can be brought in any court of competent jurisdiction. The statute has not yet been interpreted by any federal court. Should the state court hear the case?\n\nA. No, because cases arising under federal law must be decided in federal court.\nB. No, because state courts must abstain in cases arising under federal law until a federal court has decided the federal issue.\nC. Yes, because state courts may not discriminate against cases arising under discriminate against cases arising under federal law.\nD. Yes, because the parties cannot proceed in federal court since there is no diversity of citizenship.\n"

Yes, because state courts may not discriminate against cases arising under federal law.\n\nState courts have the authority to hear cases arising under federal law, and they cannot discriminate against such cases. The fact that the federal statute allows claims to be brought in any court of competent jurisdiction supports the idea that the state court can hear the case. The absence of diversity of citizenship does not preclude a federal court from hearing the case, but it does not prevent the state court from exercising jurisdiction either."
