The remaining amount can be lent out or used for other purposes. This amount is called excess reserves.\n\nGiven that the excess reserves increase by $700 when $1000 is deposited, we know that the bank held R * $1000 in reserve and lent out (or made available as excess reserves) $1000 - R * $1000 = $700.\n\nSo, we have:\n\n$1000 - R * $1000 = $700\n\nSolving for R:\n\n$1000(1-R) = $700\n\nDivide both sides by $1000:\n\n1 - R = 0.7\n\nSubtract 1 from both sides:\n\n-R = -0.3\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\nR = 0.3\n\nTherefore, the reserve ratio must be 30%."
