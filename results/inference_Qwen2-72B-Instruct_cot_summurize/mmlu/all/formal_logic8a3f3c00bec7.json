In other words, Emily stopping working is a consequence of at least one of these two things not happening. \n\nOption A is incorrect because it suggests that both Marina not reading a Percy Jackson book and Izzy not playing Minecraft must be true for Emily to stop working, which is not what the formula states. Option C is also incorrect because it suggests that Marina not reading a Percy Jackson book or Izzy not playing Minecraft alone can cause Emily to stop working, which is not necessarily true according to the formula. Option D is incorrect because it reverses the direction of causality, suggesting that Emily stopping work causes Marina not to read a Percy Jackson book or Izzy not to play Minecraft, which is not what the formula states."
