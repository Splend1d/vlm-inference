A group of cookies stored by the user's Web browser can track browsing history and online behavior, which can be used to build a profile of the user's interests and preferences.\n\nB. The Internet Protocol (IP) address of the user's computer can reveal the user's physical location and internet service provider.\n\nC. The user's e-mail address can be used to send spam or phishing emails, and can also be used to reset passwords or verify identity for various online accounts.\n\nD. The user's public key used for encryption is generally not a threat to personal privacy since it is meant to be shared publicly and cannot be used to decrypt private data without the corresponding private key.\n\nOf these options, A and B have the greatest potential for compromising a user's personal privacy, depending on the specific circumstances. However, all of the options can potentially be used to compromise privacy if they fall into the wrong hands."
