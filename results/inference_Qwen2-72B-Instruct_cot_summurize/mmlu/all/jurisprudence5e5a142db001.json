The law is inextricably bound up with morals.\n\nNon-positivist legal theorists argue that there is an inherent connection between law and morality, and that laws should be based on moral principles. They believe that the validity of a law is not solely determined by its source or the authority that enacted it, but also by its content and whether it aligns with fundamental moral values. Therefore, they see law as being inextricably bound up with morals."
