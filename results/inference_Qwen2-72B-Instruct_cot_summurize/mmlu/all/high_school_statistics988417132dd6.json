Therefore, the probability of their intersection is zero. However, if two events are independent, then the probability of their intersection is equal to the product of their individual probabilities. This means that if E and F are both independent and mutually exclusive, then we have:\n\nP(E \u2229 F) = P(E) * P(F) = 0\n\nBut this implies that either P(E) or P(F) (or both) must be zero, which contradicts the assumption that they have nonzero probabilities. Therefore, it is impossible for E and F to be both independent and mutually exclusive.\n\nAs for the other options:\n- A. It is possible for the sum of two probabilities to be greater than 1 if the events are not mutually exclusive.\n- B. It is possible for the difference between two probabilities to be negative if the second probability is greater than the first.\n- C. It is possible for the ratio of two probabilities to be greater than 1 if the numerator is greater than the denominator."
