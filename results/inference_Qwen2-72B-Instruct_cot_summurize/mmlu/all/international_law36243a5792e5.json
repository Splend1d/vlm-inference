Yes, article 103 of the UN Charter cannot trump jus cogens norms\n\nArticle 103 of the United Nations Charter states that in the event of a conflict between obligations under the Charter and obligations under other international agreements, the former shall prevail. However, this does not mean that Article 103 has unlimited application. It cannot override peremptory norms (jus cogens) of international law, which are recognized as fundamental principles that cannot be derogated from by any state. These norms include prohibitions against genocide, slavery, war crimes, and crimes against humanity, among others. Therefore, option C is correct. Options A, B, and D are incorrect because they either assert that there are no limits or suggest incorrect limitations on the application of Article 103."
