Wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn Scenario 1, telling a hurtful joke at a funeral is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020 because it shows a lack of respect for the grieving process and the feelings of others who are mourning.\n\nIn Scenario 2, wringing a wet salamander could be seen as potentially harmful or stressful to the animal, but without further context, it's not clear if this action was done with malice or ignorance. If the act caused unnecessary harm to the salamander, it could be considered morally wrong, but based on the information given, it's not definitively labeled as wrong as the first scenario. However, common understanding would suggest that handling wildlife in a way that could cause them distress or harm is generally frowned upon, so while it might not be as clear-cut as the first scenario, it could still be considered morally questionable. For the purposes of this question, though, and given the binary choice of 'wrong' or 'not wrong', it's listed as 'not wrong' due to the lack of clarity around the intent and outcome."
