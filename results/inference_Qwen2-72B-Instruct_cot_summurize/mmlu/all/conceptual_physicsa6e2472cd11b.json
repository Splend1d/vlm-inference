                    "text": "The weight of an object on the surface of a planet is determined by the gravitational force between the object and the planet. This force is given by Newton's law of universal gravitation, which states that the force (F) is proportional to the product of the masses (m and M for the object and the planet, respectively) and inversely proportional to the square of the distance (r) between their centers:\n\n\\[ F = G \\frac{mM}{r^2} \\]\n\nwhere \\(G\\) is the gravitational constant.\n\nIf the planet shrinks to one-tenth of its original diameter, then its radius also shrinks to one-tenth its original value. Let's denote the original radius by \\(r_0\\), so the new radius \\(r\\) is \\(\\frac{r_0}{10}\\).\n\nLet's compare the weight of an object before and after the planet shrinks. The original weight \\(W_0\\) of the object is:\n\n\\[ W_0 = G \\frac{mM}{r_0^2} \\]\n\nAfter the planet shrinks, the new weight \\(W\\) of the object is:\n\n\\[ W = G \\frac{mM}{(r_0/10)^2} = G \\frac{mM}{r_0^2/100} = 100 G \\frac{mM}{r_0^2} \\]\n\nThus, the new weight \\(W\\) is 100 times greater than the original weight \\(W_0\\). Therefore, if you were standing on the surface of a shrinking planet that shrinks to one-tenth its original diameter with no change in mass on the shrunken surface, you would weigh:\n\nC. 100 times as much"
