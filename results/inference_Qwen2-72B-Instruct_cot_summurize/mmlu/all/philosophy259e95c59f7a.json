It is a descriptive claim about human behavior rather than a normative one about how people ought to behave.\n\nFeinberg's story about Abraham Lincoln goes like this: during the American Civil War, President Lincoln was asked why he was willing to free the slaves when it would cost him votes in the upcoming election. Lincoln replied, \"If I don't set the slaves free, who will? If I don't do it now, when will it be done?\"\n\nFeinberg argues that this story provides evidence against psychological egoism because Lincoln's actions were not motivated by self-interest but rather by a sense of duty or moral obligation. Therefore, the correct answer to the question is:\n\nB. provides some evidence against psychological egoism."
