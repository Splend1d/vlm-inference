Damage to this area can lead to difficulties in learning and memory, particularly in forming new long-term declarative memories. This condition is often referred to as anterograde amnesia. While the hippocampus does interact with other brain regions that are involved in emotional regulation, motor coordination, and speech production, its primary function is related to learning and memory. Therefore, an individual with brain lesions in the hippocampus will most likely experience impairment to her learning abilities."
