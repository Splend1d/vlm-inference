Depression can lead to negative thinking patterns and a distorted self-perception, causing individuals to underestimate their own abilities and overestimate their failures or shortcomings. This tendency is known as the \"depressive realism\" effect, where people with depression tend to have a more pessimistic view of themselves and their abilities.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that attributions can vary greatly from person to person and depend on many factors, including individual beliefs, past experiences, and the specific circumstances surrounding the event. Other students might attribute a low score to any of the other options provided (B, C, or D), but for someone dealing with chronic depression, option A might be the most common attribution."
