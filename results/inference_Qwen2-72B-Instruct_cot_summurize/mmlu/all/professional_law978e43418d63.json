Both requests are denied by the judge, and the defendant is found guilty. The maximum penalty for shoplifting is a $500 fine and six months in jail. The defendant is sentenced to three months in jail, which he is allowed to serve on weekends in the county detention center. The defendant claims that his constitutional rights have been violated. Is he correct?\n\nA. No, because his actual sentence was only three months.\nB. Yes, because the defendant was denied the right to counsel.\nC. Yes, because the defendant was denied the right to a jury trial.\nD. Yes, because the defendant was denied both the right to counsel and the right to a jury trial.\n"

Yes, because the defendant was denied both the right to counsel and the right to a jury trial.\n\nIn the United States, the Sixth Amendment of the Constitution guarantees the right to legal representation and the right to a speedy and public trial by an impartial jury in criminal prosecutions. These rights apply regardless of the severity of the charge. Therefore, even in cases involving lesser charges like shoplifting, defendants are entitled to these constitutional protections if they cannot afford an attorney and request one, and they also have the right to a jury trial if they request it. The denial of either or both of these rights would constitute a violation of the defendant's constitutional rights."
