                    "text": "The dimension of the vector space P of polynomials with coefficients in Z_5 and degree less than or equal to 7 is 8, since a general polynomial in P has the form:\n\np(x) = a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + ... + a_7 x^7\n\nwhere each a_i is in Z_5. Thus, there are 8 coefficients.\n\nThe operator D sends p(x) to its derivative p'(x). The derivative of a constant term is zero, so any polynomial of the form a_0 (i.e., a constant polynomial) will be sent to the zero polynomial by D. This means that the null space of D consists of all constant polynomials, which is a one-dimensional subspace of P.\n\nFor the range of D, note that the derivative of a polynomial of degree n is a polynomial of degree n-1. So, if we take the derivative of a polynomial of degree 7, we get a polynomial of degree 6. The derivative of a polynomial of degree 6 is a polynomial of degree 5, and so on, until we take the derivative of a polynomial of degree 1, which is a constant polynomial. The derivative of a constant polynomial is the zero polynomial.\n\nTherefore, the range of D consists of all polynomials of degree less than or equal to 6, which is a 7-dimensional subspace of P.\n\nSo, the dimensions of the null space n and range r of D are n = 1 and r = 7.\n\nAnswer: B. n = 1 and r = 7"
