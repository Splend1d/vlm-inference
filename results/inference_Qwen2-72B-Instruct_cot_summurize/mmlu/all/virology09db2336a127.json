However, this choice might not be the most precise answer among the options given, because randomization primarily addresses confounding variables rather than effect modification per se. Randomization ensures that known and unknown confounders are distributed equally between the treatment and control groups, thereby minimizing the potential for systematic differences that could affect the outcome.\n\nThe other options are addressed through different methods:\n\nA. Placebo effect is controlled by using a placebo-controlled design or blinding.\nB. Recall bias is typically addressed by using objective measures or concurrent data collection rather than relying on retrospective self-reporting.\nC. Non-compliance is often managed through various strategies such as patient education, reminders, and monitoring adherence.\n\nIn summary, while randomization can indirectly help with some aspects of these issues by ensuring comparability of groups at baseline, its primary function is to minimize confounding, which can also include some forms of effect modification if they are due to unmeasured or uncontrolled variables."
