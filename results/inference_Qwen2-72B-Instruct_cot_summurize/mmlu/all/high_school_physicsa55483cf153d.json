The equation for Gauss's Law is:\n\n\u03a6 = \u222bE\u22c5dA = Qenc/\u03b5\u2080\n\nwhere \u03a6 is the electric flux, E is the electric field, dA is an infinitesimal area element, Qenc is the charge enclosed within the surface, and \u03b5\u2080 is the permittivity of free space.\n\nIt is important to note that while Gauss's Law holds true under any conditions, it may be more difficult to calculate the electric flux directly using the law when the charge distribution is not symmetric, as this would require solving a more complex integral. However, the principle remains valid in all cases."
