Nathanson is a philosopher who argues against the use of the death penalty and advocates for a more humane system of punishment. He proposes a form of retributivism that includes options A, B, and C: a list of crimes ranked according to their seriousness, a scale of punishments that correspond to the seriousness of certain crimes, and treating criminals humanely. However, he does not support the use of the death penalty as a form of punishment."
