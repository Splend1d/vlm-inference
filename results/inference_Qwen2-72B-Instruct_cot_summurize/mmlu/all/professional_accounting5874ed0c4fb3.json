During its first year of operation, AQR sold the land to an unrelated third party for $160,000. What is the proper tax treatment of the sale?\n\nA. Each partner reports a capital gain of $33,333.\nB. The entire gain of $100,000 must be specifically allocated to Acre.\nC. The first $40,000 of gain is allocated to Acre, and the remaining gain of $60,000 is shared equally by the other two partners.\nD.

According to IRS regulations, when a partnership sells a contributed property, any gain up to the amount of the difference between the fair market value at contribution and the partner's basis in the property (in this case, $40,000) must be allocated to the contributing partner (Acre). Any additional gain beyond that amount is then allocated according to the partnership agreement, which in this case specifies equal sharing among all partners. Therefore, the first $40,000 of gain is allocated to Acre, and the remaining gain of $60,000 is shared equally by all the partners in the partnership."
