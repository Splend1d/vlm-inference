This ensures that the generated voltage remains relatively constant.\n\nOn the other hand, the armature resistance is generally low because the armature winding has to carry a large current, and a high resistance would result in excessive power loss as heat, reducing the efficiency of the machine. A low armature resistance helps to minimize these losses."
