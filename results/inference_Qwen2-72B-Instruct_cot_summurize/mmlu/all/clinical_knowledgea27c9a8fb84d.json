Antidepressants.\n\nMany antidepressants, particularly tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and some selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), can cause dry mouth as a side effect. This is because they can block the action of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter that stimulates the salivary glands to produce saliva. Other classes of drugs, such as antihistamines, diuretics, and antipsychotics, can also cause dry mouth, but among the options given, antidepressants are the most likely to cause this side effect."
