After two nights without sleep, participants may start experiencing hallucinations, which are perceptions that have no basis in reality. This is because sleep deprivation can cause disruptions in the brain's normal functioning, leading to altered perception and cognition. While hunger, thirst, and lack of coordination may also occur as a result of sleep deprivation, they are not specific to the second sleepless night and are less likely to be reported at this stage compared to hallucinations."
