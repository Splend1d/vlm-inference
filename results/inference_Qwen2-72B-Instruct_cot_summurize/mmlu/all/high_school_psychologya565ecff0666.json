This includes gender-specific behaviors, which children learn by observing and imitating others, particularly those who are rewarded for behaving in gender-stereotypical ways. Reinforcement and punishment also play a critical role in shaping gender identity, as children learn what is expected of them based on their observed gender and are reinforced or punished accordingly."
