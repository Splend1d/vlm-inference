This is true as paracetamol can interact with some medications, including warfarin, potentially increasing the risk of bleeding.\n\nB. It should only be given on an 'as required' basis. While this statement may be true for some medications, it's not necessarily always the case for paracetamol. The frequency and duration of use should be based on medical advice or as directed by the product label.\n\nC. Patients should carefully check the contents of over-the-counter cold remedies in order to prevent accidental overdose, as such preparations often contain additional paracetamol. This is correct as many cold and flu medicines contain paracetamol, and taking more than one of these medicines at the same time could lead to an overdose.\n\nD. It is contraindicated in patients with pyrexia. This statement is incorrect. Paracetamol is often used to treat fever (pyrexia).\n\nSo, the most accurate answers are A and C. However, if you must choose just one, C is likely the most universally applicable advice for patients taking paracetamol."
