However, red fox populations are sometimes attacked by a fatal parasite, the mange mite. As mite population sizes increase at a given site, how are hare and fox populations most likely to respond at the same site? (Assume that hares have no major predators at this site other than foxes.)\n\nA. Both fox and hare populations will decrease.\nB. Both fox and hare populations will increase.\nC.

This is because the parasite will cause illness and death among the foxes, leading to a decrease in their numbers. With fewer foxes around to hunt and kill hares, the hare population will likely increase due to reduced predation pressure.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Fox populations will decrease and hare populations will increase."
