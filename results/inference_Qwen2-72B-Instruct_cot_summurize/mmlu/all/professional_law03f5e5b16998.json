Under state law, such an abuse of the prescription-writing privilege requires revocation of a doctor's license. After it received an official notification of the doctor's conviction, the state medical board revoked the doctor's license without affording the doctor any opportunity for a hearing. The doctor has sued the board in state court to set aside the revocation, alleging deprivation of property without due process of law because the board did not provide an opportunity for a trial-type hearing before revoking the license. The doctor does not deny the conviction or the factual basis for it. Which of the following is the strongest argument in support of the state medical board?\n\nA. A doctor's license to practice is a privilege, not a right, and therefore is not property within the meaning of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nB. Due process requires a balancing of interests, and the state's interest in preventing drug abuse outweighs the doctor's interest in the particular procedure followed in the disciplinary proceeding.\nC. The adjudicative facts necessary to revoke the doctor's license were determined in the criminal trial, and therefore due process does not require any further trial-type hearing.\nD. The licensing board was required to summarily revoke the doctor's license because Article IV, Section 1, of the Constitution requires the licensing board to give full faith and credit to the doctor's criminal conviction.\n"

The adjudicative facts necessary to revoke the doctor's license were determined in the criminal trial, and therefore due process does not require any further trial-type hearing.\n\nThis argument acknowledges that the doctor's license is indeed a property interest protected by the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment but asserts that due process was satisfied by the prior criminal trial. Since the doctor was afforded all the procedural protections in the criminal case, including the opportunity for a trial-type hearing, the same facts do not need to be re-litigated in a separate administrative hearing for the purposes of license revocation. This argument is consistent with the principle that due process does not require multiple hearings on the same issue when the issue has already been decided in a prior proceeding where the party had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the matter."
