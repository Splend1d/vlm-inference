Mill's utilitarianism is often interpreted as a form of rule-utilitarianism, where the rightness or wrongness of an action is determined by whether it conforms to rules that generally promote the greatest happiness. These rules are not just any rules but are supposed to be derived from principles that maximize overall well-being when followed. This contrasts with act-utilitarianism, which evaluates the morality of each individual act based on its consequences alone, and Kantian ethics, which emphasizes adherence to universal moral laws regardless of consequences."
