However, the methods used to achieve this goal would need to be considered to determine if they were morally right or wrong. Since no specific actions are mentioned, only the intention is provided, it cannot be determined as morally wrong based on the information given.\n\nIn scenario 2, ripping a page out of a library book is clearly against ordinary moral standards and library rules. Libraries lend books for public use, and damaging or defacing them is considered theft or vandalism, which is morally wrong."
