The appendix has a substantial amount of defensive lymphatic tissue.\n\nThis statement suggests that the appendix may have an active function in the immune system, which would contradict the idea that it is merely a vestigial organ without any current purpose. Lymphatic tissue plays a role in the body's defense mechanisms by producing white blood cells and aiding in the immune response to pathogens. If the appendix contains significant amounts of this tissue, it could indicate that it serves some immunological function, albeit one that might not be essential for survival or overall health."
