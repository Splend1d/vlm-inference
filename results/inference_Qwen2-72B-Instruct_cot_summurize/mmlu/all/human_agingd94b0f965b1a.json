Internal\n\nGary's statement that he won the lottery because he really knows how to pick those numbers suggests that he believes his actions (picking the numbers) directly led to the outcome (winning the lottery). This is indicative of an internal locus of control, where individuals believe they have control over the events in their lives and that their actions determine the outcomes. However, it's important to note that winning the lottery is typically considered a matter of chance, not skill, so Gary's belief may not align with reality."
