We can't directly derive \\(4x + 6y\\) from \\(3x + 7y\\), but we can look for a linear combination of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) that might work.\n\nB. \\(x + y + 5\\)\n\nThis expression doesn't have an immediate obvious relation to \\(3x + 7y\\). However, adding or subtracting constants does not affect divisibility by 11 (since 5 is not a multiple of 11, adding it won't suddenly make something divisible by 11 if it wasn't already).\n\nC. \\(9x + 4y\\)\n\nLet's see if we can relate this to \\(3x + 7y\\). Notice that if we multiply the original equation by 3, we get \\(9x + 21y\\). Subtracting \\(17y\\) (which is not immediately related to the given equation) doesn't help us directly reach \\(9x + 4y\\). However, let's try to manipulate it differently.\n\nD. \\(4x - 9y\\)\n\nLet's focus on relating this to \\(3x + 7y\\). If we multiply the given equation by 4, we get \\(12x + 28y\\). This looks promising because we have \\(12x\\) which is close to \\(4x\\) (in terms of being a multiple of 4) and we want \\(-9y\\).\n\nIf we subtract \\(3 \\times (3x + 7y)\\) from \\(4 \\times (3x + 7y)\\), we get:\n\\[4(3x + 7y) - 3(3x + 7y) = 12x + 28y - 9x - 21y = 3x + 7y\\]\n\nThat's not quite what we're looking for, but let's adjust slightly. If we take \\(4(3x + 7y)\\) and subtract \\(3 \\times (3x + 7y) + 30y\\), we get:\n\\[4(3x + 7y) - (3 \\times (3x + 7y) + 30y) = 12x + 28y - (9x + 21y + 30y) = 12x + 28y - 9x - 51y = 3x - 23y\\]\n\nThat's still not exactly what we want. But if we look closely at our goal, \\(4x - 9y\\), and compare it to what we've manipulated, \\(3x - 23y\\), we realize we need to find a way to get from \\(3x + 7y\\) to \\(4x - 9y\\).\n\nNotice that:\n\\[4(3x + 7y) - 3(3x + 7y) = 3x + 7y\\]\nBut if we subtract \\(31y\\) instead of \\(21y\\):\n\\[4(3x + 7y) - (3 \\times (3x + 7y) + 31y) = 12x + 28y - (9x + 21y + 31y) = 12x + 28y - 9x - 52y = 3x - 24y\\]\n\nAnd then if we add \\(x + 15y\\):\n\\[3x - 24y + x + 15y = 4x - 9y\\]\n\nThus, \\(4x - 9y\\) is indeed a manipulation of \\(3x + 7y\\) that maintains divisibility by 11 if \\(3x + 7y\\) is divisible by 11. Therefore, the correct answer is **D. \\(4x - 9y\\)**."
