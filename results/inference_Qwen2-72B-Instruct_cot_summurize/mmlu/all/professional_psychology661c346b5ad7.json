This condition is characterized by the occurrence of at least one manic episode, which may be followed by hypomanic or major depressive episodes. In contrast, Bipolar II disorder involves at least one major depressive episode and one hypomanic episode, but no full-blown manic episodes. Depression (Major Depressive Disorder) and Dysthymia (Persistent Depressive Disorder) do not involve manic episodes; they are characterized primarily by depressive symptoms."
