True, True\n\nExplanation:\nStatement 1 is true because one of the fundamental assumptions in traditional machine learning is that the training and test data come from the same underlying distribution. This assumption is often referred to as the i.i.d. (independent and identically distributed) assumption.\n\nStatement 2 is also true. In 2017, it was common practice to pretrain models on large datasets like ImageNet before fine-tuning them on smaller, more specific datasets like COCO. Pretraining on ImageNet allowed models to learn general features that could then be adapted to more specific tasks."
