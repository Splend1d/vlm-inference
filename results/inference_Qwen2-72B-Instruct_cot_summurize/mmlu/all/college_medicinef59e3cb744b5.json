                    "text": "The correct answer is C. The pressure in the knee is greater than the pressure in the neck because of the increase in pressure head.\n\nThis is because the heart pumps blood throughout the body, and gravity plays a role in the pressure distribution. Blood in the lower parts of the body, such as the knee, has to work against gravity to return to the heart. This results in higher hydrostatic (pressure head) pressure in the lower extremities compared to areas closer to or above the heart, like the neck. Bernoulli's principle, which relates to the conservation of energy in a flowing fluid, does not directly account for the effects of gravity on pressure in the circulatory system, but it does imply that velocity and pressure are inversely related, which can be affected by gravitational forces in a vertical system like the human body."
