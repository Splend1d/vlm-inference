However, option D, sexual union, can be a part of certain tantric Buddhist practices, but it is not the only or even the most important aspect of the tradition. Other key components include meditation, visualization, and the use of mantras and mudras. Therefore, the closest answer would be D, but it is important to note that sexual union is not the defining characteristic of tantric Buddhism."
