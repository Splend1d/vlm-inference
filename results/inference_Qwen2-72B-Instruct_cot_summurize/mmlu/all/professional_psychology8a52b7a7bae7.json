In vivo exposure and response prevention\n\nExposure and response prevention (ERP) therapy is considered the gold standard for treating Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) and has also shown efficacy in treating Agoraphobia. This form of cognitive-behavioral therapy involves exposing patients to their feared stimuli or anxiety-provoking situations without allowing them to engage in their typical avoidance behaviors or compulsions, thus helping them to learn that their anxiety will naturally decrease over time."
