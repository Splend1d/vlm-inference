In Scenario 2, learning texting lingo to pass as a teen might be deceptive but isn't necessarily harmful or immoral unless it is used for nefarious purposes, which is not specified here. Therefore, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, only Scenario 1 involves doing something clearly morally wrong."
