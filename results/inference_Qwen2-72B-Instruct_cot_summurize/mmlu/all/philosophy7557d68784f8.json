According to Nagel, most skeptical arguments do not fall into categories A, B, or C, as stated in your question. Instead, he suggests that skepticism arises from the tension between subjective experience and objective truth\u2014a tension that emerges when we apply ordinary standards consistently.\n\nThus, the closest answer to Nagel's view would be:\n\nD. grow from the consistent application of ordinary standards.\n\nIn Nagel's perspective, skepticism is not necessarily the product of overly strict criteria (A), linguistic misunderstandings (B), or logical inconsistencies (C). Instead, it stems from the inherent difficulty in reconciling our subjective, first-person experiences with an objective, impersonal view of the world. When we critically examine our beliefs about knowledge and reality using standards we typically apply in everyday life, skepticism can naturally emerge."
