The role of the compiler in the process of developing executable software is to translate a program written in an abstract, high-level language into a program with the same behavior expressed in machine code. This is done by parsing the source code, analyzing it for errors, and generating object code that can be linked together with other object files to create an executable file. The compiler does not manage specification files, run or test executables, or track older versions of the software. These tasks are typically handled by other tools and processes in the software development lifecycle."
