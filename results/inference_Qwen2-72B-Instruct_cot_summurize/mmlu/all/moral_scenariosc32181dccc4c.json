A vegan diet might be suitable for some pets, such as rabbits, if it provides all the necessary nutrients they need to thrive. Ensuring your pet maintains a healthy weight is part of responsible pet ownership.\n\nIn scenario 2, playing an instrument while others sleep may be inconsiderate, but it is not necessarily morally wrong unless it causes significant distress or harm. If the noise is not excessively loud or disruptive, and if you have permission or reasonable belief that the activity will not disturb others, then playing music is generally acceptable. However, it would be courteous to try to minimize disturbance or play at times when others are awake and less likely to be disturbed."
