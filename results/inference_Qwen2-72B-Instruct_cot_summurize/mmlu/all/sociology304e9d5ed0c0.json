While Leroy appreciates these changes, he is worried that his parents will not be able to afford to continue living in their neighborhood because property values are rising.

Gentrification\n\nGentrification is the process by which a neighborhood undergoes revitalization or renovation, often leading to an increase in property values and the displacement of lower-income residents. This phenomenon typically involves the influx of more affluent individuals or families, who may seek out areas with lower housing costs but good potential for development. As these new residents move in, they can drive up demand for housing, which in turn increases property values and often leads to higher property taxes and rental prices. This can make it difficult for long-term, lower-income residents to afford to stay in the area.\n\nIn Leroy's case, the development of new housing and upscale shopping centers suggests that gentrification is occurring in his parents' neighborhood. This could lead to rising property values and potentially force his parents and other long-term residents to move due to increased living costs."
