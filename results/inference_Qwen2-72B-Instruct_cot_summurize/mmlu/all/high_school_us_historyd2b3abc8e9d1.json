I answer: Out of local conditions and the necessities of the case methods of government will grow. If England can govern foreign lands, so can America. If Germany can govern foreign lands, so can America. If they can supervise protectorates, so can America. Why is it more difficult to administer Hawaii than New Mexico or California? Both had a savage and an alien population; both were more remote from the seat of government when they came under our dominion than the Philippines are to-day.\nWill you say by your vote that American ability to govern has decayed; that a century's experience in self-rule has failed of a result? Will you affirm by your vote that you are an infidel to American power and practical sense? Or will you say that ours is the blood of government; ours the heart of dominion; ours the brain and genius of administration? Will you remember that we do but what our fathers did\u2014we but pitch the tents of liberty farther westward, farther southward\u2014we only continue the march of the flag?\n\u2014Albert Beveridge, \"The March of the Flag,\" Indianapolis, September 16, 1898\nThe theme of Beveridge's speech can most directly be compared to which of the following?\n\nA. The Monroe Doctrine\nB. Containment\nC. Manifest Destiny\nD. The ideology of states' rights\n"

Manifest Destiny\n\nThe theme of Beveridge's speech is most directly comparable to Manifest Destiny, which was the belief that the United States was destined to expand across the North American continent. This ideology justified the acquisition of new territories and was used to support the annexation of lands such as Texas, Oregon, and California in the 19th century. Beveridge's argument for the expansion of American power and governance into new territories, including the Philippines and Hawaii, echoes the sentiments of Manifest Destiny. He asserts that America has the ability and right to govern these new possessions, much like earlier proponents of Manifest Destiny believed in the divine right of Americans to expand their territory."
