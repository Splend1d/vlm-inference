The cost function used in logistic regression is convex, meaning there is only one global optimum and no local optima.\n\nStatement 2 is also false. While a Naive Bayes classifier can be effective when the distribution of the data is known, it makes strong independence assumptions about the features which may not hold true in many real-world datasets. There are classifiers that can perform better under certain conditions, such as decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, or neural networks, depending on the specifics of the data distribution and problem at hand."
