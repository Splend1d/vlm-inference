It is composed of at least one central city with a population of at least 50,000 and it surrounds densely urbanized counties.\n\nA Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) is defined by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) as a geographic region with a relatively high population density at its core and close economic ties throughout the area. An MSA must have at least one urbanized area of 50,000 or more people, and the surrounding counties must be economically tied to the core city as measured by commuting patterns. This definition helps to distinguish between rural, suburban, and urban areas for statistical purposes."
