Plasma membrane\n\nThe plasma membrane is considered to be one of the earliest cellular components to have arisen because it provides a boundary between the inside and outside of the cell, allowing for the maintenance of a distinct internal environment. The other components listed (nucleus, mitochondrion, flagellum) are more complex structures that likely evolved later as cells became more sophisticated."
