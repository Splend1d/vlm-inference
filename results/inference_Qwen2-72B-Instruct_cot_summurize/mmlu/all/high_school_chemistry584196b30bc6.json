The temperature of the mixture rose to reach a final temperature of 35 \u00b0C. Which of the following can be concluded?\n\nA. The sample temperature changed more than the water temperature did; therefore the sample lost more heat energy than the water gained.\nB. The sample temperature changed more than the water temperature did, but the sample lost the same amount of heat energy as the water gained.\nC. The sample temperature changed more than the water temperature did; therefore the CP of the sample must be greater than the CP of the water.\nD. The final temperature is less than the average starting temperature of the sample and the water; therefore the total energy of the sample and water decreased.\n"

                    "text": "To determine which statement is correct, we need to analyze the heat transfer between the liquid sample and the water.\n\nFirst, let's consider the conservation of energy principle: the heat lost by the sample equals the heat gained by the water. This can be expressed using the formula:\n\n\\[q_{\\text{lost}} = q_{\\text{gained}}\\]\n\nWhere \\(q\\) represents the heat flow. Heat flow can be calculated using the specific heat capacity (\\(c_p\\)), mass (\\(m\\)), and change in temperature (\\(\\Delta T\\)):\n\n\\[q = m \\cdot c_p \\cdot \\Delta T\\]\n\nFor the liquid sample (let's call it substance X):\n- Mass: \\(m_X = 25 \\, \\text{g}\\)\n- Initial temperature: \\(T_{X,\\text{initial}} = 100^\\circ C\\)\n- Final temperature: \\(T_{X,\\text{final}} = 35^\\circ C\\)\n\nSo, the temperature change for substance X is:\n\\[\\Delta T_X = T_{X,\\text{final}} - T_{X,\\text{initial}} = 35^\\circ C - 100^\\circ C = -65^\\circ C\\]\n\nFor the water:\n- Mass: \\(m_{\\text{water}} = 100 \\, \\text{g}\\)\n- Initial temperature: \\(T_{\\text{water},\\text{initial}} = 22^\\circ C\\)\n- Final temperature: \\(T_{\\text{water},\\text{final}} = 35^\\circ C\\)\n\nSo, the temperature change for water is:\n\\[\\Delta T_{\\text{water}} = T_{\\text{water},\\text{final}} - T_{\\text{water},\\text{initial}} = 35^\\circ C - 22^\\circ C = 13^\\circ C\\]\n\nFrom this information, we can see that the temperature change for substance X is indeed greater than the temperature change for water. However, we know from the conservation of energy principle that the heat lost by substance X must equal the heat gained by the water:\n\n\\[m_X \\cdot c_{p,X} \\cdot \\Delta T_X = m_{\\text{water}} \\cdot c_{p,\\text{water}} \\cdot \\Delta T_{\\text{water}}\\]\n\nGiven that \\(m_X < m_{\\text{water}}\\) and \\(\\left|\\Delta T_X\\right| > \\left|\\Delta T_{\\text{water}}\\right|\\), for the equation to hold true, \\(c_{p,X}\\) must be smaller than \\(c_{p,\\text{water}}\\) (since \\(c_{p,\\text{water}}\\) is known to be relatively high). This means that option C is incorrect because it suggests that the specific heat capacity of the sample is greater than that of water, which would not lead to the observed temperature changes.\n\nThe correct conclusion based on the given information is B: \"The sample temperature changed more than the water temperature did, but the sample lost the same amount of heat energy as the water gained.\" This is because the heat lost by the sample equals the heat gained by the water due to the conservation of energy."
