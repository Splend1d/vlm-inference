Yes, the entireties ownership was severed by the valid deed from mother to her son, and son now owns one-half of the property as tenants in common with the husband.\nB. Yes, the son became a tenant by the entireties with his mother's husband upon his mother's death.\nC. No, the mother's deed was a nullity because the entireties estate can only be broken with the consent of both parties; the husband became the sole fee simple owner on wife's death.\nD. No, a mother cannot convey a real estate interest to a son without getting the approval of all of her children.\n"

No, the mother's deed was a nullity because the entireties estate can only be broken with the consent of both parties; the husband became the sole fee simple owner on wife's death.\n\nUnder the majority view among the states, an entireties estate is a special form of co-ownership between a husband and wife that cannot be unilaterally terminated or severed by one spouse without the consent of the other. The wife's attempt to convey her interest to her son would not have been effective because it required her husband's consent, which she did not obtain. Upon her death, her interest in the property would pass to her husband by right of survivorship, making him the sole owner of the property. Therefore, the stepson cannot prevail by asserting his deed from his mother."
