In this case, dissatisfaction with current jobs is a push factor because it motivates individuals to seek better opportunities elsewhere. The other options listed are examples of pull factors, as they attract people to move to a new place due to positive aspects such as higher-paying jobs, attractive retirement communities, or a pleasant climate."
