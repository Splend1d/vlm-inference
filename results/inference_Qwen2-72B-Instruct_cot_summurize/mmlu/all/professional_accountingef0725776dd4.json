This means that the costs incurred before establishing technological feasibility, such as preliminary project stage costs and the completion of detailed program design, must be expensed as incurred.\n\nIn this case, the costs incurred for coding and testing to establish technological feasibility ($15,000) and other coding and testing costs incurred after establishment of technological feasibility ($44,000) can be capitalized. Therefore, the total amount that should be capitalized in Pipp's December 31, Year 2 balance sheet is:\n\n$15,000 (costs for establishing feasibility) + $44,000 (other coding and testing costs) = $59,000\n\nThe correct answer is D. $59,000."
