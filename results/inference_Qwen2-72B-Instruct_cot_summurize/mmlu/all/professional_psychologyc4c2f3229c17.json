The psychologist: tells the client to call a physician immediately and to come in at 9:00 A.M. on Monday for a session. The psychologist makes no other attempt to intervene, and the client dies later that evening without making any other calls for assistance. In this situation, the psychologist's behavior was clearly\n\nA. unethical, because the client's needs were not addressed more directly\nB. unethical, because the psychologist should have delayed the trip and given the client an appointment for that afternoon\nC. unethical, because the psychologist should have called a physician directly\nD. ethical, because it was not possible to determine whether or not the client was being manipulative\n"

Unethical, because the client's needs were not addressed more directly.\n\nIn this scenario, the psychologist failed to take immediate action to ensure the safety of the client. Upon hearing that the client had taken an overdose as a suicide attempt, the psychologist should have immediately contacted emergency services or a crisis intervention team to ensure the client received medical attention. Leaving the client to handle the situation alone until Monday morning, when they were in immediate danger, is a clear breach of ethical standards in psychology, which require professionals to prioritize client welfare and take steps to prevent harm."
