The time for an external analog-to-digital converter (which is triggered by a CPU instruction) to digitize one input is 12 microseconds, and only one digitization occurs at a time. Five CPU instructions, including the triggering instruction, must be executed for each signal digitized. Ten CPU instructions are executed in order to average each set of four samples and output this value. The time to convert the output from digital to analog form is to be ignored. If it is assumed that suitable data buffering is employed, then the maximum average instruction execution time that allows the microcomputer to keep up with the input-output data rates, is\n\nA. 0.8 microseconds\nB. 1.2 microseconds\nC. 1.6 microseconds\nD. 2.4 microseconds\n"

Therefore, the total time available for executing instructions per cycle is 48 microseconds.\n\nLet \\(T\\) be the average instruction execution time. We can calculate the total time taken by the CPU to execute the 30 instructions as \\(30T\\). Since the CPU must complete these instructions within 48 microseconds, we have:\n\n\\[30T \\leq 48\\]\n\nSolving for \\(T\\), we get:\n\n\\[T \\leq \\frac{48}{30} = \\frac{8}{5} = 1.6\\]\n\nTherefore, the maximum average instruction execution time that allows the microcomputer to keep up with the input-output data rates is **C. 1.6 microseconds**."
