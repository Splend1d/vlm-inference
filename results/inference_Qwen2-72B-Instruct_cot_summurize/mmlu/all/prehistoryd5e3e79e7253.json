The Upper Paleolithic saw the emergence of more sophisticated and specialized tools, such as blades, burins, and points, which required advanced planning, skill, and knowledge to produce. These tools were not only more efficient than earlier stone tools but also allowed for the creation of new technologies, such as sewing needles and fishhooks.\n\nThat being said, it's important to note that the other options also indicate significant cognitive advancements. Parietal and mobiliary art (cave paintings and portable art objects) suggest the development of symbolic thought and expression. The acquisition of non-local raw materials implies the establishment of trade networks and long-distance communication. Changes in settlement patterns may reflect more complex social organization and adaptation to different environments. However, new stone-tool technologies stand out as the most direct evidence of increased cognitive abilities and technological innovation."
