The first study was an experiment with a control group (the group watching 1 hour of television) and a treatment group (the group watching 5 hours of television), while the second was an observational study because it did not manipulate the independent variable (television usage) but instead measured it as it naturally occurred. Therefore, the correct answer is not A, but rather:\n\nE. The first study was an experiment with a control group, while the second was an observational study."
