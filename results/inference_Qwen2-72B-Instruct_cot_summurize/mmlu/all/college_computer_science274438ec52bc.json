With 6 edges, we can form a single connected component using a minimum of 3 nodes (since 2 nodes can have at most 1 edge between them, but 3 nodes can have up to 3 edges forming a triangle). This leaves us with 7 nodes that could potentially be isolated or part of smaller disconnected clusters.\n\nHowever, since we only have 6 edges, we cannot form another cluster with more than 2 nodes (as it would require at least 3 edges), leaving us with 1 edge to connect 2 out of the remaining 7 nodes, and the other 5 nodes will remain isolated. Therefore, the maximum number of connected components we can achieve is:\n\n- 1 connected component of 3 nodes,\n- 1 connected component of 2 nodes,\n- 5 isolated nodes (each forms its own connected component).\n\nThis gives us a total of **M = 7** connected components.\n\n**For m (Minimum Number of Connected Components):**\n\nTo minimize the number of connected components, we want to distribute the 6 edges in such a way that they connect as many nodes as possible into a single connected component. The best way to do this is by creating a path or a tree-like structure. A path with 6 edges can connect 7 nodes (as each edge connects two nodes). However, since we have 10 nodes, we'll still have 3 nodes left over that will not be connected to this path unless we use some edges to connect them. But with only 6 edges, we can't connect all 10 nodes into a single component.\n\nThe optimal distribution for minimizing connected components would be to use the 6 edges to connect 6 nodes into a single component, and then have the remaining 4 nodes be isolated (each forming their own component). This gives us a total of:\n\n- 1 connected component of 6 nodes,\n- 4 isolated nodes (each forms its own connected component).\n\nThus, the minimum number of connected components we can achieve is **m = 4**.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **C. M = 7, m = 4**."
