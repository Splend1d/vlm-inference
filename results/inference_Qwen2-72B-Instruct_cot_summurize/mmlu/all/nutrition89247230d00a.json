However, since you asked for one answer, I will choose A. Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1). Higher levels of IGF-1 have been linked to an increased risk of prostate cancer. It's important to note that while dietary fat can also contribute to prostate cancer risk, the question asked for a single factor, and IGF-1 has a more direct association with prostate cancer development. Alcohol and salt do not have strong links to prostate cancer risk."
