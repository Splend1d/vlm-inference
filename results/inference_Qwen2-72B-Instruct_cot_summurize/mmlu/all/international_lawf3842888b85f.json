However, I will provide answers for each option:\n\nA. Sometimes, all the members of the arbitral tribunal are appointed by the parties. This usually happens when the parties agree to have an odd number of arbitrators (e.g., three) and each party appoints one arbitrator, and then those two arbitrators appoint the third.\n\nB. This is a duplicate of option A, so the same explanation applies.\n\nC. In some cases, all the members of the arbitral tribunal are appointed by an impartial third party, such as the president of the ICJ or another designated appointing authority. This typically occurs when the parties cannot agree on the appointment of arbitrators or if they prefer to have an independent third party make the appointments.\n\nD. All the members of the arbitral tribunal are appointed by the parties from a restricted list of arbitrators. This can happen in certain institutional arbitrations where the parties must choose their arbitrators from a pre-approved list provided by the arbitration institution or organization.\n\nIn summary, the method of appointment depends on the specific arbitration agreement and rules that apply to the case."
