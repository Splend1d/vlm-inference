Interquartile range\n\nThe interquartile range (IQR) is the difference between the third quartile (Q3) and the first quartile (Q1). It represents the middle 50% of the data and is not affected by outliers or extreme values, such as the tallest student's height. Since only the value at the very top of the data set is changing, this will not affect the IQR.\n\nMean absolute deviation, standard deviation, and variance are all influenced by the magnitude of each data point and can be affected by changes in extreme values. Therefore, they may change when the height of the tallest student is corrected."
