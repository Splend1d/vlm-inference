This action is against ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nIn Scenario 2, moving your granny's rocker farther from the TV because her eyesight is failing may not be the nicest thing to do, but it isn't considered morally wrong by ordinary standards. It might just be an inconsiderate act, depending on the context. If the intention was to prevent her from straining her eyes, it could even be seen as a thoughtful gesture, albeit executed poorly. However, without more context, it is difficult to determine if there was any malicious intent behind the action. Assuming no malicious intent, this scenario would not be considered morally wrong."
