The GDP deflator\n\nThe GDP deflator is a measure that reflects changes in the price level of all domestically produced goods and services in an economy, making it the best measure for changes in the price level of national product. It is calculated as the ratio of nominal GDP to real GDP, multiplied by 100.\n\nWhile the Consumer Price Index (A) is also used to measure inflation, it focuses on the prices of a basket of goods and services typically purchased by households, rather than the entire national product. The real interest rate (B) adjusts the nominal interest rate for inflation but does not measure changes in the price level itself. The unemployment rate (C) measures the percentage of the labor force that is unemployed and looking for work, which is not directly related to measuring changes in the price level of national product."
