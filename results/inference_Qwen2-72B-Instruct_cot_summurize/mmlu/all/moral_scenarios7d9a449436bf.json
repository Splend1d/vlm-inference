In Scenario 1, giving onions to a dog is harmful because onions are toxic to dogs and can cause serious health problems, including death. In Scenario 2, hiding a stink bomb in someone's locker is also morally wrong as it causes distress and inconvenience to others, potentially leading to property damage and creating a hostile environment. Both actions violate ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020."
