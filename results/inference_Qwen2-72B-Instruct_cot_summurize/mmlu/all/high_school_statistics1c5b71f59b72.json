The registrar decides to take a random sample of 150 students from the current directory of students and determine the number of students with the correct addresses on record. He then uses this information to construct a 95 percent confidence interval. Which of the following statements must be true?\n\nA. The true proportion of students at this university with the correct address on record is within the confidence interval constructed.\nB. Ninety-five percent of students at this university have the correct address on record.\nC. The true proportion of students at this university with the correct addresses on record is within the confidence interval 95 percent of the time.\nD. The sample proportion of students at this university with the correct address on record is within the confidence interval.\n"

The true proportion of students at this university with the correct addresses on record is within the confidence interval 95 percent of the time.\n\nExplanation: A 95% confidence interval means that if you were to repeat the process of taking a random sample and constructing a confidence interval many times, about 95% of those intervals would contain the true population proportion. It does not guarantee that any single interval will contain the true proportion, only that over many repetitions, 95% of them would. Therefore, statement C is the correct interpretation of a 95% confidence interval. \n\nA is incorrect because we cannot be certain that the true proportion falls within the specific interval constructed; it's only likely (95% chance) based on the sample data.\n\nB is incorrect because it makes a definitive statement about the population proportion based on the confidence level, which is not what a confidence interval represents.\n\nD is incorrect because the sample proportion itself is not within the confidence interval; rather, the confidence interval provides an estimate of where the true population proportion lies based on the sample proportion."
