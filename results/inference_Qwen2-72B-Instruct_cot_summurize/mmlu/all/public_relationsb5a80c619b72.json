The findings generate qualitative data that can be used to develop surveys.\n\nFocus group research is a qualitative method where a group of people are brought together to discuss and provide feedback on a particular topic. This method does not involve random selection of participants (A), and while it can be a structured process, it is not necessarily considered a formal research tool in the same way as quantitative methods might be (B). Focus group results cannot typically be generalized to a larger population due to the non-random sampling and small sample size (C), but they can be very useful in generating qualitative insights and ideas that can inform the development of survey questions or other quantitative research tools (D)."
