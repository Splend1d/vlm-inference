True, True.\n\nExplanation:\n\nStatement 1: True - The margins obtained by different kernels on the same training set provide insight into how well-separated the data is in the feature space defined by each kernel. However, it does not guarantee that one classifier will perform better than the other on unseen data (the test set). Performance on the test set depends on various factors including the generalization ability of the model, overfitting, underfitting, and the nature of the test data itself.\n\nStatement 2: True - BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), a popular model for natural language processing tasks, uses the GELU (Gaussian Error Linear Unit) as its activation function. This function was introduced to improve upon the traditional ReLU function by providing a smoother transition at zero, which can help with gradient flow and stability during training."
