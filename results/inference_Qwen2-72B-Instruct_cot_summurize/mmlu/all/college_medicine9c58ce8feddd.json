Blood lactate concentration typically increases during high-intensity exercise, such as soccer, due to anaerobic metabolism when the oxygen supply to the muscles cannot meet the demand. As the game progresses and players become more fatigued, their reliance on anaerobic energy pathways increases, leading to higher blood lactate levels by the end of the game compared to the end of the first half."
