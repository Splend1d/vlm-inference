The mass number for potassium-40 is 40, which is the sum of the protons and neutrons.\n\nTo find the number of neutrons, we subtract the number of protons from the mass number:\n\\[ \\text{Neutrons} = \\text{Mass Number} - \\text{Protons} = 40 - 19 = 21 \\]\n\nWhen potassium forms the compound K2SO4, it becomes a cation with a +1 charge (K+) by losing an electron. However, the question asks about potassium-40 in K2SO4, not the charge state, so we consider the original number of electrons in a neutral atom of potassium.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. 21 neutrons, 19 protons, 19 electrons"
