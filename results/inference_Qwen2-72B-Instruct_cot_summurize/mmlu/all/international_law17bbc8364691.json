Moreover, according to Article 20 of the same convention, a reservation is also considered invalid if it is incompatible with the object and purpose of the treaty. Therefore, both options C and D are correct.\n\nOption A is incorrect because objections by other states do not automatically invalidate a reservation. The validity of a reservation depends on its compatibility with the treaty's object and purpose and with jus cogens norms.\n\nOption B is also incorrect because the validity of a reservation does not depend solely on the decision of an international tribunal. While an international tribunal may be called upon to rule on the validity of a reservation, its decision is not the only factor that determines whether a reservation is valid or not."
