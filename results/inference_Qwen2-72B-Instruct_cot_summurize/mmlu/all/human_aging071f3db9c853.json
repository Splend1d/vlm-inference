Can be verified while older events often cannot.\n\nThis is because recent events can often be verified through external sources such as photographs, videos, or other people who were present at the time. However, events that happened a long time ago may not have any external evidence to support them, making it difficult to verify their accuracy. This can make it challenging to compare older adults' memory for recent events and events that happened a long time ago, as the accuracy of the memories for older events may be less reliable due to the lack of external verification."
