In Scenario 1, ignoring a friend who is feeling depressed could be seen as neglectful and unsupportive. In Scenario 2, not paying someone for their work is generally viewed as exploitative and unfair. Both actions violate common ethical principles of kindness and fairness. However, it's worth noting that Scenario 2 might need additional context to fully understand the situation\u2014there may be circumstances where payment isn't expected or required, but without such context, not paying for work done is typically considered wrong."
