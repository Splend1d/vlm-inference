Quantity demanded of pears falls.\n\nWhen the price of pears increases, assuming all other factors remain constant (ceteris paribus), consumers will typically buy less of them because they have become more expensive relative to other goods. This is known as the law of demand. As the price goes up, the quantity demanded goes down.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that an increase in price does not necessarily mean that demand itself has fallen. Demand refers to the entire relationship between prices and quantities that buyers are willing and able to purchase at those prices. A change in demand would be represented by a shift of the entire demand curve, which could occur due to changes in factors other than price, such as consumer income, tastes, or the prices of related goods. In this case, option D (Demand for pears falls) would not be correct unless there was information indicating a shift in the demand curve, which is not provided in the question."
