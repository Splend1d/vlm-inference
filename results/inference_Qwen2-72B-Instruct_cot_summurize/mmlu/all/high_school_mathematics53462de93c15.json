In other words, $f(f^{-1}(x)) = x$ and $f^{-1}(f(x)) = x$ for all $x$ in their respective domains.\n\nWe are given that $f(2) = 4$ and $f^{-1}(2) = 4$.\n\nFirst, let's understand what these two pieces of information mean:\n\n1. $f(2) = 4$: This tells us that when we input $2$ into the function $f$, the output is $4$.\n\n2. $f^{-1}(2) = 4$: This tells us that when we input $2$ into the inverse function $f^{-1}$, the output is $4$. Since $f^{-1}$ is the inverse of $f$, this also means that if we input $4$ into $f$, the output will be $2$ (i.e., $f(4) = 2$).\n\nNow, we want to find the value of $f(f(2))$.\n\nFrom our first piece of information, we know that $f(2) = 4$. Therefore, we can substitute $4$ for $f(2)$ in our expression, which gives us $f(f(2)) = f(4)$.\n\nFrom our second piece of information, we know that $f(4) = 2$.\n\nTherefore, $f(f(2)) = f(4) = 2$.\n\nSo the answer is $\\boxed{B. 2}$."
