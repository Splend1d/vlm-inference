(2) In 1996, the mortgage company recorded the mortgage on the ranch. (3) In 2007, in a signed writing, which the borrower delivered to his daughter, the borrower promised to convey the ranch to the daughter by a quitclaim deed and pay the mortgage debt when it came due. (4) In 2008, the borrower delivered to the daughter a quitclaim deed that made no reference to the mortgage. If the borrower thereafter defaulted on the mortgage and the mortgage company brought an in personam action against the daughter to recover the amount due on the mortgage debt, the mortgagee will probably\n\nA. succeed, because the mortgage company is a third-party beneficiary of the agreement between the borrower and the daughter.\nB. succeed, because there was an implied delegation of duties to the daughter.\nC. not succeed, because the daughter did not promise to pay the mortgage debt.\nD. not succeed, because the law does not permit the mortgagor to delegate duties under this type of a property transfer.\n"

The borrower's promise to the daughter was to convey the ranch by quitclaim deed and to pay off the mortgage debt himself when it came due. There is no evidence that the daughter assumed or agreed to assume the mortgage debt. Therefore, the mortgage company would likely not be able to bring a successful in personam action against the daughter to recover the amount due on the mortgage debt.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the mortgage company is not a third-party beneficiary of the agreement between the borrower and the daughter; the agreement pertains to the transfer of the ranch and the payment of the mortgage by the borrower, not the mortgage company.\nOption B is incorrect because there is no evidence of an implied delegation of duties to the daughter; the borrower did not transfer the obligation to pay the mortgage to her.\nOption D is incorrect because it assumes that the mortgagor cannot delegate duties under this type of property transfer, but the issue here is not the delegation of duties but rather the lack of assumption of the mortgage by the daughter."
