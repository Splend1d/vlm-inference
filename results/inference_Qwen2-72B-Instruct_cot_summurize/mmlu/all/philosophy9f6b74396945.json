However, even if every time someone got what they wanted they felt pleasure, this wouldn't necessarily prove that they acted out of self-interest in the first place. For instance, one could argue that the desire to help others or to act altruistically can also bring about feelings of pleasure when fulfilled, but this doesn't mean that the initial motivation was purely self-interested.\n\nFurthermore, the claim that we always feel pleasure when getting what we want is empirically false. There are many instances where individuals may regret achieving something they initially desired, or where the fulfillment of a desire does not result in pleasure but instead leads to guilt, shame, or other negative emotions. Thus, even if feeling pleasure supported psychological egoism (which it does not), the claim itself is not universally true."
