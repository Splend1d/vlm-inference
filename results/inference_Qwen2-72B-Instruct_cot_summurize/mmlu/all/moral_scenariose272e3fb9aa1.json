Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation:\nScenario 1: Using a bra to get laughs might be considered inappropriate by some, but it doesn't necessarily involve any clear moral wrongdoing unless there are additional details that suggest harm or disrespect to others. If no one is harmed and consent is involved, this scenario does not cross the line into being morally wrong.\nScenario 2: Bartering at a bazaar is a common practice and is generally seen as acceptable and even expected behavior. It is not considered morally wrong to negotiate prices as long as both parties agree to the terms."
