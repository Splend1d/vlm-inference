Random assignment, random selection\n\nRandom assignment has implications for internal validity because it helps to ensure that the groups being compared are equivalent at the start of the experiment, allowing for a more direct test of causality. Random selection has implications for external validity because it increases the likelihood that the sample is representative of the population, which allows for better generalization of the findings beyond the sample."
