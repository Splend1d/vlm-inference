These omega-3 fatty acids are crucial components of cell membranes, particularly in the brain and retina, and play important roles in cognitive and visual development.\n\nThe likely benefits include:\n\nA. Visual Performance: DHA is highly concentrated in the retina, and studies have suggested that adequate DHA intake during pregnancy and early infancy can support optimal visual acuity and development.\n\nB. Motor Performance: While evidence is less robust for motor skills specifically, some studies suggest that DHA supplementation may contribute to better motor development in infants.\n\nC. Behaviour Disorders: There is some evidence that suggests EPA and DHA supplementation may help reduce symptoms of certain behavior disorders, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), although the research is not conclusive and more studies are needed.\n\nD. Memory: Omega-3 fatty acids, including EPA and DHA, have been linked to improved memory and cognitive function. Early life supplementation may have long-lasting effects on these aspects of brain function.\n\nIt's important to note that while these supplements can be beneficial, they should ideally be part of a balanced diet and lifestyle. Additionally, pregnant women and infants should only take supplements under the guidance of a healthcare provider to ensure safety and appropriate dosing."
