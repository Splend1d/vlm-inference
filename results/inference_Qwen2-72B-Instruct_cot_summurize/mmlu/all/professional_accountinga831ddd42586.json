A contract was formed on the day Jackson received Sands\u2019 acceptance.\n\nUnder the Sales Article of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), a merchant's firm offer is irrevocable for a reasonable time not exceeding three months, even if the offer does not specify a time period. In this case, Jackson, being a merchant, made a firm offer to Sands without specifying an expiration date. However, he promised not to revoke the offer, which is consistent with the UCC's treatment of firm offers by merchants.\n\nThe revocation that Jackson sent on day 4 was ineffective because it did not reach Sands until after the offer had already been made irrevocable under the UCC. Since the offer was not revoked before Sands accepted it, and since Sands' acceptance was properly communicated to Jackson, a contract was indeed formed when Jackson received the acceptance on day 9."
