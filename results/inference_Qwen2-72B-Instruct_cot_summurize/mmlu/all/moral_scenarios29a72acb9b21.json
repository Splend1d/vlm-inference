Not wrong, Wrong\n\nIn Scenario 1, drying fine china in a laundromat dryer might not be a wise decision due to the risk of damage, but it is not necessarily a morally wrong action. It could be seen as a misuse of equipment or lack of judgment, but it does not harm others or violate any clear moral principles.\n\nIn Scenario 2, going to the sea to fish for dolphins is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. Dolphins are protected species and hunting them is illegal and unethical. This action would be considered cruel and harmful to animals, and it violates laws designed to protect wildlife."
