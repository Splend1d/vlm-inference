This practice helps Sikhs to internalize the teachings of the Guru and to keep their thoughts and actions aligned with the principles of the faith. Therefore, option C is the most accurate answer.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the recitation of the Guru's Vak also serves as a form of communal worship and can provide doctrinal instruction for discussion in the community. Additionally, prayers may be offered on behalf of people outside of the Sikh community during this time as well."
