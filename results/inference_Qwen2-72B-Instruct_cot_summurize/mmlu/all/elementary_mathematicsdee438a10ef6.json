The first expression expands to 3x + 6, which is different from 3x + 2.\n\nB. 4d+ 2e and 8d+e are not equivalent. These expressions have different coefficients for d and e, so they represent different quantities.\n\nC. f+f+f+g and 3fg are not equivalent. The first expression simplifies to 3f + g, which is different from 3fg (which means 3 times f times g).\n\nHence, the only equivalent pair of expressions for any variable value greater than zero is option D."
