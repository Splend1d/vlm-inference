It helps regulate blood sugar levels and plays a key role in metabolism. When insulin binds to its receptors on muscle cells, it triggers a cascade of events that leads to the translocation of glucose transporters (GLUT4) to the cell membrane, allowing glucose to enter the cell. Similarly, insulin also facilitates the uptake of amino acids by increasing the activity of amino acid transporters."
