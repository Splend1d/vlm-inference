The blocks of residences were added haphazardly as needed.\n\nThe urban planning of the Indus Valley cities, such as Mohenjo-Daro and Harappa, was quite advanced for their time. The cities featured a grid layout with streets running north-south and east-west, indicating a high degree of planning. Houses were typically uniform in size and were built with standardized bricks, which contradicts the notion that residences were added haphazardly."
