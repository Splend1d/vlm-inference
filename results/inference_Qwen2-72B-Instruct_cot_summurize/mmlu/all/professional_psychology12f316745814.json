It works by counteracting deviations from a set point or desired state, helping the system return to its normal functioning. This mechanism is common in various systems, including biological, ecological, and social systems like families. Negative feedback does not necessarily have a detrimental impact; instead, it serves a regulatory function that can be beneficial for the overall health and balance of the system."
