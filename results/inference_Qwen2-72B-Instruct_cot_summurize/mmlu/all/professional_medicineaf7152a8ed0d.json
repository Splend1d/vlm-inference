Her son says that she repeats herself frequently and has been forgetting to take her routine medications. She takes hydrochlorothiazide for mild systolic hypertension and levothyroxine for hypothyroidism. She had vulvar cancer 10 years ago treated with wide excision. Her blood pressure is 138/78 mm Hg. Physical examination is within normal limits for her age. Mini-Mental State Examination score is 23/30. Laboratory studies, including serum vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin), thyroxine (T4), and thyroid-stimulating hormone concentrations, are within normal limits. A CT scan of the head shows mild volume loss. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy?\n\nA. \u03b2-Adrenergic agonist\nB. Cholinesterase inhibitor\nC. Dopamine agonist\nD. Prednisone\n"

This class of medication is used in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia, which can present with symptoms such as progressive memory loss, repetition, and forgetfulness. Cholinesterase inhibitors work by increasing the concentration of acetylcholine in the brain, which can help improve or stabilize cognitive function in patients with dementia.\n\nIt's important to note that while I'm providing an answer based on the information given, actual medical decisions should always be made by a qualified healthcare provider who can consider all aspects of the patient's health and medical history."
