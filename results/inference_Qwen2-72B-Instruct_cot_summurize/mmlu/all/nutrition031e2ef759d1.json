Reduced secretion of intrinsic factor - Intrinsic factor is necessary for the absorption of vitamin B12 in the small intestine. With age, the production of intrinsic factor by gastric parietal cells may decrease.\n\nB. Atrophic gastritis - This condition involves inflammation and thinning of the stomach lining, which can lead to reduced production of gastric acid and intrinsic factor, both of which are essential for vitamin B12 absorption.\n\nC. Helicobacter pylori infection - This type of bacterial infection can cause gastritis and reduce the production of gastric acid, which is also needed for vitamin B12 absorption from food."
