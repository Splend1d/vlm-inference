Cooking and eating a baby is an abhorrent act that violates every moral standard.\n\nIn Scenario 2, putting a child in a time-out as a form of discipline is generally considered an appropriate and acceptable method of child-rearing, and is not morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. However, it's important to note that the way this is done should be respectful and not harmful to the child. The term \"naughty\" could imply a judgmental attitude, but the action itself (giving a time-out) is not inherently wrong."
