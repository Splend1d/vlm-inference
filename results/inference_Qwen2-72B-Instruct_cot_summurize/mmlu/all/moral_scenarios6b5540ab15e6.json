In scenario 1, mowing the lawn is a normal activity and does not cause harm to others. In scenario 2, selling one's own property to pay rent is also not morally wrong, although it might be considered rude or inconsiderate not to inform a friend about it if the friend has an emotional attachment to the guitar. However, without additional context, such as whether the friend had any rights or expectations regarding the guitar, this action is not clearly morally wrong."
