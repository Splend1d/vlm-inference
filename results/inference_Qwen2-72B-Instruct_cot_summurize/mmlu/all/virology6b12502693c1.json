Among the given options, the closest to describing this would be:\n\nC. Sequence diversity allows widespread replication\n\nThis option implies that astroviruses have genetic variability that enables them to infect a wide range of hosts and replicate effectively, leading to illness. However, it's important to note that the primary site of infection and pathology for astroviruses is the gut, not the central nervous system or the upper respiratory tract. Astrovirus infections typically manifest as diarrhea, vomiting, and fever."
