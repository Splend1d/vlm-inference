However, assuming that the question is asking which visual cues Abdul can use to judge distance with monocular vision (since he has lost sight in one eye), the most common cues are:\n\nI. Relative size: Objects that are closer appear larger than objects that are farther away.\nII. Texture gradient: The texture of surfaces appears more detailed and pronounced when they are closer.\nIII. Linear perspective: Parallel lines appear to converge as they recede into the distance.\n\nGiven these options, the correct answer would be D. I and II only, since linear perspective (option III) is not a reliable cue for judging distance in real-world driving situations. However, relative size and texture gradient can help drivers estimate the distance of objects ahead of them. It's important to note that people who have lost sight in one eye may also rely on other cues, such as auditory and proprioceptive information, to compensate for their reduced depth perception."
