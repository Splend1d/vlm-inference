                    "text": "A third-year law student was the captain of the law school rugby club. One evening, the student and a few of his rugby teammates were drinking beer at a local pub. They were worried that the rugby club would be forced to disband because the law school had withdrawn its sponsorship. While the student was discussing the problem with his teammates, the owner of the tavern approached the players. The owner indicated that he was interested in sponsoring the rugby club because he felt it would help business at the pub. During their ensuing discussion, the owner agreed to sponsor the rugby club. The parties then orally agreed that the owner \"would pay for all the usual sponsoring fees\" incurred by the club. The owner had understood the agreement to mean that he would pay for the rugby shirts and supply the keg of beer following each \"home\" game that the rugby club played. Conversely, the student thought that the owner would be reimbursing the team for (a) the shirts, (b) the keg of beer (following \"home\" games), as well as (c) transportation expenses for \"away\" games and (d) equipment expenses (balls, etc. ). Assume that it was the customary practice of the rugby teams in the community to have the sponsors pay for (a) the shirts and (b) beer only. Before the rugby club was to play its first game under the owner's sponsorship, which of the following is the most accurate statement regarding the legal relationship between the parties?\n\nA. A contract exists on the terms understood by the owner.\nB. A contract exists on the terms understood by the student.\nC. A contract exists on the terms that are customary for the other teams in the community.\nD. No contract exists.\n"

                    "text": "The most accurate statement regarding the legal relationship between the parties is:\n\nA. A contract exists on the terms understood by the owner.\n\nThis is because the owner clearly communicated his intentions to sponsor the rugby club and what that sponsorship would entail from his perspective (paying for the rugby shirts and supplying the keg of beer following each \"home\" game). The student, as the representative of the rugby club, did not immediately object or clarify the broader understanding of the sponsorship terms during the discussion. Therefore, based on the owner's communication, there is an oral agreement on the terms as understood by the owner. However, this does not preclude further negotiations or modifications to the contract if the student wishes to include additional terms that were part of his understanding.\n\nIt's worth noting that option C could also be considered partially correct given that the customary practices of the community might be used to interpret ambiguous terms in the contract. However, since the owner's understanding was explicitly stated, and there is no indication that the student disputed these terms at the time of agreement, option A is the more directly accurate choice based on the information provided."
