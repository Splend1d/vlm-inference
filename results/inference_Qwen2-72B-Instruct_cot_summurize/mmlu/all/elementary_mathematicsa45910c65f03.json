However, since there's no option with 70,000, we know that the 7 represents 7 * 1,000 = 7,000 because of how the options are structured.\n- The third digit (0) is in the thousands place, but since it's zero, it doesn't add anything to the total.\n- The fourth digit (2) is in the hundreds place, so it represents 2 * 100 = 200.\n- The fifth digit (4) is in the tens place, so it represents 4 * 10 = 40.\n- The last digit (0) is in the ones place, but since it's zero, it doesn't add anything to the total.\n\nAdding these together: 200,000 + 7,000 + 200 + 40 = 270,240."
