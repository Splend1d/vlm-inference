Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation:\nScenario 1: Pole dancing during a puppet show might be considered inappropriate or unusual behavior depending on the context and audience, but it is not necessarily morally wrong unless it involves illegal activities or is performed in front of an unsuitable audience (such as children at a school event). If the puppet show is for an adult audience and the pole dancing is part of the performance, it may not be considered morally wrong.\nScenario 2: Playing catch with your dog and aiming the ball over the dog's head is not morally wrong. It could be seen as playful behavior between an owner and their pet. However, one should ensure that the game does not harm or distress the animal. Assuming no harm is intended or caused, this scenario does not involve any clear moral wrongdoing."
