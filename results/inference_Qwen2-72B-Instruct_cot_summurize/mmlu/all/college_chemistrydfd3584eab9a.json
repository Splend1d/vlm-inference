                    "text": "To calculate the g-factor (g-value) from an Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectrum, we can use the relationship between the resonance magnetic field (\\(B\\)) and the frequency (\\(\\nu\\)) of the microwave radiation:\n\n\\[ \\nu = \\frac{g \\mu_B B}{h} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\(\\nu\\) is the frequency of the microwave radiation,\n- \\(g\\) is the g-factor,\n- \\(\\mu_B\\) is the Bohr magneton,\n- \\(B\\) is the magnetic field strength,\n- \\(h\\) is Planck's constant.\n\nGiven that the frequency (\\(\\nu\\)) is in the X-band (around 9.5 GHz), and knowing that the resonant fields (\\(B\\)) for the four hyperfine lines are at 3074 G, 3174 G, 3274 G, and 3374 G, we can rearrange the equation to solve for \\(g\\):\n\n\\[ g = \\frac{\\nu h}{\\mu_B B} \\]\n\nFirst, convert all units to SI units:\n- \\(\\nu = 9.5 \\times 10^9\\) Hz (since 1 GHz = \\(10^9\\) Hz),\n- \\(B\\) needs to be converted from Gauss (G) to Tesla (T), using the conversion factor \\(1 T = 10^4 G\\).\n\nThus, for the first resonant field position (3074 G or 0.3074 T):\n\\[ g = \\frac{(9.5 \\times 10^9 \\text{ Hz}) \\times (6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ J s})}{(9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ J T}^{-1}) \\times (0.3074 \\text{ T})} \\]\n\n\\[ g = \\frac{(9.5 \\times 6.626 \\times 10^{-24})}{(9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\times 0.3074)} \\]\n\n\\[ g = \\frac{62.947 \\times 10^{-24}}{2.8466 \\times 10^{-24}} \\]\n\n\\[ g = 2.211 \\]\n\nHowever, this calculation uses only one of the resonant field positions. Since the hyperfine splitting is due to the interaction of the electron spin with the nuclear spin, the resonant field positions should give the same g-factor. Therefore, it is expected that calculating \\(g\\) using each of the resonant field positions would yield approximately the same result. \n\nGiven the options provided:\nA. g = 2.002\nB. g = 1.950\nC. g = 2.250\nD. g = 2.005\n\nThe closest match to our calculated value is:\nC. g = 2.250\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the exact numerical answer may vary slightly due to rounding during the calculation process, but the principle remains valid. The calculated value of \\(g = 2.211\\) is closest to option C, which suggests the correct answer is C. g = 2.250, assuming slight rounding errors in the provided options."
