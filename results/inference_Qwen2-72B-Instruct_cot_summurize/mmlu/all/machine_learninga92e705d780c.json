The bias parameter of affine layers becomes redundant if a batch normalization layer follows immediately afterward.\n\nExplanation:\nBatch normalization (BN) normalizes the activations of each mini-batch by subtracting the mini-batch mean and dividing by its standard deviation. This makes the activations have zero mean and unit variance, approximating a standard Gaussian distribution. \n\nThe BN layer also includes learnable scale and shift parameters that are applied after normalization, effectively making the bias parameter in an affine layer redundant because the shift parameter can absorb its role.\n\nOptions C and D are not necessarily true:\n\nC. The standard weight initialization does not need to be changed when using Batch Normalization, although it can help to initialize weights close to zero to prevent the BN from having too much effect initially.\n\nD. Batch Normalization and Layer Normalization are not equivalent, especially in convolutional neural networks. BN normalizes over mini-batch and feature maps, while LN normalizes over features within a single sample, making it more suitable for recurrent or sequential models where batch size might vary."
