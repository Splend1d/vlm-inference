Therefore, the correct answer would be:\n\nB. Higher than all other ethnic groups except African-Americans\n\nHowever, it's important to note that HIV affects different communities in various ways, and there are disparities in access to healthcare, prevention resources, and treatment that contribute to these differences. The CDC also highlights that within the Hispanic/Latino community, there are significant differences in HIV prevalence based on country of origin, socioeconomic status, sexual orientation, gender identity, and age."
