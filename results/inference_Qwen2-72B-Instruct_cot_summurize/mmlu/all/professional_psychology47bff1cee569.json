Ecological assessment.\n\nAn ecological assessment is an evaluation that uses primarily observational methods to examine and understand the physical and psychological variables that impact behavior in a given environment or setting. This type of assessment considers the interaction between individuals and their environments, including the influence of social, cultural, and physical factors on behavior.\n\nA functional behavioral assessment (FBA) is a systematic process for identifying the reasons behind specific problem behaviors and developing interventions to address them.\n\nA work sample is a type of assessment that involves observing an individual's performance on tasks that are similar to those they would encounter in their job or daily life.\n\nA norm-referenced test compares an individual's performance to a standardized group or normative sample. These tests are often used to determine how an individual's abilities or skills compare to others in the same age or grade level."
