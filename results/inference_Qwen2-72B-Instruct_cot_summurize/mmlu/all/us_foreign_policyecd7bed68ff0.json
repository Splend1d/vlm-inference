It refers to the practice of two countries or entities engaging in direct communication and negotiation without the involvement of intermediaries or outside facilitators. This can take place through various means, including face-to-face meetings between state leaders (as mentioned in option B), but the key aspect is the absence of a third party in the negotiations. Direct diplomacy can be an effective way for countries to resolve conflicts or reach agreements directly with one another."
