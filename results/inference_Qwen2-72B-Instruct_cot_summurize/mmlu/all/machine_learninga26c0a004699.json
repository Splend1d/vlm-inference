It uses a greedy approach and may get stuck in local optima, leading to suboptimal trees.\n\nStatement 2: In a continuous probability distribution with density function f(), the value of f(x) at any point x does not represent the probability of x. Instead, it represents the density at that point. The actual probability of a specific value x in a continuous distribution is considered to be zero since there are infinitely many possible values. The probability is calculated over intervals, not single points."
