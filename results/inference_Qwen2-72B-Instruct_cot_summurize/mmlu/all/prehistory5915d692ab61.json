When anatomically modern humans (Homo sapiens) first arrived in the Middle East around 50,000 to 60,000 years ago, they encountered Neandertals (Homo neanderthalensis), who were not their evolutionary descendants but rather a separate species that had diverged from the lineage leading to Homo sapiens several hundred thousand years earlier. There is evidence of interbreeding between Neandertals and Homo sapiens, which suggests some level of contact and interaction between the two groups.\n\nOption B is incorrect because Homo erectus was already extinct or nearly so by the time anatomically modern humans arrived in the Middle East. Option C is also incorrect because it is anatomically modern humans (Homo sapiens) themselves who are arriving in the region, not encountering an independent evolution of Homo sapiens in Asia. Option D is therefore also incorrect since only Neandertals were present at the time of arrival of Homo sapiens in the Middle East."
