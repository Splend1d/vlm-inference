According to research by the OECD, women spend more hours per day working (including paid and unpaid work) than men in all regions except Anglo America and Australia. This is known as the \"second shift\" phenomenon, where women often take on a larger share of household and care responsibilities in addition to their paid work. \n\nStatements A, B, and C are not true. While some women do work in agriculture, it is not the case that most women work in this sector. In fact, the majority of women workers are employed in services and industry. The percentage of women economically active in the labor force has actually increased worldwide over the past few decades, although there are still significant gender gaps in labor force participation rates in many countries. Similarly, the percentage of women in the total labor force has also increased in many parts of the world."
