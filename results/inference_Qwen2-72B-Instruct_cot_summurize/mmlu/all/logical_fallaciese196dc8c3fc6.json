The minor premise must either accept an alternative or reject an alternative\n\nIn a valid disjunctive syllogism, one premise presents a set of alternatives (disjunction), and the other premise denies one of those alternatives, allowing for the conclusion that the remaining alternative must be true. For example:\n\nPremise 1: Either it is raining, or it is not raining.\nPremise 2: It is not raining.\nConclusion: Therefore, it is not raining.\n\nHowever, premise 1 is a tautology in this case.
