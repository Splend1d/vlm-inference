With that information in mind, what message can Kipling be said to be offering the Americans in this excerpt?\n\nA. A reminder of the responsibility of advanced civilizations to bring the benefits of modern civilization to less-developed peoples\nB. A warning to avoid the war and hardships of imperialism\nC. An exhortation to Christianize the heathen peoples of the world\nD. An ironic presentation of the sheer folly of imperialism\n"

Thus, the most fitting interpretation of his message in this context would be:\n\nA. A reminder of the responsibility of advanced civilizations to bring the benefits of modern civilization to less-developed peoples\n\nWhile some elements of warning and irony can be detected in the poem, the primary thrust is to encourage the imperial power to embrace its perceived duty to uplift and govern the \"new-caught, sullen peoples,\" despite the challenges involved."
