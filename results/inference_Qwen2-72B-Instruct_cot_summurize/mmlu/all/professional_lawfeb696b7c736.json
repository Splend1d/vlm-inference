A group of adjoining landowners who owned single-family residences sued for an injunction, alleging various environmental violations. The developer did not have a significant investment at that point, and decided to stop the construction.Shortly thereafter, the city passed a comprehensive new citywide zoning law that re-zoned the subject property and some large tracts of adjoining land to low-density residential, allowing one residence for each 4.6 acres. This destroyed the multi-unit plan and the city cancelled the permit, which the developer did not appeal.The developer's land value decreased from $2 million to $100,000.The developer sued the city in federal court on the basis that this was illegal spot zoning constituting a taking in violation of due process.Will the developer prevail with his federal constitutional claim?\n\nA. Yes, the state cannot cause such a dramatic diminution in an owner's property without paying just compensation.\nB. Yes, because he got a building permit and justifiably relied on that approval \u0080\u0093 the rezoning was an illegal act once it granted a building permit.\nC. Yes, because the developer's loss was caused by discriminatory spot zoning that took its property without due process.\nD. No, this was a comprehensive new zoning plan that rezoned the entire city; the developer shared the loss with the adjoining owners who were also rezoned.\n"

However, based on the information provided, option D seems to be the most likely correct answer.\n\nThe fact that the city passed a comprehensive new zoning law that affected multiple properties suggests that this was not a case of illegal spot zoning, which typically involves singling out a particular piece of property for unfavorable treatment. Additionally, the fact that the developer did not appeal the cancellation of the building permit could potentially weaken their argument that they had a legitimate expectation of being able to proceed with the construction project.\n\nFurthermore, while the developer may have suffered a significant loss as a result of the rezoning, the government has the power to regulate land use through zoning laws in order to promote the public welfare. In order to succeed in a takings claim under the Fifth Amendment, the developer would need to show that the rezoning went beyond what was necessary to achieve a legitimate public purpose and resulted in a complete deprivation of all economically viable uses of the property. It is unclear from the information provided whether the developer could meet this high standard.\n\nTherefore, the most likely answer is D: No, this was a comprehensive new zoning plan that rezoned the entire city; the developer shared the loss with the adjoining owners who were also rezoned. However, it is important to note that this is a complex area of law and a definitive answer would require a more thorough analysis of the facts and legal precedent."
