Social facts\n\n\u00c9mile Durkheim, a pioneering French sociologist, argued that the primary focus of sociology should be on \"social facts.\" According to Durkheim, social facts are the ways of acting, thinking, and feeling that exist outside any one individual but exert an influence on all individuals in a society. These include institutions, cultural norms, laws, and collective beliefs. Durkheim emphasized that social facts have a reality and existence independent of the individual and must be studied objectively as things, much like phenomena in the natural sciences."
