While the Aztec Empire did collect tribute from its subjects, it was not necessarily half of all maize grown, and the commoners were allowed to keep enough to sustain themselves and their families. Additionally, the Aztec government provided some services such as education and healthcare to its citizens. There is also no evidence to suggest that these particular villages had no protection from invading city-states."
