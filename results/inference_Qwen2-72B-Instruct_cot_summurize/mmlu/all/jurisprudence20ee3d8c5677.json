Women look to context, whereas men appeal to neutral, abstract notions of justice.\n\nDifference feminism argues that there are inherent differences between men and women which should be recognized and valued rather than ignored or seen as inferior. The quotation C suggests that women tend to approach issues with a contextual and relational perspective, while men often rely on abstract principles of justice, which is a key idea in difference feminism."
