Fission nuclear weapons are gun-type devices that require a relatively small amount of fissile uranium-235 material to produce a comparatively large explosion because mass and energy becomes interchangeable in the barrel. Implosion devices however are unable to sustain the reaction; the neutron generator is unable to set off the interchange being destroyed in the explosion.\nB. Implosion fissure devices are constructed with relative ease because unlike the gun-type fissure device it uses high-explosive shaped lenses to compress the fissile material to critical tolerance. Detonation is highly volatile with a high potential of \"going critical\".\nC. Fissile weapons are produced by the rapid rearrangement of hydrogen, oxygen, carbon and nitrogen in a chamber, striking each other at high velocities the friction sparking a chemical explosion.\nD. Gun-type devices are of rugged design using two sub-critical masses fired down a barrel at very high velocities with a high probability of producing a reaction. Implosion devices are more complex, requiring the assembling of shaped charges to compress the fissile material to critical tolerances, and are detonated with more than split-second timing.\n"

Implosion devices are more complex, requiring the assembling of shaped charges to compress the fissile material to critical tolerances, and are detonated with more than split-second timing.\n\nFission nuclear weapons work on the principle of nuclear fission, where the nucleus of an atom splits into two smaller nuclei, releasing a large amount of energy. This can be achieved through either a gun-type mechanism or implosion mechanism. In a gun-type device, two sub-critical masses of fissile material (such as uranium-235) are brought together at high speeds to form a supercritical mass, triggering a chain reaction. In an implosion device, high explosives are used to compress a single sub-critical mass of fissile material to achieve criticality and initiate the chain reaction. The timing of the implosion must be precise to ensure maximum compression and efficiency of the reaction."
