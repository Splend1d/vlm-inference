Plants have both chloroplasts and mitochondria; animals and fungi have only mitochondria.\n\nMitochondria are found in almost all eukaryotic cells, including plants, animals, and fungi. They are responsible for energy production through cellular respiration. Chloroplasts, on the other hand, are found only in plant cells and some algae. They are responsible for photosynthesis, the process by which light energy is converted into chemical energy."
