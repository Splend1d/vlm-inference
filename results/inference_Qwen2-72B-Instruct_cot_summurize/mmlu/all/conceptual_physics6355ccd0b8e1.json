When an object moves at speeds close to the speed of light relative to a stationary observer, time appears to pass slower for the moving object as observed by the stationary observer. So, clocks on a fast-moving spaceship would appear to run slow when viewed from Earth. However, it's important to note that this effect is reciprocal: if there were an observer on the spaceship looking back at Earth, they would see Earth's clocks running slow relative to them. But since the question asks specifically about how the clocks on the spaceship appear to someone on Earth, the correct answer is B. Earth."
