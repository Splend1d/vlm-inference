His views, particularly on utilitarianism and the ethics of animal rights, are more closely aligned with philosophers who emphasize consequentialism or the idea that the morality of an action is determined by its outcome. Given these specifics, none of the philosophers listed (Plato, Aristotle, Thomas Aquinas, Immanuel Kant) directly aligns with Singer's philosophy. However, if we have to choose, the closest might be D. Immanuel Kant, not because their conclusions are similar, but because both have had significant impacts on modern ethical thought, albeit from very different perspectives. Singer's utilitarian approach contrasts with Kant's deontological ethics, which focuses on duty and intention rather than consequences.\n\nIf this question is from a specific context or text where Peter Singer himself made such a claim, it would be helpful to know that detail for a more accurate answer. Without additional context, it's challenging to determine precisely which philosopher(s) Singer might have been comparing himself to."
