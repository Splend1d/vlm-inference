At the age of 7 months, he was treated for osteomyelitis caused by Aspergillus fumigatus. He has been admitted to the hospital three times during the past 4 years for severe pneumonia. He appears moderately ill. His temperature is 39\u00b0C (102.2\u00b0F). Abdominal examination shows an enlarged, tender liver. Ultrasonography of the abdomen shows an intrahepatic abscess. Culture of the abscess fluid grows Staphylococcus aureus. Further analysis shows failure of the neutrophils to undergo an oxidative burst when exposed to S. aureus. This patient has an increased susceptibility to infection as a result of which of the following abnormalities?\n\nA. Failure of leukocytes to migrate between endothelial cells\nB. Failure of leukocytes to roll along the endothelial surface\nC. Inability of leukocytes to ingest microorganisms\nD. Inability of leukocytes to kill intracellular microorganisms\n"

Inability of leukocytes to kill intracellular microorganisms.\nThe patient's history of recurrent infections with both fungal and bacterial pathogens, including an inability of his neutrophils to undergo an oxidative burst in response to S. aureus, suggests a defect in the ability of his leukocytes to effectively kill ingested microorganisms. This could be due to a variety of inherited or acquired disorders that affect the function of phagocytes, such as chronic granulomatous disease or myeloperoxidase deficiency. The other options listed do not explain the patient's clinical presentation and laboratory findings."
