The detectives then submitted an affidavit to a neutral magistrate setting forth sufficient underlying circumstances for the issuance of a search warrant. Making a determination of probable cause, the magistrate issued a warrant for the x-brand stereo at the homeowner's address. The police arrived at the homeowner's dwelling, showed him the warrant, and came inside. In the living room, they noticed a y-brand stereo, which had the serial number removed. Upon further inspection, the police determined that the stereo had been stolen from a local electronics store during a recent burglary. Thereupon, the police placed the homeowner under arrest and instructed him to remain seated in the living room while they searched the rest of the home. One of the officers proceeded to the basement where she found the stolen x-brand stereo. She then decided to search the upstairs and came upon a stolen z-brand stereo in the homeowner's second-floor bedroom. The homeowner was subsequently prosecuted for receiving stolen property. At trial, the homeowner moves to prevent introduction of the stereos into evidence. His motion should be granted with respect to\n\nA. the y-brand stereo.\nB. the z-brand stereo.\nC. the y-brand and the z-brand stereos.\nD. none of the stereos.\n"

However, the discovery and subsequent seizure of the z-brand stereo may have exceeded the scope of the original warrant. The warrant only authorized the search for the x-brand stereo, and the search for additional items not listed on the warrant would generally require either additional warrants or an exception to the warrant requirement, such as plain view doctrine or exigent circumstances.\n\nIn this case, the y-brand stereo was in plain view and its illegal nature was immediately apparent (the serial number was removed), so it could be seized without a separate warrant. However, the officer did not have a warrant to search the upstairs for anything other than the x-brand stereo. Since the z-brand stereo was found in a location not covered by the original warrant and there is no indication of exigent circumstances or other exceptions that would justify the search of the second-floor bedroom, the evidence obtained from that search (the z-brand stereo) may be suppressed as the result of an unlawful search."
