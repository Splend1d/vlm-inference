These costs suggest that those who are willing or forced to leave a state often have substantial interests in living in another state (A). Preventing potential immigrants from settling in a different state can be detrimental to their well-being because it may prevent them from accessing better economic opportunities, education, healthcare, and other resources (B). Closing borders can also have significant costs to potential immigrants, including the denial of basic human rights and the exacerbation of poverty and inequality (C). Therefore, all of the above statements are likely conclusions that can be drawn from the fact that emigration is often associated with significant costs."
