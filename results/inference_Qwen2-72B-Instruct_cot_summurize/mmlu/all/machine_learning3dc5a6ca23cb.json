False, False\n\nExplanation:\nStatement 1 is false because support vector machines (SVMs) do not inherently provide a probability distribution over the possible labels. SVMs output a decision value that can be converted into probabilities using a calibration technique such as Platt scaling, but by default, they do not provide probabilistic outputs like logistic regression does.\n\nStatement 2 is also false because the support vectors may change when moving from a linear kernel to higher order polynomial kernels. The choice of kernel function can significantly alter the decision boundary learned by the SVM, and thus the set of support vectors, which are the data points closest to the decision boundary, can change accordingly."
