This process includes independent assortment during meiosis and random fertilization, both of which contribute to genetic diversity. While new mutations, genetic drift, and geographic variation also play roles in genetic diversity, the primary source of variation between most individuals is the reshuffling of existing alleles during sexual reproduction."
