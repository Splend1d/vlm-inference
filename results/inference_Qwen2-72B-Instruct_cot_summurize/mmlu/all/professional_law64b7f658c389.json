Such a sale is without reserve unless the goods are explicitly put up with reserve.\n- This statement is generally true. An auction without reserve means that the items being sold must be sold to the highest bidder regardless of the price. There is no minimum price set by the seller. However, if the goods are explicitly put up with reserve, the seller reserves the right not to sell if the bids do not meet a predetermined minimum.\n\nB. A bidder may retract his bid at any time until the falling of the hammer.\n- This statement is not universally true. The ability to retract a bid depends on the specific rules of the auction and jurisdiction. Typically, once a bid is made, it cannot be retracted once another bid has been placed after it. The finality of a bid is usually determined by the fall of the hammer.\n\nC. The retraction of a bid by a bidder revives the previous bid.\n- This statement is not typically accurate. When a bid is retracted, it is usually considered void, and the bidding process continues with the next highest bid. Retracting a bid does not automatically revive the previous bid; instead, the auctioneer would call for new bids.\n\nD. If the auction is without reserve, the auctioneer can withdraw the article at any time prior to the fall of the hammer.\n- This statement is incorrect. In an auction without reserve, the auctioneer cannot withdraw an item once the auction begins unless there are specific terms agreed upon beforehand that allow for such withdrawal. Once an item is up for bid in a without reserve auction, it must be sold to the highest bidder.\n\nIn summary, option A best represents the general rule applicable to auctions regarding whether they are conducted with or without reserve. However, it's important to note that specific auction rules and local laws should always be consulted, as these can vary significantly."
