This income tax exempts taxable income earned by city residents outside of the state. Moreover, residents of the city were not taxed on their in-city earned income. A commuter who works in the city but is a resident of a neighboring state, challenges the constitutionality of this statute. Which of the following provisions would furnish the most applicable basis for this constitutional challenge?\n\nA. The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nB. The Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause.\nC. The privileges and immunities clause of ArticleIV.\nD. The commerce clause.\n"

The privileges and immunities clause of Article IV.\n\nThis clause states that \"The Citizens of each State shall be entitled to all Privileges and Immunities of Citizens in the several States.\" This provision is designed to prevent a state from treating citizens of other states in a discriminatory manner. In the given scenario, the city is taxing nonresidents' city-derived income while exempting its own residents' income earned outside the state or within the city. This could be seen as discriminatory against nonresidents, potentially violating the privileges and immunities clause by imposing a greater burden on citizens of another state than on its own citizens."
