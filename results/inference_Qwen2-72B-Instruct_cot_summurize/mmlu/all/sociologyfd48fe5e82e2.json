This concept is often associated with the work of sociologist Edwin Lemert, who distinguished between primary and secondary deviation. Primary deviation is the initial act of rule-breaking, while secondary deviation occurs when an individual internalizes a deviant identity due to societal reactions and begins to behave consistently with that identity."
