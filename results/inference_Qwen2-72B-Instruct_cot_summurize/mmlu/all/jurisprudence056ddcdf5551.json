Grotius was a Dutch philosopher, theologian, and jurist who made significant contributions to the development of international law and natural law theory. His work, \"De Jure Belli ac Pacis\" (\"On the Law of War and Peace\"), published in 1625, is considered one of the foundational texts of international law. In this work, Grotius argued that there is a natural law that applies to all people regardless of their social or political context, and that this law is derived from human nature and the inherent social tendencies of human beings."
