US (Unconditioned Stimulus)\n\nIn Pavlov's experiment, the small bit of meat powder in the dog's mouth is the unconditioned stimulus (US) that naturally and automatically triggers the unconditioned response (UR), which is salivation. The conditioned stimulus (CS) is something that initially does not trigger the response but through repeated pairing with the unconditioned stimulus becomes able to trigger the conditioned response (CR). In this case, the sound of a bell ringing before presenting the food eventually became the CS, triggering the CR of salivation when the dogs heard the bell, even without the presence of food."
