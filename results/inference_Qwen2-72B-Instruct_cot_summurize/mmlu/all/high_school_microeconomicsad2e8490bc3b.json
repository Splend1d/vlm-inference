This means that they can sell any quantity at the market price without affecting it. Therefore, the marginal revenue (MR), which is the additional revenue from selling one more unit, equals the price (P). The demand curve is horizontal, reflecting the fact that the firm's output decision does not affect the market price.\nII. Under monopoly or imperfect competition, firms face a downward-sloping demand curve. This implies that to sell additional units, they must lower their price. As a result, the marginal revenue (MR) is less than the price (P) because the firm has to reduce the price for all units sold, not just the additional unit. The difference between P and MR increases as the degree of market power increases.\nIII. This statement is incorrect. For imperfect competition, demand and price are not represented by a vertical function. Instead, they are represented by a downward-sloping demand curve, as mentioned in point II. A vertical demand curve would imply that the quantity demanded is completely unresponsive to changes in price, which is not the case for imperfect competition."
