The genius of Napoleon is astounding. All branches of human knowledge seemed alike familiar to his gigantic mind. His conversations at St. Helena, scattered through the numerous and voluminous memorials of those who gleaned them, are replete with intensest interest. During the long agony of his imprisonment and his death, he conversed with perfect freedom upon the events of his marvelous career, and upon all those subjects or morals, politics, and religion, which most deeply concern the welfare of our race. There is no mind which will not be invigorated by familiarity with these profound thoughts, expressed with so much glow of feeling and energy of diction.\n\u2014John S. C. Abbott, historian, Napoleon at St. Helena, 1855\nNapoleon helped make the French Revolution an international movement in the areas he conquered\n\nA. By imposing a universal currency based on the French franc\nB. By the brutal suppression of guerrilla resistance\nC. By abolishing feudalism and manorialism\nD. By encouraging the use of French as the universal language\n"

Napoleon's reforms in the territories he conquered included the abolition of feudal privileges, which had been a major source of social and economic inequality in Europe. This helped spread the ideals of the French Revolution and made it an international movement."
