Here's how each option fares:\n\nA. Speak a little slower than normal - This is a good strategy because it allows the person more time to process what you're saying.\n\nB. Speak loudly into their best ear - Speaking loudly can help, but it's crucial not to shout as this can distort speech sounds and make understanding harder. Identifying and speaking into their best ear is a good practice.\n\nC. Face them so they can watch your lips - This is very effective. Lip-reading can significantly aid in understanding, especially when combined with hearing.\n\nD. Ask another person to translate - This might be necessary if the communication barrier is too great, but it's generally better to try direct communication first using the other strategies.\n\nSo, the best answer would be a combination of A, B (without shouting), and C. However, since only one answer can be selected, I'd recommend **C. Face them so they can watch your lips** as the most universally beneficial strategy, though combining this with speaking slowly and clearly into their best ear would be ideal."
