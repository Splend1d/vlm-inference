Firstly, the answer is that the operation of the imperialist system bears major responsibility for African economic retardation by draining African wealth and by making it impossible to develop more rapidly the resources of the continent. Secondly, one has to deal with those who manipulate the system and those who are either agents or unwitting accomplices of the said system. The capitalists of Western Europe were the ones who actively extended their exploitation from inside Europe to cover the whole of Africa.\"\nWalter Rodney, historian, How Europe Underdeveloped Africa, 1974\nRodney's argument in the passage is most likely a response to which of the following developments of the period 1450 to 1750 C.E.?\n\nA. The colonization of the interior of Africa by European powers\nB. The expansion of the African diaspora to the New World\nC. The spread of Christianity into Sub-Saharan Africa\nD. The importation of New World products into Africa\n"

This period (1450-1750 C.E.) saw the height of the transatlantic slave trade, during which millions of Africans were forcibly taken to the Americas to work on plantations and in mines. This trade was driven by European demand for labor and had a devastating impact on African societies, leading to the loss of population, disruption of social structures, and economic underdevelopment. Rodney argues that this exploitation by European capitalists played a significant role in retarding the economic development of Africa."
