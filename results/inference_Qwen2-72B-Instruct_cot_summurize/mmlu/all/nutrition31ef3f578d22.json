It is defined as a birth weight below the 10th percentile for the specific gestational age, which means the baby weighs less than 90% of other babies at the same gestational age. This definition does not necessarily correlate with being born at a low birthweight (LBW), very low birthweight (VLBW), or being born pre-term, although it can be associated with these conditions."
