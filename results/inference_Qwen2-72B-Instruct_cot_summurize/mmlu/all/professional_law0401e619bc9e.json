Unable to stop, the woman hit the man's car into a median.

Didn't you ever learn that you're supposed to use a turn signal when you switch lanes?\" The pedestrian is never identified and is not present at trial.

One such exception is the \"excited utterance\" exception, which allows for the admission of statements made while the declarant was under the stress of excitement caused by an event or condition. \n\nIn this case, the pedestrian's statement could potentially fall under the excited utterance exception since it was made immediately after witnessing the accident and while the pedestrian was visibly upset. However, the fact that the pedestrian is not identified and is not present at trial does not necessarily make the statement inadmissible under this exception.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer would be:\n\nC. admissible under the excited utterance exception."
