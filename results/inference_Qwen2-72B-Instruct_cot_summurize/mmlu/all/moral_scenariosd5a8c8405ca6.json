Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn Scenario 1, spreading fertilizer on your neighbor's vegetable garden might not be considered morally wrong if you have permission or if it is part of an agreement or arrangement you have with your neighbor. Without additional context suggesting otherwise, this action could potentially be seen as helpful, depending on the relationship and agreements between you and your neighbor.\n\nIn Scenario 2, getting leftovers because you could not finish your supper is not morally wrong. It is a common practice to save uneaten food for later consumption, which can help reduce food waste.\n\nHowever, if Scenario 1 involved spreading fertilizer without permission or against the neighbor's wishes, then it would be considered morally wrong due to the violation of property rights and potential harm to the neighbor's property. But based on the information given, neither scenario clearly indicates a morally wrong action."
