At trial, to prove that the substance added to the resident's food could result in death, the prosecutor, without first calling any witnesses, offers to read into evidence several pages from a standard medical treatise that support the prosecution's claim that the substance the defendant added to the food is lethal. Is the evidence offered admissible?\n\nA. No, because the treatise excerpts were not offered during the examination of a qualified expert.\nB. No, because the treatise itself must be introduced as an exhibit.\nC. Yes, although hearsay, under the learned treatise exception to the hearsay rule.\nD. Yes, because the lethal nature of the substance is relevant to the defendant's state of mind and intent.\n"

Yes, although hearsay, under the learned treatise exception to the hearsay rule.\n\nUnder the Federal Rules of Evidence (FRE) 803(18), a statement contained in a learned treatise, periodical, pamphlet, or other published work on a subject that is not generally known and that is established as a reliable authority by the expert witness, another expert witness, or judicial notice can be admitted as an exception to the hearsay rule. The FRE allows for the admission of such treatises if they are relevant to the issues at hand and if they are recognized as authoritative in the field. In this case, the prosecutor seeks to use a standard medical treatise to establish the lethal nature of the substance in question. If the treatise is recognized as a reliable authority in the medical field, it may be admissible under the learned treatise exception. However, it should be noted that while the treatise can be read into evidence, it is typically necessary for an expert witness to authenticate the treatise and lay a foundation for its reliability before it can be admitted."
