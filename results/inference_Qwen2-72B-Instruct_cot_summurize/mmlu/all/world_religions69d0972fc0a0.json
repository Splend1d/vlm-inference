Second century CE\n\nThis is the time when we start to see more solid evidence of Jaina architecture and temple building, although it's important to note that Jainism itself dates back further, with some scholars placing its origins as early as the 7th or 8th century BCE. However, the physical structures we recognize as Jaina temples began to emerge around the time period given in option A."
