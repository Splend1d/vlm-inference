In scenario 1, assuming the spiders were not harmed and that the apartment was either owned or rented by the individuals involved, there is no clear moral wrongdoing. It could be seen as a prank or part of a decoration plan, but without additional context indicating harm or lack of consent, it is not inherently wrong. In scenario 2, heating rolled oats in a microwave is a normal action, often done for cooking purposes, and does not involve any moral transgressions."
