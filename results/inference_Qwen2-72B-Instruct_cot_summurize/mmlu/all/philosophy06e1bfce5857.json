However, this specific option is not listed in your choices. Among the options you've given, none directly align with Anscombe's view, but if I must choose, I would say:\n\nC. psychology.\n\nThis is because understanding human actions and motivations, which are central to moral philosophy, requires some understanding of the human mind and behavior, which falls under the domain of psychology. However, Anscombe's actual view goes beyond just psychology and encompasses a broader theory of practical reasoning and action."
