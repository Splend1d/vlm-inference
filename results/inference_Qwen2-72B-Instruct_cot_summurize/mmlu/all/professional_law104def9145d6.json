At the defendant's trial, several eyewitnesses testified that they had seen a large redheaded man pull out a gun and rob the owner of the liquor store. The defendant appeared at trial with a shaven head. The prosecution calls a corrections officer to testify that the defendant had red hair when he was first brought to jail. The defendant's counsel objects. The trial judge should rule the correction officer's testimony\n\nA. admissible as a prior identification.\nB. admissible, for the limited purpose of clarifying the discrepancy in the witnesses' testimony.\nC. inadmissible as hearsay not within any recognized exception.\nD. inadmissible, because it is opinion testimony.\n"

This testimony can help establish that the defendant matches the description given by the eyewitnesses, despite his current shaven head. It is not being offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted (that the defendant committed the robbery), but rather to explain a difference in appearance that could affect the credibility of the eyewitness testimony. Therefore, it is not considered hearsay and is admissible for this limited purpose."
