The Moon will be further from the Earth and the Earth\u2019s day will be longer.\n\nOver long periods of time, the gravitational interaction between the Earth and the Moon causes the Moon to slowly move away from the Earth at an average rate of about 3.8 cm per year. As the Moon moves further away, it exerts less torque on the Earth, which results in a gradual slowing of Earth's rotation. This means that over 20,000 years, the Moon will be further from the Earth, and the length of a day on Earth will be slightly longer than it is today."
