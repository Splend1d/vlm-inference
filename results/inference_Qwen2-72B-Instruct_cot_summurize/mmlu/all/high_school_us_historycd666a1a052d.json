Tonight, the daughter of working Americans tells all Americans that the future is within our reach, if we're willing to reach for it. Tonight, the daughter of an immigrant from Italy has been chosen to run for (vice) president in the new land my father came to love.\u2026 Americans want to live by the same set of rules. But under this administration, the rules are rigged against too many of our people. It isn't right that every year the share of taxes paid by individual citizens is going up, while the share paid by large corporations is getting smaller and smaller.\u2026 It isn't right that young couples question whether to bring children into a world of 50,000 nuclear warheads. That isn't the vision for which Americans have struggled for more than two centuries.\u2026 Tonight, we reclaim our dream. We're going to make the rules of American life work for all Americans again.\u2026 The issue is not what America can do for women, but what women can do for America.\n\u2014Geraldine Ferraro, Vice Presidential Nomination Acceptance Address, July 19, 1984\nGeraldine Ferraro can be most directly compared to which of the following women?\n\nA. Abigail Adams\nB. Sandra Day O'Connor\nC. Jane Addams\nD. Rosa Parks\n"

Ferraro was the first woman to be nominated for Vice President by a major American political party, while O'Connor was the first woman to serve on the United States Supreme Court. Both women broke significant gender barriers in American politics.\n\nA. Abigail Adams was an early advocate for women's rights but never held public office.\n\nC. Jane Addams was a social worker and reformer who won the Nobel Peace Prize, but she did not hold high elected office.\n\nD.
