Lenin.\nThe independence of our country cannot be upheld unless we have an adequate industrial basis for defense. And such an industrial basis cannot be created if our industry is not more highly developed technically. That is why a fast rate of development of our industry is necessary and imperative. We cannot go on indefinitely, that is, for too long a period, basing the Soviet regime and socialist construction on two different foundations, the foundation of the most large-scale and united socialist industry and the foundation of the most scattered and backward, small commodity economy of the peasants. We must gradually, but systematically and persistently, place our agriculture on a new technical basis, the basis of large-scale production, and bring it up to the level of socialist industry. Either we accomplish this task\u2014in which case the final victory of socialism in our country will be assured, or we turn away from it and do not accomplish it\u2014in which case a return to capitalism may become inevitable.\n\u2014Vladimir I. Lenin Industrialization of the Country and the Right Deviation in the C.P.S.U., November 19,1928\nWhich of the following policies of Joseph Stalin was NOT used to correct the problem cited by Lenin above?\n\nA.

The Berlin Blockade\n\nThe Berlin Blockade was not a policy of Joseph Stalin directed at correcting the issue of industrialization and agricultural modernization in the Soviet Union. It was an international event that occurred in 1948-1949 as part of the early Cold War tensions between the Soviet Union and Western powers over the control of post-war Germany.\n\nThe other options listed were indeed policies implemented by Stalin:\n\nA. Collectivization: This was the forced consolidation of individual peasant households into collective farms (kolkhozes) and state farms (sovkhozes). It aimed to increase agricultural efficiency and align with the industrialization efforts.\n\nB. Persecution of the better-off peasants (kulaks): Stalin's government targeted kulaks, who were wealthier and more successful farmers, accusing them of being counter-revolutionaries and enemies of the people. Many were exiled, executed, or forced to join collective farms.\n\nD. The Five-Year Plans: These were a series of nation-wide centralized exercises in rapid economic development, focusing heavily on industrial output and aiming to transform the Soviet Union from a predominantly agrarian society into an industrial superpower."
