As the man was running away with the wallet, the police officer pulled out his service revolver. The police officer yelled at the man to stop and then fired several shots in the man's direction. The police officer did not aim directly at the man but shot at the pavement intending to frighten him. One of the bullets ricocheted off the sidewalk and struck the man, killing him.

However, given the information provided, the most likely charge would be:\n\nB. Involuntary manslaughter.\n\nInvoluntary manslaughter typically involves the unintentional killing of another person through reckless or criminally negligent behavior. While the police officer did not intend to kill the man, he did fire a weapon in a public space without aiming directly at the threat, which can be considered recklessly endangering others. The fact that the bullet ricocheted and struck the man could be seen as an unintended consequence of the officer's reckless action.\n\nIt is important to note that the specific charges could vary based on local laws regarding self-defense, use of force by law enforcement officers, and the specific details of the incident. For example, if it could be shown that the officer acted with malice aforethought or had a clear intent to kill, the charge could potentially rise to murder. However, based on the information given, involuntary manslaughter seems the most fitting charge."
