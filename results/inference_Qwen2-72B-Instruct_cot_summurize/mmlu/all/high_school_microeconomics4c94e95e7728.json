MC that first falls, but eventually rises, as output increases.\n\nThis law states that if one input is increased while all other inputs are held constant, there will come a point where the additional output from that extra input will begin to decrease. This is because each additional unit of input is less efficiently used than the previous one. In terms of cost, this means that the marginal cost (MC) of production will initially decrease as the increased input leads to greater efficiency and lower average costs per unit. However, once diminishing returns set in, the MC will start to rise as the cost of producing each additional unit increases."
