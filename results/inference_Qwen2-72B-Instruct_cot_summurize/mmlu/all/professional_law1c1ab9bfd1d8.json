When a teenage male opened the door, the police officer told him that a convict had escaped and asked if he had seen anyone suspicious in the neighborhood. The teenager said he hadn't but then asked the police officer to come inside to ensure the house was safe. The police officer entered the home and proceeded to look around. When he went into the kitchen, the police officer noticed a bag containing white powder on the counter. Suspecting that the bag contained narcotics, the police officer questioned the teenager as to its contents. The teenager said he didn't live in the house and had never seen it before. The police officer confiscated the bag and took the teenager to the station house for questioning, at which time it was determined that the teenager had escaped from a psychiatric hospital and had broken into the home earlier in the day. Furthermore, the results of a police lab test found that the bag contained heroin. As a result, the police issued an arrest warrant for the owner of the home. He was apprehended and charged with possession of heroin. The homeowner's attorney has filed a motion to suppress, claiming that the heroin confiscated by the police was unlawfully obtained. The motion should be\n\nA. granted, because the teenager did not have the authority to consent to a search of the house.\nB. granted, because the teenager did not have an ownership or shared occupancy interest in the premises.\nC. denied, because the police officer reasonably believed that he had permission to enter the dwelling.\nD. denied, because the police officer reasonably believed that he had permission to enter the dwelling and reasonably believed that the teenager was competent to give consent.\n"

While the teenager did not have actual authority to consent to a search (since he did not live there), the police officer could have reasonably assumed that the teenager had apparent authority, especially considering the circumstances presented. The police officer's belief that the teenager was competent to give consent and his reasonable reliance on that consent would likely fall under the \"good faith\" exception to the warrant requirement, allowing the evidence to be admissible. However, it is important to note that the specific outcome would depend on the interpretation of case law in the jurisdiction where the incident occurred."
