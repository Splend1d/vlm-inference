If we consider \\(f(z)\\) as a function of two variables, \\(f(x, y)\\), then since \\(f(z)\\) is analytic and maps the entire complex plane to the real line, by the Open Mapping Theorem (which states that a non-constant analytic function maps open sets to open sets), if \\(f(z)\\) were not constant, it would map some open set in the complex plane to an open set on the real line. However, since the image is constrained to the real axis, this cannot happen unless the function is constant on that open set.\n\nGiven that the function maps the entire complex plane to the real line, and considering the imaginary axis specifically (\\(x = 0\\)), if \\(f(z)\\) were to map the imaginary axis onto anything other than a point (i.e., an open interval, a ray, or the entire real axis), it would violate the fact that an analytic function maps open sets to open sets, unless the function is constant on that open set. Since the imaginary axis is an open set in the complex plane (when considered as a subset), and the function maps the entire complex plane into the real line, the only way for this to hold true without violating the Open Mapping Theorem is if the imaginary axis is mapped to a single point on the real line.\n\nThus, the correct answer is B. a point."
