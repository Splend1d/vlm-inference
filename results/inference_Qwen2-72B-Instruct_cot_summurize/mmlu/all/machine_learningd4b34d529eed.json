Layer Normalization was introduced later by Ba et al. (2016).\n\nStatement 2 is also false because DCGANs (Radford et al., 2015) do not use self-attention mechanisms to stabilize training. Self-attention was introduced into GAN architectures later, for example, in the paper \"Self-Attention Generative Adversarial Networks\" by Zhang et al. (2019)."
