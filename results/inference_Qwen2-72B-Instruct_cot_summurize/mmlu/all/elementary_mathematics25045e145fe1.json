For example, if Mr. Paulson has 40 students and Ms. Hugo has 80 students, then 0.5 of Mr. Paulson's class (20 students) ate pizza, while 0.5 of Ms. Hugo's class (40 students) ate hamburgers. This would mean more students (in absolute numbers) ate hamburgers than pizza, even though the percentages were the same.\n\nChoices A and D do not provide relevant information for comparing the number of students who ate specific foods in the two classes. Choice C is incorrect because the proportions alone are not sufficient for comparison without context regarding the sizes of the groups being compared."
