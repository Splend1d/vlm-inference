It may be answered that one should wish to be both, but, because it is difficult to unite them in one person, it is much safer to be feared than loved, when, of the two, either must be dispensed with. Because this is to be asserted in general of men, that they are ungrateful, fickle, false, cowardly, covetous, and as long as you succeed they are yours entirely; they will offer you their blood, property, life, and children, as is said above, when the need is far distant; but when it approaches they turn against you. And that prince who, relying entirely on their promises, has neglected other precautions, is ruined; because friendships that are obtained by payments, and not by greatness or nobility of mind, may indeed be earned, but they are not secured, and in time of need cannot be relied upon; and men have less scruple in offending one who is beloved than one who is feared, for love is preserved by the link of obligation which, owing to the baseness of men, is broken at every opportunity for their advantage; but fear preserves you by a dread of punishment which never fails.\"\nNicolo Machiavelli, The Prince, ca. 1513 C.E.\nThe political philosophy espoused in the text above is different from those of the medieval period in which of the following ways?\n\nA. It accepted the notion that monarchs were justified in asserting their authority.\nB. It was a pragmatic rather than an ethical or religious ideology.\nC. It stressed the importance of looking back to the classical past.\nD. It did not rely upon strong concepts of equality across class boundaries.\n"

It was a pragmatic rather than an ethical or religious ideology.\n\nMachiavelli's political philosophy in \"The Prince\" diverges significantly from medieval political thought by focusing on practicality and effectiveness over morality and religious doctrine. In the medieval period, politics and governance were often intertwined with Christian ethics and the divine right of kings, which suggested that rulers were accountable to God and should govern according to His will. Machiavelli's advice to rulers, however, is centered around maintaining power and control through any means necessary, including deceit, manipulation, and force. This pragmatic approach is evident in his assertion that it is safer for a ruler to be feared than loved, as fear ensures obedience and loyalty more reliably than love, which can be fickle and unreliable. By emphasizing the importance of power and survival over ethical considerations, Machiavelli's political philosophy reflects a significant shift away from the more idealistic and religiously influenced ideologies of the medieval period."
