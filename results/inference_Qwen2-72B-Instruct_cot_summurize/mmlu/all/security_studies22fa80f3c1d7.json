The problematic contention that the liberalist perspective is based on ideas that are Western - such as democracy, free enterprise, and civil rights: This challenge questions whether these values are universally applicable or if they are culturally specific to Western societies. The assumption that these values would be easily embraced in the Middle East was questioned when the outcomes of the Arab Spring did not always lead to stable democracies.\n\nB. Liberalism did not provide a clear way to deal with the Arab Spring, and its inconsistencies and contradictions were exposed: During the Arab Spring, Western countries struggled to find a consistent approach to supporting democratic movements while also maintaining strategic interests in the region. This led to accusations of hypocrisy and inconsistency in their application of liberal principles.\n\nC. The liberalist perspective does not explain clearly how and when liberalism is supposed to spread, in this case to the Arab countries in question: The events of the Arab Spring raised questions about the conditions necessary for the successful transition to liberal democracy. It became apparent that simply removing authoritarian regimes did not guarantee the establishment of liberal democratic institutions, and that factors such as civil society, rule of law, and economic development also play crucial roles.\n\nThese challenges underscored the complexity of applying liberal principles in diverse cultural and political contexts and revealed the limitations of a one-size-fits-all approach to promoting democracy and human rights."
