However, we can conclude option B: the people of country X enjoy a standard of living twice as much as country Y, assuming that \"standard of living\" is measured by per capita output. Since country X produces twice as much output with the same number of people as country Y, its per capita output is twice as high, which would imply a higher standard of living. However, it's important to note that other factors such as income distribution, access to healthcare and education, and cost of living can also affect the standard of living in a country."
