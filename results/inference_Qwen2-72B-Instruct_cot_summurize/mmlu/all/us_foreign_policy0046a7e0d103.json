The US promoted the marketization of the Russian economy\n\nDuring the Clinton Administration (1993-2001), the United States supported the economic transition in Russia from a centrally planned economy to a market-based one. This policy was part of a broader strategy to foster democratic reforms and economic liberalization in post-Soviet Russia. The U.S. government provided technical assistance and financial support through various channels, including the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, to help Russia implement economic reforms such as privatization, price liberalization, and the establishment of a banking system. However, the implementation of these policies, often referred to as \"shock therapy,\" faced significant challenges and criticism for contributing to economic instability and inequality in Russia."
