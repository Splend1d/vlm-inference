However, it may be admissible under certain exceptions to the hearsay rule.\n\nIn this case, the most likely exception that would apply is B: hearsay, but admissible as an admission. An admission by a party-opponent is a statement made by the defendant or someone associated with the defendant that can be used against them in court. Since the man on death row is essentially admitting his role in the crime, this could fall under the category of an admission and therefore be admissible despite being hearsay. \n\nHowever, whether it's admissible as a dying declaration (option C) would depend on whether the declarant believed they were facing imminent death at the time of making the statement and whether the statement concerned the cause or circumstances of what they believed to be their impending death. If these conditions are met, then it could also be admissible as a dying declaration. But based on the information provided, option B seems the most appropriate answer."
