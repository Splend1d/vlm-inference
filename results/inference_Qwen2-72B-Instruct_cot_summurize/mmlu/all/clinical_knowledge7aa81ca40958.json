The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nA. The enzymes of the tricarboxylic acid cycle (Krebs' cycle) are located within the mitochondrial matrix, not embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane.\n\nC. Glycogen molecules are primarily stored in liver and muscle cells, not in the mitochondria. They are stored in the cytoplasm outside of the mitochondria.\n\nD. Triacylglycerol molecules are typically found in lipid droplets or as components of cell membranes, not embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane."
