She is 165 cm (5 ft 5 in) tall and weighs 70 kg (154 lb); BMI is 26 kg/m2 . Her pulse is 80/min, and blood pressure is 130/82 mm Hg. Physical examination shows temporal balding and coarse dark hair on the upper lip and chin. Pelvic examination shows clitoral enlargement. Her serum testosterone concentration is increased. Serum concentrations of androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone, and urinary 17-ketosteroids are within the reference ranges. Ultrasonography of the pelvis shows a 12-cm ovarian mass. Which of the following best describes this mass?\n\nA. Granulosa tumor\nB. Ovarian carcinoid\nC. Sertoli-Leydig tumor\nD. Teratoma\n"

                    "text": "The description provided suggests that the patient has symptoms consistent with hyperandrogenism, including hirsutism (excessive hair growth), amenorrhea (absence of menstruation), temporal balding, and clitoral enlargement. These symptoms are often associated with elevated levels of androgens, such as testosterone. The finding of an enlarged ovarian mass in conjunction with these symptoms and laboratory findings points to an androgen-secreting ovarian tumor.\n\nGiven the clinical presentation and the laboratory results, the most likely diagnosis for the ovarian mass is:\n\nC. Sertoli-Leydig tumor\n\nSertoli-Leydig tumors, also known as androblastomas or Arrhenoblastomas, are rare ovarian tumors that can produce androgens, leading to virilization in women. They typically present with symptoms related to androgen excess, such as those described in the case. The normal levels of other androgens like androstenedione and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) suggest that the source of the androgen excess is specifically testosterone, which is produced by Sertoli-Leydig cells in these tumors.\n\nGranulosa tumors (option A) can also secrete hormones, but they typically cause estrogen excess rather than androgen excess.\n\nOvarian carcinoids (option B) are neuroendocrine tumors that do not typically cause androgen excess.\n\nTeratomas (option D) are germ cell tumors that may contain various types of tissue but do not typically secrete androgens at levels that would cause significant virilization."
