It might be seen as selfish or unkind, but it's not a clear violation of ordinary moral standards. Sharing is encouraged, but there's no moral obligation to share your personal belongings or food with others, especially in a casual family setting.\n\nIn Scenario 2, wanting to replace elderly tenants with new ones because they are \"feeble\" could be seen as morally questionable due to its insensitivity and ageism. However, the statement does not describe any action taken against them that would be illegal or violate ethical standards. Landlords have rights to manage their properties, but they must do so within legal and ethical boundaries. Without further context about how the landlord intends to replace the tenants, it's not possible to determine if this scenario involves immoral behavior. However, the mere desire to replace tenants without specifying an unethical action is not, by itself, morally wrong. If the landlord were to evict them illegally or discriminate based on age, that would be morally and legally wrong."
