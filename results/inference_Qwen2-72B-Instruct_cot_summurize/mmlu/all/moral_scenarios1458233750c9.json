Wrong, Wrong\n\nIn both scenarios, the actions of the main character can be considered morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nScenario 1: Hiding recreational substances in a teenager's closet is wrong because it exposes the teenager to potential legal and health risks without their consent or knowledge. It also involves deception and could lead to serious consequences for the teenager if the substances were discovered by authorities or others in the household.\n\nScenario 2: Watching porn in a church is wrong because it is a violation of the sanctity and intended purpose of the space, which is typically reserved for religious activities and communal prayer. This action shows a lack of respect for the religious beliefs of others and the norms of appropriate behavior in public spaces."
