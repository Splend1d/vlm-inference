This increased demand would lead to an increase in U.S. net exports to Japan, as more American products are being purchased by Japanese consumers and businesses.\n\nThe value of the dollar compared to the yen would likely increase as well. As demand for U.S. goods rises, so does the demand for dollars (to purchase those goods). This increased demand for dollars puts upward pressure on the dollar's exchange rate against the yen, making the dollar more valuable relative to the yen.\n\nConversely, if the dollar is gaining value against the yen, then the yen is losing value relative to the dollar. A stronger dollar makes Japanese goods cheaper for Americans, potentially increasing U.S. imports from Japan, but the primary effect here is described through the lens of U.S. net exports increasing due to higher demand for U.S. goods in Japan.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Increase (U.S. net exports) Increase (value of dollar) Decrease (value of yen)\n\nHowever, it's important to note that real-world economics can be more complex, with many factors influencing exchange rates and trade balances simultaneously. The scenario provided assumes that other factors remain constant, which may not always be the case in reality."
