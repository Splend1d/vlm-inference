The ADI is the amount of a substance that can be ingested daily over a lifetime without appreciable health risk. This is determined by dividing the no-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) by a safety factor, usually 100, to account for interspecies and inter-individual variation. If the EDI is less than the ADI, it is generally considered safe. However, all of the options listed can contribute to the overall safety assessment of a food additive."
