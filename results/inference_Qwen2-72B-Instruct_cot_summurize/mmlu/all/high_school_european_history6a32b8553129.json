One would find it hard to imagine how the laws of movement cause such frightful disasters in the best of possible worlds. A hundred thousand ants, our fellows, crushed all at once in our ant-hill, and half of them perishing, no doubt in unspeakable agony, beneath the wreckage from which they cannot be drawn. Families ruined all over Europe, the fortune of a hundred businessmen, your compatriots, swallowed up in the ruins of Lisbon. What a wretched gamble is the game of human life! What will the preachers say, especially if the palace of the Inquisition is still standing? I flatter myself that at least the reverend father inquisitors have been crushed like others. That ought to teach men not to persecute each other, for while a few holy scoundrels burn a few fanatics, the earth swallows up one and all.\n\u2014Voltaire, in a letter, 1755\nWhich of the following Enlightenment philosophes questioned reliance on reason and began the Romantic Movement for the rationale given?\n\nA. Jean-Jacques Rousseau because he thought society corrupted noble souls.\nB. Baron Montesquieu because he thought that governments were not capable of being fair.\nC. Mary Wollstonecraft because she railed against the subjugation of women emotionally.\nD. Adam Smith because he stated that reason could not be used to understand how another feels.\n"

Jean-Jacques Rousseau because he thought society corrupted noble souls.\n\nWhile none of the options provided perfectly align with Voltaire's sentiment in this quote, Jean-Jacques Rousseau is the closest match among the choices given. Rousseau was critical of the Enlightenment's emphasis on reason and believed that humans were naturally good but were corrupted by society. His ideas contributed to the development of the Romantic Movement, which emphasized emotion and individualism over rationalism and collective norms. The quote from Voltaire reflects a disillusionment with the idea that the world is inherently good or just, which resonates with Rousseau's critique of society's impact on the human condition."
