Ease of entry and exit in the long run\n\nBoth perfect competition and monopolistic competition allow for easy entry and exit in the long run, which means that firms can enter or leave the industry without significant barriers. This characteristic ensures that in the long run, economic profits will be zero as new entrants will be attracted by short-run profits in perfect competition, driving down profits to normal levels, and in monopolistic competition, it leads to a situation where firms earn only normal profit in the long run as they face competitive pressure from existing and new firms. \n\nB is incorrect because while perfect competition assumes homogenous products, monopolistic competition does not. In monopolistic competition, firms sell differentiated products.\n\nC is incorrect because perfectly elastic demand is a feature of perfect competition, not monopolistic competition. In monopolistic competition, each firm faces a downward-sloping demand curve due to product differentiation.\n\nD is incorrect because neither structure allows for long-run positive profits. In both cases, free entry and exit ensure that any economic profits will attract new firms into the market until profits are competed away, leaving firms with only normal profits in the long run."
