The result is the value of GDP adjusted for price changes, which allows for comparison over time or between countries with different rates of inflation. Real GDP = (Nominal GDP / GDP deflator) x 100. However, in this context, simply dividing nominal GDP by the GDP deflator would also provide the correct adjustment for inflation, albeit without the multiplication by 100 that scales the result to an index value."
