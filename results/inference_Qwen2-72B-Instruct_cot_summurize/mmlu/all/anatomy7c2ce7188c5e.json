Therefore, if these lymph nodes are enlarged, you would look for potential infection sites in areas that drain to these nodes. None of the options provided exactly match this description, but option D comes closest as it includes structures that could potentially drain to the submandibular lymph nodes. However, the more accurate answer based on the drainage pattern would include the floor of the mouth and the anterior two-thirds of the tongue, which are not listed.\n\nGiven the options:\n\nA. hard palate.\nB. hard palate and upper lip.\nC. hard palate, upper lip and upper central incisor.\nD. hard palate, upper lip, upper central incisor and lower first molar.\n\nThe best choice would be **D** because it includes structures that could potentially lead to submandibular lymph node enlargement due to their proximity and drainage patterns. However, it's important to note that the floor of the mouth and the anterior two-thirds of the tongue should also be examined as they are primary areas that drain into the submandibular lymph nodes."
