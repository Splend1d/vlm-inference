However, I can provide a general overview of their guidance on testing.\n\nThe CDC and WHO have recommended that testing should be available to anyone with symptoms of COVID-19, as well as to those who have been in close contact with someone diagnosed with the virus, regardless of whether they have symptoms. They also recommend testing in certain settings, such as healthcare facilities, long-term care facilities, and congregate living settings where outbreaks are more likely to occur. Additionally, both organizations suggest that countries should consider the local epidemiological situation and resources when implementing testing strategies.\n\nRegarding \"opt-in\" or \"opt-out\" policies, these terms typically refer to the way consent is obtained for testing in a specific setting. An \"opt-in\" policy requires individuals to actively give consent to be tested, while an \"opt-out\" policy assumes consent unless the individual explicitly declines. The CDC and WHO do not mandate a specific opt-in or opt-out policy but rather provide guidelines that countries and institutions can adapt based on their local context.\n\nMandatory testing of prisoners or high-risk groups is not a blanket recommendation from either the CDC or WHO. Instead, they suggest that testing should be prioritized for high-risk groups, which may include prisoners due to the crowded conditions in correctional facilities. However, the decision to implement mandatory testing in any group is left to the discretion of local health authorities based on the evolving epidemiological situation and public health needs.\n\nIt's important to note that testing policies can change rapidly in response to new information about the disease and its transmission, as well as changes in the availability of testing resources. Always consult the latest guidance from the CDC and WHO for the most up-to-date information."
