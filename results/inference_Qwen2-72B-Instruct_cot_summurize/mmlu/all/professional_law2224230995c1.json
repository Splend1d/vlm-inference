Under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), an offer by a merchant to buy or sell goods can be made irrevocable without consideration if it is in writing and states that it will be held open for a specified period of time, not exceeding three months (UCC \u00a7 2-205). Options A, C, and D all include terms that would make the offer irrevocable under the UCC. Option B, however, lacks any such term and could therefore be revoked by the seller prior to acceptance."
