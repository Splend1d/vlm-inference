This means that for each prime \\(p\\) in the factorization of \\(n\\), if \\(p^k\\) is the highest power of \\(p\\) dividing \\(n\\), then \\(2k\\) must be less than or equal to the exponent of \\(p\\) in the factorization of 1200.\n\nGiven the prime factorization of 1200, we have:\n\n- For \\(2\\), the highest exponent that \\(2^k\\) can have in \\(n\\) is \\(k=2\\) (since \\(2 \\cdot 2 \\leq 4\\)).\n- For \\(3\\), the highest exponent that \\(3^k\\) can have in \\(n\\) is \\(k=0\\) (since \\(2 \\cdot 1 > 1\\), but \\(2 \\cdot 0 \\leq 1\\)).\n- For \\(5\\), the highest exponent that \\(5^k\\) can have in \\(n\\) is \\(k=1\\) (since \\(2 \\cdot 1 \\leq 2\\)).\n\nThus, \\(n\\) can be written as \\(2^a \\cdot 3^b \\cdot 5^c\\) where \\(a \\in \\{0, 1, 2\\}\\), \\(b \\in \\{0\\}\\) (since \\(3^b\\) cannot contribute to a perfect square divisor of 1200 with \\(b>0\\)), and \\(c \\in \\{0, 1\\}\\).\n\nThe possible values for \\(n\\) are thus:\n- \\(2^0 \\cdot 3^0 \\cdot 5^0 = 1\\)\n- \\(2^1 \\cdot 3^0 \\cdot 5^0 = 2\\)\n- \\(2^2 \\cdot 3^0 \\cdot 5^0 = 4\\)\n- \\(2^0 \\cdot 3^0 \\cdot 5^1 = 5\\)\n- \\(2^1 \\cdot 3^0 \\cdot 5^1 = 10\\)\n- \\(2^2 \\cdot 3^0 \\cdot 5^1 = 20\\)\n\nSumming these up, we get:\n\\[1 + 2 + 4 + 5 + 10 + 20 = 42\\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. 42."
