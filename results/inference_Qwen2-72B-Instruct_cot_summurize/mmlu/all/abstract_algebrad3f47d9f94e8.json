For the first component in \\(Z_{12}\\), we want to find the smallest positive integer \\(n\\) such that \\(4n \\equiv 0 \\mod{12}\\). The divisors of \\(12\\) are \\(1, 2, 3, 4, 6,\\) and \\(12\\). The smallest \\(n\\) that satisfies \\(4n \\equiv 0 \\mod{12}\\) is \\(n=3\\) because \\(4 \\times 3 = 12 \\equiv 0 \\mod{12}\\).\n\n2. For the second component in \\(Z_{8}\\), we want to find the smallest positive integer \\(n\\) such that \\(2n \\equiv 0 \\mod{8}\\). The divisors of \\(8\\) are \\(1, 2, 4,\\) and \\(8\\). The smallest \\(n\\) that satisfies \\(2n \\equiv 0 \\mod{8}\\) is \\(n=4\\) because \\(2 \\times 4 = 8 \\equiv 0 \\mod{8}\\).\n\nNow, we have two different orders for each component (\\(3\\) and \\(4\\)). The order of the element \\((4, 2)\\) in \\(Z_{12} \\times Z_{8}\\) will be the least common multiple (LCM) of these two orders because both components must simultaneously return to their identity elements.\n\nThe LCM of \\(3\\) and \\(4\\) is \\(12\\).\n\nThus, the correct answer is **C. 12**."
