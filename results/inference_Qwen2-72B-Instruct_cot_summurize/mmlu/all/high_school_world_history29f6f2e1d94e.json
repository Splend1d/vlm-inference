The glorious sun Shamash bestowed upon him glory; Adad the terrible god of storms bestowed upon him courage. The great gods perfected his magnificence beyond all others, terrible like the great wild bull. Two thirds god they made him; one third man they made him.\nOf Uruk, its great rampart he built, and the wall of the sacred Eanna temple, the holy sanctuary. Behold the outer walls which gleam with the brilliance of copper; see the inner wall which none might rival. Touch the threshold stone\u2014it is from ancient days. Goest thou into the Eanna temple, yea, the dwelling place of Ishtar, the like of which no subsequent king or living man might equal. Ascend and walk about on the wall of Uruk, inspect the corner-stone, and examine its brick-work, whether its wall is not made of burned brick, and its foundation laid by the Seven Sages. One third for city, one third for garden, one third for field, and a precinct for the temple of Ishtar. These parts and the precinct comprise Uruk.\"\nThe Epic of Gilgamesh, ca. 2100 B.C.E.\n*Gilgamesh was a king of Uruk.\nWhich of the following best describes the origins of epic poetry such as the Epic of Gilgamesh?\n\nA.

Epic poetry often celebrates the heroic deeds and adventures of legendary figures, many of whom were warriors or kings. In the case of the Epic of Gilgamesh, it recounts the heroic exploits of Gilgamesh, a king of Uruk, and his companion Enkidu. The poem highlights Gilgamesh's strength, wisdom, and his building projects, such as the walls of Uruk and the Eanna temple, which were seen as monumental achievements. The origins of epic poetry are closely tied to the oral tradition of storytelling, where the feats of these heroes were passed down through generations before being written down by scribes. While the other options may have played a role in the preservation and transmission of epic poetry, it is the rise of a warrior elite and their legendary deeds that are typically at the heart of epic narratives."
