In this case, the market price of Gin Co.'s stock was $10 per share, and the exercise price was $9 per share.\n\nSo, the intrinsic value per share would be:\n\nMarket Price - Exercise Price = $10 - $9 = $1\n\nSince the option is for 100 shares, the total intrinsic value of the option at the time of initial investment would be:\n\nIntrinsic Value per Share * Number of Shares = $1 * 100 = $100\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. $100"
