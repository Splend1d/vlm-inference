DNA polymerase I\n\nThis enzyme has both 5' to 3' polymerase activity and 3' to 5' exonuclease (proofreading) activity. After the RNA primer is removed, DNA polymerase I fills in the gap with the correct nucleotides and its proofreading activity ensures that any incorrectly paired bases are excised and replaced. However, it's worth noting that during DNA replication, the primary polymerase responsible for DNA synthesis is DNA polymerase III, which also has proofreading capabilities but it's not as efficient as DNA polymerase I in the specific context mentioned."
