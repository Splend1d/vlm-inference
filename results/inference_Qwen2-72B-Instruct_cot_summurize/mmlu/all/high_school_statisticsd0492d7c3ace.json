                    "text": "To solve this problem, we can use the Central Limit Theorem (CLT), which states that the distribution of sample means approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases, regardless of the population distribution.\n\nGiven:\n- Population mean (\\(\\mu\\)) = 4 ounces\n- Population standard deviation (\\(\\sigma\\)) = 0.25 ounces\n- Sample size (\\(n\\)) = 40 jars\n\nFirst, we need to find the standard error (\\(SE\\)) of the sampling distribution of the mean. The formula for the standard error is:\n\n\\[SE = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}\\]\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\n\\[SE = \\frac{0.25}{\\sqrt{40}} = \\frac{0.25}{6.3246} \\approx 0.0395\\]\n\nNext, we want to find the probability that the mean amount per jar (\\(\\bar{x}\\)) is less than 3.9 ounces. To do this, we convert the value to a z-score using the following formula:\n\n\\[z = \\frac{\\bar{x} - \\mu}{SE}\\]\n\nSubstituting the known values:\n\n\\[z = \\frac{3.9 - 4}{0.0395} = \\frac{-0.1}{0.0395} \\approx -2.53\\]\n\nNow, we look up the z-score of -2.53 in the standard normal distribution table or use a calculator to find the corresponding cumulative probability. A z-score of -2.53 corresponds to a probability of approximately 0.0057.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the mean amount per jar filled in the sampled jars is less than 3.9 ounces is:\n\nA. 0.0057"
