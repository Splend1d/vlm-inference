However, in clinical practice, a comprehensive psychodiagnostic workup (option A) that rules out other causes of dementia, along with neuropsychological testing (option D) showing the characteristic pattern of cognitive deficits, is used to make a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. CT or MRI scans (option B) can show cerebral atrophy, which is often seen in Alzheimer's disease, but this finding is not specific to Alzheimer's and can also occur in other conditions. Therefore, while all of these options can contribute to the diagnostic process, the most accurate verification would be C. brain biopsy, if it were feasible and ethical to perform. However, in real-world clinical practice, the combination of A and D is what is typically used to diagnose Alzheimer's disease."
