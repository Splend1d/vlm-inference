The use of intravenous feeding tubes is a biological intervention, aimed at addressing the physical consequences of anorexia nervosa. The attempt to change Zoe's irrational belief about her body image is a cognitive-behavioral technique, which focuses on modifying distorted thinking patterns and behaviors. Discussing how her early family relationships may have contributed to her problems is a psychodynamic approach, which explores the influence of unconscious processes and past experiences on current functioning.\n\nGiven that the treatment combines elements from biological, cognitive-behavioral, and psychodynamic approaches, the best classification for this integrated strategy would be:\n\nD. eclectic."
