Realizing that the power to tax is the power to destroy and that the power to take a certain amount of property or of income is only another way of saying that for a certain proportion of his time a citizen must work for the government, the authority to impose a tax on the people has been most carefully guarded.\u2026 A government which lays taxes on the people not required by urgent necessity and sound public policy is not a protector of liberty, but an instrument of tyranny. It condemns the citizen to tyranny. One of the first signs of the breaking down of free government is a disregard by the taxing power of the right of the people to their own property.\u2026 Unless the people can enjoy that reasonable security in the possession of their property, which is guaranteed by the Constitution, against unreasonable taxation, freedom is at an end.\u2026 With us economy is imperative. It is a full test of our national character.\u2026 It is always the people who toil that pay.\n\u2014Calvin Coolidge, \"Economy in the Interest of All,\" June 30, 1924\nIn the passage above Coolidge is reacting against which of the following?\n\nA. The economic policies of his predecessor Warren G. Harding\nB. The growing strength of radical politics in America following the Russian Revolution\nC. Populist agitation in the West\nD. The governmental policies of the Progressive Era\n"

However, given the context and the timing of the speech (\"Economy in the Interest of All,\" June 30, 1924), it is more likely that he is reacting against:\n\nD. The governmental policies of the Progressive Era\n\nCoolidge's emphasis on guarding against excessive taxation and protecting individual property rights aligns with a reaction against the expansion of government intervention and regulation that characterized the Progressive Era. This period saw reforms aimed at addressing social issues and regulating businesses, often through increased taxation and government spending.\n\nThe other options do not fit as well based on the information provided in the passage:\n\nA. The economic policies of his predecessor Warren G. Harding - Harding's policies were generally aligned with Coolidge's views on limited government and pro-business policies.\nB. The growing strength of radical politics in America following the Russian Revolution - While this could have been a concern for Coolidge, the passage does not specifically address radical politics or the Russian Revolution.\nC. Populist agitation in the West - Although populism was a factor in American politics, the passage does not directly address Western populist movements."
