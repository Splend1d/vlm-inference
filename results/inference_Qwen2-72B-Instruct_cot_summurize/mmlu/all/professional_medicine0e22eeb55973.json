Timolol is a beta-blocker used in the treatment of glaucoma, but it can also have systemic effects, including bronchoconstriction, which can exacerbate respiratory conditions such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Given the patient's history of smoking, it is possible that she has developed COPD, and the use of Timolol could worsen her respiratory symptoms."
