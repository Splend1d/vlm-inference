Fifteen engineers work in the Atlanta office, and 14 engineers work in the New Orleans office. The business manager decided to use a 2-sample t-test to compare the mean salaries of engineers in the two offices. Because there were only 15 engineers in one office and 14 engineers in the other, he used the salaries of all the engineers in the computation. Is the 2-sample t-test an appropriate inferential technique in this situation?\n\nA. Yes, because he is comparing the means of two small groups.\nB. Yes. Both Atlanta and New Orleans are large cities, so the salaries are comparable.\nC. Yes. Because Atlanta and New Orleans are about 500 miles apart, the two groups of engineers can be assumed to be independent.\nD. No, because the entire population information was used from both offices. Because no samples were taken, a t-test should not be used.\n"

Because no samples were taken, a t-test should not be used.\n\nExplanation: A t-test is typically used to compare the means of two independent samples drawn from larger populations. In this case, since the business manager used the salaries of all the engineers in each office (i.e., the entire population), there is no sampling involved. Therefore, using a t-test would not be appropriate. Instead, a simple comparison of means or another non-sampling statistical method would be more suitable."
