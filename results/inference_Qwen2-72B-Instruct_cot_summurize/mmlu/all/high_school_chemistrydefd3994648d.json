This means that sodium has one less electron than magnesium and also one less proton in its nucleus.\n\nGiven this information, we can predict that:\n\n1. Sodium's atomic radius will be larger than that of magnesium because with one less proton in the nucleus, the effective nuclear charge on the valence electrons is slightly reduced, allowing the electron cloud to expand slightly.\n2. Sodium's first ionization energy will be lower than that of magnesium because it is easier to remove an electron from sodium (which has fewer protons attracting the outermost electron) than from magnesium.\n\nLooking at the choices:\n\nA. 186 pm, 496 kJ/mol - This has a smaller atomic radius than magnesium, which contradicts our prediction that sodium should have a larger atomic radius. However, the ionization energy is lower, which is consistent with our prediction.\n\nB. 186 pm, 898 kJ/mol - This also has a smaller atomic radius than magnesium and a higher ionization energy, both of which contradict our predictions.\n\nC. 135 pm, 523 kJ/mol - This has a significantly smaller atomic radius than magnesium, which is inconsistent with our prediction. The ionization energy is higher, which also goes against our prediction.\n\nD. 147 pm, 523 kJ/mol - This still has a smaller atomic radius than magnesium, which doesn't match our prediction. Although the ionization energy is higher than magnesium's, which is not what we would expect based on periodic trends.\n\nGiven the options provided, the choice that best matches our predictions based on periodic trends is A. 186 pm, 496 kJ/mol. This option indicates a lower ionization energy (consistent with sodium being easier to ionize than magnesium) and while the atomic radius is listed as smaller, the other options either have even smaller radii or do not fit the trend for ionization energy.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that real-world data for sodium's atomic radius (about 180-190 pm depending on the source) and first ionization energy (495.8 kJ/mol) actually supports choice A as the closest match to actual values and periodic trends."
