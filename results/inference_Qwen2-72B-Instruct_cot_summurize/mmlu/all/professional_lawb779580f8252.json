The note read as follows: \"Do you think this contract of sale for my boat complies with state law? I would have talked to you in person about this, but I'm on my way out of town. I will be back next week.\" The attorney reviewed the document and wrote a one-page letter to the client stating that the document complied with state law. The lawyer included a bill for $500, which was a lawyer included a bill for $500, which was a reasonable fee. The client refused to pay the attorney anything, arguing that she had never agreed to retain the attorney and that she had received nothing of value from the attorney because the sales transaction was never concluded. Assume that there is no applicable statute or rule governing the formation of attorney-client relationships in the jurisdiction. If the attorney sues the client for the $500, will the attorney be likely to prevail?\n\nA. No, because even if the parties had an agreement, that agreement was discharged under the doctrine of frustration of purpose.\nB. No, because the attorney and the client never agreed on the essential terms of a contract.\nC. Yes, because the attorney took action on the client's note to his detriment.\nD. Yes, because the client's note and the attorney's performance created an implied- in-fact contract.\n"

Yes, because the client's note and the attorney's performance created an implied-in-fact contract.\n\nThe attorney is likely to prevail in suing the client for the $500 based on the concept of an implied-in-fact contract. When the client sent the attorney a note asking for legal advice on the contract of sale for her boat, she implicitly requested the attorney's professional services. The attorney responded by providing the requested service, which is considered performance on their part. An implied-in-fact contract can be formed when one party reasonably expects compensation for their services and the other party accepts those services without explicitly objecting to the terms of payment.\n\nIn this case, the attorney provided legal advice, which is a service within their expertise, and the client did not object to the potential charge for this service. Additionally, the attorney billed a reasonable fee for the work performed. Since the client did not specify any disagreement with the fee before receiving the service, it can be argued that she implicitly agreed to the attorney's standard billing practices.\n\nThe fact that the sales transaction was never concluded does not necessarily negate the attorney's right to compensation for the services they provided. The attorney's work was completed independently of the outcome of the sales transaction, and the client received the benefit of the attorney's legal opinion on the matter.\n\nTherefore, the attorney has grounds to argue that an implied-in-fact contract was formed, and they are entitled to the $500 fee for the services rendered."
