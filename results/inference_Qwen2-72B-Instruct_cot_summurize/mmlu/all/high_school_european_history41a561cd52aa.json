The young men shall go to battle; the married men shall forge arms and transport provisions; the women shall make tents and clothing and shall serve in the hospitals; the children shall turn old linen into lint; the aged shall betake themselves to the public places in order to arouse the courage of the warriors and preach the hatred of kings and the unity of the Republic. \u2026\nThe Committee of Public Safety is charged to take all necessary measures to set up without delay an extraordinary manufacture of arms of every sort which corresponds with the ardor and energy of the French people. It is, accordingly, authorized to form all the establishments, factories, workshops, and mills which shall be deemed necessary for the carrying on of these works, as well as to put in requisition, within the entire extent of the Republic, the artists and workingmen who can contribute to their success.\nThe representatives of the people sent out for the execution of the present law shall have the same authority in their respective districts, acting in concert with the Committee of Public Safety; they are invested with the unlimited powers assigned to the representatives of the people to the armies.\nThe Lev\u00e9e en Masse, August 23, 1793\nThis passage established\n\nA. the French Republic\nB. the Committee of Public Safety\nC. war against the Coalition\nD. mass conscription\n"

This is an example of mass conscription, where all able-bodied citizens are required to serve in the military or support the war effort in other capacities. The establishment of the Committee of Public Safety and the reference to war against the Coalition are also mentioned, but the primary focus of the passage is on the mobilization of the French population."
