New York City\n\nThe term \"Knickerbocker\" was originally used in the 18th century to describe Dutch settlers in the Hudson River Valley, including those in New Amsterdam (now New York City). In the early 19th century, Washington Irving popularized the term with his fictional historian Diedrich Knickerbocker in \"A History of New York.\" Since then, it has been used to refer to the people of New York City and is still occasionally used today, especially in relation to sports teams like the New York Knicks (short for Knickerbockers)."
