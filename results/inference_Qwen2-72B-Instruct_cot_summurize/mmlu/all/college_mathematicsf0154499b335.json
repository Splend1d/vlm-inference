The closure of a set A includes A itself and all its limit points. Since A is connected, it cannot be represented as the union of two disjoint non-empty open sets. When we include the limit points in the closure, these points do not introduce any new separation because they are part of the continuous structure of A. Hence, the closure of A also cannot be represented as the union of two disjoint non-empty open sets, preserving its connectedness.\n\n**Statement 2**: Every continuous function \\(f : (0, 1) \\rightarrow (0, 1)\\) has a fixed point.\n\nThis statement is **False**. While it might seem intuitive due to the intermediate value theorem, which applies to continuous functions on closed intervals, this particular statement does not hold for open intervals like (0, 1). A counterexample can easily disprove this statement. Consider the function \\(f(x) = x + \\frac{1}{2}x^2\\). This function maps from (0, 1) to (0, 1), is continuous, but has no fixed point within (0, 1) since solving \\(x = x + \\frac{1}{2}x^2\\) leads to solutions outside of (0, 1).\n\nThus, the correct answer is **B. True, False**."
