The formula is:\n\nYears to Double = 70 / Annual Growth Rate\n\nIn this case, the annual growth rate is 10%, so:\n\nYears to Double = 70 / 10 = 7 years.\n\nTherefore, if real GDP per capita grows at a rate of 10% a year, we can expect the standard of living to double in 7 years.\n\nThe correct answer is D. 7 years."
