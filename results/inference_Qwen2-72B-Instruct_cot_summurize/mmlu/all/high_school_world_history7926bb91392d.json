                    "text": "A. Nationalist movements advocating pan-Americanism\n\nThe documents provided show the establishment of two different political entities in Latin America during the early 19th century: the Republic of Colombia (Gran Colombia) and the Empire of Brazil. These were created in the aftermath of the Napoleonic Wars, when many Latin American countries sought independence from European colonial powers.\n\nThe constitution for Gran Colombia reflects the vision of Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar, a key figure in the independence movements across several South American countries. Bol\u00edvar was a proponent of pan-Americanism, a movement that sought to unite the newly independent American states under a common identity and political framework. His efforts led to the creation of Gran Colombia, which initially included present-day Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, Panama, and parts of Peru and northern Brazil.\n\nOn the other hand, the Constitution of the Empire of Brazil established a hereditary monarchy with a constitutional and representative government. This document also reflects nationalist sentiments but takes a different form than Gran Colombia. It asserts Brazil's independence and establishes a unique political structure that distinguishes it from other former Spanish colonies, which tended towards republican forms of government.\n\nBoth constitutions were products of nationalist movements in their respective regions, aiming to establish sovereign states after gaining independence from colonial rule. However, the specific mention of unity among the provinces of Venezuela and New Granada in Source 1 aligns more closely with the concept of pan-Americanism advocated by Bol\u00edvar. Thus, option A is the most accurate choice given the context provided."
