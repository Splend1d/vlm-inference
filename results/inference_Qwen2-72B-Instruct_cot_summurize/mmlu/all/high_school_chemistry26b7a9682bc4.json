These induced dipoles attract each other, creating weak intermolecular forces known as London dispersion forces. This is the correct answer.\n\nB. The three-dimensional intermolecular bonding present in all covalent substances refers to the structure of covalent compounds and not specifically to London dispersion forces.\nC. The uneven electron-to-proton ratio found on individual atoms of a molecule does not directly cause London dispersion forces; these forces are related to the distribution of electrons within the molecule as a whole rather than the specific properties of individual atoms.\nD. The electronegativity differences between the different atoms in a molecule lead to permanent dipoles, which are involved in dipole-dipole interactions, not London dispersion forces."
