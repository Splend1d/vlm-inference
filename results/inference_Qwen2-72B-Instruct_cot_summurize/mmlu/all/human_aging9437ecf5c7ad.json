Hospice\n\nHospice care is a type of care and philosophy of care that focuses on providing comfort and quality of life for people who have a terminal illness or are in the last stages of life. It typically involves a team-oriented approach that addresses the physical, emotional, social, and spiritual needs of the patient, as well as support for the family. Hospice care can be provided in various settings, including the patient's home, hospice facilities, hospitals, or nursing homes. The goal is to help patients live as fully and comfortably as possible during their remaining time, rather than focusing on curative treatments."
