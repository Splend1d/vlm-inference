An experiment, thus making cause and effect a reasonable conclusion.\n\nThe teacher has implemented a specific intervention (giving weekly practice quizzes) to see if it affects student performance (grades). By changing this variable and observing the outcome, she is conducting an experiment. The fact that all students achieved at least a C grade could suggest a positive effect of the quizzes on their performance, implying a potential cause-and-effect relationship. However, to strengthen the conclusion, the teacher would ideally compare these results to a control group that did not receive the quizzes, ensuring that any observed effects are indeed due to the intervention and not other variables."
