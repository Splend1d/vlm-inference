Two days ago, she began to feel hot, but she has not taken her temperature. Medical history is unremarkable and her only medication is an oral contraceptive. She has no history of allergies. She does not smoke cigarettes. BMI is 22 kg/m2 . Vital signs are temperature 38.1\u00b0C (100.6\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 16/min, and blood pressure 116/74 mm Hg. Physical examination discloses tenderness over the left maxillary sinus without purulent drainage. There is clear fluid behind the left tympanic membrane, enlarged tonsils bilaterally, and pain with tapping of the left upper incisors. Left frontal sinus does not transilluminate. Cardiopulmonary examination discloses no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely underlying mechanism of this patient's sinusitis?\n\nA. Eustachian tube dysfunction\nB. Mucosal edema\nC. Nasal polyps\nD. Oral contraceptive use\n"

The symptoms described, including nasal stuffiness, clear rhinorrhea, sore throat, fever, and physical exam findings such as tenderness over the left maxillary sinus, clear fluid behind the left tympanic membrane, enlarged tonsils, and pain with tapping of the left upper incisors, suggest an acute viral upper respiratory infection that has led to inflammation and swelling of the mucosa in the sinuses and nasopharynx. This can cause obstruction of the sinus ostia, leading to sinusitis. The lack of transillumination on the left frontal sinus also suggests sinus inflammation or fluid accumulation. While Eustachian tube dysfunction can contribute to sinusitis by impairing ventilation and drainage of the sinuses, it is less likely to be the primary mechanism in this case given the absence of other symptoms such as otalgia or hearing loss. Nasal polyps are typically associated with chronic sinusitis and are less common in young adults. Oral contraceptive use is not directly related to the development of sinusitis."
