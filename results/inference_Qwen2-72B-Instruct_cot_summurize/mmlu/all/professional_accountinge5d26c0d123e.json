The unemployment insurance system is administered by the states through their employment laws.\n\nThe Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA) requires employers to pay a federal tax that helps fund state workforce agencies, which administer unemployment insurance programs. However, it's important to note that the administration and eligibility criteria for unemployment benefits are determined by each individual state according to their own employment laws, not directly by the FUTA itself. Employers pay the FUTA tax, but employees do not contribute to this tax; it is a one-sided tax on employers.\n\nRegarding the other options:\nA. Whether an employee who resigns is eligible for unemployment benefits depends on the specific circumstances and state laws. Generally, voluntarily quitting without good cause makes one ineligible for benefits.\nB. The federal unemployment system is primarily funded by employer taxes under the FUTA, not by employee contributions.\nC. The Act is intended to provide temporary financial assistance to workers who have lost their jobs through no fault of their own, not necessarily those who are permanently out of work. Its purpose includes helping them maintain their standard of living while they search for new employment."
