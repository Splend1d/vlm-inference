Review of her extensive medical chart, which she has brought with her, discloses that she has a long history of varying physical symptoms. Definitive causes for these symptoms have not been found despite extensive diagnostic studies, consultations with many physicians, and several surgical explorations. She gives dramatic and exaggerated descriptions of her present and past symptoms, and she makes conflicting statements about her history. She has been hospitalized at least 23 times since age 18 years. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\n\nA. Conversion disorder\nB. Histrionic personality disorder\nC.

                    "text": "The most likely diagnosis in this case is D. Somatic Symptom Disorder. This disorder is characterized by a person experiencing significant distress or disruption in their life due to physical symptoms for which there is no adequate medical explanation. The patient's history of multiple hospitalizations, extensive diagnostic testing, and surgeries without finding a definitive cause for her symptoms, as well as her dramatic and exaggerated descriptions of her symptoms, are consistent with this diagnosis.\n\nHere are the definitions of the other options:\n\nA. Conversion disorder: A condition where a person experiences physical symptoms that affect voluntary motor or sensory functions but cannot be explained by a neurological or medical condition. The symptoms are often related to psychological stress or trauma.\n\nB. Histrionic personality disorder: A personality disorder characterized by excessive emotionality, attention-seeking behavior, and an exaggerated need for approval from others. While the patient in this case may exhibit some of these behaviors, the primary focus is on her physical symptoms and their impact on her life.\n\nC. Occult medical disorder: An underlying medical condition that is not yet diagnosed or is difficult to diagnose. While it is possible that there could be an undiagnosed medical condition causing the patient's symptoms, the extensive diagnostic testing and lack of definitive cause make this less likely than somatic symptom disorder.\n\nIn summary, the most likely diagnosis in this case is somatic symptom disorder, given the patient's history of recurrent abdominal pain, extensive medical workup without a definitive diagnosis, and dramatic and exaggerated descriptions of her symptoms."
