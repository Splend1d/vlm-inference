Random mating\n\nLinkage disequilibrium (LD) refers to the non-random association of alleles at different loci in a given population. LD can be caused by several factors, including:\n\nA. Asexual reproduction: In asexually reproducing organisms, there is no shuffling of genetic material through recombination, which helps maintain linkage disequilibrium.\n\nB. Coadapted gene complexes: When genes function together as a unit and provide a selective advantage, they tend to be inherited together, promoting linkage disequilibrium.\n\nC. Epistasis: When the effect of one gene depends on the presence of one or more \"modifier genes,\" it can lead to linkage disequilibrium because the frequency of particular allele combinations may not be what would be expected under random mating.\n\nOn the other hand, random mating tends to break down linkage disequilibrium over time because it leads to the reshuffling of alleles, making the population approach Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium where allele frequencies are independent of each other."
