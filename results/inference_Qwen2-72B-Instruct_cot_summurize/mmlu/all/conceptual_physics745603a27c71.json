However, it's important to note that A is also correct in a sense, because gravity affects the speed at which light travels through spacetime, but the phrasing \"slowed by gravity\" might not be the most accurate since the speed of light in a vacuum is constant. C is incorrect; a clock on the Sun's surface would actually run slower than one on Earth due to the stronger gravitational field near the Sun. So, the closest correct answer from the given options is B. But if considering the spirit of general relativity, a more complete answer would acknowledge aspects of both A and B."
