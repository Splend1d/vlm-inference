The man decided to surprise the friend with some fireworks, so he purchased some fireworks and hid them under his friend's chair on the friend's porch. That evening, the friend went outside to smoke and dropped his unfinished cigarette next to his chair on the porch. The cigarette ignited the fireworks, and the fireworks immediately exploded, causing extensive damage to the friend and to his cabin. The man was arrested and is being prosecuted for arson. Will the man be found guilty of arson?\n\nA. No, because the man never intended to hurt the friend.\nB. No, because the man did not intend to burn down the cabin and was not guilty of wanton and willful misconduct.\nC. Yes, because the man indirectly set fire to the friend's cabin.\nD. Yes, because the injury to the friend and to his cabin was the natural result of the man's actions.\n"

Even though the man did not intend to harm his friend or burn down the cabin, his actions in hiding fireworks under the chair created a foreseeable risk of fire. This act of recklessly creating a dangerous situation that leads to a fire can meet the legal definition of arson. Arson does not necessarily require intent to start a fire, but rather reckless disregard for safety or property. In this case, the man's decision to hide fireworks in a location where they could be accidentally ignited demonstrates a lack of regard for safety, which could lead to an arson conviction."
