Following the expansion of peace studies in the decline of the Cold War, the field has emerged as an independent and autonomous area of study that addresses issues surrounding conflict resolution, economic security and the cessation of violence at both an international and sub-national level. As a field of research, peace studies are best defined by their distinction from development studies and international relations.\nB. Peace studies are best defined by its research agenda that focuses on the search for non-violent measures by which to end conflict. Peace researchers adopt a 'top-down' approach to conflict resolution that prioritises the issues surrounding violence and the use of force, focusing on instigating agents in an attempt to secure that actor as the referent object to security.\nC. Peace studies cannot be defined as a specific academic approach due to the shifting nature of its research agenda and the diversity of interests addressed by peace researchers. However, following the Cold War the success of the field has been such that it boasts a number of research institutes and attracts global and interdisciplinary attention.\nD. Peace studies is defined by a concern with the underlying causes of phenomena in IR, a global outlook, an interdisciplinary approach, the search for non-violent transformations, an analytical and normative approach, and the adoption of multi-level analysis that links theory and practice within research.\n"

It recognizes the field's focus on understanding and addressing the root causes of conflicts and violence, its global perspective, and its interdisciplinary nature, drawing insights from various disciplines such as political science, sociology, psychology, economics, and law. The search for non-violent transformations highlights the field's commitment to finding peaceful solutions to conflicts. The analytical and normative approach suggests that peace studies not only describes and explains but also advocates for certain values and norms. Finally, the multi-level analysis indicates that peace studies examines issues at various levels, from individual to local, national, and international, linking theoretical concepts with practical applications."
