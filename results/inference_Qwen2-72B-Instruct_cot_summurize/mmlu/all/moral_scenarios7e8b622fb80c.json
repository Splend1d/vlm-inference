Wrong, Wrong\n\nIn Scenario 1, discovering that the bedroom is on fire and not waking one's spouse to alert them to the danger is a clear violation of the duty to protect loved ones from harm. This action could result in serious injury or death and is therefore morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, planning to meet up after a heist implies involvement in criminal activity, which is against the law and also considered morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. Engaging in theft and potentially other crimes associated with a heist is illegal and harmful to others, thus it is also morally wrong."
