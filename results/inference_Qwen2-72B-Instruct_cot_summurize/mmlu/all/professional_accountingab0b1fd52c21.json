                    "text": "The new time clock process is designed to reduce several types of exposure related to time theft, errors in time recording, and inaccurate accounting of hours. However, among the options given, fraudulent reporting of employees' own hours (Option A) is likely to be the least changed by this system.\n\nThe reason for this is that the system still relies on the employee to input their own hours by selecting their identification number and choosing the clock-in or clock-out button. An employee intent on committing fraud could still manipulate the system by misreporting their actual clock-in and clock-out times. The video camera may deter some employees from attempting such fraud due to the increased likelihood of being caught, but it does not eliminate the possibility entirely.\n\nIn contrast, the system would more effectively address:\n\n- Errors in employees' overtime computation (Option B), as it provides a clear record of clock-in and clock-out times that can be used to accurately calculate overtime.\n- Inaccurate accounting of employees' hours (Option C), since the system automates the recording of time and reduces manual data entry errors.\n- Recording of other employees' hours (Option D), often referred to as \"buddy punching,\" which the video camera should help prevent by providing visual evidence of who is actually using the system.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is **A. Fraudulent reporting of employees\u2019 own hours**."
