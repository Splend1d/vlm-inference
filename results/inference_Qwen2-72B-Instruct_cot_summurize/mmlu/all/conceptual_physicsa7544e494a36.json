                    "text": "The answer to this question depends on the angle of incidence and the refractive indices of water and air. When light travels from a medium with a higher refractive index (like water) to one with a lower refractive index (like air), it bends away from the normal as it crosses the boundary between the two media. The critical angle for total internal reflection occurs when the angle of incidence reaches a value where the angle of refraction would be 90 degrees, but no light actually passes into the second medium because it is bent back into the first medium.\n\nThe critical angle \\(\\theta_c\\) for total internal reflection can be calculated using Snell's Law:\n\n\\[ n_1 \\sin{\\theta_i} = n_2 \\sin{\\theta_r} \\]\n\nwhere \\(n_1\\) is the refractive index of the first medium (water in this case, approximately 1.33), \\(n_2\\) is the refractive index of the second medium (air, approximately 1.00), \\(\\theta_i\\) is the angle of incidence, and \\(\\theta_r\\) is the angle of refraction. Total internal reflection occurs when \\(\\theta_r = 90^\\circ\\).\n\nRearranging Snell's Law to solve for the critical angle:\n\n\\[ \\sin{\\theta_c} = \\frac{n_2}{n_1} \\]\n\nFor water-air interface:\n\n\\[ \\sin{\\theta_c} = \\frac{1.00}{1.33} \\approx 0.7519 \\]\n\nThus,\n\n\\[ \\theta_c = \\arcsin(0.7519) \\approx 48.6^\\circ \\]\n\nGiven that the diver's flashlight is pointed at an angle of 20\u00b0 from the normal, which means the angle of incidence is also 20\u00b0, this is significantly less than the critical angle of about 48.6\u00b0. Therefore, the light does not undergo total internal reflection.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nB. passes into the air above"
