Yes, because there was an offer for a unilateral contract that became irrevocable prior to the man's attempted revocation.\nB. Yes, under the doctrine of quasi-contract.\nC. No, because the man's revocation was effective, since the neighbor had not completed performance.\nD.

No, because the man's revocation was effective, since the neighbor had not completed performance.\n\nIn this situation, the man made an offer to pay $50 for the neighbor to mow his lawn. This offer could be accepted by the neighbor performing the act of mowing the lawn. However, before the neighbor completed the performance (i.e., finished mowing the lawn), the man revoked the offer. Since the neighbor had not fully performed the requested service at the time of revocation, the revocation was effective, and the neighbor would not be entitled to the $50 under the terms of the offer.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the offer was not yet accepted by complete performance, and thus it was still revocable. Option B is incorrect because quasi-contract does not apply here; quasi-contracts are imposed by courts to prevent unjust enrichment when no actual contract exists. In this case, there was an offer that could have led to a contract, but it was properly revoked before acceptance through full performance. Option D is partially correct but less accurate than option C; while the neighbor had prepared to accept the offer, the key point is that the revocation was effective due to the lack of completed performance."
