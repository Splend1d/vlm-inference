H3O+ and OH- is not a conjugate acid-base pair according to the Br\u00f8nsted-Lowry definition because they don't share a proton (H+) with each other. H3O+ is actually the conjugate acid of water (H2O) and OH- is the conjugate base of water.\n\nB. H3PO4 and H3PO3 is not a conjugate acid-base pair according to the Br\u00f8nsted-Lowry definition because when H3PO4 loses a proton, it becomes H2PO4-, not H3PO3. H3PO3 is a different compound.\n\nC. HC2H3O2 and C2H3O2- is a conjugate acid-base pair according to the Br\u00f8nsted-Lowry definition. When HC2H3O2 (acetic acid) loses a proton (H+), it becomes its conjugate base, C2H3O2- (acetate ion).\n\nD. SO32- and SO22- is not a conjugate acid-base pair according to the Br\u00f8nsted-Lowry definition because neither can be formed by the other losing or gaining a proton. SO32- is the conjugate base of H2SO3 (sulfurous acid), and SO22- does not exist as such; SO2 is a neutral molecule.\n  \nSo, the only Br\u00f8nsted-Lowry conjugate acid-base pair from the options provided is:\nC. HC2H3O2 (Acetic Acid) and C2H3O2- (Acetate Ion)."
