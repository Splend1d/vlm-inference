A finitely generated free abelian group can be thought of as \\(\\mathbb{Z}^n\\) for some positive integer \\(n\\). Any nonzero subgroup of \\(\\mathbb{Z}^n\\) is also free abelian, because it will be isomorphic to \\(\\mathbb{Z}^m\\) for some \\(m \\leq n\\). This is due to the structure theorem for finitely generated modules over principal ideal domains (PIDs), which includes \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\). Since \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\) is a PID, any submodule (subgroup in this case) of a finitely generated free module (free abelian group) is again a free module (free abelian group).\n\n**Statement 2:** If \\(K\\) is a nonzero subgroup of a finitely generated free abelian group, then \\(G / K\\) is free abelian.\n\nThis statement is false. The quotient group \\(G / K\\) may not be free abelian. For instance, consider the finitely generated free abelian group \\(G = \\mathbb{Z}^2\\) and let \\(K\\) be the subgroup generated by \\((2,0)\\). Then \\(G / K\\) is not free abelian; instead, it has a torsion element, specifically, the equivalence class of \\((1,0)\\) has order 2 since adding it to itself gives an element equivalent to \\((2,0)\\), which is in \\(K\\). Therefore, \\(G / K\\) contains a nontrivial torsion subgroup, making it not free abelian.\n\nSo the correct answer is **C. True, False**."
