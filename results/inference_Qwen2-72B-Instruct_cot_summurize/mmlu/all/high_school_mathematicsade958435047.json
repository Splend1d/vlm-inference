                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to understand how the functions $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ behave when applied in sequence and alternating with each other.\n\nGiven:\n\\[f(x) = \\frac{1 + x}{1 - x}\\]\n\\[g(x) = \\frac{-2}{x + 1}\\]\n\nLet's start by applying $f(x)$ to $12$:\n\\[f(12) = \\frac{1 + 12}{1 - 12} = \\frac{13}{-11} = -\\frac{13}{11}\\]\n\nNow, apply $g(x)$ to $f(12)$:\n\\[g(-\\frac{13}{11}) = \\frac{-2}{-\\frac{13}{11} + 1} = \\frac{-2}{-\\frac{13}{11} + \\frac{11}{11}} = \\frac{-2}{-\\frac{2}{11}} = 11\\]\n\nNext, apply $f(x)$ again:\n\\[f(11) = \\frac{1 + 11}{1 - 11} = \\frac{12}{-10} = -\\frac{6}{5}\\]\n\nAnd then $g(x)$:\n\\[g(-\\frac{6}{5}) = \\frac{-2}{-\\frac{6}{5} + 1} = \\frac{-2}{-\\frac{6}{5} + \\frac{5}{5}} = \\frac{-2}{-\\frac{1}{5}} = 10\\]\n\nNotice that we started with $12$, went through some transformations, and ended up with $10$. This process seems to be reducing the number by $2$ at every $2$ steps (i.e., after applying $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ once each).\n\nIf we continue this pattern, applying $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ eight times each, we should see a reduction of $2$ for every pair of applications, for a total of $8$ pairs.\n\nStarting from $12$:\n1. After the first pair, we get $10$.\n2. After the second pair, we get $8$.\n3. After the third pair, we get $6$.\n4. After the fourth pair, we get $4$.\n5. After the fifth pair, we get $2$.\n6. After the sixth pair, we get $0$.\n7. After the seventh pair, we get $-2$.\n8. After the eighth pair, we get $-4$.\n\nHowever, we are only interested in the final result of applying these functions, not the intermediate results. Since we know that the value decreases by $2$ for each pair of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ applications, starting from $12$, after $8$ pairs (which is $16$ applications), the value will have been reduced by $16$ (since $8 \\times 2 = 16$). Therefore, the final value will be $12 - 16 = -4$.\n\nNone of the given options (A. 12, B. 8, C. 4, D. 0) match our calculated answer of $-4$. However, based on the provided options and the logic applied, the closest answer would be:\n\nD. 0\n\nBut this implies that the correct option was not listed among the choices provided. The correct answer, based on our calculations, is $-4$, which is not an option."
