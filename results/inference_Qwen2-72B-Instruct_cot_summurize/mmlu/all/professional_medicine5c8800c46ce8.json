                    "text": "The correct answer is D. Increased peripheral vascular resistance.\n\nIncreased peripheral vascular resistance can lead to an increase in blood pressure. Peripheral vascular resistance is the resistance offered by the systemic arterial vasculature to the flow of blood. Factors that can increase peripheral vascular resistance include vasoconstriction (narrowing of the blood vessels) due to sympathetic nervous system activation, release of vasoactive substances like endothelin or angiotensin II, or an increase in blood viscosity. In the case of this 55-year-old man with hypertension, increased peripheral vascular resistance could contribute to his elevated blood pressure. \n\nDecreased cardiac output (option A), decreased pulse (option B), and decreased stroke volume (option C) would all tend to decrease blood pressure rather than increase it."
