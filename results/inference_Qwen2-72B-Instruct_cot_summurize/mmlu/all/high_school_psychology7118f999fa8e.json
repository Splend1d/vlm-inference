The neural connections to the primary visual cortex are not fully connected.\n\nIn newborns, many neural connections, including those related to vision, are still developing. The brain's visual system continues to mature after birth, and the connections between the eyes and the primary visual cortex become stronger and more refined over time. This process, known as neural plasticity, allows for the development of better visual acuity as the baby grows."
