By setting a price floor above the equilibrium price, the government can ensure that sellers receive a higher price for their goods than they would in a free market. This can be beneficial for sellers who might otherwise be forced to sell their goods at lower prices due to competition or other market forces. However, it can also lead to a surplus of the good if the price floor is set too high, as buyers may be unwilling to pay the higher price."
