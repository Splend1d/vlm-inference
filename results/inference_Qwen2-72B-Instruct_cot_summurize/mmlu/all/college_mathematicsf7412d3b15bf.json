                    "text": "To find the equation of the torus formed by revolving the circle \\(C: (y-3)^2 + z^2 = 1\\) around the z-axis, we need to understand how the coordinates transform during such a revolution.\n\nThe given circle lies in the yz-plane with its center at (0, 3, 0) and radius 1. When this circle is revolved around the z-axis, the distance from any point on the circle to the z-axis remains constant. This distance corresponds to the radius of the small circle that makes up the cross-section of the torus. \n\nLet's consider a point \\((x', y', z')\\) on the original circle before the revolution. After revolution around the z-axis, this point will have coordinates \\((x, y, z)\\). The distance from the center of the original circle to the z-axis is the radius of the large circle forming the torus, which is 3 (the y-coordinate of the center).\n\nTo find the new coordinates after the revolution, we use cylindrical coordinates where the x and y coordinates are expressed in terms of radius (\\(r\\)) and angle (\\(\\theta\\)). Since the revolution is around the z-axis, the z coordinate remains unchanged.\n\nBefore the revolution:\n\\[ (y-3)^2 + z^2 = 1 \\]\n\nAfter the revolution, let's express the coordinates using cylindrical coordinates. Let \\(r\\) represent the distance from the z-axis to the point on the torus, and let \\(\\theta\\) represent the angle of rotation around the z-axis. Then, the coordinates can be expressed as:\n\\[ x = r\\cos{\\theta}, \\quad y = r\\sin{\\theta} + 3, \\quad z = z \\]\n\nHowever, for our purposes, it's more convenient to keep the Cartesian coordinates. We note that the distance from the center of the torus (which is along the z-axis) to any point on the torus is constant. This distance is the sum of the radius of the large circle (3) and the radius of the small circle (1), which is 4 units. Therefore, if we consider a point on the torus, the distance from this point to the z-axis is the radius of the small circle, which is 1 unit away from the center of the torus.\n\nWe can express this using the equation of a sphere centered at (0, 3, 0) with radius 4:\n\\[ (x-0)^2 + (y-3)^2 + (z-0)^2 = 4^2 \\]\n\\[ x^2 + (y-3)^2 + z^2 = 16 \\]\n\nNow, since we want the equation of the torus, not the sphere, we need to account for the fact that the radius of the small circle (1) changes depending on the angle around the z-axis. This means the distance squared from any point on the torus to the z-axis is \\((x^2 + y^2)\\). Substituting this into our equation gives us:\n\\[ (x^2 + y^2) + (y-3)^2 + z^2 = 16 \\]\n\nRearranging terms:\n\\[ x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + (y-3)^2 = 16 \\]\n\nExpanding the squared term:\n\\[ x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + y^2 - 6y + 9 = 16 \\]\n\\[ x^2 + 2y^2 + z^2 - 6y - 7 = 0 \\]\n\nThis doesn't match directly with any of the options provided, but we're aiming to match the structure of the options rather than the exact form. We see that the equation is related to the structure of option A, but we need to manipulate it further to match one of the options exactly.\n\nConsidering the options:\n\nA. \\(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 8 = 6y\\)\n\nRearranging:\n\\[ x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 6y + 8 = 0 \\]\n\nAdding 1 to both sides to complete the square:\n\\[ x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 6y + 9 = 1 \\]\n\\[ x^2 + (y-3)^2 + z^2 = 1 \\]\n\nThis matches the initial equation of the circle before revolution, but we need to account for the expansion due to the revolution. Comparing with our derived equation, we see that option A does not fully match.\n\nB. \\((x^2 + y^2 + z^2)^2 = 8 + 36(x^2 + z^2)\\)\n\nThis option involves squaring the left side, which doesn't align with our derivation.\n\nC. \\((x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 8)^2 = 36(x^2 + z^2)\\)\n\nLet's expand the left side and compare:\n\\[ (x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 8)^2 = 36(x^2 + z^2) \\]\n\nExpanding the left side would involve terms that include \\(y^4\\), \\(x^4\\), and \\(z^4\\), which are not present in our derived equation. However, the structure of this equation is more in line with what we expect for a torus equation, considering the terms \\(x^2 + z^2\\) and the squared term on the left.\n\nD. \\((x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 8)^2 = 36(x^2 + y^2)\\)\n\nThis option has a similar structure to C but uses \\(x^2 + y^2\\) instead of \\(x^2 + z^2\\), which doesn't fit the expected behavior of a torus.\n\nGiven the options, the closest match to our derived equation and the expected form of a torus equation is **Option C**:\n\\[(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 8)^2 = 36(x^2 + z^2)\\]"
