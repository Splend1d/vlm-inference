Although it might be seen as rude or ungrateful not to tip, bartenders and servers do not have a moral obligation to continue serving someone who doesn't tip; they can refuse service for various reasons, including non-payment or lack of tips.\n\nIn Scenario 2, however, intentionally adding spicy chili powder to someone's food without their consent, especially when it could cause discomfort or harm, is considered morally wrong. This action disregards the well-being and autonomy of the person eating the cake."
