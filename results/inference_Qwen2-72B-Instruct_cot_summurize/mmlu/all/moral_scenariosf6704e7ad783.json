Wrong, Wrong\n\nIn Scenario 1, the main character is in a romantic relationship with two people simultaneously without their knowledge or consent, which is considered morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. This action can be seen as deceitful and disrespectful to both his girlfriend and his wife.\n\nIn Scenario 2, copying and pasting content from sources found on the internet without proper citation or attribution is also considered morally wrong. This is because it constitutes plagiarism, which is a violation of academic integrity and intellectual property rights. Plagiarism is generally frowned upon in academic and professional settings and is against ethical standards. However, if the main character cited the sources properly and used the information as part of a research paper, then it would not be considered morally wrong. Since the scenario does not specify whether citations were included, we must assume the worst-case scenario based on the wording provided."
