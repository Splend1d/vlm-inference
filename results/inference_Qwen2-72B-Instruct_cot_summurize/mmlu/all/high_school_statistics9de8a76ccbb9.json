The formula for the union of two sets is P(A \u222a B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \u2229 B). Since P(A \u2229 B) = 0, we have P(A \u222a B) = P(A) + P(B) = 0.3 + 0.2 = 0.5.\n\n2. If A and B are independent, then P(A \u2229 B) = P(A) * P(B). We can use the same formula for the union: P(A \u222a B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \u2229 B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A) * P(B) = 0.3 + 0.2 - 0.3 * 0.2 = 0.5 - 0.06 = 0.44.\n\n3. If B is a subset of A, this means that all elements of B are also in A, so any event in B happening is also an event of A happening. In this case, the union of A and B is just A, because B adds no new events. Therefore, P(A \u222a B) = P(A) = 0.3.\n\nThe correct answer is B. 0.5, 0.44, 0.3."
