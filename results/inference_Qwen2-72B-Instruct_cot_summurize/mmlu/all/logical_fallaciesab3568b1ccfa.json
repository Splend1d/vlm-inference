Fallacy of interrogation\n\nHowever, this is not a standard term in logical fallacies. The fallacy of complex question is more accurately described as a type of fallacy where someone asks a question that presupposes something that has not been proven or accepted by all the people involved. This forces the person answering the question into a false dilemma of either accepting the unproven presupposition or rejecting the question's premise entirely.\n\nNone of the other options (B, C, D) directly refer to the fallacy of complex question:\n- B. Compound proposition refers to a statement made up of two or more propositions.\n- C. Appeal to ignorance is an argument that assumes something to be true because it hasn't been proven false (or vice versa).\n- D. Extension typically refers to the scope or range of application of a concept or rule, and does not specifically describe a logical fallacy."
