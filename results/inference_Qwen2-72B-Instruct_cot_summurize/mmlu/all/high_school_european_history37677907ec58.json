                    "text": "D. Social Darwinism\n\nHerbert Spencer's views as presented in the passage align most closely with Social Darwinism. This philosophy applies the concept of \"survival of the fittest,\" originally developed by Charles Darwin for biological evolution, to human societies. According to Social Darwinists like Spencer, the natural order includes competition and struggle, which results in the survival of the strongest or most capable individuals. This is evident in Spencer's statement that the \"poverty of the incapable, the distresses that come upon the imprudent, the starvation of the idle\" are part of a \"large, farseeing benevolence,\" implying that such hardships serve a greater good by ensuring the survival and dominance of the fit and capable.\n\nSpencer argues against government intervention in alleviating poverty or providing relief to the poor, as he believes it would interfere with the natural order and the process of natural selection. He maintains that governments should only protect individual freedoms and not ensure people's satisfaction or well-being. This stance reflects the laissez-faire capitalism often associated with Social Darwinism, where minimal government intervention in economic and social affairs is preferred to allow for the free play of market forces and individual competition.\n\nThe other options\u2014Utopian socialism, social conservatism, and Romanticism\u2014do not accurately reflect Spencer's views as presented in the passage:\n\nA. Utopian socialism advocates for a society based on cooperation and communal ownership rather than competition and individualism. This is in direct contrast to Spencer's support for a competitive society where the strong naturally prevail over the weak.\n\nB. Social conservatism typically emphasizes the maintenance of traditional values and institutions. While Spencer's views might seem conservative in terms of his opposition to government intervention, his overall philosophy is more aligned with Social Darwinism, which was a distinct and somewhat controversial perspective during the Victorian era.\n\nC. Romanticism is an artistic, literary, and intellectual movement that emphasizes emotion, individualism, and the glorification of nature. It does not align with Spencer's utilitarian and scientifically oriented approach to social issues.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Social Darwinism."
