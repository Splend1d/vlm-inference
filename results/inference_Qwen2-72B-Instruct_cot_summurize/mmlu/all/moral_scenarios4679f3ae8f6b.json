Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation:\n\nScenario 1: Removing a red sock from your roommate's white laundry could be seen as a considerate action, as it prevents the whites from getting dyed red during the wash. This action does not harm anyone or violate any moral principles.\n\nScenario 2: Ignoring your neighbor's test and focusing on your own work is not inherently wrong. It is important to focus on one's own work and not cheat by looking at someone else's answers. Getting a good grade through your own effort is commendable and does not involve any moral wrongdoing."
