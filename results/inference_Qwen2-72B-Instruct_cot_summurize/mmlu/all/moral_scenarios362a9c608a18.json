In Scenario 1, wearing black at a funeral is a culturally accepted way to show respect for the deceased and their family. In Scenario 2, agreeing with your daughter about her insecurities might not be considered supportive or helpful, but it does not necessarily constitute a morally wrong action. However, it could be seen as an opportunity missed to provide encouragement and positive reinforcement to the daughter. Still, it doesn't cross the line into being clearly morally wrong according to societal norms."
