He has no history of similar symptoms. He has hypertension treated with hydrochlorothiazide. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 30 years. His pulse is 110/min, respirations are 24/min, and blood pressure is 110/50 mm Hg. A grade 3/6, diastolic blowing murmur is heard over the left sternal border and radiates to the right sternal border. Femoral pulses are decreased bilaterally. An ECG shows left ventricular hypertrophy. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\n\nA. Acute myocardial infarction\nB. Aortic dissection\nC. Esophageal rupture\nD. Mitral valve prolapse\n"

The patient's symptoms of sudden onset of shortness of breath, severe chest pain, and sweating along with his risk factors of hypertension and smoking, and the physical examination findings of a diastolic murmur that radiates to the right sternal border, decreased femoral pulses bilaterally, and an ECG showing left ventricular hypertrophy are all consistent with aortic dissection. This is a medical emergency that requires immediate attention as it can be life-threatening. Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) would also present with chest pain and ECG changes but it would not explain the diastolic murmur or decreased femoral pulses. Esophageal rupture and mitral valve prolapse would not present with these symptoms and signs."
