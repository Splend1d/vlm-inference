The immunophenotyping showing B-cell origin further supports this diagnosis.\n\nAcute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) and acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) usually present with less mature cells and can occur at any age, but are more common in children and younger adults for ALL and older adults for AML. They also tend to present with more severe symptoms and signs of bone marrow failure.\n\nChronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) would typically show a left shift on the differential with increased numbers of myeloid precursors and fewer mature lymphocytes."
