Io did have impact craters but they have all been buried in lava flows.\n\nIo, one of Jupiter's moons, has a very active volcanic system due to the intense gravitational forces exerted by Jupiter and other nearby moons. These forces cause tidal heating within Io's interior, leading to widespread volcanic activity. As a result, the surface of Io is constantly being resurfaced with new lava flows, which bury any existing impact craters. This ongoing geological activity means that Io's surface appears relatively young and smooth, without the heavily cratered appearance typical of many other moons and planets in our solar system."
