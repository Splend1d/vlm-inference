The thermal equilibrium polarization \\( p_{eq} \\) for a nucleus with a gyromagnetic ratio \\( \\gamma \\) in a magnetic field \\( B_0 \\) at temperature \\( T \\) is given by:\n\n\\[ p_{eq} = \\frac{\\hbar \\gamma B_0}{k_B T} \\]\n\nwhere \\( \\hbar \\) is the reduced Planck constant (\\( \\approx 1.0545718 \\times 10^{-34} \\, \\text{J}\\cdot\\text{s} \\)), \\( k_B \\) is the Boltzmann constant (\\( \\approx 1.38064852 \\times 10^{-23} \\, \\text{J}/\\text{K} \\)), and \\( T \\) is the absolute temperature.\n\nFor a 13C nucleus, the gyromagnetic ratio \\( \\gamma \\) is \\( \\approx 6.728 \\times 10^7 \\, \\text{rad}\\cdot\\text{s}^{-1}\\cdot\\text{T}^{-1} \\).\n\nHowever, the exact calculation of \\( p_{eq} \\) isn't necessary since we're asked to find the time when \\( p(t) \\) is twice \\( p_{eq} \\). Let's denote \\( 2p_{eq} \\) as \\( p_f \\) for simplicity. We then have:\n\n\\[ p_f = 2p_{eq} = [1 - p_{eq}]e^{-\\frac{t}{T_1}} + p_{eq} \\]\n\nSince we want \\( p(t) = p_f \\), we substitute \\( p_f \\) into the equation and solve for \\( t \\):\n\n\\[ 2p_{eq} = [1 - p_{eq}]e^{-\\frac{t}{T_1}} + p_{eq} \\]\n\n\\[ 2p_{eq} - p_{eq} = [1 - p_{eq}]e^{-\\frac{t}{T_1}} \\]\n\n\\[ p_{eq} = [1 - p_{eq}]e^{-\\frac{t}{T_1}} \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{p_{eq}}{1 - p_{eq}} = e^{-\\frac{t}{T_1}} \\]\n\nTaking natural logarithm on both sides:\n\n\\[ \\ln\\left(\\frac{p_{eq}}{1 - p_{eq}}\\right) = -\\frac{t}{T_1} \\]\n\n\\[ t = -T_1 \\ln\\left(\\frac{p_{eq}}{1 - p_{eq}}\\right) \\]\n\nNow, without the exact numerical value of \\( p_{eq} \\), we can still see that what we really care about is the ratio \\( \\frac{p_{eq}}{1 - p_{eq}} \\) which represents the polarization increase from thermal equilibrium to twice its value.\n\nHowever, we know that at \\( t = T_1 \\), \\( p(t) = \\frac{1}{e} \\approx 0.368 \\) of its initial value, and we are looking for the time it takes to decay from 1 to twice \\( p_{eq} \\). \n\nLet's plug in \\( p_{eq} \\) as \\( x \\) for simplicity:\n\n\\[ t = -5.0 \\ln\\left(\\frac{x}{1-x}\\right) \\]\n\nWe are looking for the condition where \\( p(t) = 2x \\). From the original equation:\n\n\\[ 2x = [1 - x]e^{-\\frac{t}{5.0}} + x \\]\n\nSolving for \\( t \\) directly from the options given would require us to have an exact value for \\( x \\). However, since the question asks for the time it takes for \\( p \\) to reach a value equal to twice the thermal equilibrium polarization, and without the actual value of \\( p_{eq} \\), we can approach this problem conceptually.\n\nGiven the exponential decay nature of the relaxation process, we know that it will take longer than one \\( T_1 \\) period but less than infinity to reach any fraction above the thermal equilibrium value. Looking at the answer choices:\n\n- A. This is not an option.\n- B. 72.0 s\n- C. 56.6 s\n- D. 12.7 s\n\nOption D seems too short considering that \\( T_1 = 5.0 \\, \\text{s} \\) and it would take more than one \\( T_1 \\) period to relax to twice the thermal equilibrium polarization. Option B seems too long given the context. Option C seems like a reasonable choice given that it's significantly more than one \\( T_1 \\) period but not excessively long.\n\nTherefore, without further calculations, based on the nature of exponential decay and the given options, the most reasonable choice is:\n\n**C. 56.6 s**"
