When the crane was manufactured, some of the welding of its parts was done improperly. No one had ever noticed this manufacturing defect in the crane. The defect caused the crane to break and topple over. Part of the crane fell on the doctor's car. The doctor's car was completely destroyed. The car was valued at $35,000. The doctor had auto insurance, and the insurance company promptly paid the doctor $35,000 under the insurance policy. If the doctor brings suit against the manufacturer of the crane, will the doctor prevail?\n\nA. No, because the doctor had auto insurance, so she suffered no loss.\nB. No, because the manufacturer was unaware of the defect in the crane.\nC. Yes, because the manufacturer sold a product with a dangerous defect.\nD. Yes, because the manufacturer failed to inspect the crane adequately before selling it.\n"

Yes, because the manufacturer sold a product with a dangerous defect.\n\nIn product liability law, manufacturers can be held liable for injuries or damages caused by defective products that they produce. In this case, the crane had a manufacturing defect that led to its collapse and subsequent damage to the doctor's car. Even though the manufacturer was unaware of the defect, they are still responsible for ensuring the safety of their products. The fact that the doctor had insurance does not absolve the manufacturer of responsibility for the damage caused by their defective product. The insurance payment simply compensates the doctor for her loss, but the manufacturer may still be held liable for producing a defective product that caused the damage in the first place."
