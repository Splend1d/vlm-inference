Steroid hormones are derived from cholesterol, which has a structure containing four hydrocarbon rings. They can pass through the cell membrane and bind to receptors inside the cell or nucleus, influencing gene expression and thus potentially increasing the amount of nucleic acid in the cell as part of their function. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Steroid"
