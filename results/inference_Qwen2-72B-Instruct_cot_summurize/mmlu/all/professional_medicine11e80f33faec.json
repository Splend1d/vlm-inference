He denies any trauma but reports that he had been doing a lot of painting over the past week. He denies any radicular pain or numbness. Cervical range of motion is moderately limited in all fields. He is treated with articulatory springing technique.

This is because such a technique can potentially lead to vertebral artery dissection, which can cause symptoms such as confusion, nausea, and vertigo. It is important to note that liability may also depend on other factors, such as whether the physician obtained informed consent and whether the treatment was appropriate given the patient's medical history and presenting symptoms."
