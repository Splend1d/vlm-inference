In fact, it's fulfilling one's duty as an educator to accurately assess and reward academic achievement.\n\nIn scenario 2, lying to protect someone from harm, especially in historical contexts like the Holocaust where lives were at stake, is generally not considered morally wrong. On the contrary, it can be seen as a brave and morally justifiable act to save a life or prevent harm."
