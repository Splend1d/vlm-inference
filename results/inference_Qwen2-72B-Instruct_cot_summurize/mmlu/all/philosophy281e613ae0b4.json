The first question seeks to clarify definitions and understandings of terms and ideas, while the second question explores the justification and evidence for claims or beliefs.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that all four pairs of questions you've listed are relevant to philosophical inquiry:\n\nA. \"Why should we bother?\" and \"What are the consequences of our believing one thing over another?\" These questions touch on the motivation for philosophical investigation and the practical implications of different beliefs.\n\nC. \"Who really believes X?\" and \"How can we explain differences in people's beliefs?\" These questions delve into the sociological and psychological aspects of belief and the reasons behind varying perspectives.\n\nD. \"How do philosophers argue?\" and \"Are their differences important?\" These questions focus on the methodology and significance of philosophical debate and discourse.\n\nNonetheless, the core of philosophical inquiry often revolves around understanding meaning and justifying beliefs, making option B the most direct summary of philosophical investigation."
