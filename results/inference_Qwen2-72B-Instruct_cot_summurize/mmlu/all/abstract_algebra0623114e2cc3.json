These properties include the existence of an additive identity (usually denoted as 0), an additive inverse for every element, an associative law for addition, a commutative law for addition, a multiplicative identity (usually denoted as 1), a multiplicative inverse for every non-zero element, an associative law for multiplication, a commutative law for multiplication, and the distributive law of multiplication over addition. Therefore, every field is indeed a ring, since it satisfies all the requirements to be a ring (a set with two operations that satisfy the associative laws for addition and multiplication, the distributive laws, and the existence of an additive identity and additive inverses).\n\nHowever, not every ring has a multiplicative identity. A ring can be defined without requiring the existence of a multiplicative identity. If a ring does have a multiplicative identity, it is called a \"ring with unity\" or a \"unital ring\". Rings without a multiplicative identity are known as \"rngs\" (pronounced \"rungs\"). \n\nSo, Statement 1 is true, and Statement 2 is false. The answer is C. True, False."
