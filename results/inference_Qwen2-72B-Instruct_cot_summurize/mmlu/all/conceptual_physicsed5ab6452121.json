So, the correct answer is A. heats water. However, it's important to note that the primary purpose is to generate electricity, but this is done indirectly through a series of steps starting with heating water.\n\nRegarding the other options:\nB. generates electricity directly - This is not accurate, as the process is indirect.\nC. gets energy from nothing - This is false, as the energy comes from the fission of atomic nuclei.\nD. is a major polluter of the atmosphere - This is not entirely true, as nuclear reactors do not emit greenhouse gases or air pollutants during operation. However, they do produce radioactive waste, which poses its own environmental challenges."
