Eating a candy cane when one is in the mood for something sweet is not morally wrong. Similarly, telling someone to run while holding scissors might be ill-advised due to safety concerns, but it does not inherently constitute a morally wrong action unless there were malicious intentions or foreseeable harm that could have been prevented. However, standard advice would be to avoid running with sharp objects to prevent accidents."
