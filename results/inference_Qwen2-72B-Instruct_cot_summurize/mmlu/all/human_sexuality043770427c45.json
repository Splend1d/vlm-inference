However, the truth is that there is no scientific evidence to suggest that any particular sexual position significantly increases the chances of conception. The timing of intercourse in relation to ovulation is much more important than the position of intercourse. It's also important to note that conception can occur in any position where semen is deposited near the cervix. Ultimately, the best position for conception is one that both partners find comfortable and enjoyable."
