Capitalized and depreciated over its estimated useful life.\n\nAccording to accounting standards, equipment used in research and development (R&D) that has alternative future uses should be treated as a capital asset. This means that the cost of the equipment should be capitalized on the balance sheet and then depreciated over its estimated useful life, which may extend beyond the duration of the R&D project. This approach ensures that the expense is recognized over the period during which the asset is expected to generate economic benefits for the company."
