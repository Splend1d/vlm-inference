The adaptive metabolic demand means that the slope of N-balance studies underestimates the efficiency of protein utilization.\n\nExplanation: Adaptive metabolic demand refers to the body's ability to adjust its metabolism based on nutrient availability and other physiological needs. When protein intake is low, the body becomes more efficient at utilizing the available protein, which can result in a lower nitrogen (N) excretion than would be expected based on a linear relationship between protein intake and N excretion. This adaptive response can lead to an underestimation of the true protein requirement if the efficiency of protein utilization is not properly accounted for in N-balance studies. Thus, the slope of N-balance studies may underestimate the efficiency of protein utilization due to this adaptive response."
