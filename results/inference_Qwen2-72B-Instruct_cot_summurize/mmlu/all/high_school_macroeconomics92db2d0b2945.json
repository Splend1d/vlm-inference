The short-run Phillips curve is downward sloping, showing an inverse relationship between unemployment and inflation, while the long-run Phillips curve is vertical, indicating that there is no trade-off between inflation and unemployment in the long run. This is because workers and firms adjust their expectations about inflation over time, and as they do so, the short-run trade-off between inflation and unemployment disappears."
