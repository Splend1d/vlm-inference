The value placed on the owner's skills in an alternative career\n\nAn implicit cost, also known as an imputed or notional cost, is a non-cash expense that represents the opportunity cost of a company's own resources. In this case, the value placed on the owner's skills in an alternative career is an implicit cost because it represents the income the owner could earn if they used their skills in another job instead of running the store. This is a cost that does not involve an actual cash transaction but is still relevant when considering the total economic costs of operating the business."
