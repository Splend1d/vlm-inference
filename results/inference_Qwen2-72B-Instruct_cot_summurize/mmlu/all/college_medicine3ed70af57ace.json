                    "text": "The correct answer is C. failure of the ATP supply to match the demand.\n\nIn high-intensity exercises, such as sprinting or heavy weightlifting, muscles require a lot of energy very quickly. This energy is provided by the breakdown of ATP (adenosine triphosphate). However, the body's stores of ATP are limited and must be rapidly replenished during exercise to maintain performance.\n\nUnder conditions of high-intensity exercise, the demand for ATP can exceed the rate at which it can be supplied through aerobic metabolism (which requires oxygen). As a result, the body resorts to anaerobic metabolism, primarily through glycolysis, to produce ATP more quickly but less efficiently. This process leads to the accumulation of byproducts like lactic acid, which can contribute to muscle fatigue.\n\nAdditionally, as ATP is consumed, its levels may drop, leading to a decrease in the availability of phosphocreatine (PCr), a molecule that helps regenerate ATP quickly in muscle cells. The depletion of PCr further contributes to the failure of the ATP supply to meet the high demands of intense exercise, ultimately resulting in fatigue."
