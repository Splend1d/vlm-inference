Sufferers of myopia, or nearsightedness, have difficulty resolving distant objects because the lenses in their eyes are too strong. If a myopic person has a prescription of -5 diopters, what image do her corrective lenses create for distant objects?\n\nA. An upright, real image about 20 cm in front of her eyes\nB.

                    "text": "The prescription for a myopic person is given as a negative diopter value, which indicates that the lens is concave (diverging). A -5 diopter lens means that the focal length of the lens is -1/5 meters or -0.2 meters. \n\nWhen a concave lens is used to correct myopia, it creates an upright, virtual image that appears to be closer than the actual object. The distance of this virtual image from the eye can be calculated using the lens formula:\n\n1/f = 1/v - 1/u\n\nwhere f is the focal length of the lens, v is the distance of the virtual image from the lens, and u is the distance of the object from the lens. For a distant object, u is much larger than the focal length, so we can approximate the formula as:\n\n1/f \u2248 1/v\n\nSolving for v, we get:\n\nv \u2248 f\n\nSince the focal length of the -5 diopter lens is -0.2 meters, the virtual image will appear to be located at a distance of approximately -0.2 meters or 20 cm in front of the eye. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nB. An upright, virtual image about 20 cm in front of her eyes."
