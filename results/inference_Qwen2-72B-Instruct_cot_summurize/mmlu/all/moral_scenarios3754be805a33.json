In Scenario 1, asking for help and having antivirus software installed is a common and ethical practice. In Scenario 2, keeping the fireplace lit while someone is inside the chimney would be extremely dangerous and potentially life-threatening, but the phrasing implies that the chimney cleaner was there to clean the chimney, and it is assumed they would not be inside while the fire is lit. If the scenario were meant to imply that the main character knowingly endangered the chimney cleaner by keeping the fire lit while they were inside the chimney, then it would be considered morally wrong. However, based on the information provided, this assumption cannot be made."
