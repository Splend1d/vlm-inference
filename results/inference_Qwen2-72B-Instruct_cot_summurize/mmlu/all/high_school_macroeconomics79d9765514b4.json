Saving is equal to zero when consumption equals disposable income.\n\nExplanation:\n\nIn a private closed economy, there are no government or foreign sectors involved. The economy consists of only households and businesses. The basic equation for this type of economy is:\nDisposable Income (Yd) = Consumption (C) + Savings (S)\n\nWhen consumption equals disposable income (C = Yd), it means that households are spending all their income on consumption and not saving any of it. This implies that savings (S) are equal to zero.\n\nLet's discuss why the other options are incorrect:\n\nA. Household saving can never be negative: This statement is false because households can have negative savings if they spend more than their disposable income, which could occur through borrowing or using past savings.\n\nB. Investment is always greater than savings: This statement is false because in equilibrium, investment must equal savings (I=S). If investment were always greater than savings, it would imply a continuous increase in aggregate demand, leading to inflation or unsustainable economic growth.\n\nC. The economy is in equilibrium when consumption equals saving: This statement is false because equilibrium in a private closed economy occurs when total savings equal total investment (S=I). Consumption does not need to equal savings for the economy to be in equilibrium."
