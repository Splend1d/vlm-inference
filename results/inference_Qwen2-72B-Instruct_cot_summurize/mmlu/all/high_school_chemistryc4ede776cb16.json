Rate = k[A]^2.\n\nWhen dealing with reaction kinetics, the shape of the plot of concentration vs. time can help determine the order of the reaction. If the graph of [A] vs. time is curved, this does not provide enough information by itself to determine the order, but it does tell us that the concentration of A is not changing linearly with time, which would be expected for a zeroth-order reaction.\n\nHowever, when you take the natural logarithm of [A] (ln[A]) and plot it against time, if the result is a straight line, this indicates a first-order reaction. Since in your case, the ln[A] vs. time plot is curved, this rules out first-order behavior.\n\nWhen plotting 1/[A] vs. time results in a straight line, this indicates a second-order reaction. For a second-order reaction, the rate law is given by:\n\n\\[ \\text{Rate} = k[A]^2 \\]\n\nThis is because the integrated rate law for a second-order reaction is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{[A]} = kt + \\frac{1}{[A]_0} \\]\n\nWhere \\(k\\) is the rate constant, \\(t\\) is time, and \\([A]_0\\) is the initial concentration of A. When plotted as \\(1/[A]\\) vs. \\(t\\), the slope of the line will equal \\(k\\)."
