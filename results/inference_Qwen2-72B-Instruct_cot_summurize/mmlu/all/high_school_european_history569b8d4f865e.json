He believes that enforcing the fundamental law and ensuring freedom is enough, and that providing satisfaction or relief to the poor through taxation reverses the proper function of the state. He further suggests that hardships such as poverty and distress serve a larger purpose in the context of universal humanity, implying that they are part of a natural order that benefits society as a whole."
