The sum of the angles in a triangle can be more than 180\u00b0 in certain non-Euclidean geometries, such as those that apply to curved spaces.\n\nHowever, if we are talking about a triangle embedded in a four-dimensional Euclidean space (with no curvature), then the angles of the triangle would still add up to 180\u00b0, just as they would in three dimensions or on a flat plane within any number of dimensions. This is because the triangle itself is a two-dimensional object, and its properties are not affected by the additional dimensions beyond the plane it lies in.\n\nSo, in the context of four-dimensional Euclidean space, the correct answer would be:\n\nA. always.\n\nBut if you're considering non-Euclidean geometries that might apply in four dimensions (or any dimension), then the angles of a triangle could indeed add up to more than 180\u00b0, and the answer would be:\n\nB. sometimes.\n\nGiven the question's focus on four-dimensional geometry without specifying whether it's Euclidean or non-Euclidean, the most accurate answer in a mathematical sense is:\n\nB. sometimes."
