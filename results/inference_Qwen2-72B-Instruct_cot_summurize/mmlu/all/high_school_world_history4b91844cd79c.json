The [Muslims] are exceedingly numerous here. This whole city is surrounded by a wall: each of the six [districts of Hangzhou] is also surrounded by a wall.

The Mongol administration of its Russian domains relied heavily on tribute from the Russian principalities, while the Mongol administration in China emulated a centralized Chinese bureaucratic state. In Russia, the Mongols imposed heavy taxes and levies on the local population and rulers, whereas in China, they adopted many aspects of the existing Chinese administrative system, including the civil service examination system for selecting officials. This allowed the Mongols to integrate more smoothly into Chinese society and maintain control over a large and diverse empire."
