The two are generally autonomous, although federal courts may rule on the constitutionality of state court decisions.\n\nThis option best describes the relationship between the federal and state judiciaries. While they are largely independent systems, there are circumstances under which federal courts can review state court decisions, particularly when there is a question regarding the Constitution or federal law. However, it's important to note that federal courts do not simply act as an automatic appeal for state court decisions; there must be a substantial federal issue at stake for them to take up a case."
