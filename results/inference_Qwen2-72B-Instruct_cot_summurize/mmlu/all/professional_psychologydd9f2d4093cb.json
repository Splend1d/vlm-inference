Assigning students goals that can be achieved only through intergroup cooperation is likely to be the most effective strategy for decreasing hostility between groups of junior high school students. This approach encourages students to work together towards a common goal, which can help to break down barriers and promote positive interactions between members of different groups. This strategy is based on the theory of cooperative learning, which suggests that students learn better and develop more positive relationships when they work together in small groups to achieve shared goals. Additionally, increasing opportunities for contact under pleasant conditions (option A) and having a respected member of the community speak to the students about the benefits of cooperation (option B) can also be helpful, but may not be as effective as promoting intergroup cooperation through shared goals. Having each group select a representative to discuss ways to reduce hostility (option C) could also be useful, but it may not be as effective as promoting direct intergroup cooperation."
