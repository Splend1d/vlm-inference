(g o h)^2 = g^2 o h^2 for every g,h in G\n\nIn an Abelian group (G, o), the operation \"o\" is commutative, meaning that for any two elements g and h in G, g o h = h o g.\n\nLet's check the options:\n\nA. g = g^-1 for every g in G: This statement is not necessarily true for all elements in an Abelian group. It would only be true if every element were its own inverse, which is not a requirement for an Abelian group.\n\nB. g = g^2 for every g in G: Again, this is not necessarily true for all elements in an Abelian group. This would imply that every element squared gives itself, which is not a property required of Abelian groups.\n\nC. (g o h)^2 = g^2 o h^2 for every g,h in G: This statement is true because of the properties of Abelian groups. Since the operation is commutative, we can expand (g o h)^2 as follows:\n(g o h)^2 = (g o h) o (g o h) = g o (h o g) o h (by associativity)\n= g o (g o h) o h (since the group is Abelian, we can commute h and g)\n= (g o g) o (h o h) (by associativity again)\n= g^2 o h^2.\nSo, (g o h)^2 = g^2 o h^2 for every g,h in G is indeed a true statement for an Abelian group.\n\nD. G is of finite order: This is not necessarily true. An Abelian group can be either finite or infinite. The finiteness or infiniteness of the group does not depend on it being Abelian.\n\nHence, the correct answer is C."
