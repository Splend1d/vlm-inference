It works to dilate the airways quickly, allowing better deposition of other medications.\n\nShort-acting bronchodilators, such as albuterol (also known as salbutamol), work rapidly to relax and open the airways in the lungs. Taking this medication first ensures that the airways are as open as possible when subsequent medications are administered, allowing those medications to reach deeper into the lungs where they can be more effective. This is particularly important in the treatment of conditions like asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)."
