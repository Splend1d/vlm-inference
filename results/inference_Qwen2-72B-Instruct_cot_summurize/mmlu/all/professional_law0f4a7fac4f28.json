The contract has many clauses, including one that prohibits generally the assignment of the contract or any of its terms. The distributor assigns its right to receive the funds anyway. Will a court enforce the bar against assignment under these circumstances?\n\nA. No, a bar of assignment does not apply to the right to receive the funds unless specifically stated.\nB. No, a bar of assignment is an unconstitutional deprivation of due process.\nC. Yes, a contractual provision prohibiting assignments is enforceable in all respects.\nD. Yes, a bar against the right to receive proceeds is a favored restriction unless otherwise stated.\n"

No, a bar of assignment does not apply to the right to receive the funds unless specifically stated.\n\nIn general, the right to receive money (such as a debt or a sum due under a contract) is considered assignable unless there is a specific clause in the contract that prohibits the assignment of that particular right. The rationale behind this is that the assignment of a right to receive money does not typically affect the performance obligations of the other party and does not alter the nature of the contract. However, if the contract explicitly states that the right to receive payment is non-assignable, then a court would likely enforce that provision. Without such specific language, the prohibition on assignment would not apply to the right to receive funds."
