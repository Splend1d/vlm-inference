Excluding a relevant variable from a linear regression model\n\nThe first three options (A, B, and C) are examples of mis-specification of functional form because they involve using an incorrect mathematical relationship between the dependent variable (y) and independent variable(s) (x). Option D, on the other hand, represents an issue known as omitted variable bias, which is not directly related to the functional form but rather to the set of variables included in the model. However, it's important to note that excluding a relevant variable can lead to a form of mis-specification, but it is not typically categorized under functional form mis-specification."
