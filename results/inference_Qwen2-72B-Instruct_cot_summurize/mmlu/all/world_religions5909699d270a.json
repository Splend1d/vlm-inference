It was actually the Battle of Hunayn, which occurred after the Battle of Badr and the Battle of Uhud, but before the Battle of the Trench. However, the conquest of Mecca, which led to the mass conversion of the city's inhabitants to Islam, did not technically involve a battle, as the Meccans surrendered without much resistance. This event is known as the Conquest of Mecca, and it occurred in Ramadan 8 AH (630 CE). \n\nHowever, if you have to choose from the given options, then the closest answer would be:\n\nD. The Battle of Badr\n\nThis is because the Battle of Badr was the first major military victory for the Muslims, and it significantly boosted their morale and confidence. This victory paved the way for further military campaigns and conquests, including the eventual conquest of Mecca."
