In two-dimensional space, the hyperplane (which is the decision boundary) learned by a linear SVM is indeed a straight line.\n\nD. Overfitting in an SVM is not a function of number of support vectors.\n\nThis statement is partially true. The number of support vectors does not directly correlate to overfitting in the way that more support vectors always mean more overfitting. Overfitting in SVMs is influenced by several factors including the choice of kernel, the value of the regularization parameter (C), and the complexity of the decision boundary. However, having too many support vectors could indicate that the model is fitting the noise in the training data, which might lead to overfitting.\n\nB. In theory, a Gaussian kernel SVM cannot model any complex separating hyperplane.\n\nThis is false. A Gaussian kernel SVM can actually model very complex separating hyperplanes. The Gaussian kernel (also known as the RBF kernel) maps the input features into an infinite-dimensional feature space, allowing for the modeling of highly nonlinear boundaries.\n\nC. For every kernel function used in a SVM, one can obtain an equivalent closed form basis expansion.\n\nThis is false. Not all kernel functions have a closed-form basis expansion. The beauty of the kernel trick in SVMs is that it allows us to compute the dot product in high-dimensional spaces without explicitly mapping the data into those spaces. For some kernels, such as polynomial kernels or linear kernels, we can obtain a closed-form basis expansion, but this is not the case for all kernels, especially for the Gaussian kernel."
