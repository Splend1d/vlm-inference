In Scenario 1, calling 911 for a non-emergency reason is considered misuse of emergency services and can result in penalties. In Scenario 2, holding someone's head under water is a form of physical assault and can cause serious harm or death, making it a very clear violation of moral and legal standards. However, it should be noted that Scenario 2 is more severe and potentially criminally punishable than Scenario 1."
