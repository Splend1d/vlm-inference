The parents of two students who attend a public high school in the state sue for a declaratory judgment and injunction in federal court, claiming that the state statute violates the establishment clause of the First Amendment. Assume that the federal court decides to hear the case on its merits. Which of the following is the state's LEAST persuasive argument for sustaining the validity of the statute?\n\nA. The state statute benefits the parents or guardians of all the children in private schools, religious and nonreligious.\nB. The primary effect of the state statute is not to advance or inhibit religion.\nC. The administration of the state statute by the department of education does not foster excessive governmental entanglement with religion.\nD. The state statute is a valid exercise of state regulatory action in the field of education.\n"

The state statute is a valid exercise of state regulatory action in the field of education.\n\nWhile it is true that states have the authority to regulate education, this argument does not directly address the constitutional issue at hand: whether the statute violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. Arguments A, B, and C more directly engage with the legal criteria established by the Supreme Court for evaluating whether government action constitutes an unconstitutional establishment of religion. These criteria include whether the statute has a secular legislative purpose, its primary effect neither advances nor inhibits religion, and it does not foster an excessive government entanglement with religion. Argument D focuses on the state's general authority rather than specifically addressing these criteria."
