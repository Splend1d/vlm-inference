This method involves studying different age groups at the same point in time to determine differences and similarities in their development. However, it's important to note that longitudinal studies, where the same individuals are studied over an extended period, are also widely used in developmental psychology. These provide insights into how individuals change and develop over time. Both methods are crucial for understanding human development."
