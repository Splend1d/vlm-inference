Rearranging the Gibbs phase rule to solve for \\(P\\), we get:\n\n\\[ P = C - F + 2 \\]\n\nSince \\(F\\) must be non-negative, the largest possible value of \\(P\\) occurs when \\(F = 0\\). Substituting \\(C = 3\\) and \\(F = 0\\) into the equation gives:\n\n\\[ P = 3 - 0 + 2 = 5 \\]\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of phases that can coexist in a three component system is 5.\n\nThe correct answer is D. 5."
