When the debtor offered to pay $10,000, it was a new agreement or promise to pay a portion of the discharged debt voluntarily. However, since the debtor's ability to pay was contingent upon the sale of his house, and the sale did not go through, there is no enforceable contract or obligation for the debtor to pay the $10,000. The creditor cannot sue for breach of contract because there was no valid consideration (i.e., something of value) exchanged for the debtor's promise to pay, as the sale of the house fell through. Therefore, the creditor is not entitled to recover any amount from the debtor based on the circumstances provided."
