It's more likely to occur between genes that are farther apart on the same chromosome because the closer two genes are to each other, the less likely they are to be separated by a crossover event.\n\nGiven the options:\n\nA. Two genes (1 and 2) are located right next to each other on chromosome A. Crossover between these genes is unlikely because they are close together.\n\nB. Gene 1 is located on chromosome A, and gene 2 is on chromosome B. Crossover cannot occur between genes on different chromosomes during normal meiosis. However, if we consider independent assortment, then these genes will segregate independently during meiosis, which can lead to new combinations in the offspring.\n\nC. Genes 1 and 2 are located near each other on the X chromosome. This scenario suggests that the genes are linked and therefore might not undergo crossover frequently if they are very close to each other. However, if they are \"near\" but not too close, there is still a chance for crossover to occur.\n\nD. Gene 1 is located on chromosome A; gene 2 is located far away but on the same chromosome. This scenario is the most likely for crossover to occur because the genes are on the same chromosome but are far enough apart that a crossover event could potentially separate them.\n\nTherefore, **D** is the correct answer as it describes the situation where crossover is most likely to occur."
