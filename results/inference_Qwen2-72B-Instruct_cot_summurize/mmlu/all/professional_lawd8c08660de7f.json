The owners of the complex told the fumigation company that the common wall separating the infested building from the uninfested building was an impenetrable fire wall. The fumigation company did its own thorough inspection and determined that the buildings were indeed completely separated by the wall. Residents of the condominium units in the building that was to be sprayed were told to evacuate, but the residents of the uninfested building were told that they could remain while the other building was treated. During and shortly after the fumigation, in which a highly toxic chemical was used, many residents of the uninfested building became sick. It was determined that their illnesses were caused by the fumigation chemical. In fact, there was a hole in the fire wall separating the two buildings, but because it could only be observed from a specific position in the crawl space underneath the floor of the uninfested building, it had not been discovered by either the fumigation company or any previous building inspector. Are the residents of the uninfested building likely to prevail in a tort action against the fumigation company?\n\nA. No, because the condominium complex owners were responsible for accurately conveying the condition of their buildings.\nB. No, because the fumigation company exercised a high level of care.\nC. Yes, because the fumigation company can be held strictly liable for its activity.\nD. Yes, because the fumigation company put a dangerous product into the stream of commerce.\n"

Yes, because the fumigation company can be held strictly liable for its activity.\n\nIn this scenario, the fumigation company used a highly toxic chemical that caused harm to the residents of the uninfested building. Even though the company conducted its own thorough inspection and was misled about the condition of the firewall, they engaged in an activity that is considered abnormally dangerous due to the use of a hazardous substance. Under the doctrine of strict liability, a party engaged in such an activity is liable for any resulting damages without the need to prove negligence or fault. Therefore, the residents of the uninfested building are likely to prevail in a tort action based on strict liability against the fumigation company. Option D, while related to products liability, does not directly apply here as the issue is with the application of the chemical rather than the chemical itself being inherently dangerous when sold."
