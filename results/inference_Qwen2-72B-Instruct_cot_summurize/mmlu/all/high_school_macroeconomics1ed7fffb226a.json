This is often referred to as the \"wealth effect.\" When people feel wealthier, they are more likely to spend money, thus shifting the consumption function upward.\n\nThe increase in consumption then leads to an increase in aggregate demand, as aggregate demand is the total spending on goods and services in an economy. It includes consumption, investment, government spending, and net exports. An increase in consumption directly affects aggregate demand positively.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Increase Increase\n\nThe consumption function will shift upwards (increase), and aggregate demand will also increase."
