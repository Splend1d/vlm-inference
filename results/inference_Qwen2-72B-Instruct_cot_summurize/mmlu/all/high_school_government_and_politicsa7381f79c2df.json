Redistricting is the process of redrawing the boundaries of electoral districts based on new census data, which is collected every 10 years. This ensures that each district has roughly equal populations and maintains the principle of \"one person, one vote.\"\n\nAs for the other options:\nA. While congressional committees often play a role in the redistricting process, it is typically state legislatures that have the primary responsibility for redrawing congressional districts.\nB. Redistricting is often controversial due to its significant political implications. Politicians may manipulate district boundaries to favor their own party or incumbents, a practice known as gerrymandering.\nD. The Supreme Court has indeed placed some restrictions on the use of race in redistricting but has not completely banned the consideration of racial demographics. The court's rulings are nuanced, allowing for the consideration of race under certain circumstances while prohibiting overt racial gerrymandering."
