The same chromosome in every cell of a normal female is inactivated.\n\nThis statement is not correct because the inactivation of the X chromosome in females is a random process. In each cell, either the maternal or paternal X chromosome can be inactivated, but it's not the same chromosome across all cells. This phenomenon is known as lyonization and leads to mosaicism for X-linked gene expression in females."
