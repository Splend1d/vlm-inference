In both cases, the conclusion ~G \u2228 ~E is false, which means the argument is invalid.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Invalid. Counterexample when E, F, and G are true\n\nHowever, it's also worth noting that:\n\nC. Invalid. Counterexample when E and G are true and F is false\n\nis also a correct counterexample, as it shows another scenario where the premises are true but the conclusion is false. So technically, both B and C could be chosen as correct answers if multiple choices were allowed. But since only one answer is asked for, you would typically choose the first counterexample found, which is B."
