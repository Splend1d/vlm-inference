In scenario 1, placing items on the counter at a convenience store is a normal part of the purchasing process. In scenario 2, using a phone in a movie theater may be considered rude or disruptive by some, but it is not typically viewed as a morally wrong action on par with lying, stealing, or harming others. However, it's worth noting that many theaters have policies against using phones during movies to maintain the viewing experience for all patrons, so while not morally wrong, it could be seen as disrespectful or against the rules."
