The aid is in the form of annual subsidies to qualified institutions. The grants are non-categorical but may not, under an added provision, be utilized by the institutions for sectarian purposes. A state agency determines the eligibility of applicant institutions. Eight state taxpayers, all avowed atheists, bring suit in federal court to enjoin the payments of subsidies under the statute to all church-affiliated institutions in the state. The federal district court will most likely\n\nA. dismiss the action for lack of standing.\nB. uphold the validity of the statute as nonviolative of the establishment clause.\nC. invalidate the statute as violative of the establishment clause.\nD. uphold the validity of the statute as a valid exercise of the state's power to subsidize education.\n"

Simply being a taxpayer and disagreeing with how tax dollars are spent is generally not enough to confer standing. However, if the case were to proceed on its merits, the court might consider the following:\n\nB. The court could uphold the validity of the statute as non-violative of the Establishment Clause if it finds that the aid is provided on a neutral basis to all institutions meeting the specified criteria, without regard to religious affiliation, and that the aid is not used for sectarian purposes.\n\nD. The court could also uphold the validity of the statute as a valid exercise of the state's power to subsidize education if it determines that the statute serves a secular purpose, has a primary effect that neither advances nor inhibits religion, and does not foster an excessive government entanglement with religion. This would be consistent with the Lemon test established by the U.S. Supreme Court in Lemon v. Kurtzman (1971), although the legal landscape regarding the Establishment Clause has evolved since then, with more recent cases sometimes applying different analyses."
