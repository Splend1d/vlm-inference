In Scenario 1, the punishment of banishing someone to the basement for such an extended period is extreme, cruel, and unjustified, especially for something as relatively minor as being rude. In Scenario 2, starting a forest fire, even if it only burns twigs and shrubs, can lead to uncontrolled spread, endangering wildlife, property, and potentially human life. It is illegal and morally irresponsible to start fires in natural environments without proper authority and precautions."
