Open-ended\n\nOpen-ended questions seek qualitative information because they allow respondents to answer in their own words, providing detailed and descriptive responses. This contrasts with the other options, which typically yield quantitative data:\n\nA. Likert scale - Provides a range of responses that measure the intensity of an attitude or opinion.\nB. Multiple choice - Offers a set of predefined answers from which the respondent selects.\nD. Yes/No - Provides a binary response, indicating only whether a statement is true or false for the respondent."
