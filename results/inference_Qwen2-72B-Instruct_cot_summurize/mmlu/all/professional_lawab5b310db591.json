It was addressed to the manager. He read it, put it in a private drawer, and did not read it again. Later, he tried to sue the competitor for defamation as a result of the letter. Will the court likely grant the defendant's motion to dismiss, and on what grounds? Base your answer on the common law definition of defamation.\n\nA. Yes, it will dismiss on the basis that the publication is made to the manager alone.\nB. Yes, it will dismiss on the basis that the language is not damaging to the manager's reputation.\nC. No, it will not dismiss because the circumstances show that all of the elements of defamation are all present.\nD. No, it will not dismiss because a plaintiff in a defamatory action has an absolute right to a jury trial to prove defamation.\n"

Yes, it will dismiss on the basis that the publication is made to the manager alone.\n\nFor a statement to be considered defamatory under common law, it must meet certain criteria, including that the statement must be published to someone other than the person it concerns (the plaintiff). In this case, since the letter was only read by the manager himself and not shared with any third party, it does not meet the requirement of publication to a third party, which is essential for a defamation claim. Therefore, the court would likely grant the defendant's motion to dismiss based on the lack of publication to a third party."
