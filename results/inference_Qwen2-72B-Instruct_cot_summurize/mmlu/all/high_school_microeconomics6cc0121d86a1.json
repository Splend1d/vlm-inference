Typically, market segments with more inelastic demand (less sensitive to price changes) will be charged higher prices, while those with more elastic demand (more sensitive to price changes) will be charged lower prices.\n\nAs a result of this practice, consumer surplus decreases because consumers who would have purchased the product at a lower price but are now charged a higher price due to their perceived willingness to pay see a reduction in their consumer surplus. The firm captures some of this surplus in the form of higher profits."
