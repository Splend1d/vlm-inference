These vibrations lead to the release of neurotransmitters, which then stimulate the auditory nerve fibers that send signals to the brain. The louder the sound, the more hair cells are stimulated and the more neurons fire, leading to a stronger signal being sent to the brain and thus a greater perception of loudness. Therefore, the increase in sound volume results in more neurons firing more frequently to transmit the intensity of the sound to the brain."
