The purpose of the statute was to protect children from accessing pornographic materials. The law imposed a blanket prohibition on any communications that could be accessed by children and which might contain the feared material. A group of Internet publishers filed an action to have the law declared unconstitutional and unenforceable. They proved that many instances of artistic expression and non-prurient broadcasts could fall within the wide parameters of the law. The government argued that its interest in protecting children outweighed the other considerations, and that millions of parents who are now afraid to access the Internet would use the service because the new law made it safe for children. What will the Supreme Court decide?\n\nA. The law violates the First Amendment because it does not precisely regulate the content of speech and can be broadly applied to eliminate free speech for adults.\nB. The law is a precise and narrow proscription that applies only to pornographic materials and its wording will be approved because it is necessary to protect children.\nC. The law is constitutional because it is a reasonable exercise of the police power of the federal government.\nD. The law is unconstitutional because it invades the absolute right to privacy that adults expect to be protected when using the Internet.\n"

The law violates the First Amendment because it does not precisely regulate the content of speech and can be broadly applied to eliminate free speech for adults.\n\nThe Supreme Court has previously ruled on similar issues regarding the regulation of indecent material on the Internet, most notably in the case of Reno v. American Civil Liberties Union (1997). In that case, the Court struck down provisions of the Communications Decency Act that attempted to ban \"indecent\" and \"patently offensive\" communications on the Internet that could be accessed by minors. The Court held that the Internet is entitled to the highest level of First Amendment protection, and that the provisions were overbroad and vague, infringing upon the rights of adults to engage in constitutionally protected speech.\n\nGiven this precedent, it is likely that the Court would rule similarly in this hypothetical scenario, finding that the federal statute is too broad and impinges on the First Amendment rights of adults by restricting a substantial amount of protected speech in an effort to shield children from indecent material. The Court would likely require that any regulation of speech on the Internet must be narrowly tailored to serve a compelling government interest without unnecessarily infringing on the rights of adults to access and communicate lawful content."
