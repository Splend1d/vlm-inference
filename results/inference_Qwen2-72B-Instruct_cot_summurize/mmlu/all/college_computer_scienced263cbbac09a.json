This minimizes the waiting time of shorter processes behind longer ones.\n\nLet's schedule the jobs in increasing order of their service times:\n\n- Job 1: Service time = 2 time units. Completion time = 2.\n- Job 2: Service time = 3 time units. Completion time = 2 + 3 = 5.\n- Job 3: Service time = 5 time units. Completion time = 5 + 5 = 10.\n- Job 4: Service time = 15 time units. Completion time = 10 + 15 = 25.\n- Job 5: Service time = 25 time units. Completion time = 25 + 25 = 50.\n\nThe total completion time is the sum of all individual completion times:\nTotal completion time = 2 + 5 + 10 + 25 + 50 = 92.\n\nThe average completion time is the total completion time divided by the number of jobs:\nAverage completion time = Total completion time / Number of jobs = 92 / 5 = 18.4.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. 92/5."
