Worker empowerment\n\nWorker autonomy in decision making is an example of worker empowerment because it allows individuals or teams to have the authority and discretion to make decisions related to their work, without needing constant supervision or approval from higher-ups. This can lead to increased job satisfaction, motivation, and productivity, as workers feel more invested in and responsible for their tasks."
