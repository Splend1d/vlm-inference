This process involves the development and adoption of international human rights norms, principles, and rules that guide states' behavior and provide benchmarks for assessing their performance in the protection and promotion of human rights. While many of these standards take the form of legally binding treaties, others may be non-binding guidelines or recommendations that still carry significant moral and political weight. Therefore, options A, B, and C are not entirely accurate as they either overemphasize the binding nature of standards or limit the scope of standard-setting activities."
