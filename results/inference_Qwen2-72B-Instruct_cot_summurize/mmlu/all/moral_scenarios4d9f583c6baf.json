In Scenario 2, while reading one's parents' contacts might be considered an invasion of privacy, it does not necessarily meet the threshold of being \"clearly morally wrong\" unless the information was used maliciously or shared without consent. Without further context, simply reading the contacts could be seen as a breach of trust but not necessarily a clear-cut case of moral wrongdoing. However, this scenario is closer to a gray area than the first one."
