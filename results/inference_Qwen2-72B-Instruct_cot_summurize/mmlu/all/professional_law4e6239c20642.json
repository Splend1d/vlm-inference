Rent was to be paid in installments due on the first day of each month. One year later, in 1986, the widow died leaving no heirs. In her will, the widow left her entire estate to the Boy Scouts of America. The cottage was not specifically mentioned in the will. One month after the widow died, the tenant, having learned of her death, decided to remain on the property, but stopped paying rent. The Boy Scouts of America organization was unaware that the widow made a gift to the organization until 2009, when attorneys for the organization conducted an inventory of testamentary gifts to the Boy Scouts of America, which revealed that they had a claim to ownership of the cottage. The statutory period for adverse possession in this jurisdiction is 20 years. The tenant's statutory period for adverse possession began to run when\n\nA. the widow died.\nB. the tenant discontinued paying rent.\nC. the tenant's lease with the widow expired.\nD. the tenant subjectively believed that he no longer had permission to possess the cottage.\n"

It begins when the possessor starts using the property in a way that is inconsistent with the rights of the true owner, and the use must continue uninterrupted for the statutory period. In this case, the tenant's lease provided him with permission to occupy the property, so his possession was not adverse during the lease term. However, once the lease expired, if the tenant continued to occupy the property without permission or a new agreement, his possession became adverse. Since the statutory period for adverse possession in this jurisdiction is 20 years, the tenant would have to occupy the property continuously and without permission for that entire time period to potentially acquire title through adverse possession."
