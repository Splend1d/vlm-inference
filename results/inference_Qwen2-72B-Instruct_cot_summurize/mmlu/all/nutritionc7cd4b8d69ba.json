Obesity\n\nObesity has been shown to increase the risk of postmenopausal breast cancer. This is because after menopause, most of the body's estrogen comes from fat tissue. The more fat tissue there is, the more estrogen is produced, and higher estrogen levels have been linked to an increased risk of breast cancer.\n\nWhile dietary factors like red meat (option A) and dietary fat (option B) have been studied in relation to breast cancer risk, their association with postmenopausal breast cancer is less clear-cut compared to obesity. Fish (option C), on the other hand, is generally considered to be protective against various diseases due to its high content of omega-3 fatty acids, although individual studies may show varying results."
