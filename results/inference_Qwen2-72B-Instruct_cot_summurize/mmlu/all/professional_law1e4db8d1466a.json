It is a right to use the land of another for a specific purpose, such as a utility company's right to install power lines across private property. In this case, the citrus grower has been granted a right of way across the grapefruit grove for his personal benefit, which allows him to cross the property on foot, by bicycle, or automobile. This right is not dependent on the ownership of any particular parcel of land, making it an easement in gross rather than an easement appurtenant."
