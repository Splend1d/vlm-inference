Public nudity is generally illegal and against social norms in the United States.\n\nIn Scenario 2, putting trick candles on your cousin's cake is not considered morally wrong. It is a common prank often associated with birthday celebrations and is typically seen as a harmless joke that adds to the fun of the occasion."
