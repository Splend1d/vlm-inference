In this case, the power (P) is 60 watts and the voltage (V) is 120 volts. So the current (I) is:\nI = P / V I = 60 W / 120 V I = 0.5 A\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. 0.5 A. Options C and D are not relevant to the question and can be eliminated. Option A is incorrect because it underestimates the current drawn by the light bulb."
