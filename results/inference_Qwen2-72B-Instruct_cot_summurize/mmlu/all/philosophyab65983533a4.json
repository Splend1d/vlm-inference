According to Stevenson, ethical statements are not merely descriptive but are also prescriptive. They express feelings about certain behaviors or states of affairs and attempt to influence the attitudes and actions of others. This perspective is part of Stevenson's emotivist theory of ethics, which holds that moral statements primarily function to express emotions and to try to persuade others to share those emotions or to act in accordance with them.\n\nSo the correct answer is:\n\nB. influence the interests of others."
