However, given the nature of these sites and what we know about their construction, the most appropriate characterization would be:\n\nB. affluent foragers\n\nG\u00f6bekli Tepe in Turkey, which dates back to around 10,000 years ago, is particularly significant because it predates the advent of agriculture in the region. The construction of such large-scale monuments suggests that the people who built them had a surplus of resources and were capable of organizing complex tasks without the aid of an agricultural economy.\n\nWatson Brake in Louisiana, USA, is one of the oldest known mound complexes in North America, dating to approximately 3500 BC. Similarly, Poverty Point in Louisiana, dating from 1700 to 700 BC, features earthworks and mounds that indicate a high level of organization and communal effort. Both sites suggest that the societies involved were hunter-gatherers or foragers with enough resources to support such large-scale projects.\n\nWhile these societies might not have been agriculturalists or formed into archaic states or primitive civilizations in the traditional sense, they demonstrate a level of social complexity and resource management that goes beyond what is typically associated with nomadic foraging groups. Thus, the term \"affluent foragers\" best captures their capabilities and lifestyle."
