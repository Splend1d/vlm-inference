Amount of fertilizer produced in the country\n\nWhile the amount of fertilizer produced in a country can certainly impact agricultural productivity, it is not an environmental factor. Environmental factors influencing agriculture typically include aspects such as climate (temperature, precipitation patterns), soil type and quality, topography, and availability of water resources. The production of fertilizer is more related to industrial capacity and economic policies than to environmental conditions."
