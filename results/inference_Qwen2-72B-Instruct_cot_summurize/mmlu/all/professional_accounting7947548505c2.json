Adopting the fixed asset module of the new system for integration.\n\nIntegrating the fixed asset management into the new enterprise-wide system will provide several benefits over the long term. This approach will ensure consistency, accuracy, and efficiency across all financial processes within the organization. It will also facilitate better reporting, analysis, and compliance with accounting standards. Additionally, an integrated system can reduce the risk of errors and fraud by providing a single source of truth for all financial data. A stand-alone fixed asset program could also be considered if it offers superior functionality or specialized features that are not available in the new system's fixed asset module, but integrating it with the new system would still be recommended for the reasons mentioned above. Simply continuing to use the current spreadsheet process may lead to scalability issues, increased risk of errors, and lack of integration with other financial systems as the company grows and evolves."
