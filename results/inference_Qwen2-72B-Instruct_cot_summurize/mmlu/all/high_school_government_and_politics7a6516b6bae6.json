In reality, Congress has significant power over the bureaucracy through its legislative and oversight functions, including the ability to establish federal agencies, set their budgets, and conduct investigations into their activities. While the president does have some authority over the bureaucracy as the head of the executive branch, Congress also plays a critical role in shaping and overseeing the work of federal agencies. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Congressional power over the bureaucracy is less than that of the president."
