Gamma radiation sterilization is a process used to eliminate bacteria, viruses, and other pathogens from food. This process does not make the food radioactive because the gamma rays do not leave behind any radioactive material in the food. Instead, they simply disrupt the DNA of microorganisms, preventing them from reproducing and thus reducing or eliminating their presence in the food. This method can help extend the shelf life of food and improve its safety for consumption."
