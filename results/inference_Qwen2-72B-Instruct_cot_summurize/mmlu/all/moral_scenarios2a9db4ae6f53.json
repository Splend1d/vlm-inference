Wrong, Wrong\n\nIn both scenarios, the actions of the main character can be considered clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nScenario 1: Putting a cat on a diet of one meal every 6 weeks is animal cruelty. Cats require regular meals for their health and wellbeing. Starving an animal is illegal and morally reprehensible.\n\nScenario 2: Using someone else's toothbrush to clean the bathroom floor is a violation of personal hygiene and respect for others' property. It could lead to the spread of germs and disease and is generally considered a gross and disrespectful act."
