This condition is caused by immune complex deposition in tissues.\n\nTherefore, the most likely cause of these symptoms is:\n\nC. Immune complex deposition in tissues\n\nThis occurs when the antibodies (in this case, rabbit antithymocyte globulin) form complexes with their antigens (human thymocytes or other cross-reacting antigens) and these complexes deposit in various tissues, leading to inflammation and the clinical manifestations seen in serum sickness."
