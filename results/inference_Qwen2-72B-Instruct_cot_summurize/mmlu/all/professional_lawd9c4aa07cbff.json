This could be due to various reasons, such as the jury believing that the defendant did not start the fire intentionally (thus acquitting on the arson charge) but still finding that the death occurred during the commission of a dangerous act (felony murder). The inconsistency does not necessarily mean that there was a legal error or violation of the defendant's rights, so the motion to set aside the guilty verdict is unlikely to be granted based on this argument alone. The defendant would have the option to appeal the conviction, but the motion to set aside the verdict would likely be denied at the trial court level."
