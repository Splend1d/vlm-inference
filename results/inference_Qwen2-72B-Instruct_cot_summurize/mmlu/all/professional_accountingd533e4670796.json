Based on the calculation using the given data, none of the options (A, B, C, D) directly match the calculated standard deviation of 12%. The closest option to our calculated result would be:\n\nD. 9.70%\n\nBut this is not correct based on the calculation. It's important to ensure that all information provided is accurate and that calculations are performed correctly.
