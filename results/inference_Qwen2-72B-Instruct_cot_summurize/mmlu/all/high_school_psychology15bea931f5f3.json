Specifically, her actions seem to align with symptoms of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), which is characterized by recurrent, unwanted thoughts (obsessions) and repetitive behaviors (compulsions). In this case, Jeanette has a compulsion to check if the door is locked multiple times, even after she has already done so. This behavior can be distressing and time-consuming for individuals with OCD, as they feel compelled to perform these checks to alleviate anxiety related to their obsessions. It's important to note that only a qualified mental health professional can diagnose someone with OCD or any other mental health condition. If you or someone you know is struggling with these types of behaviors, seeking help from a mental health professional may be beneficial."
