The Ideal Policy framework provides the analytical tools for understanding the contextual factors influencing the use of coercive diplomacy, for example why a policymaker takes the decision to, or not to, implement the Ideal Policy.\nB. The Ideal Policy framework focuses on the use of coercive diplomacy to counter aggression. The Ideal Policy explains and predicts outcomes with a minimum of success conditions on the basis of the coercer's actions only.\nC. The Ideal Policy provides an expansive framework, firstly for the examination of a maximum number of probable causal conditions and secondly to make the conditions applicable to the contextual factors relating to the use of coercive diplomacy.\nD. The Ideal Policy framework recognizes that to make non-compliance too costly, the coercer must threaten to defeat the adversary or to deny the targets objectives. The condition for success is pivotal on the coercer's threat of force.\n"

The Ideal Policy framework aids in understanding the contextual factors that influence the use of coercive diplomacy. It helps policymakers analyze why certain decisions are made or avoided, providing insights into the complex dynamics at play when considering the implementation of such policies.\n\nB. The Ideal Policy framework specifically addresses the use of coercive diplomacy to counter aggression. By explaining and predicting outcomes based on the coercer's actions, it offers a clear set of guidelines for achieving successful results under minimal success conditions. This focus allows practitioners to concentrate on the most critical aspects of their strategy.\n\nC. The Ideal Policy framework is comprehensive, allowing for the examination of a wide range of probable causal conditions. This expansiveness ensures that the framework can be applied to various contextual factors related to the use of coercive diplomacy. Practitioners can benefit from this thorough approach by gaining a deeper understanding of the nuances involved in implementing such policies.\n\nD. The Ideal Policy framework acknowledges the importance of making non-compliance too costly for the adversary. To achieve this, the coercer must threaten to defeat the adversary or deny them their objectives through the credible threat of force. This recognition highlights the pivotal role of the coercer's threat capabilities in ensuring the success of coercive diplomacy efforts.\n\nOverall, the Ideal Policy framework offers a structured and detailed approach to understanding and applying coercive diplomacy. By focusing on key elements like context, causality, and the role of threats, it empowers practitioners to develop effective strategies and increase the likelihood of success in their diplomatic endeavors."
