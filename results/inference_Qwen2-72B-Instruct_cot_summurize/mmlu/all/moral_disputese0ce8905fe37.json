According to Thaddeus Metz, a prominent philosopher in the field of ethics and African philosophy, punishment should aim to correct the wrongdoer's behavior rather than simply inflict harm or degradation upon them. He argues that punishment should be seen as a form of moral education, helping the wrongdoer to understand the impact of their actions and encouraging them to act more morally in the future. Therefore, the punishment should be proportionate to the severity of the wrongdoing and aimed at correcting it, rather than simply seeking retribution or vengeance. Option D is incorrect because not all forms of punishment are justified on Metz's view; only those that aim to correct the wrongdoing and are proportionate to its severity are justified. Options A and C are also incorrect because they suggest forms of punishment that may not necessarily aim to correct the wrongdoing or may involve unnecessary harm or degradation."
