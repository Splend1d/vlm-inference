The developer decided to raze the existing building on her lot and to erect a building of greater height. The developer has received all governmental approvals required to pursue her project. When the building was completed, the homeowner discovered that the shadow created by the new higher building placed her building in such deep shade that her ability to lease space was diminished and that the rent she could charge and the occupancy rate were substantially lower. Assume that these facts are proved in an appropriate action that the landowner instituted against the developer for all and any relief available. Which of the following is the most appropriate comment concerning this lawsuit?\n\nA. The landowner is entitled to a mandatory injunction requiring the developer to restore conditions to those existing with the prior building insofar as the shadow is concerned.\nB. The court should award permanent damages, in lieu of an injunction, equal to the present value of all rents lost and loss on rents for the reasonable life of the building.\nC. The court should award damages for losses suffered to the date of trial and leave open recovery of future damages.\nD. Judgment should be for the developer, because the investor has no cause of action.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is C. The court should award damages for losses suffered to the date of trial and leave open recovery of future damages.\n\nExplanation: In this scenario, the landowner's property value and income potential have been adversely affected by the developer's actions, which have led to a decrease in rental income and occupancy rates due to the shadow cast by the new building. While the developer may have obtained all necessary permits and approvals for the construction, this does not necessarily mean that the landowner is without recourse. The landowner may seek compensation for the diminution in value of their property and lost income resulting from the developer's actions.\n\nA mandatory injunction requiring the developer to restore the previous conditions would likely not be granted, as it would be overly burdensome and potentially unfeasible for the developer. Additionally, it might not be necessary if monetary damages can adequately compensate the landowner for their losses.\n\nPermanent damages equal to the present value of all lost rents and losses on rents for the reasonable life of the building (option B) could be an overreach, as it assumes that the situation will remain unchanged for the entire lifespan of the building, which is uncertain. It also does not account for potential changes in market conditions or other factors that could affect the landowner's ability to lease space in the future.\n\nJudgment for the developer (option D) would be inappropriate, as the landowner has suffered demonstrable harm as a result of the developer's actions, even if the developer acted within legal bounds.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate course of action is for the court to award damages for the losses suffered up to the date of the trial and allow the landowner to recover future damages if they continue to be impacted by the shadow cast by the new building. This approach balances the interests of both parties and provides the landowner with fair compensation for their losses while acknowledging the developer's right to develop their property within legal limits."
