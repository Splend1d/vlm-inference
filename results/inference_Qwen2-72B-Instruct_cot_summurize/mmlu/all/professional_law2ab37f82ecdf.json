                    "text": "A defendant was convicted of assault of a federal officer and imprisoned in a federal penitentiary. While in prison, federal authorities began investigating the murder of the defendant's 11-year- old stepdaughter who was murdered two years earlier. Believing that the defendant was responsible for this killing, federal agents decided to plant an informant at the prison to befriend the defendant and possibly obtain evidence about the crime. In accord with this plan, the federal agents hired a paid informant and placed him in the prison as a fellow inmate, masquerading as an organized crime figure. The informant soon befriended the defendant and learned that he was being threatened by other inmates because of a rumor that he had killed a child. The informant then raised the subject in several conversations, but the defendant repeatedly denied any such involvement. After the defendant started receiving tough treatment from other inmates because of the rumor, the informant offered to protect the defendant but told him, \"You have to tell me the truth about what really happened you know, if you want me to help you. \" Believing that the informant would protect him from the other inmates, the defendant then admitted to the informant that he had driven his stepdaughter to the desert where he killed her. Based upon this confession, the defendant was then indicted for the first-degree murder of his stepdaughter. Prior to trial, the defendant moves to suppress the statement given to the informant. Should the defendant's motion be granted?\n\nA. Yes, because the confession was coerced by the threat of physical violence, absent protection from the informant that motivated the defendant to confess.\nB. Yes, because the informant was a false friend, and the defendant was tricked into making the confession.\nC. No, because the confession was voluntary.\nD. No, because under the totality of circumstances, the informant's conduct was not inherently coercive.\n"

                    "text": "The defendant's motion to suppress the statement given to the informant should be evaluated based on the principles established by the U.S. Supreme Court regarding confessions obtained through government agents or informants. Generally, for a confession to be admissible in court, it must be voluntary and not the result of coercion, duress, or improper inducement by law enforcement.\n\nIn this case, the defendant confessed after being threatened by other inmates due to rumors of having killed a child and being offered protection by the informant in exchange for the truth. The key question is whether the informant's actions amounted to coercion or whether the confession was still voluntary under the totality of the circumstances.\n\nOption A suggests that the confession was coerced by the threat of physical violence, which is a factor to consider. However, simply being in a threatening environment does not automatically make a confession involuntary. The informant did offer protection in exchange for information, which could be seen as a form of inducement.\n\nOption B argues that the confession should be suppressed because the informant was a false friend and tricked the defendant into confessing. This argument could hold water if the defendant was misled into believing that the informant was genuinely interested in his well-being and not working for law enforcement.\n\nOption C states that the confession was voluntary, which could be true if the defendant's decision to confess was not significantly influenced by external pressures but rather a free choice made without duress.\n\nOption D suggests that under the totality of circumstances, the informant's conduct was not inherently coercive. This implies that while the informant did offer protection, the defendant's decision to confess was not solely based on that offer but also his own desire to clear up the situation and perhaps receive better treatment in prison.\n\nGiven the context, the most likely answer based on legal precedent would be:\n\n**D. No, because under the totality of circumstances, the informant's conduct was not inherently coercive.**\n\nThis conclusion assumes that the defendant's confession was not the result of outright threats or physical force but rather a calculated decision made in light of the challenging prison environment. Courts generally consider the totality of circumstances, including the defendant's mental state, age, intelligence, and the nature of the interrogation when determining voluntariness. If the defendant was not subjected to direct pressure or manipulation by the informant beyond the general prison conditions and the offer of protection, the confession might be deemed voluntary and thus admissible. However, this is a complex legal issue that would ultimately be decided by a judge considering all relevant factors."
