This perspective allows them to maintain companionship, emotional support, and intimacy without the legal and financial complexities often associated with marriage, especially in cases where one or both partners have been previously married. Cohabitation can also provide a sense of independence and flexibility that some older adults may prefer. However, it's important to note that individual motivations can vary widely, and some may see cohabitation as a way to save on expenses (option C) or even as a precursor to marriage (option A), depending on their personal circumstances and preferences. Option D, \"their swan song,\" is not a common perspective expressed by older adults regarding cohabitation."
