The witness denied ever having heard the defendant make such threats, even though she had testified to that effect before the grand jury. The prosecutor now seeks to admit the witness\u00d5s grand jury testimony. How should the court rule with regard to the grand jury testimony?\n\nA. Admit the testimony, because it contains a statement by a party-opponent.\nB. Admit the testimony, both for impeachment and for substantive use, because the witness made the inconsistent statement under oath at a formal proceeding.\nC. Admit the testimony under the former testimony exception to the hearsay rule.\nD. Exclude the testimony for substantive use, because it is a testimonial statement.\n"

Additionally, under certain circumstances, such as when the witness is subject to cross-examination and the opposing party had an opportunity to develop the testimony, the grand jury testimony may also be admissible for its substantive value as evidence of the truth of the matter asserted under the \"former testimony\" exception to the hearsay rule. However, the specific rules regarding the admissibility of such testimony can vary depending on jurisdiction and the specific rules of evidence applicable in the case."
