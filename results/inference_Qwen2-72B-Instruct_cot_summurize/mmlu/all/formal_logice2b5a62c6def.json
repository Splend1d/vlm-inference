However, in the context of this statement, we're looking for what directly precedes the action of raising tuition.\n\nThe conditional proposition can be broken down into two parts:\n1. If the governor approves of it and the board of trustees recommends it, then the university raises tuition.\n2. If the university raises tuition, then the governor has approved of it and the board of trustees has recommended it.\n\nIn the first part, the antecedent is \"the governor approves of it and the board of trustees recommends it,\" which leads to the consequent \"the university raises tuition.\"\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is not listed in your options as provided (A, B, C), but combining B and C would give you the complete antecedent:\n\nB.
