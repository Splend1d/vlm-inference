This can lead to the host feeding the parasitic chick at the expense of its own chicks. However, the host bird's instinct to feed chicks that are begging for food remains advantageous in situations where all the chicks in the nest are their own, as it ensures that chicks that need food the most receive it. Thus, the genes for this behavior are not selected against in the host population, even though they may sometimes result in rearing cuckoo chicks instead of their own."
