All of the above.\n\n1. **Speech codes encourage bigotry** - Some argue that speech codes can backfire by driving bigoted views underground rather than eliminating them. This can create an environment where such views continue to fester and may even become more extreme due to the perceived censorship.\n\n2. **Speech codes treat hate speakers with less than equal consideration** - Critics claim that speech codes infringe upon the principle of equality before the law. By specifically targeting certain types of speech (often based on content), they argue, speech codes fail to treat all individuals equally, potentially leading to selective enforcement and bias.\n\n3. **Speech codes result in causal harms** - Opponents suggest that speech codes can have unintended consequences, such as chilling free speech and academic freedom. The fear of punishment for violating vague or broad speech codes might discourage open discussion and debate, which are essential components of education and democratic societies.\n\nIn the context of discussing objections to speech codes, it is common for critics to raise all three of these points. However, without further clarification about which specific work by Altman you are referencing, this answer provides a general overview of common objections to speech codes."
