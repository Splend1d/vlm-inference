Power Transfer Capability: The power transfer capability of a transmission line is directly proportional to the square of the voltage. This means that by increasing the voltage, you can transmit more power over the same line without exceeding its capacity.\n\nB. Reduced Transmission Line Losses: Power loss in a transmission line is given by the formula P_loss = I^2 * R, where I is the current and R is the resistance of the line. By increasing the voltage while keeping the power constant, the current decreases, leading to lower power losses due to the reduced I^2 term.\n\nC. Reduced Conductor Size: Higher voltages allow for the use of conductors with smaller cross-sectional areas because the current density (current per unit area) can be kept within safe limits even at high power levels. Smaller conductors mean less material used, which reduces costs and weight.\n\nOverall, higher transmission voltages improve efficiency, reduce costs, and enable the transmission of more power over longer distances with less loss."
