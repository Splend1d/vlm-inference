                    "text": "The solubility of a salt like MgCl2 can be affected by the presence of common ions according to the common ion effect, which is a result of Le Chatelier's principle. The solubility of MgCl2 will decrease if either Mg^2+ or Cl^- ions are already present in the solution because this will shift the equilibrium towards the formation of more solid MgCl2.\n\nLet's examine each option:\n\nA. LiOH(aq) - This solution provides OH^- ions but not any ions that are common with MgCl2. Therefore, it does not directly affect the solubility of MgCl2 based on the common ion effect.\n\nB. CBr4(aq) - This solution does not contain any ions that are common with MgCl2, so it doesn't have an impact on the solubility of MgCl2 based on the common ion effect.\n\nC. Mg(NO3)2(aq) - This solution contains Mg^2+ ions, which are common with MgCl2. According to the common ion effect, the presence of additional Mg^2+ ions from Mg(NO3)2 would decrease the solubility of MgCl2.\n\nD. AlCl3(aq) - This solution contains Cl^- ions, which are common with MgCl2. According to the common ion effect, the presence of additional Cl^- ions from AlCl3 would also decrease the solubility of MgCl2.\n\nHowever, the question asks for the solution in which MgCl2 would be MOST soluble. Since both options C and D decrease the solubility of MgCl2 due to the common ion effect, neither of these would be correct based on the given context. \n\nGiven the options, the answer that would allow MgCl2 to be MOST soluble is A. LiOH(aq), as it does not introduce common ions that would decrease the solubility of MgCl2. The other options all introduce common ions (either Mg^2+ or Cl^-) that would decrease the solubility of MgCl2. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. LiOH(aq)."
