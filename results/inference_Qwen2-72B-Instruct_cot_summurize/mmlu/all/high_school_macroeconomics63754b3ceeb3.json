Given that the AS curve is upward sloping, this shift would lead to:\n\nA. The equilibrium price level increases while the equilibrium quantity of output decreases.\n\nThe intuition behind this is that with less capacity to produce goods and services, the cost of production increases (since the remaining resources have to work harder or be more expensive to replace), leading to higher prices. At the same time, the total output of the economy falls because there is less physical capital available to produce goods and services. This scenario is consistent with a situation where the AS curve shifts to the left, causing both a higher price level and a lower quantity of output at the new equilibrium."
