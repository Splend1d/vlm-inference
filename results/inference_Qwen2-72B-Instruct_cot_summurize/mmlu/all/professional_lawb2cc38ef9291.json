Many high school and college students have been purchasing fraudulent driver's licenses with phony birthdates showing \"proof' of being 21 years of age or older. As a consequence, many teenagers are able to purchase alcoholic beverages at liquor stores, restaurants, and bars. The situation is becoming especially alarming on many college campuses. A magazine article reported that the majority of freshmen between the ages of 18 and 19 at many colleges had illegally purchased evidence of phony \"proof. \"With underage drinking reaching epidemic proportions, Congress enacted a statute establishing a federal commission to monitor and curtail alcoholic beverage sales to underage drinkers. To implement the program on a national scale, the bill required each state to pass legislation establishing a local \"watchdog\" agency to facilitate compliance with congressional intent. A state has filed suit challenging the constitutionality of the federal statute. The law is likely to be held\n\nA. valid, because the sale of alcoholic beverages has a substantial impact on interstate commerce.\nB. valid, because the establishment of a state watchdog agency under the auspices of a federal regulatory scheme is consistent with the provisions of the Twenty First Amendment.\nC. invalid, because it violates the fundamental principles of state sovereignty embodied by the Eleventh Amendment.\nD. invalid, because the federal government may not compel state legislatures to enact and enforce a federal regulatory program.\n"

United States (1992) and Printz v. United States (1997). According to this doctrine, Congress cannot require states to enact or administer a federal regulatory program. This principle is grounded in the Tenth Amendment, which reserves powers not delegated to the federal government to the states or the people. In the given scenario, the federal statute requiring states to establish local \"watchdog\" agencies would likely be struck down as unconstitutional under the anti-commandeering doctrine."
