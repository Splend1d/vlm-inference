This is a clear example of religious regulation of personal behavior in Islamic society.\n\nThe second verse from the Rub\u00e1iy\u00e1t of Omar Khayy\u00e1m, while not directly related to Islamic law or practice, can be seen as a contrast to the strict prohibitions mentioned in the Qur'anic verse. It encourages partaking in wine, which is forbidden in Islam, reflecting a more relaxed attitude towards personal behavior. However, since the question asks for the closest relation between both verses, the answer would still be C, as both verses deal with aspects of personal behavior that are subject to religious regulation, even if they present opposing views on what is permissible."
