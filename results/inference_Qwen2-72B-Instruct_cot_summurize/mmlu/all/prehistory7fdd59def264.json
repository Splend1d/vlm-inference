Therefore, option B (pyramids) and C (monumental works) could both be correct. However, if you have to choose just one answer, then C (monumental works) would be the more comprehensive choice since it encompasses not only pyramids but also other large-scale structures like temples, palaces, and public buildings that were built by ancient state societies."
