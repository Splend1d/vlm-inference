Shortly thereafter, the developer prepared a subdivision plan that created 100 one-acre residential building lots on this tract. In 1996, the subdivision plan was recorded with the county recorder's office. During the next few years, the developer sold 60 residential lots to individual purchasers. Each deed specified that every lot designated on the subdivision plan was to be recorded in the county recorder's office. Each deed also provided the following:\"No house trailer or mobile home shall be built or maintained on any lot within the subdivision. \"In 2002, the developer conveyed the remaining 40 lots to a builder by deed that included language identical to that contained in the first 60 deeds. By 2007, the builder had sold all of the 40 lots. Each of these deeds identified each lot as being a part of the subdivision, but did not include the clause relating to mobile homes. On January 30, 2008, a man who had purchased one of the residential lots from the builder placed a mobile home on his property. A woman who owns a lot in the subdivision initiates suit against the man to force him to remove the mobile home. Which of the following would be the most accurate statement of law?\n\nA. There is no enforceable restriction because the mobile-home provision did not \"run with the land. \"\nB. There is no enforceable restriction because the man's deed did not include the mobile-home provision.\nC. The mobile-home restriction would be enforceable because a common development scheme had been established for the entire subdivision.\nD. The outcome turns on whether a common development scheme had been organized for the entire subdivision.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is C: The mobile-home restriction would be enforceable because a common development scheme had been established for the entire subdivision.\n\nWhen a developer creates a subdivision and includes restrictions in the deeds of the initial sales, those restrictions can create a common development scheme if they are intended to apply to all lots in the subdivision. In this case, the original 60 lots were sold with a specific restriction against mobile homes, and the remaining 40 lots were conveyed with identical language, even though the restriction wasn't repeated in the subsequent sales. This suggests an intent to establish a uniform scheme of restrictions for the entire subdivision.\n\nA common development scheme can bind subsequent owners, even if the restrictions aren't explicitly stated in their deeds, if it can be shown that the restrictions were part of a general plan applicable to the whole subdivision and that the later owners had notice of the scheme. Since the original restriction was recorded with the county recorder's office and applied to the entire subdivision, it is likely that a court would find that a common development scheme exists and enforce the restriction against mobile homes.\n\nAnswer D is somewhat redundant, as it essentially asks whether the same condition that makes C true applies. However, C directly states the legal principle at play, while D frames it as an open question about the existence of the scheme."
