This increase in supply does not affect the market price immediately (option B is incorrect) but rather leads to a situation where each existing firm captures a smaller share of the market because consumers now have more alternatives to choose from.\n\nThe entry of new firms would cause the demand curves for existing firms to shift leftward (option D), as some of their customers switch to the new entrants. The demand curve shifts to the left because the quantity demanded at each price level decreases. This happens because the new firms attract some of the customers away from the existing firms, leading to a reduction in sales for the incumbent firms.\n\nOptions A and C are incorrect because:\n\nA. The demand for existing firms would not shift rightward; it would actually shift leftward due to increased competition from new entrants.\n\nC. The demand for existing firms would not become more inelastic. In fact, it might become more elastic as consumers have more substitutes available, making them more sensitive to price changes.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. the demand for existing firms to shift leftward."
