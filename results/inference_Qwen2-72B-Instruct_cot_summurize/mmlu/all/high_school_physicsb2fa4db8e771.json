Thus, options A and D do not affect the period of the pendulum.\n\nOption C refers to the amplitude of the swing, which for small angles (less than about 15 degrees) does not significantly affect the period of a pendulum according to the small-angle approximation used in the simple pendulum model. However, for larger angles, the period can be affected due to the nonlinearity of the forces acting on the pendulum, but this effect is typically negligible or at least much smaller than the effect of changing the length of the pendulum.\n\nTherefore, the only option that would decrease the period of the pendulum is:\n\nB. Decreasing the length of the string\n\nSince the period is directly proportional to the square root of the length of the pendulum, decreasing the length of the string will result in a decrease in the period of the pendulum."
