                    "text": "The Traditional Religion Advocacy Party (TRAP) has successfully lobbied the State of Texarkana for a statute named \"Equal Rights for All Religions.\" The law requires broadcasters that air segments discussing Christianity to allow equal time for segments on Judaism, Islam, Hinduism, and Buddhism. The American Atheism Association (AAA) has put together a broadcast segment about atheism, rejecting all religions, but four of the five Texarkana stations have declined to air the segment because they believe it would violate the statute. AAA has filed suit against the state, challenging the constitutionality of the statute. What is the strongest argument AAA can make in support of striking down the Equal Rights for All Religions statute?\n\nA. The First Amendment prohibits government interference with freedom of the press.\nB. The fact that the statute involves only broadcast media and not print media is an Equal Protection violation.\nC. The First Amendment prohibits government interference with the free exercise of religion.\nD. The statute is not narrowly tailored to promote a compelling governmental interest.\n"

The statute is not narrowly tailored to promote a compelling governmental interest.\n\nWhile A and C are also valid points regarding the First Amendment's protections of freedom of the press and the free exercise of religion, respectively, the argument that the statute is not narrowly tailored to serve a compelling governmental interest directly addresses the issue at hand. This argument focuses on the overreach of the statute in mandating equal time for religious content, which could be seen as an infringement on both freedom of speech and the free exercise clause. Moreover, this argument highlights that the statute may not pass strict scrutiny, which is required for laws that affect fundamental rights or involve suspect classifications. The fact that the statute does not consider non-religious beliefs, such as atheism, further supports the contention that it is not narrowly tailored."
