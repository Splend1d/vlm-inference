The length of the meter stick in the observer's reference frame is given by:\n\n\\[ L = L_0 \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}} \\]\n\nwhere \\(L_0 = 1\\, \\text{m}\\) is the proper length of the meter stick (its length in its rest frame), \\(v = 0.8c\\), and \\(c\\) is the speed of light.\n\nLet's calculate the contracted length \\(L\\):\n\n\\[ L = 1 \\cdot \\sqrt{1 - \\left(\\frac{0.8c}{c}\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{1 - 0.64} = \\sqrt{0.36} = 0.6\\, \\text{m} \\]\n\nNow we can find the time it takes for the meter stick to pass the observer:\n\n\\[ v = 0.8c = 0.8 \\times 3 \\times 10^8\\, \\text{m/s} = 2.4 \\times 10^8\\, \\text{m/s} \\]\n\n\\[ t = \\frac{L}{v} = \\frac{0.6}{2.4 \\times 10^8} = 2.5 \\times 10^{-9}\\, \\text{s} = 2.5\\, \\text{ns} \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. 2.5 ns"
