This action is harmful to others and contributes to criminal activity.\n\nScenario 2: Inviting a student to a romantic evening is inappropriate and violates ethical boundaries, especially if there is an age disparity or power dynamic at play. Engaging in a romantic relationship with a student can be considered a form of abuse of power and is typically against institutional policies and societal expectations."
