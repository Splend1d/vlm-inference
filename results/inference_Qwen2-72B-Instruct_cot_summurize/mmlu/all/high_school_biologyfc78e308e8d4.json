Enhancer\n\nEnhancers are transcription-affecting DNA regions that can increase the likelihood of transcription of a particular gene, and they can be located far away from the promoter, sometimes even on the opposite side of the gene they regulate. They work by looping the DNA so that they come into close proximity with the promoter region."
