The motorcyclist was injured and brought suit against the driver of the car and the driver of the truck. The jury returned a verdict finding that the motorcyclist's injuries were caused by negligence on the part of all three of the parties. The jury assigned 55 percent of the fault for the motorcyclist's injuries to the motorcyclist, 25 percent to the driver of the car, and 20 percent to the driver of the truck. The jury found that the amount of the motorcyclist's injuries was$100,000. The motorcyclist enforces the judgment against the driver of the car and collects $45,000 from the driver of the car. If the driver of the car then brings an action against the driver of the truck for contribution, the driver of the car should\n\nA. recover nothing, because he was more at fault than the driver of the truck.\nB. recover $27,000.\nC. recover $20,000.\nD. recover $15,000.\n"

Given that the jury assigned 25% of the fault to the driver of the car and 20% to the driver of the truck, we need to determine how much the driver of the car is entitled to recover from the driver of the truck based on the principle of contribution.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total amount each party should have contributed based on their assigned percentage of fault:\n\n- Motorcyclist: 55% of $100,000 = $55,000\n- Driver of the car: 25% of $100,000 = $25,000\n- Driver of the truck: 20% of $100,000 = $20,000\n\nSince the driver of the car paid $45,000 but was only responsible for $25,000, they overpaid by $20,000 ($45,000 - $25,000).\n\nThe driver of the car seeks contribution from the driver of the truck, who was supposed to pay $20,000 but did not pay anything. Since the driver of the car has effectively covered the truck driver's share as well (in addition to his own), he can seek contribution for the truck driver's share.\n\nHowever, the question is how much of the truck driver's share can the car driver recover? The car driver cannot recover more than what he overpaid, which is $20,000. Therefore, the driver of the car should recover $20,000 from the driver of the truck.\n\nThe correct answer is C. recover $20,000."
