Unpaired electrons have a spin magnetic moment due to their intrinsic angular momentum (spin) and orbital motion around the nucleus.\n\nAmong the given options:\n- Carbon (C) has an electron configuration of 1s\u00b2 2s\u00b2 2p\u00b2. It has two unpaired electrons in its p-orbitals.\n- Nitrogen (N) has an electron configuration of 1s\u00b2 2s\u00b2 2p\u00b3. It has three unpaired electrons in its p-orbitals.\n- Neon (Ne) has a full valence shell with an electron configuration of 1s\u00b2 2s\u00b2 2p\u2076. It does not have any unpaired electrons.\n- Sulfur (S) has an electron configuration of 1s\u00b2 2s\u00b2 2p\u2076 3s\u00b2 3p\u2074. It has two unpaired electrons in its p-orbitals.\n\nTherefore, the atom that would have the strongest magnetic moment is Nitrogen (N), as it has the most number of unpaired electrons among the given elements.\n\nCorrect answer: B. Nitrogen"
