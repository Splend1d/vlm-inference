Uniformitarianism is the geological principle that the same geological processes we observe today have always been at work throughout Earth's history, shaping the planet over long periods of time through gradual and consistent action.\n\nIn contrast:\n\nA. Natural selection refers to the mechanism proposed by Charles Darwin for evolution, where traits that enhance survival and reproduction become more common in successive generations.\n  \nB. Catastrophism is the theory that Earth's geological features and the extinction of many species were caused by sudden, short-lived, violent events, possibly worldwide in scope.\n  \nD. Unilineal evolution is a theory in anthropology that suggests all societies progress through a series of stages in the same order. This concept does not relate to geological or biological processes but rather to the development of human cultures."
