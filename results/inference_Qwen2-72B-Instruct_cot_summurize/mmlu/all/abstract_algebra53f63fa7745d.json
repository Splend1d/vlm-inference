                    "text": "The first statement is not necessarily true. The equality \\(aH = Ha\\) holds if and only if \\(H\\) is a normal subgroup of \\(G\\). Without the assumption that \\(H\\) is normal, we can only say that \\(aH\\) and \\(Ha\\) are related by the definition of left and right cosets, but they are not necessarily equal. Therefore, the first statement is false.\n\nThe second statement is also false as stated. If \\(H\\) is a normal subgroup of \\(G\\), it means that for every \\(a \\in G\\) and every \\(h \\in H\\), there exists some \\(h' \\in H\\) such that \\(aha^{-1} = h'\\). This is equivalent to saying that \\(aH = Ha\\) for any \\(a \\in G\\), which is not the same as saying that \\(ah = ha\\) for all \\(h \\in H\\). In fact, \\(ah = ha\\) for all \\(h \\in H\\) would imply that \\(H\\) is not just normal but also that it commutes with every element of \\(G\\), which is a stronger condition than being normal.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. False, False\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that if the second statement had said \"for every \\(a \\in G\\) and every \\(h \\in H\\), there exists some \\(h' \\in H\\) such that \\(aha^{-1} = h'\\),\" then it would have been true, because this is the definition of a normal subgroup. But since it directly claims that \\(ah = ha\\) for all \\(h \\in H\\), which is a stronger (and generally false) claim, the statement is false."
