While it's true that older parents may have more financial stability, it's important to note that each of the other statements contains inaccuracies or generalizations. For instance, B is incorrect because older mothers (especially those over 35) are often at higher risk for certain medical complications during pregnancy and birth. C is not necessarily true as all parents, regardless of age, can have expectations about their children's behavior. D is also not universally true, as physical energy levels can vary widely among individuals and are not solely determined by age."
