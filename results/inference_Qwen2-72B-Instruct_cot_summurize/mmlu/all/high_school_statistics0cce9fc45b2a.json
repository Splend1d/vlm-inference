Correlations of +0.87 and -0.87 indicate the same degree of clustering around the regression line.\n\nExplanation:\nA. The correlation coefficient and the slope of the regression line will always have the same sign, as both indicate the direction of the relationship between two variables.\nB. A correlation of 1 indicates a perfect linear relationship between the variables, but it does not imply causation. Correlation only measures the strength and direction of the relationship, not causality.\nD. Correlation applies to quantitative data, not categorical data. Categorical data cannot be used to calculate a correlation coefficient because it does not have numerical values that can be used in mathematical calculations."
