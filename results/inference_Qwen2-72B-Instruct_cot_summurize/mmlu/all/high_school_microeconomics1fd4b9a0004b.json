This happens because at the higher wage, employers may hire fewer workers than they would at the equilibrium wage (because labor becomes more expensive), while at the same time, more people may be willing to work at the higher wage rate. Thus, you have more workers looking for jobs than there are jobs available at that wage rate, leading to a surplus of labor."
