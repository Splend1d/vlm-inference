As people age, there is often a gradual loss of muscle mass (sarcopenia) and a decrease in bone density (osteoporosis), while body fat tends to increase, especially around the abdomen. Therefore, options A and B are incorrect, as bone mass and muscle mass typically decrease with age, not increase. Option D is also incorrect because it includes the incorrect options A and B."
