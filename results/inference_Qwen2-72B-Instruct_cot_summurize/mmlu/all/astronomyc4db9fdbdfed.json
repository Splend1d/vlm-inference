Radioactive dating of lunar samples shows that they are older.\n\nRadioactive dating techniques can determine the age of rocks by measuring the decay of radioactive isotopes within them. Samples brought back from the Moon have been dated using these methods, and the results show that most of the rocks on the Moon's surface are indeed older than those found on Earth's surface. This is because the Earth's surface is continually being reshaped by geological processes such as plate tectonics, erosion, and volcanic activity, which recycle and renew the crust. In contrast, the Moon has no active geology, so its surface features and rocks remain largely unchanged over billions of years."
