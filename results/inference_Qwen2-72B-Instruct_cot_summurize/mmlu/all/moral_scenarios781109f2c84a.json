Tightening the lug nuts on someone's car can be seen as a helpful act, assuming it was done with good intentions and not to cause harm or manipulate a situation. Telling a child they cannot have candy until after dinner is a common parental decision related to discipline and nutrition, and is not considered morally wrong."
