Diverticulitis of the cecum would typically present with right lower quadrant pain, which doesn't match the patient's symptoms.\n\nThe description of band-like, burning pain extending from the epigastrium around to the midline of the back is more consistent with shingles (Herpes zoster), particularly if there is a rash or vesicular eruption in the area described. This condition can affect older adults and may present without a rash initially, but the characteristic dermatomal distribution of pain is highly suggestive of herpes zoster.\n\nTherefore, the most likely diagnosis is:\n\nD.
