If he falls into poverty, even if only through a prolonged illness, he is then completely helpless, exam_ins to his own devices, and society does not currently recognize any real obligation towards him beyond the usual help for the poor, even if he has been working all the time ever so faithfully and diligently. The usual help for the poor, however, leaves a lot to be desired, especially in large cities, where it is very much worse than in the country.\"\nOtto von Bismarck, 1884\nThe long-term effects of Otto von Bismarck's speech include which of the following?\n\nA.

Development of socialized programs throughout much of Europe\n\nOtto von Bismarck's speech highlights the grievances of workers regarding their lack of security and the absence of societal obligations towards them. In response to these issues, Bismarck introduced a series of social insurance programs in Germany during the late 19th century, including health insurance (1883), accident insurance (1884), and old-age insurance (1889). These policies laid the foundation for modern welfare states and inspired the development of similar socialized programs across Europe.\n\nB. Disunity of the German states - This is incorrect because Bismarck's actions actually contributed to the unification of Germany, not its disunity.\n\nC. Communist overhaul of the eastern parts of Germany - This is incorrect because Bismarck's social programs were implemented to counteract the spread of socialism and communism, not to facilitate it.\n\nD. A decrease in German economic output - This is incorrect because Bismarck's social policies did not lead to a decrease in economic output. Instead, they helped to stabilize the workforce and contributed to Germany's economic growth during the late 19th century."
