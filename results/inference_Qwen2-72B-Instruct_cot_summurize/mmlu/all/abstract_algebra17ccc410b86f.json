                    "text": "Statement 1 is true. By definition, an ideal \\(I\\) of a ring \\(R\\) is a subset of \\(R\\) that satisfies the following conditions:\n1. \\((I, +)\\) is a subgroup of \\((R, +)\\).\n2. For every \\(a\\) in \\(I\\) and \\(r\\) in \\(R\\), both \\(ra\\) and \\(ar\\) are in \\(I\\).\n\nThis means that an ideal is closed under addition and additive inverses (making it a subgroup under addition), and it absorbs multiplication by any element of the ring. However, since it also contains the additive identity (from being a subgroup under addition), it can be considered as a subring when viewed simply as a subset with the inherited operations. Therefore, every ideal is indeed a subring of the ring.\n\nStatement 2 is false. A subring \\(S\\) of a ring \\(R\\) is a subset of \\(R\\) that is itself a ring under the same operations as those defined on \\(R\\). This means that \\(S\\) must contain the multiplicative identity of \\(R\\) if \\(R\\) has one (not all rings have multiplicative identities, but when they do, their subrings inherit this property), which is not a requirement for an ideal. Furthermore, while ideals absorb multiplication from any element of the ring, subrings do not necessarily have this property. For example, consider the ring of integers \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\) and its subset of even integers \\(2\\mathbb{Z}\\). \\(2\\mathbb{Z}\\) is a subring of \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\) but not an ideal since multiplying an odd integer by an even integer does not always result in an even integer.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. True, False"
