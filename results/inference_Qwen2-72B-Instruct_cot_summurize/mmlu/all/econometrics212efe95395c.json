It can be particularly useful when:\n\n- The distributional properties of the actual data are unknown, because bootstrapping relies on the empirical distribution of the data rather than assuming a particular theoretical distribution.\n- You want the distributional properties of the data in the experiment to be the same as those of some actual data, since bootstrapping samples from the actual data itself.\n- The sample of actual data available is very small, as bootstrapping can provide more stable estimates under such conditions by creating multiple \"synthetic\" datasets.\n\nGiven these points, the correct answer would be:\n\nC. (i), (ii), and (iv) only\n\nHowever, strictly speaking, (ii) is not accurate because if the distributional properties are known exactly, one might prefer pure simulation using the known distribution instead of bootstrapping. Therefore, the most accurate answer considering the nuances would be:\n\nB. (i) and (iii) only\n\nBut based on the options provided and common understanding of when bootstrapping is typically preferred, C might be considered the best choice if we assume that (ii) was intended to be interpreted loosely. However, the strictest interpretation of the question would favor B."
