He identified three such rights: the right to life, the right to liberty, and the right to property. The right to citizenship, however, is not one of these natural rights as conceived by Locke. Citizenship typically refers to membership in a political community, which is a status conferred by law or custom rather than being an inherent aspect of human nature."
