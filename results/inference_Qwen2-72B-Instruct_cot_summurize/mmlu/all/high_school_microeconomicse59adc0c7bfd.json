This allows the monopsonist to pay workers less than what their marginal revenue product would be in a perfectly competitive market. In a competitive labor market, the wage would equal the marginal revenue product of labor, but in a monopsony, the wage is set below this level due to the monopsonist's market power.\n\nThe other options do not accurately describe a monopsonist:\nB. Employment level is actually lower than that of a competitive labor market because the monopsonist hires fewer workers at a lower wage rate.\nC. A wage payment higher than that of a competitive labor market would not occur in a monopsony; rather, wages are typically lower.\nD. A single seller of labor services would imply a monopoly on the supply side, which is not the same as a monopsony where there is a single or dominant buyer."
