X-ray crystallographic analysis of the calculus showed calcium as the primary cation. Physical examination today shows no abnormalities. A 24-hour collection of urine shows increased calcium excretion. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy?\n\nA. Carbonic anhydrase inhibitor\nB. Na+ \u2013Cl\u2212 symport inhibitor\nC. Na+ \u2013K + \u20132Cl\u2212 symport inhibitor\nD. Osmotic diuretic\n"

                    "text": "The most appropriate pharmacotherapy for a patient with hypercalciuria (increased calcium excretion) and a history of passing a calcium renal calculus would be a thiazide diuretic, which is not listed among your options but is functionally similar to option C, a Na+\u2013K+\u20132Cl\u2212 symport inhibitor.\n\nThiazide diuretics inhibit the Na+\u2013Cl\u2212 cotransporter in the distal convoluted tubule, but they also have effects on the Na+\u2013K+\u20132Cl\u2212 cotransporter in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle, leading to increased excretion of sodium and chloride and decreased excretion of potassium and calcium. By decreasing the amount of calcium that is filtered by the kidneys and increasing its reabsorption, thiazide diuretics can reduce the risk of calcium stone formation.\n\nOption A, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, such as acetazolamide, is used primarily to treat glaucoma and to prevent altitude sickness. It does not target hypercalciuria directly.\n\nOption B, a Na+\u2013Cl\u2212 symport inhibitor, such as loop diuretics (furosemide), increases the excretion of sodium, chloride, and water, but it does not have a significant effect on reducing urinary calcium excretion compared to thiazides.\n\nOption D, an osmotic diuretic, such as mannitol, increases urine output by creating an osmotic gradient that prevents water reabsorption in the kidney. This is not typically used for the prevention of calcium stones.\n\nTherefore, while not explicitly listed, the treatment closest to what would be recommended for this patient would be a thiazide diuretic, which functions similarly to a Na+\u2013K+\u20132Cl\u2212 symport inhibitor (option C). However, it's important to note that the specific medication choice should be made by a healthcare provider based on the patient's medical history and current health status."
