By modeling their three-digit numbers with base ten blocks on a place value mat, students are breaking down (decomposing) those numbers into hundreds, tens, and ones, which is an essential skill in understanding place value and the structure of multi-digit numbers. This activity helps students visualize how each digit in a number contributes to its overall value based on its position."
