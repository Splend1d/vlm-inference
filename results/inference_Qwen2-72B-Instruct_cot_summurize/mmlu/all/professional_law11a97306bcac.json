The brothers took the wife hostage, pointed a gun at her head, and demanded that she drive them in her car to their hideout. As the wife was driving down the street, a woman pushing her baby in a stroller suddenly stopped in the middle of the intersection. In order to avoid hitting the woman and her child, the wife veered the car to the left, and intentionally struck a bystander, instantly killing him. If the wife is subsequently prosecuted for the murder of the bystander, she will most likely be found\n\nA. guilty, because she intentionally veered the car, striking the bystander.\nB. not guilty, by reason of necessity.\nC. not guilty, by reason of duress.\nD. not guilty, by reason of self-defense.\n"

In this case, the wife was being forced to drive under threat of violence from the kidnappers, which would constitute duress. Additionally, her actions were taken to avoid an imminent danger (hitting the woman and her child) and could potentially fall under the legal defense of necessity, but duress seems more directly applicable given the circumstances of coercion by the kidnappers. However, both B and C could be valid defenses depending on the jurisdiction and specific legal interpretations."
