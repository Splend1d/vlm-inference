To close this gap, fiscal policy should aim to reduce aggregate demand.\n\nOption D: \"The government increases taxes and decreases spending\" would be the most effective fiscal policy in this scenario. Increasing taxes reduces disposable income, which can lower consumption and overall demand. Decreasing government spending also directly reduces aggregate demand. Both actions work together to help close the inflationary gap by reducing the total demand in the economy, thereby helping to control inflation."
