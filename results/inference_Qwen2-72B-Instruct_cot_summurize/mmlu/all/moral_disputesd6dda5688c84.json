Shapiro's discussion of Mediterranean cultures' use of alcohol highlights that even in cultures where alcohol consumption is relatively low, there can still be high levels of alcoholism. He also notes that moderate consumption of certain types of alcohol, such as red wine, has been linked to potential health benefits. Additionally, he points out that increased use of a drug does not necessarily result in increased addiction, as cultural and social factors can play a significant role in how substances are used and abused."
