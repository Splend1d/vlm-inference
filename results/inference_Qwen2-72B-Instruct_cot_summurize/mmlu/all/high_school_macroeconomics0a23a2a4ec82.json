Monetarists, led by economist Milton Friedman, argue that central banks should focus on maintaining a steady growth rate in the money supply to achieve price stability and avoid both inflation and deflation. They believe that this approach is more effective than using monetary policy to fine-tune the economy (option A), as they consider such attempts to be prone to error and potentially destabilizing.\n\nMonetarists do not necessarily claim that crowding out is not a problem (option B). Crowding out refers to the phenomenon where increased government spending leads to higher interest rates, which can discourage private investment. While monetarists might have views on this issue, it is not a core tenet of monetarism.\n\nRegarding option D, monetarists do not typically assert that the velocity of money is inherently unstable. Instead, they often argue that the velocity of money can be relatively stable over the long term but can become unpredictable when monetary policy is erratic or when there are significant changes in economic conditions. However, this is not the defining feature of monetarism."
