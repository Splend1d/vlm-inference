Great responsibilities have been placed upon us by the swift movement of events. . . . I am confident that the Congress will face these responsibilities squarely.\"\n\u2014President Harry S.

President Truman's words reflect the belief that poverty, strife, and the loss of hope create conditions in which totalitarian regimes can take hold. By keeping the hope of a better life alive, he suggests that the U.S. can prevent the spread of such regimes. This aligns with the policy of containment, which was aimed at preventing the spread of communism during the Cold War."
