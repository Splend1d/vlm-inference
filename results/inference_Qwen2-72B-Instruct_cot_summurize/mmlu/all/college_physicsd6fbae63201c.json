Let's denote the initial refractive index of the gas as \\( n \\). The optical path length (OPL) through the gas cell when filled with the gas is given by \\( n \\times L \\), where \\( L \\) is the physical path length (10 cm or 0.1 m in this case).\n\nWhen the gas is evacuated, the refractive index approaches that of vacuum (or air, which we can consider as approximately 1 for this purpose). So, the OPL becomes approximately equal to the physical path length, \\( L \\).\n\nThe change in OPL, \\( \\Delta\\text{OPL} \\), is thus:\n\n\\[ \\Delta\\text{OPL} = nL - L = L(n-1) \\]\n\nGiven that 100 fringes are counted as the gas is being evacuated, and using the relation between fringes and OPL change:\n\n\\[ 100 = \\frac{L(n-1)}{\\lambda} \\]\n\n\\[ 100 = \\frac{0.1(n-1)}{632.2 \\times 10^{-9}} \\]\n\nSolving for \\( n \\):\n\n\\[ 100 = \\frac{0.1(n-1)}{6.322 \\times 10^{-7}} \\]\n\n\\[ 100 \\times 6.322 \\times 10^{-7} = 0.1(n-1) \\]\n\n\\[ 6.322 \\times 10^{-5} = n-1 \\]\n\n\\[ n = 1 + 6.322 \\times 10^{-5} \\]\n\n\\[ n = 1.00006322 \\]\n\nThe closest option to this value is:\n\nA. 1.00063\n\nSo, the answer is A. 1.00063."
