A sonic boom is produced when an aircraft travels through the air at supersonic speeds, which is faster than the speed of sound. This creates a shock wave that can be heard as a loud boom on the ground below. Option A is also technically correct since breaking the sound barrier refers to accelerating past the speed of sound, but option C is more specific and accurate in this context. Option B is not related to producing a sonic boom. Therefore, the best answer is C."
