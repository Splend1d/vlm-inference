In Russia and China, there have been restrictions placed on the activities of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and civil society groups by the government, making it difficult for them to operate freely. In contrast, Britain has a long history of a strong civil society, with a tradition of voluntary action and community involvement that dates back centuries. The British government also provides funding and support for NGOs and community groups, which helps to strengthen civil society in the country."
