This is catalyzed by the enzyme glycogen phosphorylase. The glucose-1-phosphate can then be converted to glucose-6-phosphate by the enzyme phosphoglucomutase, which can enter glycolysis for energy production or be used in other metabolic pathways. However, the immediate product of glycogen breakdown is glucose-1-phosphate."
