If he falls into poverty, even if only through a prolonged illness, he is then completely helpless, exam_ins to his own devices, and society does not currently recognize any real obligation towards him beyond the usual help for the poor, even if he has been working all the time ever so faithfully and diligently. The usual help for the poor, however, leaves a lot to be desired, especially in large cities, where it is very much worse than in the country.\"\nOtto von Bismarck, 1884\nHow would twentieth-century economist John Maynard Keynes suggest that society address Otto von Bismarck's evaluation of workers in Germany?\n\nA. Keynes would recommend government intervention in order to maintain aggregate demand.\nB. Keynes would suggest helping elderly workers, but claim that the government should not intervene in most circumstances.\nC. Keynes would caution against government intervention in personal economic matters.\nD. Keynes would advocate doing nothing because he felt poverty in rural areas was actually more severe than it was in cities.\n"

Keynes would recommend government intervention in order to maintain aggregate demand.\n\nJohn Maynard Keynes was a proponent of active government intervention in the economy, particularly during times of recession or depression, to stimulate demand and provide economic stability. He believed that governments should spend money and/or cut taxes to boost aggregate demand when private spending was insufficient, which could help alleviate the grievances of workers by providing them with more job security and better social welfare programs."
