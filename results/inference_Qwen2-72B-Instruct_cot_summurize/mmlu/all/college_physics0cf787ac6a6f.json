                    "text": "The particle's velocity vector is tangential to the circle since it is moving along the circumference. The particle's acceleration can be broken down into two components: centripetal acceleration and tangential acceleration.\n\nThe centripetal acceleration is given by \\(a_c = \\frac{v^2}{r}\\), where \\(v\\) is the speed and \\(r\\) is the radius. In this case, \\(v = 10\\) m/s and \\(r = 10\\) m, so the centripetal acceleration is \\(a_c = \\frac{(10)^2}{10} = 10\\) m/s\u00b2 directed radially inward towards the center of the circle.\n\nThe tangential acceleration is given as \\(10\\) m/s\u00b2, which is directed in the direction of motion along the tangent to the circle.\n\nThus, we have a right-angled triangle formed by the two acceleration components (centripetal and tangential) and the total acceleration. Since both components have equal magnitude (\\(10\\) m/s\u00b2), the angle between them is \\(45\u00b0\\).\n\nHowever, we need the angle between the velocity vector and the total acceleration vector. Since the velocity vector is aligned with the tangential acceleration, the angle between the velocity and the total acceleration is the same as the angle between the tangential acceleration and the total acceleration.\n\nTherefore, the angle between the particle's velocity and acceleration vectors is \\(45\u00b0\\).\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nC. 45\u00b0"
