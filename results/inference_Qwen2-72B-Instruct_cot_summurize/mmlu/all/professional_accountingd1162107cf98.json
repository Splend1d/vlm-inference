In year 1, the company acquired the land for $100,000. At the end of year 1, the carrying amount was reduced to $90,000, which represented the fair value at that date. At the end of year 2, the land was revalued, and the fair value increased to $105,000. How should the company account for the year 2 change in fair value?\n\nA. By recognizing $10,000 in other comprehensive income.\nB. By recognizing $15,000 in other comprehensive income.\nC. By recognizing $15,000 in profit or loss.\nD. By recognizing $10,000 in profit or loss and $5,000 in other comprehensive income.\n"

It was revalued down to $90,000 at the end of year 1, resulting in a $10,000 loss recognized in profit or loss. At the end of year 2, the land was revalued up to $105,000. The $15,000 increase includes the $10,000 to reverse the previous loss recognized in profit or loss and the additional $5,000 gain that would be recognized in other comprehensive income.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. By recognizing $10,000 in profit or loss (reversal of the previous loss) and $5,000 in other comprehensive income (the excess over the original cost after reversing the previous loss)."
