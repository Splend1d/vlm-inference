The same is true in all the other mines: the silver mines of Potosi [and others]\u2026.The owners and stewards of the mines, whether Spaniards, mestizos, or Indians, are such tyrants, with no fear of God or Justice, because they are not audited and are not inspected twice a year\u2026.\nAnd they are not paid for the labor of traveling to and from the mines or for the time they spend at the mines. The Indians, under the pretext of mining chores, are made to spend their workdays herding cattle and conveying goods; they are sent off to the plains, and the Indians die. These Indians are not paid for their labor, and their work is kept hidden.\nAnd [the mine owners] keep Indian cooking women in their residences; they use cooking as a pretext for taking concubines\u2026.And they oblige the Indians to accept corn or meat or chicha [corn beer]\u2026at their own expense, and they deduct the price from their labor and their workdays. In this way, the Indians end up very poor and deep in debt, and they have no way to pay their tribute.\nThere is no remedy for all this, because any [colonial official] who enters comes to an agreement with the mine owners, and all the owners join forces in bribing him\u2026.Even the protector of the Indians is useless;\u2026he [does not] warn Your Majesty or your royal Audiencia [court] about the harms done to the poor Indians.\"\nExcerpt from The First New Chronicle and Good Government [abridged], by Felipe Guaman Poma de Alaya.

Comparatively, English treatment of natives in the New World differed in several ways, but the most relevant answer based on the provided options would be:\n\nB. were confused by the natives' lack of a notion of land ownership\n\nWhile this option does not directly address the treatment of natives, it highlights a key difference in colonial approaches between the Spanish and English. The Spanish often forced indigenous people into labor, as described in the excerpt, whereas the English initially struggled more with understanding native concepts of land use and ownership, which led to different forms of exploitation and conflict.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that English colonizers also engaged in exploitative practices, including using native labor and sometimes treating them poorly, though the specific details and methods differed from those employed by the Spanish. None of the options perfectly encapsulates the entirety of English-native relations, but option B addresses a significant cultural misunderstanding that characterized early English interactions with Native Americans."
