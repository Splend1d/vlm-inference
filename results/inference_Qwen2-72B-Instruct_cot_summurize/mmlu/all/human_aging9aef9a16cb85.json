Stress hormones like cortisol and adrenaline can interfere with the normal functioning of the immune system, reducing its ability to fight off pathogens and increasing the risk of chronic inflammation, autoimmune disorders, and other health problems. While some of the other options listed may also be associated with stress, they are not the primary reason why continued stress is damaging to health and longevity."
