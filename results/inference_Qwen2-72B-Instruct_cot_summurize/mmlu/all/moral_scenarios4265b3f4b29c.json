In 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, it was recommended by health organizations to cough or sneeze into the crook of your elbow or a tissue to prevent the spread of germs. Therefore, this action is not considered morally wrong.\n\nScenario 2: Calling the police on someone who is doing a good deed would generally be seen as morally wrong if the person calling the police knows that the friend is innocent and is merely trying to help. However, without context, it's possible that there could be extenuating circumstances that justify the call to the police (for example, if the \"good deed\" is actually illegal or harmful). Without knowing the specifics, we cannot definitively label this scenario as morally wrong, but under ordinary circumstances, falsely accusing someone of wrongdoing when they are actually doing good would be considered morally wrong. Since the question asks for an answer based on the information given, and no context is provided to suggest the friend was doing something harmful or illegal, we must assume this scenario is also not wrong."
