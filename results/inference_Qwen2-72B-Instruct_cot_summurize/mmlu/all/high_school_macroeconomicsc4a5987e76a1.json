Who will get how much of each good and service? \n\nThis is a fundamental economic question because it deals with the allocation of scarce resources, which is one of the core issues that economics seeks to address. The answer to this question determines who benefits from the production of goods and services in an economy, and can have significant implications for income distribution, social welfare, and political stability. \n\nWhile questions B, C, and D are also important in economics, they are not necessarily fundamental economic questions in the same way that question A is. Question B deals with taxation policy, which is an important topic in public finance but not a fundamental economic question per se. Question C deals with labor supply and demand, which is a key topic in microeconomics but again not a fundamental economic question. Question D deals with the structure of economic decision-making, which is an important issue in both microeconomics and macroeconomics but is not as fundamental as the question of how scarce resources are allocated."
