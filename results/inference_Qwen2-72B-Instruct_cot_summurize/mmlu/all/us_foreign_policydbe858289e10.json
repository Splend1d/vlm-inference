Reciprocity across multiple issues: This refers to the mutual exchange of concessions or benefits between countries. For example, one country might reduce tariffs on imports from another country in exchange for that country doing the same.\n\nB. Reputational concerns of the actors: Countries often care about their reputations on the global stage and may be more likely to adhere to agreements if they believe that not doing so could harm their reputation. This can lead to compliance with trade agreements due to the desire to maintain a positive image.\n\nC. Side payments for adjusting to the organization (such as the Common Agricultural Policy in the EU): These are financial compensations or subsidies provided to help countries or sectors adjust to new trade rules. The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) is an example of how the European Union supports its agricultural sector through direct payments and market measures, which can help farmers cope with changes brought about by trade agreements."
