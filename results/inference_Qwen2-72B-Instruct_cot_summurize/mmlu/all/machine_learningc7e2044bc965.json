While it's true that under certain conditions (like the Gauss-Markov theorem conditions), the ordinary least squares (OLS) estimator in linear regression is the best linear unbiased estimator (BLUE), meaning it has the smallest variance among all linear unbiased estimators, this doesn't necessarily extend to all unbiased estimators. There can be non-linear unbiased estimators with smaller variances under different conditions.\n\nStatement 2: This statement is true. In AdaBoost, which stands for Adaptive Boosting, each classifier is given a weight \\(\\alpha\\) that reflects its accuracy. If a classifier performs better than random guessing, it gets a positive weight. Since AdaBoost assigns weights based on performance and aims to improve the overall ensemble by focusing more on previously misclassified examples, all classifiers that contribute positively to the ensemble will have non-negative weights. Classifiers that perform worse than random guessing could theoretically get negative weights, but in practice, such classifiers would not be included in the ensemble as they do not improve the model's performance."
