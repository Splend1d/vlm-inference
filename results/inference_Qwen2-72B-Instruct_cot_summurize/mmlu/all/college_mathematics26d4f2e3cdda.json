This typically occurs when \\(n\\) is prime or has certain special properties related to its factors.\n\n- A prime number \\(p\\) always has exactly one group of order \\(p\\), which is cyclic (\\(\\mathbb{Z}_p\\)).\n- If \\(n\\) is not prime but square-free (not divisible by any square number other than 1) and the product of distinct primes, it can also have a unique group structure, though this depends on more specific conditions.\n- If \\(n\\) has repeated prime factors or can be factored into smaller numbers in multiple ways, then there may be more than one non-isomorphic group of order \\(n\\).\n\nLet's examine the options:\n\nA. For no such integer \\(n\\)\n\nThis is incorrect because we know that for prime numbers, there is exactly one group of that order up to isomorphism.\n\nB. For 3, 5, 7, and 11 only\n\nThese are all prime numbers, and each has a unique group of that order (\\(\\mathbb{Z}_n\\)). However, this does not consider the possibility of other integers within the given range having a unique group structure.\n\nC. For 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11 only\n\n9 is not a prime number; it is \\(3^2\\). The number of groups of order \\(p^2\\) (where \\(p\\) is prime) is either 1 or 2, depending on whether \\(p = 2\\) or \\(p > 2\\). Since \\(9 = 3^2\\), there are two non-isomorphic groups of order 9: \\(\\mathbb{Z}_9\\) and \\(\\mathbb{Z}_3 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_3\\). Thus, including 9 in the list is incorrect.\n\nD. For 4, 6, 8, and 10 only\n\n4 is \\(2^2\\), and as mentioned, there are two non-isomorphic groups of order \\(p^2\\) if \\(p > 2\\). So, there are two groups of order 4: \\(\\mathbb{Z}_4\\) and \\(\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2\\).\n\n6 is \\(2 \\times 3\\), and while there are two groups of order 6 (\\(\\mathbb{Z}_6\\) and \\(S_3\\)), both are considered here, implying there is not just one group of order 6.\n\n8 is \\(2^3\\), and there are five non-isomorphic groups of order 8: \\(\\mathbb{Z}_8\\), \\(\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_4\\), \\(\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2\\), \\(Q_8\\) (the quaternion group), and \\(D_4\\) (the dihedral group of order 8).\n\n10 is \\(2 \\times 5\\), and there are two non-isomorphic groups of order 10: \\(\\mathbb{Z}_{10}\\) and \\(D_5\\) (the dihedral group of order 10).\n\nGiven these explanations, the correct answer is:\n\nB. For 3, 5, 7, and 11 only\n\nThese are all prime numbers, and each has a unique group of that order up to isomorphism."
