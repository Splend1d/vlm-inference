However, finding this global optimum depends on the optimization algorithm and its implementation details.\n\nIn principle, all three algorithms listed\u2014Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Mini-Batch Gradient Descent, and Batch Gradient Descent\u2014can find the global minimum for such a model given enough time and appropriate settings for their hyperparameters. The choice between them might depend on factors like computational resources, data size, and convergence speed.\n\n1. **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)** updates the weights using only a single training example at a time. It is computationally efficient and can escape local minima in non-convex problems, but for a convex problem like this, it can still converge to the global minimum, albeit possibly with more oscillations due to its high variance.\n\n2. **Mini-Batch Gradient Descent** uses a small batch of data for each update, combining some of the benefits of both SGD and Batch Gradient Descent. It reduces the variance compared to SGD and can converge faster than Batch Gradient Descent for large datasets.\n\n3. **Batch Gradient Descent** computes the gradient using the entire dataset, which can lead to more stable updates but requires more memory and can be slower for very large datasets.\n\nGiven that the problem space is convex, any of these methods can theoretically find the global optimum if the learning rate is properly annealed over time or if an appropriate stopping criterion is set. Therefore, the correct answer to your question would be:\n\n**D. All of the above**\n\nHowever, in practice, the choice of algorithm and its parameters should be based on the specific characteristics of the data and the computing environment."
