This phenomenon is known as the inert pair effect. As a result, thallium (Tl), being the heaviest element in this group, exhibits the greatest stabilization of its valence s-electrons, making the +1 oxidation state significantly more stable than the +3 oxidation state.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Tl (Thallium)."
