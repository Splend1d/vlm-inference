According to Stevenson, when we make a statement like \"X is good,\" we are expressing approval of X and attempting to influence others' attitudes toward X. This view does not accommodate the idea of goodness as an objective feature of the world that can be known independently of our experiences or attitudes (a priori).\n\nStevenson would likely argue that the concept of goodness as an objective, a priori property is either incoherent or at least not something that can be captured within his emotivist framework. He might suggest that what people take to be objective features of morality are actually just widely shared attitudes, or that appeals to objectivity are attempts to persuade others by invoking the authority of some supposed external standard.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. He claims he does not understand such a property."
