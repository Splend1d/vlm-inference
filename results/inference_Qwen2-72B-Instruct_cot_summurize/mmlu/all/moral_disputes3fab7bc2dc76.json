Singer is a prominent advocate for animal rights and argues that animals should be treated with equal consideration because they can experience suffering, just like humans. He believes that we should minimize suffering and give equal consideration to the interests of all beings capable of suffering. This principle is often referred to as the principle of equal consideration of interests."
