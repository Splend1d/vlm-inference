Generally, the more oxygen atoms there are, the stronger the acid, because the extra oxygen atoms stabilize the negative charge on the conjugate base.\n\nAmong the options given:\n\n- A. HBrO (Hypobromous acid)\n- B. HClO (Hypochlorous acid)\n- C. HIO (Hypoiodous acid)\n- D. HClO3 (Chloric acid)\n\nHClO3 has more oxygen atoms bonded to the central chlorine atom than any of the other options. This means it will have a higher ability to stabilize the negative charge after losing a proton, making it the strongest acid among these choices.\n\nSo the answer is D. HClO3."
