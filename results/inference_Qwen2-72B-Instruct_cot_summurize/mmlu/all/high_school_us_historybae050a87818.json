Sir, we have done everything that could be done, to avert the storm which is now coming on. We have petitioned; we have remonstrated; we have supplicated; we have prostrated ourselves before the throne, and have implored its interposition to arrest the tyrannical hands of the ministry and Parliament. Our petitions have been slighted; our remonstrances have produced additional violence and insult; our supplications have been disregarded; and we have been spurned, with contempt, from the foot of the throne. In vain, after these things, may we indulge the fond hope of peace and reconciliation. There is no longer any room for hope.\u2026 It is in vain, sir, to extenuate the matter. Gentlemen may cry, Peace, Peace, but there is no peace. The war is actually begun! The next gale that sweeps from the north will bring to our ears the clash of resounding arms! Our brethren are already in the field! Why stand we here idle? What is it that gentlemen wish? What would they have? Is life so dear, or peace so sweet, as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery? Forbid it, Almighty God! I know not what course others may take; but as for me, give me liberty or give me death!\n\u2014Patrick Henry, March 23, 1775\nThe \"storm\" that Henry refers to was most directly the result of which of the following?\n\nA. American efforts to trade with Spain and France\nB. British efforts to shrink a budget deficit after the French and Indian War\nC. British unwillingness to fight Indian tribes on the frontier\nD. British impressments of American sailors and interference with American trade\n"

Following the costly French and Indian War (also known as the Seven Years' War), Britain was left with significant debt and sought to raise revenue through various taxes and acts imposed on the American colonies. This included measures like the Stamp Act, the Townshend Acts, and the Tea Act, which led to growing unrest and contributed to the tensions that erupted into the American Revolution."
