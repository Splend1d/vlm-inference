It measures how much a change in taxes affects total economic output. The larger the tax multiplier in magnitude, the greater the effect of a tax change on the economy.\n\nWhen the MPC increases, it means that a larger portion of any additional income is spent rather than saved. This leads to a larger tax multiplier because if more of people's income is spent after taxes, then changes in taxes will have a larger effect on aggregate demand and thus on the overall level of economic activity. Conversely, if the MPC decreases (meaning the MPS or marginal propensity to save increases), the tax multiplier decreases in magnitude because less of any additional income is spent, so changes in taxes have a smaller effect on the economy.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. the MPC increases."
