For the same \u03b1, as the number of degrees of freedom increases, the critical value for the rejection region decreases.\n\nThis statement is incorrect because, in fact, as the degrees of freedom increase, the critical value for the rejection region increases for a given significance level (\u03b1). This is because the \u03c7\u00b2 distribution becomes more symmetric and bell-shaped as the degrees of freedom increase, which means that larger values are required to reach the same tail probability for rejecting the null hypothesis."
