While it's true that most life on Earth requires the ability to breathe oxygen (option A) or the ability to make energy from sunlight or to eat things that do (option B), there are some exceptions. For example, some organisms can survive in environments with little to no oxygen, and some can create energy through chemosynthesis instead of photosynthesis. However, a source of organic molecules (option C) is generally considered an essential requirement for life as we know it. Therefore, options A and B are not absolute requirements for all forms of life."
