Public figures often have less expectation of privacy in public spaces.\n\nIn Scenario 2, reporting a guard who is smuggling narcotics into a prison and selling them to prisoners is clearly the right thing to do according to ordinary moral standards. This action helps prevent illegal activity and potential harm to others."
