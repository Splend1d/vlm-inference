Africa\n\nThe risk of HIV transmission from an infected mother to her fetus/infant is highest in Africa, particularly Sub-Saharan Africa, due to a combination of factors including higher rates of HIV infection, limited access to healthcare and antiretroviral therapy, and challenges in implementing prevention programs. However, it's important to note that with proper treatment and care, the risk of mother-to-child transmission can be significantly reduced."
