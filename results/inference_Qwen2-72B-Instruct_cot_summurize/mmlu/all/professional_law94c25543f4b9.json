Marital Communication Privilege.\n\nMarital Communication Privilege protects private communications between spouses from being disclosed without the consent of both parties. This privilege applies whether the communication was verbal or written and whether it occurred before or during the marriage. However, the privilege can be waived if the communication was made in a public place and overheard by others, as in this case. But the initial objection would be based on Marital Communication Privilege. \n\nHowever, it's important to note that the specifics of how the court rules could depend on the jurisdiction and the specific details of the case. In some jurisdictions, the fact that the statement was made in a public place where it could be overheard by others might negate the marital privilege, making the statement admissible. But based on the given options, B is the most likely initial objection that the defense would make."
