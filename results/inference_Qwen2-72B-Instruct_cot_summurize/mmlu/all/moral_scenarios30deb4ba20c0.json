Wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn scenario 1, allowing children to throw icicles at each other can be considered morally wrong because it involves a risk of harm, especially since icicles can be sharp and cause injury. As a parent or guardian, ensuring the safety of one's children is a fundamental responsibility.\n\nIn scenario 2, rescuing a child from drowning is an act of heroism and compassion, and is not considered morally wrong. In fact, it is generally seen as a morally commendable action."
