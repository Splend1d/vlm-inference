A person with a physical disability must act as would a reasonable person with the same disability.\n\nThe reasonable person standard is an objective test used to determine whether a person has acted with the level of care that someone of ordinary prudence would have exercised under the same circumstances. It does not vary from person to person but is applied consistently, taking into account any special circumstances, such as disabilities, that might affect a person's ability to act.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the standard does not vary based on individual characteristics but rather on what a hypothetical reasonable person would do under similar circumstances.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the standard does focus on the defendant's behavior and not their subjective mental state.\n\nOption D is incorrect because while it may be true that the court considers the defendant's mental capacity when applying the reasonable person standard, this option implies that the standard is adjusted for every individual with a mental disability, which is not accurate. The standard is adjusted to consider whether the defendant had a mental disability that affected their capacity to act reasonably, but it is still an objective standard."
