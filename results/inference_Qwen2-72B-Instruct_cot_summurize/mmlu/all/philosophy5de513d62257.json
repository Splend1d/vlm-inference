Instead, her emphasis was on understanding the nature of actions and intentions as they relate to moral responsibility and ethical decision-making. Therefore, option B best represents what Anscombe claimed would be part of an adequate moral psychology.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that the other options (A, C) might also be indirectly relevant or intertwined with Anscombe's overall philosophical concerns, but they are not explicitly claimed by her as essential components of an adequate moral psychology in the same way that analyzing concepts like action and intention are. So, the most accurate answer given the options provided is B. But if we were to interpret D as including those aspects that Anscombe did indeed discuss within her broader philosophical framework, then D could also be seen as correct, albeit in a more interpretative sense."
