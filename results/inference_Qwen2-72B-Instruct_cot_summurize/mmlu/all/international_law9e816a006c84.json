                    "text": "The unlawful homicide committed by a Minister of a country while abroad is generally not considered an act jure imperii (act of sovereignty) but rather an act jure gestionis (private act). Acts jure imperii refer to actions taken by a state in its sovereign capacity, such as entering into treaties or deploying military forces. Acts jure gestionis, on the other hand, are actions that could be performed by any private individual or entity.\n\nIn this case, committing a crime such as murder would be considered a private act, and thus option C seems to be the most accurate answer. However, it's important to note that the issue of immunity can complicate matters. Under international law, certain officials may have functional or personal immunity from jurisdiction in foreign courts for acts performed in their official capacity. This immunity does not automatically apply to private acts, but there may be diplomatic considerations that could lead to temporary immunity being granted, especially if the official is still serving in their position.\n\nThus, while the act itself is jure gestionis, there might be circumstances where the individual could claim immunity (option D), although this would not change the nature of the act itself. The assertion of immunity in such cases is often controversial and subject to the laws and policies of the host country and international legal principles. Option B is incorrect because immunity can potentially be claimed, even if it is not always granted, depending on the circumstances and the laws of the countries involved. Option A is incorrect because committing a crime is not an act of state sovereignty."
