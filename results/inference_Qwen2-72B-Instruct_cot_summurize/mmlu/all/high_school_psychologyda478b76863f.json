This system triggers the release of stress hormones such as adrenaline (epinephrine) and cortisol from the adrenal glands. These hormones prepare the body for the 'fight-or-flight' response by increasing heart rate, blood pressure, and energy levels, while decreasing non-essential functions like digestion."
