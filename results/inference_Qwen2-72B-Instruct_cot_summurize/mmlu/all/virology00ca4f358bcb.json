Bunyaviruses have three segments of negative-sense, single-stranded RNA. They use a unique mechanism for transcription that involves the synthesis of complementary positive-sense RNA strands from their negative-sense genome.\n\nB. Highly mutable RNA viruses\n\nWhile all RNA viruses have higher mutation rates than DNA viruses due to the lack of proofreading capabilities of RNA polymerases, this is not a defining characteristic specific to bunyaviruses.\n\nC. Emerging viruses via arthropod vector\n\nMany bunyaviruses are indeed transmitted by arthropods such as mosquitoes and ticks, but this is not a genetic characteristic; it's more related to their mode of transmission.\n\nD. Use an RT enzyme\n\nBunyaviruses do not use reverse transcriptase (RT) enzymes. These enzymes are typically associated with retroviruses, which convert their RNA genomes into DNA during replication. Bunyaviruses replicate and transcribe their RNA genomes directly without converting them into DNA.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer is A. Three segmented negative stranded RNA viruses with anti-sense expression."
