A cross-sequential cohort design\n\nThis type of study design involves following multiple cohorts (in this case, different age groups) over time, allowing researchers to examine both age effects and cohort effects. The fact that participants are assessed longitudinally rules out options that involve only cross-sectional designs (options D). It's not a true experiment (option A) because there is no random assignment to conditions (alcoholic parent vs. non-alcoholic parent); instead, the condition is naturally occurring. It's also not a natural experiment (option C), which would require a specific, naturally occurring event that affects some members of the population but not others in a way that resembles experimental manipulation. In this scenario, the presence or absence of an alcoholic parent is not an event that can be considered as randomly assigned by nature."
