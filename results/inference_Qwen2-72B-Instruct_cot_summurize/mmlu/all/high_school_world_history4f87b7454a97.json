The poem \"To Roosevelt\" by Ruben Dario was written in 1904, which was around the time when the United States was involved in the Panamanian independence movement, leading to the construction of the Panama Canal. This event sparked concerns among Latin American countries about U.S. intentions and potential imperialist ambitions in the region. The poem reflects these concerns and expresses a defense of Latin American culture and identity against perceived threats from the United States."
