This is because the defendant's actions were premeditated and deliberate, as evidenced by his pulling out a gun and firing four shots at his boss. The fact that the bullet ricocheted does not negate the intent to kill or cause serious harm. Therefore, the defendant can be charged with murder, which is the unlawful killing of another person with malice aforethought."
