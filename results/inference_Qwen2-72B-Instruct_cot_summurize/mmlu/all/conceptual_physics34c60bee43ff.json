Therefore, to calculate the intensity ratio between two sounds, you can use the formula:\n\nIntensity Ratio = 10^((L2 - L1) / 10)\n\nwhere L2 and L1 are the decibel levels of the louder and softer sounds, respectively.\n\nIn this case, we have:\n\nIntensity Ratio = 10^((80 - 60) / 10)\nIntensity Ratio = 10^(20 / 10)\nIntensity Ratio = 10^2\nIntensity Ratio = 100\n\nTherefore, a sound of 80 decibels has an intensity 100 times greater than a sound of 60 decibels. The answer is B. 100 times greater."
