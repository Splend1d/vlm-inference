Decreasing Increasing\n\nLower interest rates in the United States can cause the value of the dollar to decrease relative to other currencies, as lower interest rates make investments in US dollars less attractive to foreign investors. This decrease in demand for US dollars leads to a depreciation of the currency. A weaker dollar makes US exports cheaper for foreign buyers, thereby increasing demand for US exports."
