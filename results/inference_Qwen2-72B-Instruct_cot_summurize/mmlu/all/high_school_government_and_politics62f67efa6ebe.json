This is an order issued by the Court that directs a lower court to send the records of a case for review. The Supreme Court uses this process to select which cases it will hear from among the many requests made to it. The issuance of a writ of certiorari is required before the Court can review the decision of a lower court.\n\nA. Issuing a writ of habeas corpus is a legal action used to bring a prisoner or detainee before the court to determine if the person's imprisonment or detention is lawful.\nC. Amicus curiae briefs are legal documents filed in a court case by someone who is not a party to the case but has a strong interest in the matter and seeks to provide information to assist the court in making its decision.\nD. Engaging in judicial review is a function of the Supreme Court where it examines whether a law or governmental action is consistent with the Constitution. However, this is not specifically what the Court does when it decides to take a case on appeal; rather, it is part of the broader powers of the Court."
