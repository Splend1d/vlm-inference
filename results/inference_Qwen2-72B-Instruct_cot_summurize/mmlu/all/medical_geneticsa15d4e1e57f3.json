Sister\n\nAn individual is most likely to share a common HLA (Human Leukocyte Antigen) haplotype with a full sibling, such as a sister or brother, because they have two opportunities to inherit the same haplotype from each parent. While it's possible to share an HLA haplotype with a parent or child, you would only share one haplotype with them since you receive one set of haplotypes from each parent. With siblings, there is a 25% chance of sharing both haplotypes, resulting in an identical HLA profile."
