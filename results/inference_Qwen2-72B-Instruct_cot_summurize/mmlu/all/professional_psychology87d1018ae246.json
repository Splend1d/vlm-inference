This aspect of cognitive function, often referred to as processing speed or perceptual speed, typically peaks in early adulthood and then gradually declines with age. This decline can affect various aspects of cognition, including working memory, attention, and executive function.\n\nWhile attention span (A) can also be affected by aging, it does not necessarily decline as uniformly or dramatically as processing speed. Crystallized intelligence (C), which refers to accumulated knowledge and the ability to use learned skills and information, tends to remain stable or even improve with age. Implicit memory (D), which includes habits, skills, and conditioned responses, is also relatively spared in the aging process compared to explicit or declarative memory.\n\nIt's important to note that individual experiences may vary, and factors such as overall health, lifestyle, and genetics can influence the rate and extent of cognitive decline."
