This pattern reflects the differential impact of aging on various cognitive abilities, with crystallized intelligence (accumulated knowledge and vocabulary) often being more resilient than fluid intelligence (ability to solve new problems).\n\nHowever, the question seems to ask for a specific pattern defined as \"2 decline\" on certain subtests. In the context of the WAIS-R, this could refer to a common finding in older adults where there is a notable drop in scores on the Digit Symbol and Block Design subtests, which are part of the Performance IQ scale and measure visual-motor coordination, spatial organization, and processing speed.\n\nTherefore, the closest answer to the question would be:\n\nD. Block Design subtest only\n\nBut it's important to note that the Digit Symbol subtest is also commonly affected by aging, although it was not listed as an option. The answer provided here is based on the options given and the interpretation that the question is asking about a specific pattern observed in the aging population."
