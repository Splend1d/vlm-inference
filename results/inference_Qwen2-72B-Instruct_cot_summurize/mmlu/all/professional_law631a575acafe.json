Yes, admission by party.\n\nOfficer Friendly's testimony about what Polly said is admissible because it falls under the exception to the hearsay rule known as \"admission by party-opponent.\" Under this rule, a statement made by a party to the case (in this instance, Polly) can be admitted into evidence against them. This includes statements that are against their own interest, such as admitting negligence. Therefore, the statement \"Oops, I was cleaning my pistol and it went off and shot Justin. I sure was negligent!\" can be used as evidence in court."
