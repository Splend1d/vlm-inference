One of her largest spaces was rented on a month-to-month basis at $500 per month by a dance troop which held performances in the facility. The director of the dance troop moved to New York for a starring role Off-Broadway. Unfortunately the troop was unable to find another dance director, so it folded and vacated the space. Sally Sleazy learned of the closure and decided the location would be perfect for a topless strip joint. Sally rented the space from Loretta under a two-year lease at $1,000 per month without disclosing her intended use of the space. One month after the strip joint opened, the County Commissioners passed a new law prohibiting topless strip joints in that neighborhood. Sally told Loretta the new law made it impossible to operate the business, so she was leaving. If Loretta then sued Sally for breach of the lease contract, the likely outcome is a judgment for\n\nA. Sally, because the law made performance of the lease contract impossible.\nB. Loretta, because the new law was passed after the lease was executed.\nC. Loretta, only if she did not know of the use Sally intended for the space.\nD. Sally, because the lease contract was discharged under impossibility of performance.\n"

Loretta, because the new law was passed after the lease was executed.\n\nIn general, a contract cannot be voided due to the enactment of a new law after the contract has been entered into. However, if the new law makes the performance of the contract illegal, the contract may be discharged due to illegality rather than impossibility. In this case, since the new law prohibits topless strip joints in the area, it does not make the lease itself impossible to perform (Sally could still pay rent for the space), but it does make the intended use of the space illegal. \n\nHowever, since Sally is still obligated to pay rent regardless of whether she can use the space as originally intended, Loretta would likely win a judgment for breach of contract if Sally stopped paying rent. The fact that the law changed does not relieve Sally of her contractual obligations to pay rent under the terms of the lease."
