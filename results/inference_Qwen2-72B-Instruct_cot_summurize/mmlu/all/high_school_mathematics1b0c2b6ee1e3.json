There are two possible sequences for alternating colors: starting with a white ball (WBWBWBWB) or starting with a black ball (BWBWBWBW).\n\nLet's first consider the sequence starting with a white ball (WBWBWBWB):\n\n- The probability of drawing the first white ball is $\\frac{4}{8} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n- Given that the first ball was white, the probability of drawing a black ball next is $\\frac{4}{7}$.\n- Given that the second ball was black, the probability of drawing another white ball next is $\\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n- And so on...\n\nThe overall probability for this specific sequence can be calculated by multiplying these probabilities together:\n$$\\frac{1}{2} * \\frac{4}{7} * \\frac{1}{2} * \\frac{3}{5} * \\frac{1}{2} * \\frac{2}{3} * \\frac{1}{2} * \\frac{1}{1} = \\frac{1}{2^4} * \\frac{4*3*2*1}{7*5*3*1} = \\frac{1}{16} * \\frac{24}{105} = \\frac{1}{16} * \\frac{8}{35} = \\frac{1}{70}.$$\n\nFor the sequence starting with a black ball (BWBWBWBW), the calculation will be similar, but since it involves the same number of each color being drawn in a similar manner, it will result in the same probability.\n\nThus, the total probability of either sequence happening is twice the probability of one of the sequences, which gives us:\n$$2 * \\frac{1}{70} = \\frac{1}{35}.$$\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. $\\frac{1}{35}$."
