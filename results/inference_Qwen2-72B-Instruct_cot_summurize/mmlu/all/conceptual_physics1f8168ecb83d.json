Kinetic energy of the alpha particle.\n\nThe alpha particle has a much higher mass than the neutron, and thus it carries off the majority of the kinetic energy from the reaction. The neutron also receives some kinetic energy, but the distribution typically favors the alpha particle due to its greater mass.\n\nGamma radiation may also be produced during nuclear reactions, including fusion, but it is not the primary form of energy release in this particular type of reaction. Therefore, option A is not correct as the main answer.\n\nOption C is partially correct since the neutron does gain kinetic energy, but it is not the majority of the energy released.\n\nOption D suggests all forms of energy are released equally, which is not accurate for this specific fusion reaction. While both the alpha particle and the neutron receive kinetic energy, the alpha particle takes the lion's share.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is B. Kinetic energy of the alpha particle."
