The city, because it does not unreasonably limit alternative avenues of communication.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has established that while the First Amendment protects adult businesses to some extent, municipalities can still regulate them under certain conditions. In cases like this, courts typically look at whether the regulation serves a significant government interest (such as maintaining the character of a neighborhood or reducing crime), whether it directly advances that interest, and whether it leaves open ample alternative channels of communication.\n\nIn this case, the city ordinance does not ban adult businesses outright but rather restricts their location to industrial zones. This is generally considered a content-neutral time, place, and manner restriction, which means it is subject to intermediate scrutiny. As long as there are still available industrial zones where the bookstore could operate, the court would likely rule that the ordinance does not unreasonably limit alternative avenues of communication and therefore upholds the city's right to enforce the zoning law."
