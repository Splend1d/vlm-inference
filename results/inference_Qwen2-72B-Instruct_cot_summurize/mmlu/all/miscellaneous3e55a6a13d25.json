Mixing vinegar with baking soda\n\nThis is because when vinegar (acetic acid) and baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) are mixed, they react chemically to form carbon dioxide gas, water, and sodium acetate. This reaction cannot be reversed by physical means, indicating that a chemical change has occurred. The other options listed involve only physical changes, where the substances involved do not undergo any changes in their chemical composition."
