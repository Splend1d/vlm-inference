In a federal diversity action, the court applies the substantive law of the state in which it sits, including that state\u2019s choice-of-law rules. This means that the federal court sitting in State B will apply the choice-of-law rules that a State B state court would apply to determine which state\u2019s substantive law (negligence law) governs the case. Therefore, the court should determine which state's negligence law a state court in State B would apply and apply that law in this action."
