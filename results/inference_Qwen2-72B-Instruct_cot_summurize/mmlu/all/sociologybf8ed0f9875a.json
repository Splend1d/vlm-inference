Suburbanization will develop because the time it takes to commute to the city has been decreased.\n\nThe construction of a new highway extending from a major city through an area used for farmland would most likely lead to suburbanization. This is because the improved transportation access reduces the travel time between the city and the outskirts, making it more feasible for people to live in the countryside or on the outskirts while working in the city. As a result, residential development may spread out along the new highway, leading to the growth of suburbs."
