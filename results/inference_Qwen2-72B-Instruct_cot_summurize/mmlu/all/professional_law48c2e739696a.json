As they were playing catch outside, the defendant threw the ball over his nephew's head, and it rolled into the street. Instinctively, the nephew ran after the ball but tripped over the gutter and fell in the street. When he tripped, the nephew severely sprained his ankle and couldn't stand up. Moments later, a large garbage truck was backing up and ran over the nephew, killing him. Although the defendant saw his nephew's predicament, he made no effort to rescue him. Subsequently, the defendant was charged with involuntary manslaughter. At trial, the defendant testified that he was so shocked when he saw his nephew fall near the garbage truck that he froze and was unable to move until it was too late. Following the defendant's testimony, an expert witness testified for the defense that reactions of the sort described by the defendant are not unusual when a truly shocking event occurs. If the jury believes the testimony of the defendant and his expert witness, the defendant's best defense is which of the following?\n\nA. The defendant was suffering from temporary insanity.\nB. The defendant lacked the requisite mental state required for the commission of the crime.\nC. The defendant's failure to act was not voluntary.\nD. The defendant's criminal liability was superseded by that of the truck driver.\n"

                    "text": "If the jury believes the testimony of the defendant and his expert witness, the defendant's best defense would be that he lacked the requisite mental state required for the commission of the crime (Option B). This is because the statute cited states that a person is not responsible for criminal conduct if, as a result of mental disease or defect, they lack substantial capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness of their conduct or to conform their conduct to the requirements of the law.\n\nThe defendant's claim that he \"froze\" and was unable to move suggests that he may have been incapacitated by shock or panic to the extent that he could not act to prevent harm. This could potentially be interpreted as a lack of substantial capacity to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law due to a mental state induced by the sudden and traumatic event unfolding before him. \n\nWhile Option A might seem plausible, the term \"temporary insanity\" is not typically used in legal statutes, and the description provided does not necessarily imply a pre-existing mental disease or defect but rather a reaction to an immediate crisis. Option C, while related, does not directly address the mental state component necessary for criminal liability. Option D is not applicable because the question focuses on the defendant's liability, not that of the truck driver.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer based on the information provided and the statute cited is:\n\nB. The defendant lacked the requisite mental state required for the commission of the crime."
