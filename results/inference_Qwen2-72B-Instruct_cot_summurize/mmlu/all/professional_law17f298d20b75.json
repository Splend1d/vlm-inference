The defendant was taken directly from the scene of the crime in a patrol car to the police station where he was placed, still handcuffed, in an interview room. He waited for about an hour, and a detective finally came in. The detective gave the defendant his Miranda warnings, and the defendant agreed to sign the waiver and speak to the detective. The defendant then confessed to the robbery. Which of the following allegations would be LEAST helpful in suppressing his statement?\n\nA. Before the defendant gave the statement he was refused permission to use the bathroom.\nB. The defendant had a private lawyer on retainer at the time he gave his statement.\nC. The defendant's arrest was not based on probable cause.\nD. The defendant could not speak English, and the warnings were given in English.\n"

The defendant had a private lawyer on retainer at the time he gave his statement.\n\nHaving a private lawyer on retainer does not automatically mean that the defendant's rights were violated when he gave a statement to the police. The presence or absence of legal representation at the time of giving a statement can be relevant if the defendant requested an attorney before or during the interrogation and this request was ignored. However, simply having a lawyer on retainer does not mean that the defendant invoked his right to counsel or that he was denied access to his attorney during the interrogation. The other options (A, C, and D) potentially raise issues regarding the defendant's treatment, the legality of the arrest, and the defendant's understanding of his rights, which could be more directly relevant to the admissibility of his confession."
