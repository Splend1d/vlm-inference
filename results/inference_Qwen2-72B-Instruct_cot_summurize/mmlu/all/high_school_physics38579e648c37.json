Since the final velocity (\\(v\\)) is 20.0 m/s and the time (\\(t\\)) is 15.0 s, we can use the relation between final velocity, initial velocity, acceleration, and time given by:\n\n\\[v = u + at\\]\n\nSolving for \\(a\\), we get:\n\n\\[a = \\frac{v-u}{t}\\]\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\n\\[a = \\frac{20.0 - 0}{15.0} = \\frac{20.0}{15.0} = 1.333... \\, m/s^2\\]\n\nNow, substituting \\(a = 1.333...\\, m/s^2\\), \\(u = 0\\, m/s\\), and \\(t = 15.0\\, s\\) into the distance formula:\n\n\\[s = (0)(15.0) + \\frac{1}{2}(1.333...)(15.0)^2\\]\n\n\\[s = 0 + \\frac{1}{2}(1.333...)(225)\\]\n\n\\[s = \\frac{1}{2}(1.333...)(225)\\]\n\n\\[s = 0.666...(225)\\]\n\n\\[s = 150\\]\n\nThus, the distance travelled by the car during this time is 150 m.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. 150 m."
