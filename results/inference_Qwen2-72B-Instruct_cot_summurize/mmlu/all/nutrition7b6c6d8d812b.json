Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Living on a working farm will help reduce the development of atopic diseases\n\nThis idea is based on the theory that reduced exposure to infectious agents in early life due to modern hygiene practices might lead to a lack of stimulation of the immune system, which could result in an increased susceptibility to allergies and autoimmune diseases later in life."
