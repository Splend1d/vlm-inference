Deterrence theory and game theory became highly influential within the academic world and gained centrality politically because the nature of the object allowed for a high degree of normative theorization which was accompanied by a mood of technological pessimism that fostered an ethos of critique.\nB. The progressive research programs produced theories that actually formed their own reality of abstractions, the world of, 'secure second strike capability', 'extended deterrence' and 'escalation dominance'.\nC. Game theory and deterrence theory as an intellectual development resulted in the trade-off between policy relevance/utility and theoretical abstraction/sophistication.\nD. None of the above. The influence of deterrence theory was illusory. The build-up of nuclear weapons and first strike orientated policy was driven by the internal logic of maximizing firepower. Theory served as the smokescreen that belied the intent.\n"

The progressive research programs produced theories that actually formed their own reality of abstractions, the world of, 'secure second strike capability', 'extended deterrence' and 'escalation dominance'. During the 'golden age' of security studies, game theory and deterrence theory provided a framework for understanding the strategic interactions between states during the Cold War. These theories allowed scholars to conceptualize complex security dilemmas and arms races, leading to the creation of new concepts such as \"secure second strike capability,\" \"extended deterrence,\" and \"escalation dominance.\" These ideas not only influenced academic discourse but also had significant implications for military strategy and policy-making.\n\nWhile A and C contain elements of truth, they do not accurately capture the primary impact of game theory and deterrence theory on the field of security studies during this period. A focuses on normative theorization and technological pessimism, which were not the central features of these theories, while C refers to the trade-off between policy relevance and theoretical sophistication, which is not specific enough to describe the intellectual development brought about by game theory and deterrence theory. D is incorrect because it dismisses the influence of deterrence theory as illusory, when in fact it played a crucial role in shaping Cold War policies and strategies."
