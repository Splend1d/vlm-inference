Specifically, thiamin pyrophosphate (TPP) is the coenzyme derived from vitamin B1 (thiamin) that is required for the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA by the enzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. This reaction is a key step in cellular metabolism, linking glycolysis to the citric acid cycle."
