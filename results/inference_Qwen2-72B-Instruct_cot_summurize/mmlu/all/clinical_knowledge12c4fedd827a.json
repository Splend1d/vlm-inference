This means they can mimic the effects of testosterone in certain tissues without causing all the side effects associated with traditional steroids. They are designed to selectively target and activate androgen receptors in specific types of tissues, such as muscle and bone, while minimizing activity in other tissues where it could cause unwanted side effects."
