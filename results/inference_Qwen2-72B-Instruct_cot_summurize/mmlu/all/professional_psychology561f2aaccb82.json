A cover story can help prevent this by ensuring that participants do not know the real purpose of the study, thus reducing the likelihood that they will behave in ways they believe the experimenter wants them to. This helps maintain the integrity of the experimental results by minimizing bias.\n\nWhile the Hawthorne effect (A) refers to changes in behavior caused by the awareness of being observed, and the Rosenthal effect (B) involves altered performance due to experimenter expectations, both could also potentially be mitigated by a good cover story, but demand characteristics are the primary target of such a strategy.\n\nDifferential attrition (D), which refers to differences in dropout rates across conditions, is not directly controlled by using a cover story."
