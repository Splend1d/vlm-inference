This style was a reaction against the complexity and emotional intensity of the Baroque period that preceded it. The galant style favored clarity, balance, and elegance in music composition, often using homophonic textures and clear-cut forms. It was particularly prominent in the works of composers like Christoph Willibald Gluck, Johann Stamitz, and Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach."
