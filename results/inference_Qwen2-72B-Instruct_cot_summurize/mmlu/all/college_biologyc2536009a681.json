The frequencies of some alleles in a population's gene pool has changed over successive generations.\n\nFor evolution to occur, there must be changes in the genetic composition of a population over time. This is typically measured by changes in allele frequencies in the population's gene pool from one generation to the next. Evolution does not occur if the frequencies of each allele remain constant over successive generations (option C), and it does not pertain to changes within an individual's lifetime (options B and D)."
