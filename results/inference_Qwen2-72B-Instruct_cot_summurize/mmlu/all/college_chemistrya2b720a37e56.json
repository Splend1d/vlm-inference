Raman\n\nRaman spectroscopy is a light scattering technique that provides information about molecular vibrations, rotations, and other low-frequency modes in a system. It relies on the inelastic scattering of monochromatic light (typically a laser), where some of the photons interact with the molecules and change their energy state. This interaction results in a shift in the frequency of the scattered light, which can be measured to provide a spectrum that is characteristic of the chemical bonds within the sample."
