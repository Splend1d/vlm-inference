We want to find the midpoint of a 95% confidence interval for the true proportion \\( p \\) of unemployed people in the population.\n\nThe formula for the confidence interval for a proportion is:\n\n\\[\n\\hat{p} \\pm Z_{\\alpha/2} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{p}(1-\\hat{p})}{n}}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( Z_{\\alpha/2} \\) is the critical value from the standard normal distribution corresponding to the desired level of confidence (for a 95% confidence interval, \\( Z_{\\alpha/2} = 1.96 \\)).\n\nHowever, the question asks for the midpoint of this confidence interval, which is simply the sample proportion \\( \\hat{p} \\).\n\nSo, the midpoint of the 95% confidence interval is \\( \\hat{p} = 0.08 \\), which is not listed among the options provided.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD.
