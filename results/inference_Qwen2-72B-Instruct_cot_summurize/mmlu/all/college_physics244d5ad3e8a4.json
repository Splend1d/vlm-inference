The time interval between two events is longer for an observer in motion relative to the clock than for an observer at rest with respect to the clock. The formula for time dilation is:\n\nt = t0 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere t is the time measured by the moving observer, t0 is the time measured by the stationary observer (in this case, the decay time in the particle's rest frame), v is the velocity of the particle, and c is the speed of light.\n\nPlugging in the given values, we get:\n\nt = 2.0 ms / sqrt(1 - (0.60c)^2/c^2) = 2.5 ms\n\nThis is the time it takes for the particle to decay as measured in the lab frame. To find the distance traveled by the particle before decaying, we can use the formula:\n\nd = vt\n\nwhere d is the distance traveled, v is the velocity of the particle, and t is the time it takes for the particle to decay in the lab frame.\n\nPlugging in the given values, we get:\n\nd = (0.60c)(2.5 ms) = 450 m\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. 450 m."
