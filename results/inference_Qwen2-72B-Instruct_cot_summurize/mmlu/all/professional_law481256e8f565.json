After work, the defendant went out drinking with one of the other cooks, and they were commiserating about their lack of money. They decided that the only way out of their rut was to rob a local bank. They then agreed to carry out a bank heist on the following Friday. In accordance with their plan, the cook on Monday purchased two ski masks to be used in the robbery. On Wednesday, after learning that the cook had bought the masks, the defendant got cold feet and told the cook he was renouncing his involvement in the robbery scheme. On Friday, the cook carried out the robbery without the defendant's participation. This jurisdiction requires an overt act for the crime of conspiracy. Is the defendant guilty of conspiracy?\n\nA. Yes, because the cook and the defendant did enter into an agreement to commit the bank robbery.\nB. Yes, because the purchase of the ski masks was a sufficient overt act in the furtherance of the crime.\nC. Yes, because the defendant did not thwart the cook from committing the robbery.\nD. No, because the defendant's withdrawal was effective.\n"

No, because the defendant's withdrawal was effective.\n\nThe defendant initially conspired with the cook to rob a bank, and the purchase of the ski masks could be considered an overt act in furtherance of the crime. However, the defendant withdrew from the conspiracy before the crime was committed by informing the co-conspirator of his decision to renounce his involvement. For the withdrawal to be effective, it must be communicated to all co-conspirators, and the defendant must also take affirmative steps to prevent the success of the conspiracy if possible. While the question does not explicitly state that the defendant took affirmative steps to prevent the robbery, his communication of renunciation to the cook is a key factor. Assuming that this communication effectively withdrew him from the conspiracy, the defendant would not be guilty of conspiracy. It's important to note that the specifics of the law regarding conspiracy and withdrawal can vary by jurisdiction."
