Copper\n\nCopper's resistance does change with temperature, but compared to the other options listed (carbon, germanium, and silicon), copper's resistance is least affected by temperature changes. Copper has a positive temperature coefficient of resistance, meaning its resistance increases as temperature increases, but this effect is relatively small and linear over a wide temperature range. The other materials listed have much more significant changes in resistance with temperature due to their semiconductor properties."
