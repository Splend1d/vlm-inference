This is in contrast to the other options listed, which all carry deoxygenated blood or oxygenated blood away from the heart rather than towards it. The aorta carries oxygenated blood away from the heart to the rest of the body; the carotid arteries carry oxygenated blood to the head and neck; and the inferior vena cava returns deoxygenated blood from the lower half of the body to the right atrium of the heart."
