Transfer pricing. \n\nTransfer pricing refers to the practice of setting prices for goods and services sold between controlled or related legal entities within an organization. In large multinational corporations, transfer pricing can be used to shift profits to lower-tax jurisdictions, which can result in significant tax savings.
