A higher standard deviation indicates that the values in the data set are more spread out from the mean, whereas a lower standard deviation indicates that the values are closer to the mean.\n\nGiven that Mr. Bee's class had a standard deviation of 11.2 and Mr. Em's class had a standard deviation of 5.6 on the same standardized test, it means that the scores in Mr. Bee's class were more spread out compared to Mr. Em's class.\n\nTherefore:\n\nA. Mr. Bee's class is less heterogeneous than Mr. Em's - This statement is incorrect because a higher standard deviation indicates more heterogeneity (variability) in the scores.\n\nB. Mr. Em's class is more homogeneous than Mr. Bee's - This statement is correct. A lower standard deviation indicates less variability or more homogeneity in the scores.\n\nC. Mr. Bee's class performed twice as well as Mr. Em's - This statement cannot be concluded from the given information. Standard deviation does not provide information about the overall performance but rather about the variability of the scores.\n\nD. Mr. Em's class did not do as well as Mr. Bee's - This statement also cannot be concluded from the given information for the same reason as above.\n\nThe most reasonable conclusion concerning the two classes' performance on the test based on the given information is **B. Mr. Em's class is more homogeneous than Mr. Bee's**."
