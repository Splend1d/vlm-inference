As aggregate demand increases, the higher demand for goods and services can push up prices, leading to an increase in the equilibrium price level. This is known as demand-pull inflation. Therefore, one potential drawback of using fiscal policy to close a recessionary gap is that it may result in rising prices. However, it's worth noting that during a recession, there is often significant unused capacity in the economy, so the risk of inflation may be lower than at other times. \n\nOptions A, B, and D are not necessarily drawbacks of using fiscal policy to close a recessionary gap. Unemployment may fall as a result of increased aggregate demand, taxes do not necessarily have to be raised (they could be cut instead), and government spending on important programs does not have to be cut (it could be increased)."
