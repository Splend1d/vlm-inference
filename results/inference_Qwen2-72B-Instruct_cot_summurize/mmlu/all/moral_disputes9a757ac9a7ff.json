In his thought experiment, he argues that the moral significance should be based on the outcome of the actions rather than the method by which the death occurs. Both Smith and Jones cause the deaths of innocent people, but they do so through different means: Smith actively kills, while Jones allows someone to die. Rachels argues that if both outcomes are equally bad, then the methods by which they occur should not make a moral difference."
