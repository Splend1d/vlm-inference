                    "text": "Marcia Baron argues that the artificiality of ticking bomb cases is problematic because:\n\nA. the artificial assumptions are, in fact, empirical claims that are central to the debate.\n\nBaron contends that ticking bomb scenarios, which often serve as a justification for using torture in extreme circumstances, rely on unrealistic and highly improbable situations. These scenarios typically assume that there is an imminent threat, that the authorities have captured the only person who knows how to defuse the bomb, that this person has unique and unobtainable information, and that they will only reveal the information under torture. These assumptions are not only unlikely to occur in real-world situations but also make the debate about torture hinge on exceptional and extraordinary circumstances rather than focusing on more realistic and probable scenarios.\n\nMoreover, Baron suggests that such thought experiments can be misleading, as they might lead people to believe that torture could be justified in certain situations, even though the conditions under which it would be effective or necessary are highly improbable. This can contribute to a normalization of torture as a viable option in the minds of policymakers and the public, potentially leading to its misuse or abuse in less clear-cut situations.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that Baron does not argue that all artificial thought experiments are philosophically useless (option B), nor does she claim that ticking bomb cases lead us to believe that torture is always permissible (option C). Her critique is specifically focused on the problematic nature of these particular scenarios and their potential impact on the ethical debate surrounding torture. Therefore, the correct answer is A, not D."
