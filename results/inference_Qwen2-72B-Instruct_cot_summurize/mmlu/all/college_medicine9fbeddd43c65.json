Strong acids completely dissociate in water, releasing their hydrogen ions and forming stable conjugate bases. The stability of these conjugate bases allows for the acid to donate its proton readily, making it strong. Perchloric acid (HClO4), for example, fully dissociates into H+ and ClO4- ions in solution."
