                    "text": "When both short-run aggregate supply (SRAS) and aggregate demand (AD) increase, the exact outcome on the price level and real GDP depends on the relative magnitudes of these increases. However, we can make some general observations:\n\n1. **Price Level**: An increase in AD shifts the aggregate demand curve to the right, putting upward pressure on prices because there is more money chasing the same amount of goods and services. An increase in SRAS shifts the supply curve to the right, which puts downward pressure on prices because more goods and services are available at each price level. If AD increases more than SRAS, the price level will likely rise. If SRAS increases more than AD, the price level may not rise as much or even fall slightly.\n\n2. **Real GDP**: An increase in AD will typically lead to an increase in real GDP as long as there is unused capacity in the economy. An increase in SRAS also increases potential output, which can lead to higher real GDP. If both AD and SRAS increase, real GDP is very likely to increase unless the economy was already at full capacity before the increases, in which case the effect on real GDP might be limited.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most accurate statement from your options would be:\n\n**C. The price level rises but the change in real GDP is uncertain.**\n\nThis choice acknowledges that the price level is likely to rise due to the increase in AD, but it correctly notes that the change in real GDP is uncertain without knowing the relative sizes of the shifts in AD and SRAS.\n\nHowever, if the question assumes that the increases in AD and SRAS are such that they do indeed lead to an increase in real GDP (which is quite likely), then option B could also be considered correct under those specific circumstances. But based purely on the information given, and without knowing the specifics of how much each curve shifts, option C is the safest and most accurate answer."
