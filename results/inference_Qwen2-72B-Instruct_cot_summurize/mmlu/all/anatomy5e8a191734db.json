It is formed of Purkinje fibres and is the only electrical connection between the atria and the ventricles.\n\nThis statement is closest to being correct, although it needs slight modification for absolute accuracy. The atrioventricular (AV) bundle, also known as the bundle of His, is not made up entirely of Purkinje fibers; rather, it is a continuation of the atrioventricular node that conducts electrical impulses from the node into the ventricles. The AV bundle then branches into the left and right bundle branches, which subsequently give rise to the Purkinje fibers that spread throughout the ventricular myocardium. Therefore, a more accurate statement would be:\n\nThe atrioventricular bundle is part of the conduction system of the heart, consisting of specialized cardiac muscle cells, and it is the only direct electrical connection between the atria and the ventricles, facilitating the sequential contraction of these chambers."
