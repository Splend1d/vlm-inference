However, the calculation suggests there might have been an oversight in either the question's options or the calculation process since the direct calculation doesn't align precisely with any of the provided choices. Given the calculation method and the common approach to such problems, the closest match would be D. 23.3 mT, but please verify the question details and constants used for the most accurate answer."
