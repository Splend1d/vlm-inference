His mother says that he is extremely active and likes to climb. During the past year, he fractured his right tibia after falling off a trampoline and sustained a concussion after falling off his bicycle. She says that his teachers reprimand him frequently for running wildly in the classroom, talking excessively, and getting out of his seat; he often forgets to turn in his homework. His parents are currently divorcing. His father has a history of illicit drug use. The patient is at the 50th percentile for height and weight. His pulse is 80/min, and blood pressure is 100/80 mm Hg. Physical examination shows a dislocated left shoulder, healing abrasions over the elbows, and ecchymoses in various stages of healing over the knees. Mental status examination shows a neutral affect. He says that he likes to run and climb trees. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for these findings?\n\nA. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder\nB. Conduct disorder\nC. Learning disorder\nD. Seizure disorder\n"

The child's history of frequent falls resulting in fractures, his teachers' reports of running wildly in the classroom, talking excessively, and getting out of his seat, as well as his forgetfulness regarding homework, all point towards a possible diagnosis of ADHD. This disorder is characterized by developmentally inappropriate levels of inattention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity.\n\nIt is important to note that the other options listed may also contribute to the child's behavior or circumstances, but based on the information provided, ADHD appears to be the most fitting diagnosis. However, a proper evaluation by a qualified mental health professional would be necessary to confirm this diagnosis and rule out other potential contributing factors."
