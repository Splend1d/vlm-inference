The fetus gains more capacities over time, which can be seen as increasing its claim to the right to life. At the same time, a gestating mother is somewhere in between a mere biological mother and a mother in a thick, normative sense, meaning that her relationship to the fetus and her preferences regarding it may change over time and be subject to different layers of moral consideration. Therefore, the answer is AB and C. However, option D is not directly related to Little's argument for thinking about the abortion issue in terms of degrees and layers."
