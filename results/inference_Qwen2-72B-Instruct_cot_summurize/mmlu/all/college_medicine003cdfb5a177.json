The primary transcripts of many genes can be spliced in various ways to produce different mRNAs, a process known as alternative RNA splicing.\n\nAfter transcription, pre-mRNA molecules undergo a process called splicing where introns (non-coding sequences) are removed and exons (coding sequences) are joined together. In some cases, this splicing can occur in multiple ways, leading to different combinations of exons being present in the final mRNA molecule. This process, known as alternative RNA splicing, allows for the production of multiple protein variants from a single gene."
