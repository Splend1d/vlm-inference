This state statute prohibits the use of contraceptive devices by married persons. A physician who practices in the state brings suit in federal court challenging the constitutionality of the state contraceptive statute. The physician attacks the validity of the statute on the grounds that it prevents him from giving professional advice concerning the use of contraceptives to three patients, all of whom are married, whose condition of health might be endangered by child bearing. The plaintiff is likely\n\nA. to have standing.\nB. to have standing jus tertii.\nC. not to have standing.\nD. not to have standing jus tertii.\n"

In this context, the physician has standing to challenge the statute because the law directly affects his ability to provide medical care and advice to his patients. He can argue that the statute infringes upon his patients' rights, which are substantially affected by the law. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. to have standing jus tertii."
