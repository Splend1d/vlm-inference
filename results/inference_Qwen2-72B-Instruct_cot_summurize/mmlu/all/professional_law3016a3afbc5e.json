The neighbor did not immediately accept the offer but instead asked for time to think about it. The man agreed by saying, \"If you say so.\" This statement does not indicate any agreement to hold the offer open for a specific period of time or any consideration given by the neighbor to keep the offer open. Without consideration, the offer remained revocable until accepted.\n\nThe neighbor did not accept the offer before the man sold the barbecue to his brother. Once the barbecue was sold, the original offer to the neighbor could no longer be fulfilled, and thus it was effectively terminated. Since there was no binding contract between the man and the neighbor, the neighbor cannot successfully sue for breach of contract.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the termination of the offer does not depend on the neighbor learning of the sale; the offer was terminated upon the sale itself.\nChoice C is incorrect because simply allowing someone to \"think it over\" does not create an irrevocable offer without additional consideration.\nChoice D is incorrect because the neighbor being a merchant has no bearing on the enforceability of the offer in this scenario."
