This process will continue until the air around the saucer becomes saturated with water vapor, at which point the rate of evaporation will slow down or stop. Condensation would occur if the water vapor in the air were to cool and lose energy, causing it to change back into liquid form, but this is not an inevitable result of placing a saucer of water on a table."
