Warranty of merchantability.\n\nWhen a buyer purchases an item that turns out to be unfit, defective, and unsafe for its ordinary purposes, the implied warranty of merchantability can be invoked. This warranty guarantees that the product will be fit for the ordinary purposes for which such goods are used. If the goods do not meet this standard, the buyer may have a claim against the seller under the warranty of merchantability.\n\nExpress warranties, on the other hand, are specific promises or affirmations made by the seller about the quality or characteristics of the goods, and they are not applicable in this situation unless the seller specifically made such a warranty.\n\nWarranty of title ensures that the seller has the right to sell the goods and that there are no undisclosed encumbrances on the goods.\n\nTherefore, in this scenario, the buyer can invoke the implied warranty of merchantability since the product was defective and unsafe for its ordinary purposes."
