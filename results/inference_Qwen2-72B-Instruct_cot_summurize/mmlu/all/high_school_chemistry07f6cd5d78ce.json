The average kinetic energy of a gas particle is directly related to the Kelvin temperature. This means that as the temperature increases, the average kinetic energy of the gas particles also increases.\n\nB. Ideal gas particles do not attract or repel each other. In an ideal gas, there are no intermolecular forces between the particles, which allows them to move independently of one another.\n\nC. The atoms or molecules of an ideal gas have no volume. This assumption simplifies calculations by treating the gas particles as point masses with no physical size.\n\nThese assumptions are foundational to the ideal gas law, which describes the behavior of an ideal gas under various conditions of pressure, volume, and temperature."
