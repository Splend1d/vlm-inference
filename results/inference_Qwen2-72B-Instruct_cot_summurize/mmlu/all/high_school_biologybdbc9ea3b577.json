I, II, and III\n\nThe resting membrane potential is determined by all three factors: active transport (I), selective permeability (II), and differential distribution of ions across the axonal membrane (III). Active transport helps maintain an ion gradient, while selective permeability allows certain ions to pass through the membrane more easily than others. The differential distribution of ions creates a difference in electrical charge across the membrane, contributing to the resting membrane potential."
