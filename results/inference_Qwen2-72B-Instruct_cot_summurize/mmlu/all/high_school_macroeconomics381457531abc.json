National Income is the total income earned by a nation's factors of production, including wages, rents, interest, and profits. To get from NI to GDP, you must:\n\nA. Add depreciation expenses: National Income does not include the cost of replacing worn-out capital goods, which is included in GDP as depreciation or capital consumption allowance.\n\nB. Add indirect taxes: National Income does not include indirect taxes such as sales taxes, excise taxes, and customs duties. These are added to convert NI to GDP because they represent a part of the value of goods and services produced in the economy.\n\nC. Subtract subsidies: Subsidies reduce the cost of production for businesses and can lower prices for consumers. Since they are not part of the market value of goods and services, they need to be subtracted to avoid double counting when converting NI to GDP.\n\nTherefore, adding depreciation expenses, adding indirect taxes, and subtracting subsidies are necessary steps to adjust National Income to arrive at the Gross Domestic Product."
