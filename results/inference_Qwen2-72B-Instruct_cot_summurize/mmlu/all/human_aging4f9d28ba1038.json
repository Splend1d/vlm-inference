Among the options provided:\n\nA. Parkinson's disease - While Parkinson's disease can eventually lead to dementia (Parkinson's disease dementia), cognitive symptoms are not typically present at the onset of the disease. Motor symptoms such as tremors, rigidity, and bradykinesia usually precede cognitive decline.\n\nB. Pick's disease - This is a type of frontotemporal dementia characterized by atrophy in the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain. Cognitive symptoms, particularly behavioral changes and language difficulties, are prominent and often an early feature of the disease.\n\nC. Huntington's disease - Although Huntington's disease primarily affects movement, with symptoms like uncontrolled movements and problems with coordination, it also involves cognitive decline and psychiatric issues. Cognitive symptoms do occur but may not be as prominent initially as the motor symptoms.\n\nD. NeuroAIDS - HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) encompass a range of cognitive, behavioral, and motor abnormalities that can occur in people living with HIV. Cognitive symptoms can be significant and are a major part of the condition.\n\nGiven these descriptions, **A. Parkinson's** would be the answer where cognitive symptoms are less likely to be the initial or predominant feature, especially in the early stages of the disease. However, it's important to note that as Parkinson's disease progresses, cognitive symptoms can become more pronounced, leading to Parkinson's disease dementia."
