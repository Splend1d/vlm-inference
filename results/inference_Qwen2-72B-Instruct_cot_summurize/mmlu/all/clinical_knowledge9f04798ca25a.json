A moon face and a buffalo hump are characteristic of the disease\n\nCushing's Syndrome is caused by prolonged exposure to high levels of cortisol, not a deficiency (option A is incorrect). It does not cause enlarged extremities (option B is incorrect), but it can lead to osteoporosis due to the effects of excess cortisol on bone metabolism (option C is incorrect). The characteristic features include a round or \"moon\" face, a fat pad between the shoulders known as a \"buffalo hump,\" and central obesity."
