He believed in the Stoic principles of natural law and the idea that justice should be upheld at all times. According to Cicero, committing acts of injustice, breaking one's promises, or stealing would never be considered morally permissible actions. Instead, he advocated for integrity, honesty, and adherence to moral principles. However, it's important to note that Cicero's philosophy is complex, and there might be nuanced arguments within his works that could suggest exceptions under extreme circumstances, but generally speaking, the options provided do not align with his ethical teachings."
