This means that there is a clear distinction between those who are actively engaged in hostilities (combatants) and those who are not (noncombatants), and this distinction should be respected in the conduct of warfare. However, without more specific information about Valls' views, it is impossible to say for certain which option he would endorse. Option D is also a possible interpretation of Valls' views, but it is not directly related to the question of discrimination between combatants and noncombatants."
