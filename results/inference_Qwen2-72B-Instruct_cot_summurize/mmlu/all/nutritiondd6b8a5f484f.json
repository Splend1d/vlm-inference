However, it's important to note that while animal models like the growing rat can be useful for assessing protein quality, they may not perfectly reflect human nutritional needs. The Protein Digestibility Corrected Amino Acid Score (PDCAAS) and Digestible Indispensable Amino Acid Score (DIAAS) are currently considered more accurate methods for evaluating protein quality specifically for human nutrition.\n\nStatements A and B are incorrect because the rat PER and NPU assays have been largely replaced by more accurate methods such as PDCAAS and DIAAS. Statement C is partially correct but not entirely accurate; animal growth assays can provide valuable information but may not always precisely match human requirements due to species-specific differences in amino acid needs and metabolism."
