Following a physical examination, a CT\u00a0scan of the pelvis is ordered. After the scan is complete, the radiologist calls to report that the patient has a surgical sponge in her pelvis. In a subsequent malpractice suit, the plaintiff establishes that the sponge could not have been left unless there was negligence. The most appropriate term to represent the legal concept invoked by the patient is\n\nA. collateral estoppel\nB. proximate cause\nC. res ipsa loquitur\nD. respondeat superior\n"

In cases where res ipsa loquitur applies, the plaintiff does not need to prove the defendant's negligence directly but can rely on the nature of the accident itself to establish a presumption of negligence. This doctrine is often invoked in medical malpractice cases when an object is left inside a patient during surgery, as it is highly unlikely that such an event would occur without some form of negligence."
