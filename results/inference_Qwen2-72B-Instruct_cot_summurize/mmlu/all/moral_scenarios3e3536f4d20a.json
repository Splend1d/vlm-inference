In Scenario 1, swinging a baseball bat at a ballboy could result in serious injury, and in Scenario 2, removing someone's tonsils without medical necessity or consent is a clear violation of ethical and legal standards. Both actions would be considered morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. However, it's important to note that Scenario 2 might also involve legal and professional misconduct if the main character is a medical professional acting outside the bounds of their profession."
