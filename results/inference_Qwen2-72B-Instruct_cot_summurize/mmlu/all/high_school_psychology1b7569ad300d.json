Pairing an unconditioned stimulus with a conditioned stimulus\n\nIn classical conditioning, an unconditioned stimulus (UCS) that naturally triggers a response is paired with a neutral stimulus (CS) to create a learned response to the previously neutral stimulus. For example, if a bell (neutral stimulus) is rung before a dog receives food (unconditioned stimulus), the dog will eventually start salivating at the sound of the bell alone, because it has been paired with the food."
