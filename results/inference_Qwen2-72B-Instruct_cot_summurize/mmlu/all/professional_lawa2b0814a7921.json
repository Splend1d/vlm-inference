The letter stated, \"I want to sell my antique Ford Roadster for a price above $20,000. If you are interested please contact me.\" Three days later Bobby sent a letter to Susan stating \"I agree to pay your asking price of $20,000 for the 1932 Ford Roadster.\" The next day Susan sold the car to Harriet Higherprice for $25,000. If Bobby brings suit against Susan for breach of contract, the likely outcome is\n\nA. For Bobby, since her acceptance was timely under the mail box rule.\nB. For Susan, because her letter to Bobby was not an offer.\nC. For Susan, because the sale to Harriett was made before Susan was aware that Bobby had accepted.\nD. For Bobby, because her communication met the full price which Susan was asking for the automobile.\n"

In the scenario given, Susan's letter to Bobby did not contain a clear and definite offer to sell the car at a specific price. Instead, it stated that she wanted to sell the car for a price above $20,000 and invited further communication from Bobby. Therefore, Bobby's subsequent letter agreeing to pay $20,000 could not be considered an acceptance of an offer, as no such offer had been made. Since there was no valid offer and acceptance, there can be no breach of contract."
