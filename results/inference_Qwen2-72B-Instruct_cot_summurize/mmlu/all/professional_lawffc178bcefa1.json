At the college student's trial for assault, the prosecution called one of the college student's classmates to testify. The classmate was not at the bar during the fight. The classmate offered to testify that the next day at class, he approached the college student and said, \"It was wrong of you to start a fight with the man over a game of pool,\" at which point, the college student bowed his head and walked away.

The college student's reaction, bowing his head and walking away after being confronted about starting the fight, can be interpreted as an acknowledgment or admission of guilt by conduct. This type of non-verbal response can be admissible as evidence of the defendant's state of mind or as an admission by conduct under the Federal Rules of Evidence.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that this answer assumes that the court finds the non-verbal response to be sufficiently indicative of an admission and that the circumstances surrounding the encounter do not render the evidence unfairly prejudicial or otherwise inadmissible under other rules of evidence."
