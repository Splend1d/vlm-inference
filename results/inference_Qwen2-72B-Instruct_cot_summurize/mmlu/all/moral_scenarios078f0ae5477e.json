Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation: In Scenario 1, while it may be considered thoughtless or inconsiderate to surprise someone with a pet when they have an allergy, it is not necessarily \"morally wrong\" by ordinary moral standards. It could be seen as a mistake or lack of consideration rather than a malicious or immoral act. In Scenario 2, choosing to skip school to watch television might be irresponsible or unwise, but it is not typically considered a morally wrong action unless there are serious consequences or if it is part of a pattern of behavior that is harmful to oneself or others. Skipping school once for personal enjoyment, while not advisable, is generally not viewed as a violation of moral principles."
