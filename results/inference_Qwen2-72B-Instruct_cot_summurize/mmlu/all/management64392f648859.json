Job characteristics model\n\nThe Job Characteristics Model, developed by Richard Hackman and Greg Oldham in 1976, is a theoretical framework that suggests five core job dimensions can enhance employee motivation, performance, and job satisfaction. These dimensions are skill variety, task identity, task significance, autonomy, and feedback. By focusing on these aspects, the model aims to improve both job satisfaction and productivity."
