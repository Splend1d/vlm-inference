All of the above.\n\nCharles Lyell, a prominent Scottish geologist, is well known for his principle of uniformitarianism, which states that the same geological processes we observe today have always been at work throughout Earth's history, albeit at a consistent and gradual pace. This idea is encapsulated in the phrase \"the present is the key to the past.\" Based on this principle, Lyell argued that the Earth must be much older than previously thought because:\n\nA. Many processes that can be observed, such as sedimentation, volcanic activity, and erosion, act extremely slowly. The slow deposition of sediments into layers, for example, suggests vast amounts of time are required for the formation of geological strata.\n\nB. Uniformitarianism can account for significant geological features. By applying the concept of uniformitarianism, Lyell could explain the formation of mountains, valleys, and other major landforms as the result of the continuous action of natural forces over immense periods.\n\nC. Erosion works incredibly slowly. The wearing down of rocks and landscapes by wind, water, and ice occurs at a very gradual pace. The extent of erosion visible in the landscape indicates that these processes have been acting over an extended period.\n\nIn summary, Charles Lyell's argument for an ancient Earth was based on the observation that geological processes occur slowly and consistently, leading him to conclude that significant geological change requires a great deal of time."
