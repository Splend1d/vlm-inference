CBT is a form of psychotherapy that involves both behavioral and cognitive interventions. It aims to help individuals identify and change distorted thinking and behavior patterns that contribute to their psychological distress. However, if we have to choose from the given options, then D. systematic desensitization, could be considered as it combines elements of both behavioral (gradual exposure) and cognitive (relaxation techniques) interventions. But the most accurate answer would be CBT, which is not listed here."
