A man took possession of the land in 1978 as an adverse possessor and remained on the land from 1978 to 1988; he then left the property to care for his sick mother for one year, returning the following year, 1990. Meanwhile, during the man's possession, the rancher devised the parcel to his son in 1994. The man remained on the property until2010. Assume that the statutory period for adverse possession in this state is 20 years. Upon the rancher's death in 2010, his son, as his sole heir, brings an ejectment suit to recover possession of the property from the man. In his action, the son will most probably\n\nA. lose, because the man has acquired title by adverse possession.\nB. win, because the statutory period for adverse possession does not run against a remainder- man until his interest becomes possessory.\nC. win, because the man left the property to take care of his mother for one year.\nD. win, because his title was perfected at the time of conveyance.\n"

The man took possession of the land in 1978 and remained on it until 1988. Although he left the property for one year to care for his sick mother, he returned in 1990 and stayed until 2010, which means he occupied the property for more than 20 years, excluding the one-year absence. This continuous and exclusive possession for over 20 years likely satisfies the requirements for adverse possession, giving him legal title to the property.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the son did not become a remainderman; instead, he inherited the property outright upon the rancher's death. Option C is incorrect because a temporary absence for a year does not necessarily interrupt the continuity of adverse possession. Option D is incorrect because the son's title, even if perfected at the time of conveyance, cannot overcome the superior title acquired by the man through adverse possession."
