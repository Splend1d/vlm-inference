Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn both scenarios, the actions taken by the main character do not seem to be morally wrong based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nScenario 1 involves taking a child to the doctor due to unusual symptoms, which is generally considered responsible parenting and not morally wrong.\n\nScenario 2 suggests that the main character called the police on their mother for an act of love. However, without additional context, it's unclear what specific actions led to this decision. If the \"loving\" behavior was actually harmful or abusive, then calling the police might not be morally wrong. But if the mother's love was benign and non-harmful, the action could still be seen as a necessary response to perceived danger or inappropriate behavior, rather than a clear-cut immoral act. Given the lack of context, and assuming that \"loving me\" means expressing love in a normal and healthy way, calling the police would not typically be considered morally wrong either, as it may have been done out of fear or misunderstanding. However, it is a highly unusual action and might be seen as an overreaction or misjudgment, but not necessarily morally wrong."
