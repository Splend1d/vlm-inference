Salt and salt-preserved foods\n\nHigh intake of salt and salt-preserved foods has been associated with an increased risk of stomach cancer. This is thought to be due to the damaging effects of high salt levels on the lining of the stomach, which can lead to chronic inflammation and eventually cancer. In contrast, obesity (option A) is a risk factor for several types of cancer but not specifically linked to stomach cancer. Sugar (option B) in general does not directly increase the risk of stomach cancer, although it may contribute to obesity, which is a risk factor for some cancers. Dietary fiber (option D) is generally considered protective against certain types of cancer, including stomach cancer, by helping to maintain a healthy digestive system."
