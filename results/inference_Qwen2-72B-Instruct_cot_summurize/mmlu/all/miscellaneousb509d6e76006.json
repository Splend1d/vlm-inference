Silicon\n\nModern computer microchips are primarily made from silicon, a semiconductor material that can control the flow of electricity based on its design and the signals it receives. This property makes silicon ideal for use in transistors, which are the fundamental building blocks of modern electronic devices such as computers, smartphones, and many other gadgets. The pure silicon wafers used in chip manufacturing are often referred to as \"silicon chips\" or simply \"chips.\""
