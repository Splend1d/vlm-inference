Wrong, Wrong\n\nIn both scenarios, the actions taken by the main character can be considered morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020:\n\nScenario 1: Intentionally adding extra salt to someone's food, especially when it is done to cause discomfort or harm, is considered morally wrong because it violates the trust and care that should exist between family members.\n\nScenario 2: Selling someone else's belongings without their consent is also considered morally wrong. In this case, the items belong to the baby brother, and selling them without his permission is theft and a violation of his property rights. Additionally, the reference to \"Germans\" is irrelevant to the moral judgment of the action; the issue is the lack of consent from the owner of the items. However, it's important to note that the phrasing implies the brother is no longer a baby, and if he is an adult with ownership rights over his belongings, the action is more clearly wrong. If the brother is still a minor and under the guardianship of the main character, the situation might be viewed differently depending on cultural norms regarding the handling of children's belongings within a family context. Nonetheless, the general principle of consent still applies."
