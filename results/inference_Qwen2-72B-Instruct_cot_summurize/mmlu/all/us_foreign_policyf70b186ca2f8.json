The idea that the United States should avoid entangling alliances with other nations and focus primarily on domestic affairs was a dominant perspective among many American politicians and citizens. This approach was evident in George Washington's Farewell Address and persisted through much of the 19th and early 20th centuries, although there were periods when the U.S. pursued more interventionist policies, such as during the Spanish-American War and World War I. The isolationist sentiment was particularly strong between the two World Wars but began to wane after the attack on Pearl Harbor and the subsequent entry of the U.S. into World War II. However, it is important to note that American foreign policy has evolved over time and has encompassed various strategies and doctrines, including containment, neoconservatism, and protectionism, at different points in its history."
