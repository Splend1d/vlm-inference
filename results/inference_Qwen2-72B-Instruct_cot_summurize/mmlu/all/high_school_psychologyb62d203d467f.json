Random assignment, on the other hand, typically refers to the process of assigning participants to different groups (such as treatment and control groups) in an experimental design. Representative sampling or assignment would refer to a sample or group assignment that reflects the characteristics of the larger population in terms of demographics or other relevant variables, but these terms are not standard statistical terms like random sampling and random assignment. In this context, \"random sampling\" is the most accurate term for the described scenario."
