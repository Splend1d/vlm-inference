If participants are selected based on extreme pretest scores and then tested again later, their scores may appear to improve simply due to regression to the mean rather than due to any treatment effect. This can threaten the internal validity of the study by making it difficult to determine whether observed changes are due to the treatment or just a statistical artifact."
