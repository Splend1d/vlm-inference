However, since the boys were just playfully jostling, there was no actual threat or aggression. Therefore, if the pedestrian sues the 17-year-old boy, he would have to prove that the boy was negligent in order to recover damages for his injury. Negligence requires showing that the boy had a duty of care toward the pedestrian, breached that duty, and that the breach caused the pedestrian's injury. Since the fall was accidental and the boy did not foreseeably put the pedestrian at risk, it would be difficult to establish negligence. Additionally, the doctrine of transferred intent (choice B) does not apply because there was no intentional act that could be transferred to the pedestrian. The assumption of risk defense (choice C) also does not apply because the pedestrian did not voluntarily engage in any activity that involved a known risk of injury."
