Her daughter had moved away from the area, and nursing home placement was necessary because the patient could no longer function independently. Her present medications include furosemide and digoxin. Physical examination is normal except for a weight loss of 3.5 kg (7 lb) during the past 3 months. In your conversation with the patient, she says, \"No, I'm not depressed, I just don't have an appetite anymore. Nothing tastes good to me. I have a little bit of nausea most of the time.\" Which of the following is the most appropriate initial diagnostic study?\n\nA. Chest x-ray\nB. Complete blood count\nC. Determination of serum albumin concentration\nD. Determination of serum digoxin level\n"

A low serum albumin concentration can indicate malnutrition, which can be caused by poor appetite and weight loss. This test can help determine if the patient's weight loss is due to malnutrition, which may require intervention such as nutritional supplements or a referral to a dietitian.\nOption A, a chest x-ray, is not indicated as there are no symptoms or signs of respiratory illness. Option B, a complete blood count, may be useful in determining if there is anemia or infection, but it does not specifically address the issue of poor appetite and weight loss. Option D, determination of serum digoxin level, may be important to ensure the patient is not experiencing toxicity from her medication, but it does not address the underlying cause of her poor appetite and weight loss."
