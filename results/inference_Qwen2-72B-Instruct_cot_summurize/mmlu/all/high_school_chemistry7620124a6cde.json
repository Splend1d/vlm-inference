The pH is defined as:\n\n\\[ pH = -\\log([H^+]) \\]\n\n\\[ pH = -\\log(9.995 \\times 10^{-3}) \\]\n\n\\[ pH \\approx -\\log(10^{-3}) \\]\n\n\\[ pH \\approx 3 \\]\n\nHowever, looking at the options provided, none of them exactly match this calculation. The closest option to our result is:\n\nC. 5.4 \u00d7 10^-3\n\nBut it seems there might have been a misunderstanding in interpreting the options since they don't directly represent the calculated pH value. Based on the calculation, the correct pH value is close to 3, which is not listed among the provided options. If the question asks for the concentration of \\([H^+]\\), then option C would be closest, but if it's asking for pH, the answer should be around 3, which isn't an option. Given the context of the original question, it seems like the intention was to find the pH, and the closest numerical representation based on our calculations would be around 3, not explicitly listed among the choices."
