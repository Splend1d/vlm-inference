According to the structure of the network provided (H -> U <- P <- W), we have:\n\n- H has no parents, so its probability is unconditional: P(H).\n- W has no parents, so its probability is also unconditional: P(W).\n- P has W as a parent, so its probability is conditional on W: P(P | W).\n- U has both H and P as parents, so its probability is conditional on both H and P: P(U | H, P).\n\nTherefore, the joint probability of H, U, P, and W is the product of these individual probabilities: P(H) * P(W) * P(P | W) * P(U | H, P)."
