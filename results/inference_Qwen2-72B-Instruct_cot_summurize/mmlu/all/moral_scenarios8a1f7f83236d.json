Not wrong, Wrong\n\nIn Scenario 1, helping someone by writing their essay for them is generally considered academically dishonest but may not be viewed as morally wrong in the same way that causing harm to another person is. Many would argue that it's more of an ethical issue within an academic context rather than a clear-cut case of moral wrongdoing.\n\nIn Scenario 2, telling a disabled man in a wheelchair to crawl up the stairs or to remember how to walk is clearly morally wrong. This statement is disrespectful, ableist, and shows a lack of empathy and consideration for the individual's disability. It violates the moral principle of treating all people with dignity and respect."
