GA Resolutions are considered as material source, in the sense that they may enunciate statements of customary law\n\nResolutions of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) are not generally considered legally binding on states unless they are operating under Chapter VII of the UN Charter, which deals with actions with respect to threats to peace, breaches of peace, and acts of aggression. In such cases, resolutions can be binding due to the enforcement powers granted under Chapter VII.\n\nHowever, UNGA resolutions often have significant persuasive authority and can contribute to the development of international law by reflecting the opinio juris (the belief that an action is carried out as a legal obligation) of states, which is a key element in the formation of customary international law. They can also serve as a record of state practice and can influence state behavior over time, potentially leading to the emergence of new rules of customary law.\n\nWhile GA resolutions are not themselves a formal source of international law like treaties or customary law, they can be important in identifying and affirming existing norms of international law and guiding the evolution of international legal principles."
