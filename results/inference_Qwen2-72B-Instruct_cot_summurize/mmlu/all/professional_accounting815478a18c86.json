Make inquiries of management concerning restrictions on the availability of cash balances.\nD. Evaluate management's plans for dealing with negative trends and financial difficulties.\n\nOption B is incorrect because communicating deficiencies in the design of internal control to the entity's audit committee is more typical of an audit engagement rather than a review engagement. Option C is also incorrect because examining trend analysis to determine the appropriateness of the CPA's assessment of detection risk is not a standard procedure in a review engagement; it might be performed but is more relevant to an audit where detection risk assessments are made."
