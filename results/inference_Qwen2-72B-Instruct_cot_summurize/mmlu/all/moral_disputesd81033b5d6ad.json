The resulting reconstructed egg is then stimulated to divide and develop into an embryo. This embryo is then implanted into a surrogate mother's uterus to develop into a cloned individual. Because the genetic material in the nucleus determines most of the traits of the organism, the cloned individual will have nearly the same genetic makeup as the individual who donated the nucleus."
