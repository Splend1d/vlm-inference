                    "text": "According to Lawrence Nathanson, a philosopher who has written extensively on Kantian ethics and punishment, the answer is D: all of the above. Nathanson argues that Kant's principle of equality, which holds that punishment should be proportional to the crime, and the \"eye for an eye\" principle both face significant problems.\n\nA. Nathanson points out that these principles do not provide clear guidance on what the appropriate punishment would be for all cases of criminal action. They do not offer a specific formula or method for determining the exact severity of punishment that would be proportionate to a given crime.\n\nB. He also argues that these principles do not adequately address the concept of moral desert. Simply matching the punishment to the crime does not necessarily ensure that the punishment is deserved in a moral sense, as it may not take into account factors such as the offender's intentions, circumstances, or personal history.\n\nC. Furthermore, Nathanson contends that adhering strictly to these principles could require punishing criminals in ways that are morally unacceptable. For example, if a person commits a violent act, an \"eye for an eye\" approach might demand a similarly violent punishment, which could be seen as cruel and inhumane.\n\nIn summary, Nathanson criticizes Kant's principle of equality and the \"eye for an eye\" doctrine for their lack of specificity, their failure to fully consider moral desert, and their potential to mandate punishments that are themselves unjust or inhumane."
