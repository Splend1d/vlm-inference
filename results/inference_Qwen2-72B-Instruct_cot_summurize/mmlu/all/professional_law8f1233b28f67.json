The owner of the motel is prosecuted for violating the statute by showing pornographic movies in the motel rooms. On appeal, the owner's conviction will probably be\n\nA. sustained, because a state can use its police power to prohibit the showing of pornography in public areas.\nB. sustained, because a state may use local standards in determining whether a movie has redeeming literary, artistic, political, or scientific merit.\nC. overturned, because his prosecution violates the right of consenting adultsto view such films in private.\nD. overturned, because the First and Fourteenth Amendments prohibit the suppression of sexually oriented materials on the basis of their allegedly obscene contents.\n"

However, based on precedent set by several U.S. Supreme Court cases, particularly Lawrence v. Texas (2003) which struck down laws against private consensual sexual conduct between adults, and Stanley v. Georgia (1969) which held that individuals have a right to possess obscene material in the privacy of their own homes, the most likely outcome would be:\n\nC. Overturned, because his prosecution violates the right of consenting adults to view such films in private.\n\nThis assumes that the films shown did not involve illegal activities (such as child pornography) and that they were viewed in truly private settings, which motel rooms generally would be considered when rented by adults. However, it should be noted that the exact legal outcome could vary depending on the specific language of the state statute, how \"public\" is defined in relation to motel rooms, and the interpretation of \"obscene\" under local law."
