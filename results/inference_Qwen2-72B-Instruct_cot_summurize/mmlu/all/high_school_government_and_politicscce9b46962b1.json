A categorical grant is a type of federal grant that is given to state or local governments for a specific purpose, with certain conditions and restrictions on how the funds can be used. In this case, the federal government provides funding to states specifically for the Head Start early education program, which is designed to promote school readiness for children from low-income families. The grant comes with specific guidelines and requirements that the states must follow in order to receive the funding."
