Immanuel Kant, the philosopher behind this theory, argued that it is morally wrong to use people merely as means to an end without also treating them as ends in themselves. This principle is encapsulated in his famous categorical imperative, which states that one should only act according to maxims that could be willed to become universal laws. In this context, using someone merely as a means would violate the second formulation of the categorical imperative, which commands us to treat humanity, whether in oneself or in another, always as an end and never merely as a means."
