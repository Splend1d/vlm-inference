Which independent African state will claim that its financial structure and banking institutions are fully harnessed to its national development? Which will claim that its material resources and human energies are available for its own national aspirations? We are fast learning that political independence is not enough to rid us of the consequences of colonial rule. We have been too busy nursing our separate states to understand fully the basic need for union, rooted in common purpose, common planning and common endeavour.\nGhana's president, Kwame Nkrumah, addressing the Organization of African Unity, 1963\nWhich of the following factors was most important in preventing the fulfillment of the political dreams described in the passage?\n\nA. A lack of common ethnicity, language, or religion\nB. The spread of communism throughout the continent\nC. Armed intervention on the part of the Cold War superpowers\nD.

It does, however, suggest that one of the major obstacles to the fulfillment of the political dreams described is the lack of unity among independent African states. This lack of unity could be attributed to a variety of factors, including differences in ethnicity, language, or religion among the various countries. Therefore, the factor that was most important in preventing the fulfillment of the political dreams described in the passage is:\n\nA. A lack of common ethnicity, language, or religion\n\nThis answer is supported by the statement \"We have been too busy nursing our separate states to understand fully the basic need for union, rooted in common purpose, common planning, and common endeavor.\" This suggests that the divisions among African states, which could be due to ethnic, linguistic, or religious differences, were hindering their ability to unite and work towards common goals."
