The neighbor was enraged and threatened to kill the child. The child ran inside his house and told his mother what had occurred. Although the child was only mildly upset by the incident, the child's mother was extremely distressed. She suffered an emotional breakdown and needed months of therapy to recover.

The mother may be able to recover damages for intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED) or negligent infliction of emotional distress (NIED), depending on the jurisdiction and specific circumstances. In many legal systems, there is recognition that a person can suffer severe emotional harm as a result of threats or actions directed at someone close to them, particularly a child. The fact that the mother was not present when the threat was made does not necessarily bar her from recovering damages if she can demonstrate that the threat caused her significant emotional distress.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the specific laws regarding recovery for emotional distress vary widely from one jurisdiction to another, and the outcome would depend on the specific legal standards and precedents in the area where the incident occurred. For instance, some jurisdictions require that the plaintiff must have been a foreseeable victim of the defendant's conduct, while others may require a physical impact or that the plaintiff was within the \"zone of danger.\" A skilled attorney would need to evaluate the case based on local law to determine the likelihood of success."
