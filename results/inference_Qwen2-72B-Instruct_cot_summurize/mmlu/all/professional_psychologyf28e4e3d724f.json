These differences may be related to factors such as age, health status, life experiences, cultural background, and personality. Therefore, it is important for therapists to approach each client as a unique individual and tailor their interventions accordingly. Additionally, therapists should be sensitive to potential age-related biases and stereotypes that may affect their work with older adults."
