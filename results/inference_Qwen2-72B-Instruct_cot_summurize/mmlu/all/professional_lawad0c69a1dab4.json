He arrested her for driving while under suspension and secured her in the rear seat of the squad car. He then searched the car where he found several bags of cocaine inside a coat that was setting on the rear seat; he arrested her for possession and possession with intent to deliver cocaine. Prior to trial, the driver moved for suppression of the cocaine. Is it likely that the trial court will grant the suppression motion?\n\nA. Yes, it must be suppressed because this was an unreasonable, warrantless search.\nB. No, the motion will be denied because the search was permissible as incident to a proper arrest.\nC. No, the motion will be denied because the initial traffic stop was legal and everything that flowed therefrom was a reasonable step to search for crime.\nD. Yes, the motion will be granted because a search of a vehicle requires a search warrant unless there are exceptional exigent circumstances.\n"

No, the motion will be denied because the search was permissible as incident to a proper arrest.\n\nThe search of a vehicle by law enforcement without a warrant is generally allowed if it is conducted as incident to a lawful arrest. In this case, the officer had already arrested the driver for driving with a suspended license and was justified in searching the vehicle for evidence of additional crimes or contraband. The discovery of the cocaine in the coat on the rear seat would fall under this exception to the warrant requirement. However, it's important to note that the specifics of the case could affect the outcome, including whether the search was conducted immediately after the arrest and whether the officer had reason to believe evidence related to the crime of arrest might be found in the vehicle."
