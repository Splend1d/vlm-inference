Coercive diplomacy has proven a successful policy tool and one that is integral to conflict management. The successes of the past policy initiatives in the post-9/11 community have reinforced the trend toward coercive diplomacy by increasing American political will to counter mass casualty terrorism in failing states.\nB. The favourable geo-political environment, characterized by an overwhelmingly Western military superiority and a low risk of hostile great power intervention, has generated pressures and incentives for Western policymakers to promote their policy agenda, and to manage armed conflicts from weak states and failing states.\nC. The demise of the ideological bipolar division of international society in the Cold War, rather than resulting in a reduction of hostilities, has left an unstable legacy where a policy of force and mass retaliation continues to pose a very real threat. Risk of uncontrollable escalation still remains but in a different form; mass casualty terrorism, contagion from failing states and non-state actors seeking to acquire WMD are the primary concern of states and require responses in the form of military intervention.\nD. The hostile geopolitical environment has encouraged states to pursue military strategies in order to secure their interests. The use of violence rather than diplomacy or incentives has become the primary response to threats, whether these are posed by other states, resource scarcity, pandemic diseases, or other non-traditional threats.\n"

The favourable geo-political environment, characterized by an overwhelmingly Western military superiority and a low risk of hostile great power intervention, has generated pressures and incentives for Western policymakers to promote their policy agenda, and to manage armed conflicts from weak states and failing states.\n\nThe end of the Cold War and the collapse of the Soviet Union led to a unipolar world dominated by the United States and its Western allies. This new world order provided a conducive environment for Western powers to engage in coercive diplomacy, as they faced little opposition from other great powers. The lack of a global rival allowed Western nations to intervene more freely in conflicts around the world, often using military force or the threat of it to achieve their objectives.\n\nCoercive diplomacy has been employed in various contexts since the end of the Cold War, including the 1991 Gulf War, the 1999 NATO intervention in Kosovo, and the 2003 invasion of Iraq. In each case, Western powers used military might or the credible threat of force to compel compliance with their demands. The success of these interventions, however, has been mixed, with some leading to positive outcomes and others resulting in protracted conflicts and unintended consequences.\n\nAdditionally, the rise of non-state actors, such as terrorist organizations and transnational criminal networks, has presented new challenges for Western powers. These groups often operate from weak or failing states, which lack the capacity to control their own territories and prevent the activities of these non-state actors. In response, Western powers have increasingly focused on managing conflicts in these areas through coercive diplomacy, often involving military intervention or the threat of force to stabilize the situation and prevent the spread of instability.\n\nHowever, the use of coercive diplomacy has also faced criticism for its potential to exacerbate conflicts and create new enemies. Critics argue that relying too heavily on military force can undermine diplomatic efforts and create a cycle of violence that is difficult to break. As a result, there has been a growing recognition among Western policymakers of the need to balance military action with diplomatic engagement and other forms of statecraft, such as economic sanctions and development assistance, to address the root causes of conflict and promote long-term stability."
