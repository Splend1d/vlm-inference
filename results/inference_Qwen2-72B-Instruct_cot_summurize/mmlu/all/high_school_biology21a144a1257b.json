Random mating\n\nHardy-Weinberg equilibrium assumes several conditions, including random mating, no mutation, no gene flow (migration), no genetic drift, and large population size. Out of the options provided, random mating is the one that directly contributes to maintaining Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The other options (genetic drift, mutation, and gene flow) actually disrupt Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium."
