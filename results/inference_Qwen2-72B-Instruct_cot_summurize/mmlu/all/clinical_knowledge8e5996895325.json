According to recent statistics, internet usage among people aged 65 and older has been increasing steadily, with more than half of this demographic now online. Therefore, option B is not accurate.\n\nHowever, careful consideration should still be given to providing internet-based information sources to older adults due to several reasons:\n\nA. Accessibility: Some older adults may have visual or hearing impairments that make it difficult to read text on screens or hear audio. Providing accessible design features such as larger font sizes, closed captioning, and screen reader compatibility can help overcome these barriers.\n\nD. Familiarity with technology: Older adults who did not grow up with computers or the internet may need additional support and training to use digital tools effectively. Providing clear instructions, tutorials, and technical support can help bridge this gap.\n\nAdditionally, providing internet-based information sources to older adults can have many benefits, including increased social connectedness, access to health information and services, and opportunities for lifelong learning. Therefore, it is important to ensure that these resources are designed with the needs and abilities of older adults in mind. \n\nOption C is also not an accurate reason to avoid providing internet-based information sources to older adults. While it's true that the internet was initially developed by and for younger generations, it has since become a ubiquitous part of modern life, used by people of all ages and backgrounds. Moreover, there are many websites and online communities specifically geared towards older adults, addressing their unique interests and concerns."
