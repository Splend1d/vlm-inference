The concentration of oxygen (O2) in air is about 21%, while in water it is much lower, typically around 5-10 milligrams per liter (depending on temperature and pressure), which translates to a percentage far below that of air.\n\nA. Air does not provide more physical support than water; in fact, water provides significantly more buoyancy due to its greater density.\nC. Water offers more resistance to motion than air because it is denser and has higher viscosity.\nD. Water has more thermal inertia than air, meaning it can store and release heat over longer periods, making its temperature more stable."
