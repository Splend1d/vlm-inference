A command confers power to change one's legal status.\n\nAustin's theory of sanctions focuses on the idea that a command becomes a law when it is backed by a sanction, which is essentially the threat of punishment or some form of negative consequence for non-compliance. This definition does not necessarily imply that a command confers power to change one's legal status. While it is true that commands with sanctions can be part of a legal system and may lead to changes in legal status (e.g., through penalties or fines), this is not an inherent part of the definition of a sanction according to Austin.\n\nOn the other hand, statements A, B, and C align more closely with Austin's theory of sanctions:\n\nA. All commands include some sanction. - This is consistent with Austin's view that a command must have a sanction attached to it to be considered a law.\n\nB. The concept of a command contains the likelihood that a sanction will follow failure to obey the command. - This directly relates to Austin's argument that a sanction is the evil incurred as a result of disobeying a command.\n\nC. Without a sanction, the mere expression of a wish is not a command. - This statement reflects Austin's belief that a true command must have a sanction attached to it; otherwise, it is merely a wish or request."
