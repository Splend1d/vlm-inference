States do indeed assess one another based on their power and capabilities rather than their internal politics or ideologies. Furthermore, realists view states as unitary and rational actors, which means they operate cohesively with a primary goal of survival and will act in ways that best achieve this goal. These three characteristics are all hallmarks of realist theory in international relations."
