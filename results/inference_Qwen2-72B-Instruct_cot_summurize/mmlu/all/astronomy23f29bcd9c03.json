The Hubble Space Telescope has provided some of the most detailed images of Pluto, allowing scientists to accurately measure its diameter. The New Horizons spacecraft did indeed perform a flyby of Pluto in 2015, but it was not in the 1990s. Mutual eclipses of Pluto and Charon have been used to study their orbits and sizes, but they do not provide direct measurements of Pluto's diameter. Radar observations by the Arecibo telescope have been used to study other objects in the solar system, but not Pluto."
