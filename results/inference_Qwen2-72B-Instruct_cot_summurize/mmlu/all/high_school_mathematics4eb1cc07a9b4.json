We have:\n- \\(2^2\\) (a pair),\n- \\(3^2\\) (a pair),\n- \\(17\\) (which needs another \\(17\\) to make a pair),\n- and \\(n\\) which could potentially contribute more factors.\n\nWe already have two pairs from \\(2\\) and \\(3\\), but we're missing a pair for \\(17\\). Therefore, the minimum value of \\(n\\) should at least include one \\(17\\) to make the \\(17\\) factor complete a pair.\n\nLooking at the options provided:\nA. 15 (Cannot form a pair with any existing prime factors.)\nB. 10 (Cannot form a pair with any existing prime factors.)\nC. 17 (Forms a pair with the existing \\(17\\). This is the minimum \\(n\\) required.)\nD. 34 (Forms a pair but is not the minimum required.)\n\nThe least possible positive integer value of \\(n\\) to make \\(\\sqrt{18\\cdot n \\cdot 34}\\) an integer is **C. 17**."
