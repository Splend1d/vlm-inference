A torsion-free abelian group is one in which no element (other than the identity) has finite order; i.e., for any non-identity element \\( g \\), there does not exist a positive integer \\( n > 0 \\) such that \\( ng = 0 \\).\n\n**Statement 1:** Every free abelian group is torsion free.\n\nThis statement is **True**. In a free abelian group, if an element \\( g \\) had finite order, then we could find a positive integer \\( n > 0 \\) such that \\( ng = 0 \\). However, since \\( g \\) can be expressed as a linear combination of basis elements, this would imply that some linear combination of the basis elements equals zero, contradicting the independence of the basis. Thus, a free abelian group cannot have torsion elements and is torsion-free.\n\n**Statement 2:** Every finitely generated torsion-free abelian group is a free abelian group.\n\nThis statement is also **True**. This is a consequence of the structure theorem for finitely generated modules over principal ideal domains (PIDs), of which the integers form a classic example. According to this theorem, every finitely generated module over a PID can be decomposed into a direct sum of cyclic submodules. For abelian groups, which are \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\)-modules, this means every finitely generated abelian group can be expressed as a direct sum of cyclic groups of prime power order and copies of \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\). If the group is torsion-free, it cannot have any cyclic subgroups of finite order, leaving only copies of \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\) in its decomposition, making it a free abelian group.\n\nSo, the correct answer is **A. True, True**."
