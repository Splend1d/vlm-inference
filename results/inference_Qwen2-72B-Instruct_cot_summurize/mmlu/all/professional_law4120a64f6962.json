The salesperson offered to sell the man 1,000 fire extinguishers for his hotel. The salesperson told the man that the cost of the fire extinguishers would be $35,000 (or $35 apiece), payable 90 days after delivery. The salesperson promised to have the fire extinguishers installed no later than April 15. On March 16, the man telephoned the salesperson and accepted the offer. The following day, the man mailed the following memo to the salesperson:\"Please be advised that I shall take a 15 percent discount for cash payment seven days after installation. \" The salesperson received the man's correspondence on March 20. On April 1, the salesperson sent a telegram to the man, stating: \"It's apparent we don't have an enforceable contract in effect. I will not be delivering the fire extinguishers on April 15 or any other time. \"The man brings suit against the salesperson for breach of contract. The salesperson asserts the defense of the statute of frauds under the UCC. Which of the following is the most accurate statement regarding the salesperson's defenses?\n\nA. The salesperson's defense is valid, because the man's memo was not sufficient to indicate that a contract was formed.\nB. The salesperson's defense is valid, because the man's memo was inconsistent with the terms of the salesperson's oral offer.\nC. The salesperson's defense is not valid, because the salesperson failed to respond to the man's memo within a reasonable period of time.\nD. The salesperson's defense is not valid, because under the UCC the statute of frauds is not applicable in agreements between merchants.\n"

The salesperson's defense is valid, because the man's memo was inconsistent with the terms of the salesperson's oral offer.\n\nExplanation: The man's memo introduced new terms (a 15% discount and payment seven days after installation) that were not part of the original offer made by the salesperson. According to the UCC, when a response to an offer includes additional or different terms, it is considered a counteroffer, which requires acceptance by the original offeror to form a contract. Since the salesperson did not accept these new terms and instead rejected them, there was no enforceable contract. Additionally, the UCC allows for certain contracts for the sale of goods over $500 to be enforceable even if they are not in writing, but in this case, the issue is not the lack of a written agreement, but rather the inconsistency between the terms proposed by each party."
