In this method, the voltage and frequency applied to the motor are varied together in a fixed ratio to maintain a constant flux density in the motor's core. This results in a constant torque operation over a wide range of speeds. The other options listed do not directly result from V/f control. However, it is worth noting that proper V/f control can help minimize magnetic losses and reduce harmonic distortion, but these are not the primary outcome of this control method."
