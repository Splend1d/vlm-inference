How does the soap help submerge the leaf disks?\n\nA. The soap molecules enter through the stomata of the leaf and bond to oxygen molecules.\nB. The soap molecules bond to air bubbles on the surface of the leaf and remove them.\nC. The soap molecules decrease the pH of the water, allowing excess H+ to bond to the leaf surface.\nD. The hydrophobic regions of the soap molecules attach to the waxy leaf surface, while the hydrophilic regions form hydrogen bonds with the water molecules.\n"

The hydrophobic regions of the soap molecules attach to the waxy leaf surface, while the hydrophilic regions form hydrogen bonds with the water molecules.\n\nThis explanation describes how soap helps in submerging leaf disks by reducing the surface tension of water. The soap molecules have a hydrophobic (water-fearing) end that attaches to the waxy, non-polar surfaces of the leaf, and a hydrophilic (water-loving) end that interacts with the water molecules. This allows the water to more easily wet the leaf surface, helping the leaf disks to sink rather than float due to surface tension."
