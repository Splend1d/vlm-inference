The wage rate ($4.50 per unit of labor) is given, but without knowing either the total amount spent on wages or the marginal revenue product of labor (MRPL), it's impossible to determine the quantity of labor employed.\n\nFor example, if an employer has a budget of $9 for wages, then they could hire 2 units of labor at $4.50 each. However, if their budget was $18, they could hire 4 units of labor. Alternatively, if we knew the MRPL and it was equal to or greater than $4.50, we could determine how many units of labor would be hired based on where the MRPL intersects with the wage rate.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer cannot be determined from the information provided."
