However, B is not entirely accurate as there are other moons in the outer solar system that show evidence of recent geologic activity, such as Europa, Io, Enceladus, and Triton. C is incorrect because Titan's atmosphere is actually dominated by nitrogen, much like Earth's, but it does have a significant amount of methane and other hydrocarbons. Therefore, the correct answer is just A.\n\nThere seems to be a typo in option D, which should likely include option B instead of D, but based on the given information, neither A and D nor any combination including D makes sense. So, we'll stick with A as the correct answer."
