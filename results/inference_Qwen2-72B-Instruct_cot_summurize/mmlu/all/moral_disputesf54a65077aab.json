Terrorism is a form of freedom of speech.\n\nMichael Walzer, an influential political theorist, discusses several justifications or excuses often given for acts of terrorism in his work \"Arguing About War.\" Among these, he does not consider terrorism as a form of freedom of speech to be a primary justification. Instead, he focuses on arguments like terrorism being a last resort for the powerless, that it can benefit oppressed groups by drawing attention to their cause, and the idea that all political power is inherently terroristic (though this last argument is not presented as one of the main excuses terrorists use, but rather as a critique of the nature of power itself)."
