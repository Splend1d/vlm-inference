                    "text": "The correct answer is D. Older adults drink more herbal tea than do younger adults.\n\nExplanation: A significant and positive correlation between adult age and consumption of herbal teas means that as age increases, consumption of herbal teas also tends to increase. This does not imply causation (i.e., it doesn't mean that becoming older causes an increase in herbal tea consumption or that drinking herbal tea slows down aging), but rather that there is a pattern where older adults tend to consume more herbal tea compared to younger adults. Options A and B suggest causative relationships that cannot be concluded from correlation alone, and option C contradicts the given correlation."
