Therefore, option C, which includes only community colleges, seems like the most probable choice for Maria. However, it's important to note that everyone's experience with fear of success is unique, and Maria may still choose to apply to more competitive schools despite her anxiety. Ultimately, the decision of where to apply should be based on Maria's personal goals, interests, and comfort level. \n\nSo the answer is: C. the local community college and distant community colleges."
