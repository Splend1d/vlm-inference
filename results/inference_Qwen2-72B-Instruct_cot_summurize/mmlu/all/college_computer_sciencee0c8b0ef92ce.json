Round-robin\n\nRound-robin scheduling is considered starvation-free because it cycles through all processes in a queue, giving each process a fixed time slice (or quantum) to execute before moving on to the next one. This ensures that no process has to wait indefinitely for service, as each gets a turn in a fixed rotation.\n\nPriority queuing, shortest job first, and youngest job first can potentially lead to starvation under certain conditions. For example, if new high-priority jobs keep arriving in priority queuing or shorter/younger jobs keep coming in those respective schemes, a longer or older job might never get a chance to run, leading to starvation."
