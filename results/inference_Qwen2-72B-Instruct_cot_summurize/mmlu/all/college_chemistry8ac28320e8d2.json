BeCl2 - Beryllium has a +2 charge and can act as a Lewis acid because it can accept an electron pair.\nB. MgCl2 - Magnesium also has a +2 charge and can similarly act as a Lewis acid by accepting an electron pair.\nC. ZnCl2 - Zinc has a +2 charge and can act as a Lewis acid, similar to beryllium and magnesium.\nD. SCl2 - Sulfur in this compound has a formal oxidation state of +4 and already has a full octet (8 valence electrons). It is less likely to act as a Lewis acid because it does not need additional electrons.\n\nTherefore, **D. SCl2** is the compound that is LEAST likely to behave as a Lewis acid among the given options."
