Short-run aggregate supply is upward sloping as nominal wages do not quickly respond to price level changes.\n\nThis answer correctly identifies that in the short run, the aggregate supply curve is upward sloping because nominal wages and prices do not adjust immediately to changes in the price level. In contrast, in the long run, the aggregate supply curve is vertical, reflecting full employment output where all resources, including labor, are being used at their potential levels, and nominal wages have adjusted to any changes in the price level."
