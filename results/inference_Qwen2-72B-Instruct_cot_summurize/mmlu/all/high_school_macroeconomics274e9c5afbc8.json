In the equation of exchange, which is typically represented as MV = PQ, P stands for the price level, V stands for the velocity of money, M stands for the money supply, and Q stands for the quantity of goods and services produced (not quality or quarter). The equation represents a relationship between the money supply, the velocity of money, the price level, and the output of an economy."
