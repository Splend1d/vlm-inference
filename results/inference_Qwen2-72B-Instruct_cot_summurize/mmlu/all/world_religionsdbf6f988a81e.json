Among the options given:\n\nA. The Buddha - Buddhism was present during the Han Dynasty but was not yet as widespread or influential as it would become in later periods.\n\nB. Laozi - As the founder of Taoism, Laozi is associated with philosophical and religious teachings that might be appealed to for spiritual guidance, but he is not typically a figure to whom one would pray for relief from a drought.\n\nC. The Queen Mother of the West (Xi Wangmu) - In Chinese mythology, she is a significant goddess who is sometimes associated with fertility and longevity. She could be seen as a deity to whom one might appeal for help during a drought.\n\nD. Confucius - Confucius is primarily known for his ethical and philosophical teachings rather than being an object of worship or prayer. People might follow his teachings on how to behave during a crisis, but they would not pray to him for relief.\n\nGiven these options, the most likely answer would be C. The Queen Mother of the West, as she is a deity traditionally associated with aspects of life that could include intervention in natural events like droughts. However, it's also important to note that in historical practice, appeals would have been made to a variety of local and regional deities, as well as through rituals and sacrifices conducted by state officials and priests, depending on the specific beliefs and practices of the time and place."
