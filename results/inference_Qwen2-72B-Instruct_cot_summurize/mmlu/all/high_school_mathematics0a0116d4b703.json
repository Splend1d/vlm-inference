This means choosing $x$ as large as possible and $y$ as small as possible from the given set.\n\nThe largest number in the set is $10$, and the smallest (non-zero) number is $\\frac{2}{5}$. Therefore, to get the maximum quotient, we choose $x = 10$ and $y = \\frac{2}{5}$.\n\nThus,\n\n$$\\frac{x}{y} = \\frac{10}{\\frac{2}{5}} = 10 \\times \\frac{5}{2} = 25.$$\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. 25."
