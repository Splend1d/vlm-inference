CBT helps individuals identify and challenge negative thought patterns that contribute to anxiety, and learn coping strategies to manage symptoms. It is often used in conjunction with medication or other treatments, but can also be effective on its own. While social skills training, behavioral activation treatment, and nondirective supportive treatment may be helpful for some individuals, they are not typically considered first-line treatments for anxiety disorders."
