                    "text": "To determine what will be left in measurable amounts after reacting 1.0 g of rubidium (Rb) with 1.0 g of bromine (Br\u2082), we need to look at the balanced chemical equation for the reaction between rubidium and bromine:\n\n\\[ \\text{Rb} + \\text{Br}_2 \\rightarrow \\text{RbBr} \\]\n\nHowever, this equation needs to be balanced correctly. The balanced equation is:\n\n\\[ 2\\text{Rb} + \\text{Br}_2 \\rightarrow 2\\text{RbBr} \\]\n\nFrom the balanced equation, we see that 2 moles of rubidium react with 1 mole of bromine to produce 2 moles of rubidium bromide (RbBr).\n\nNext, let's find out the molar masses of Rb and Br\u2082:\n- Molar mass of Rb = 85.47 g/mol\n- Molar mass of Br\u2082 = 2 \u00d7 79.90 = 159.80 g/mol\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of moles of each reactant:\n- Moles of Rb = \\( \\frac{1.0 \\text{ g}}{85.47 \\text{ g/mol}} = 0.0117 \\text{ mol} \\)\n- Moles of Br\u2082 = \\( \\frac{1.0 \\text{ g}}{159.80 \\text{ g/mol}} = 0.00626 \\text{ mol} \\)\n\nAccording to the stoichiometry of the reaction, 2 moles of Rb react with 1 mole of Br\u2082. Therefore, the limiting reagent is Br\u2082 because it is present in fewer moles relative to its stoichiometric ratio.\n\nSince Br\u2082 is the limiting reagent, all of it will be consumed in the reaction, and some Rb will remain unreacted. To find out how much Rb remains, we can use the stoichiometry of the reaction:\n\n\\[ 2 \\text{ moles Rb} : 1 \\text{ mole Br}_2 = x \\text{ moles Rb} : 0.00626 \\text{ moles Br}_2 \\]\n\nSolving for \\(x\\) gives us:\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{2 \\times 0.00626}{1} = 0.01252 \\text{ moles Rb} \\]\n\nThis means 0.01252 moles of Rb would have been needed to completely react with 0.00626 moles of Br\u2082. Since there were 0.0117 moles of Rb to start with, the amount of Rb remaining is:\n\n\\[ 0.0117 - 0.01252 = -0.00082 \\]\n\nHowever, since you cannot have a negative amount of substance, this calculation indicates that all the Br\u2082 has been used up and some Rb remains. But this simple subtraction doesn't directly tell us the correct quantity. To find out how much Rb is left, we need to calculate based on the actual amount of Br\u2082 reacted:\n\n\\[ \\text{Moles of Rb reacted} = 2 \\times 0.00626 = 0.01252 \\text{ moles} \\]\n\nBut we only had 0.0117 moles of Rb, so all of it would have reacted if enough Br\u2082 was available. Since Br\u2082 is the limiting reagent, we know that not all Rb could have reacted.\n\nThe actual calculation should be based on the initial amount of Rb and the stoichiometry of the reaction, which indicates that all of the Br\u2082 reacts completely and all of the Rb also reacts because Br\u2082 is the limiting reagent in terms of the stoichiometry but not in absolute quantity.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\nB. RbBr and Rb only\n\nBecause all of the Br\u2082 will be converted into RbBr, and some Rb will remain unreacted."
