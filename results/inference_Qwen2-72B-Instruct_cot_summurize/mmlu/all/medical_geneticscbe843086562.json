The purpose is to help couples understand their risk of having a child with one of these conditions.\n\nAmong the options given:\n\nA. Cystic fibrosis - This is suitable for population carrier screening, especially in populations of European descent where it is relatively common.\n\nB. Oculocutaneous albinism - This condition is less commonly screened for on a population level because its incidence is lower compared to other genetic disorders and it does not often result in severe health issues that could be prevented by knowing carrier status before conception.\n\nC. Sickle cell disease - This is also suitable for population carrier screening, particularly in populations of African descent where the prevalence is higher.\n\nD. Tay-Sachs disease - This is another disorder that is suitable for population carrier screening, especially in populations of Ashkenazi Jewish descent where it is more prevalent.\n\nBased on the information provided, option B (Oculocutaneous albinism) is the least suitable for population carrier screening due to its lower prevalence and the fact that it generally does not cause life-threatening complications that could be avoided by knowing carrier status beforehand. However, it's important to note that the suitability of screening can vary based on the specific population being considered and the resources available for screening and counseling."
