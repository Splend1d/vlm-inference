The defendant was identified as the perpetrator of the crime by a film that was recorded during the burglary from a hidden camera. When the defendant was apprehended, he denied involvement in the crime and told the arresting officers that he had been out of town when the burglary occurred. Prior to trial, the defendant's court appointed attorney filed a motion requesting discovery of the videotape film that was recorded during the perpetration of the crime. The trial judge granted the request and ordered the prosecution to send a duplicate copy of the videotape to the defendant's attorney. Following the judge's ruling, the prosecuting attorney, pursuant to state law, then filed a discovery motion specifically asking the defendant whether he planned to raise an alibi defense. The prosecuting attorney also sought discovery of the identity of such an alibi witness. Assume that the judge requires the defendant to respond as to whether the defendant intends to raise an alibi defense. May the judge also require the defendant to disclose the identity of the alibi witness?\n\nA. Yes, because the prosecution should have an opportunity to investigate the merits of the alibi.\nB. Yes, because the defendant waived any claim of privilege when he sought discovery of the film from the prosecution.\nC. No, because by requiring the defendant to reveal information before he is tactically ready to do so substantially impairs his ability to successfully defend himself.\nD. No, because such disclosure constitutes an implied representation that is testimonial in character and, thus, violates the defendant's privilege against self-incrimination.\n"

Yes, because the prosecution should have an opportunity to investigate the merits of the alibi.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, a defendant who intends to present an alibi defense is required to provide notice of this intent to the prosecution, including the name and address of the alibi witness(es). This is known as \"alibi disclosure\" or \"reciprocal discovery,\" which allows both parties to prepare their cases fairly. The rationale behind this rule is that the prosecution should have the opportunity to investigate the credibility and accuracy of the alibi, just as the defense has the right to investigate the prosecution's case. This can include interviewing potential witnesses and gathering evidence that may contradict the alibi. The requirement to disclose the identity of an alibi witness does not necessarily violate the defendant's privilege against self-incrimination because it is part of the procedural rules governing criminal trials. However, the specifics can vary depending on local laws and court rules."
