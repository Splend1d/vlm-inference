The voltage \\(v\\) induced in an inductor is given by the formula:\n\n\\[ v = L \\frac{di}{dt} \\]\n\nwhere \\(L\\) is the inductance of the inductor, and \\(\\frac{di}{dt}\\) is the rate of change of current through the inductor. This relationship is known as Faraday's law of induction for inductors and describes how a changing magnetic field (which is caused by a changing current) induces an electromotive force (EMF) in the conductor."
