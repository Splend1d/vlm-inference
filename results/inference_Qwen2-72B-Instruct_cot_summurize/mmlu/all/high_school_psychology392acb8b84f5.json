You need to run an experiment: This is often true, as experiments can help establish cause-and-effect relationships, which are crucial for supporting theories. However, not all psychological theories can be tested through experiments due to ethical or practical limitations.\n\nB. You need to find statistically significant results: Achieving statistical significance is important because it suggests that the results are unlikely due to chance. However, statistical significance alone does not prove a theory; it only provides evidence that supports or refutes specific hypotheses derived from the theory.\n\nC. You must replicate your findings: Replication is critical in science, including psychology, because it confirms that the results are reliable and not due to random variation or experimental error. A single study, even with statistically significant results, is not enough to prove a theory conclusively.\n\nD. It is impossible to prove a theory: In the strictest scientific sense, this statement is true. Theories cannot be proven definitively, but they can be supported by a body of evidence. Scientific theories remain open to revision or rejection based on new evidence.\n\nIn summary, proving a psychological theory involves running experiments (when possible), finding statistically significant results, replicating findings, and continuously testing the theory against new evidence. Even then, a theory is never \"proven\" in the absolute sense, but rather becomes more widely accepted as the evidence supporting it grows stronger."
