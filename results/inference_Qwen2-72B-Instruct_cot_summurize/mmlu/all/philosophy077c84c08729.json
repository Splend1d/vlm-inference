According to Hume, perceptions of beauty are subjective and vary from one individual to another. He argues that what appears beautiful to one person may not appear so to another, emphasizing the role of personal taste and sentiment in aesthetic judgments. Therefore, he believes that each mind perceives a different beauty based on its own experiences and preferences."
