Affluent citizens, through their participation in this system, contribute to the harm of the poor by imposing on them the lasting effects of historical crimes (such as colonialism and imperialism) and by maintaining a global institutional framework that keeps them in a disadvantaged position relative to those in wealthier countries. This framework includes trade policies, intellectual property rights, and financial regulations that often favor the interests of developed nations at the expense of poorer ones."
