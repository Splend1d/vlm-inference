A high correlation means that there is a strong association between the scores on the two tests, suggesting that performance on one test can be used to predict performance on the other to some extent. However, it does not necessarily imply causation or that skill in one test directly results in skill in another (option A) or that both skills are the result of a third underlying skill (option C). It also does not measure the accuracy of the test scores (option B)."
