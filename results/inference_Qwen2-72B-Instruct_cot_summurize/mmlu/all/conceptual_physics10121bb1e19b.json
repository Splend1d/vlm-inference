When a spinning system contracts, its moment of inertia decreases (since mass is being brought closer to the axis of rotation). Due to conservation of angular momentum, the rotational speed must increase to keep the product of the moment of inertia and the angular velocity constant. Thus, even though the rotational speed increases, the angular momentum remains unchanged."
