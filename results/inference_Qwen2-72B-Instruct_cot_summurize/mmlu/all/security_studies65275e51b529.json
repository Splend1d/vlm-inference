Political policies designed to alter demographic characteristics of a state - This could involve forced assimilation, restrictions on family size for certain groups, or immigration policies aimed at changing the ethnic or religious makeup of a population. These actions can lead to social unrest, discrimination, and human rights violations.\n\nC. Legislation that criminalises certain cultural behaviours or practices - This can lead to the suppression of minority cultures and religions, which in turn can cause social tension and conflict. It may also violate principles of freedom of expression and belief.\n\nD. The use of military force to conduct ethnic cleansing through displacement and killing - This is a direct and extreme threat to societal security, involving mass violence and often resulting in significant loss of life, displacement, and long-term trauma for survivors. It is a clear violation of international law and human rights norms."
