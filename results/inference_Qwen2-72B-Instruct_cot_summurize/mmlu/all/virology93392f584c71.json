The other options listed were identified after observing clinical symptoms in patients. HIV was first recognized in the early 1980s when clusters of unusual illnesses such as Kaposi's sarcoma and Pneumocystis pneumonia were observed in homosexual men. Rubella teratogenicity was identified during the rubella epidemic in 1964 when an increase in congenital defects was observed in newborns whose mothers had contracted rubella during pregnancy. The association between microcephaly and Zika virus was identified during the 2015-2016 Zika outbreak when an increase in cases of microcephaly was observed in Brazil."
