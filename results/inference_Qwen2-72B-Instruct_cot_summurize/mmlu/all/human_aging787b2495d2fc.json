It is the longest possible measure because it encompasses the entirety of an individual's existence. Life expectancy at birth (LEAB) and life expectancy at a specified age (LEASA) are both statistical measures that estimate the average number of years a person is expected to live based on current mortality rates. These estimates are typically shorter than actual life spans because they are based on averages and do not account for individual variations or future changes in mortality rates."
