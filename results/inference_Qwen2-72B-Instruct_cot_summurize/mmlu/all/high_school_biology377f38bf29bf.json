The streamlined body has a selective advantage in that environment.\n\nThis is an example of convergent evolution, where different species independently evolve similar traits as a result of having to adapt to similar environments or ecological niches. In this case, living in water, a streamlined shape reduces drag, allowing these animals to swim faster and more efficiently. This trait provides a survival advantage in their aquatic habitat, leading to its prevalence among these different species."
