However, based on the information given:\n\nA. Mike does not suffer from a global dysfunction because his issue is not present in all situations; he can still become aroused under certain circumstances (e.g., seeing his secretary).\n\nB. Erectile dysfunction (ED) refers to the inability to achieve or maintain an erection sufficient for satisfactory sexual performance. While Mike may be experiencing difficulty getting aroused with his wife, this does not necessarily mean he has ED, as the term is more specific than just lack of arousal.\n\nC. Lubrication inhibition typically refers to difficulties with vaginal lubrication in women and does not apply to Mike's situation.\n\nD. The fact that Mike is aroused by his secretary does not automatically mean he is having an affair. Sexual attraction does not equate to acting on that attraction.\n\nGiven these options, the closest description of Mike's situation would be that he is experiencing a situational sexual dysfunction, which is not listed among the choices provided. This means that his arousal issues are specific to certain situations or partners, rather than being a general problem. If we had to choose from the options given, none directly applies, but B might be the closest if Mike's issue specifically involves difficulty achieving or maintaining an erection during intercourse with his wife, even though this does not fully capture the nuances of his experience."
