The law of survival of the fittest was not made by man, and it cannot be abrogated by man. We can only, by interfering with it, produce the survival of the unfittest. . . . The millionaires are a product of natural selection, acting on the whole body of men to pick out those who can meet the requirement of certain work to be done. In this respect they are just like the great statesmen, or scientific men, or military men. It is because they are thus selected that wealth\u2014both their own and that entrusted to them\u2014aggregates under their hands. Let one of them make a mistake and see how quickly the concentration gives way to dispersion.\"\n\u2014William Graham Sumner, What Social Classes Owe to Each Other, 1883\nThe sociological ideas of William Graham Sumner reflect the idea that during the late 1800s\n\nA. cultural and intellectual arguments justified the success of those at the top of the socioeconomic structure as both appropriate and inevitable.\nB. popular writers rejected ideas from the sciences, and based their arguments on faith.\nC. intellectuals were critical of the cut-throat competition of the ages, and proposed radical alternatives based on creating a cooperative economy.\nD. cultural products of the era tended to ignore the economic direction of society and looked back wistfully to the past.\n"

He argued that the wealthy were successful because they were naturally fit for their roles, and that any interference with this natural order would result in the survival of the unfittest. This perspective justified the vast disparities in wealth and power during the late 1800s as an inevitable outcome of natural selection."
