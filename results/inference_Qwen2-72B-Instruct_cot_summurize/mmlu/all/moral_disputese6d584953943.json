Moral theories are often developed with the aim of providing guidance for how people should act in various situations. This guidance can help individuals make decisions that align with their values and principles, and can also serve as a basis for evaluating the morality of actions and policies. While other principles such as parsimony (simplicity) and explanatory power (ability to explain phenomena) may be important in other fields of inquiry, they are not typically the primary focus of moral theory."
