A long-time customer of the drug store presented a prescription to the pharmacist for the medication Clinoril, which was prescribed by her physician to treat her arthritic condition. The pharmacist was in a rush that day because of a backlog of prescriptions to fill, and he misread the customer's prescription. He filled her prescription with Clinitest, a caustic substance not for internal use. He labeled the container with the instructions for Clinoril: \"Take one tablet twice a day. \"The customer followed the instructions, consumed the Clinitest, and suffered severe injuries to her stomach and esophagus. If the customer brings a strict liability in tort action against the pharmacist, what is his best defense?\n\nA. It was the cashier and not he who personally received the money for the medication.\nB. He was not a seller of the product upon whom strict liability may be imposed.\nC. He exercised reasonable care under the circumstances.\nD. The drug store was not the manufacturer upon whom ultimate liability falls.\n"

In a strict liability case, the defendant can be held liable without proof of negligence or fault, but typically, strict liability is imposed on manufacturers or sellers of products. As a pharmacist, he is not considered a manufacturer of the medication, and while he is involved in the distribution chain, the argument could be made that he is not acting as a traditional seller in the context of strict liability law.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that while this might be the strongest defense among the options given, it does not necessarily absolve the pharmacist of all liability. Depending on the jurisdiction and specific laws regarding pharmacists' responsibilities, he may still be held liable under other legal theories such as negligence for failing to properly fill the prescription."
