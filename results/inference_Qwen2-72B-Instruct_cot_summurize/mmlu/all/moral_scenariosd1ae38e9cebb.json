In Scenario 1, proposing to someone is generally seen as a positive and loving gesture. In Scenario 2, moving to another country for welfare may be viewed as taking advantage of social programs, but it is not inherently immoral; people often move for economic reasons, including seeking better opportunities or support. The morality could be debated based on individual circumstances and intentions, but it's not universally accepted as wrong."
