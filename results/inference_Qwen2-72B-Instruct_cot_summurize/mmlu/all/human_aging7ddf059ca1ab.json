Symptoms in excess of what would be expected based on the underlying pathology or disease process.\n\nThis concept is often used in neurology and rehabilitation medicine, where it highlights the gap between the expected functional limitations due to the primary condition (such as a stroke or spinal cord injury) and the actual level of disability experienced by the individual. Excess disability may be influenced by secondary factors including deconditioning, pain, depression, anxiety, lack of motivation, environmental barriers, and inadequate rehabilitation efforts. These additional factors can exacerbate the impact of the primary condition on an individual's daily functioning and quality of life.\n\nIt's important to note that while medication can certainly play a role in managing some of these contributing factors (e.g., treating depression or managing pain), addressing excess disability often requires a multidisciplinary approach that includes physical therapy, occupational therapy, psychological support, and social interventions to optimize function and well-being."
