National program of child immunization\n\nA national program of child immunization is likely to result in a permanent increase in a nation's productive capacity because it improves the health and longevity of the population, which can lead to a more productive workforce. Healthier children are more likely to grow into healthier adults who miss fewer days of work due to illness and are able to contribute more effectively to the economy. \n\nA decline in the birth rate (A) could potentially reduce future labor supply but does not necessarily increase productive capacity. Declining adult literacy rates (B) would likely decrease productive capacity as an educated workforce is essential for innovation and productivity. The widespread relocation of manufacturing firms to low-wage nations (C) may temporarily boost profits for those companies but does not inherently increase the productive capacity of the home nation; it might even decrease it if it leads to a loss of jobs and skills."
