Enactment of laws regulating railroads.\n\nThe sentiment expressed in the song lyrics is reflective of the Populist Movement or People's Party in the late 19th century United States, which advocated for the rights of farmers and laborers against the perceived greed of large corporations, banks, and railroads. One of the key accomplishments of this movement was the push for federal regulation of railroads, which led to laws such as the Interstate Commerce Act of 1887, aimed at curbing the monopolistic practices of railroad companies."
