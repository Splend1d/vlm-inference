This poem by Senegalese poet L\u00e9opold S\u00e9dar Senghor combines elements of Western poetic tradition with African themes and imagery. Senghor was a key figure in the N\u00e9gritude movement, which sought to celebrate and reclaim African culture and identity in the face of colonialism and Western dominance. The poem's language and form reflect this blending of influences, making it an example of how non-Western writers have adapted and transformed Western literary traditions."
