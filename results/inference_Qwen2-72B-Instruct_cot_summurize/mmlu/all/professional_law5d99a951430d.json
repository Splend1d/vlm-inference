To celebrate passing, the graduate went out with a few friends to a popular campus bar. The graduate's friend ordered a round of Hula Girls for everyone. A Hula Girl is an extremely potent alcoholic drink consisting. of 2 ounces of dry gin, 1 ounce of French vermouth, and 1 teaspoon of grenadine. After the drink is mixed, it is then served in a glass with an inverted lemon peel, which is cut at the ends to represent a grass skirt. Although the graduate had never heard of a Hula Girl, she was in a festive mood and drank it, anyway. A few minutes later, the graduate became very dizzy and attempted to stand up from the barstool. As she tried to walk to the restroom, she became nauseated and vomited over a customer sitting at a nearby table. The customer was embarrassed and greatly humiliated by the incident. If the customer asserts a claim against the graduate, the plaintiff will most likely\n\nA. prevail, because the graduate's conduct was extreme and outrageous.\nB. prevail, because an offensive touching resulted.\nC. not prevail, because the graduate's actions were involuntary.\nD. not prevail, because the graduate was unaware what she was drinking.\n"

Her actions were a result of the effects of the potent alcoholic drink she consumed, which caused her to become dizzy and vomit involuntarily. Generally, for a plaintiff to prevail in a tort claim, there must be some level of fault on the part of the defendant, such as negligence or intentional misconduct. Since the graduate's actions were not voluntary, it would be difficult for the customer to prove that the graduate acted negligently or with intent to cause harm. Therefore, the customer would most likely not prevail in a lawsuit against the graduate. However, it should be noted that the bar could potentially be held liable if they continued to serve the graduate alcohol when it was apparent she was already heavily intoxicated."
