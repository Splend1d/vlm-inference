Based on this definition:\n\nI. Mary who has quit her job to look for another - She is considered unemployed because she is not currently working, she is looking for a job, and presumably available to start working.\n\nII. John who fulfilled his dream by retiring from work at age 45 - He is not considered unemployed because he is retired and not seeking employment. Retirement usually implies that one has left the workforce voluntarily and does not intend to seek further employment.\n\nIII. Diane who works part-time but would like to work full-time - She might be classified under a related category called \"underemployment,\" which refers to individuals who are working fewer hours than they would prefer or are overqualified for their current position. However, depending on the specific criteria used to define unemployment in a given context, Diane may not necessarily be counted as unemployed if she is currently employed, even if it's part-time. Some definitions of unemployment exclude those who are partially employed but seeking more work.\n\nGiven these explanations, the answer that best fits the standard definition of unemployment is:\n\nA. I only\n\nHowever, if the question is considering broader labor market concepts that include underemployment, then Diane (III) could also be considered in the discussion, although typically not under the strict definition of unemployment. Since the question asks specifically about unemployment, the most accurate answer remains A. I only."
