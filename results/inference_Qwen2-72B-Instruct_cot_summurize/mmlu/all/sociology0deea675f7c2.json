Laing and Aaron Esterson criticized traditional psychiatry for its medicalization of human distress and its tendency to ignore the social and relational contexts in which mental health issues arise. They argued that so-called \"symptoms\" or \"disorders\" could often be understood as meaningful responses to troubled family dynamics or societal pressures, rather than as purely biological dysfunctions."
