Confounding variables are factors that can influence the outcome of the study but are not accounted for or controlled by the researcher. In this case, there could be several confounding variables that could affect student achievement, such as differences in the students' prior knowledge, their motivation, their learning styles, their sleep patterns, or even the teacher's energy level at different times of the day. Without controlling for these variables, it would be difficult to determine whether any observed differences in achievement were due to the time of day the class was taken or some other factor."
