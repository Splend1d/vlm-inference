The use of sampling with replacement as the sampling technique.\n\nBagging, or Bootstrap Aggregating, involves creating multiple subsets (or \"bags\") of the original dataset by sampling with replacement. This means that each subset can have duplicate samples from the original dataset. When these subsets are used to train different models, they help in reducing variance and preventing overfitting because each model sees a slightly different version of the data. By aggregating the predictions from all these models, bagging reduces the overall error and helps prevent overfitting.\n\nOptions B, C, and D do not specifically address the mechanism by which bagging prevents overfitting:\n\n- B. The use of weak classifiers: While using weak classifiers can be effective in boosting (another ensemble method), it's not specific to how bagging prevents overfitting.\n- C. The use of classification algorithms which are not prone to overfitting: This might reduce overfitting, but it does not explain how bagging itself prevents overfitting.\n- D. The practice of validation performed on every classifier trained: This is a good practice for model evaluation but does not inherently prevent overfitting in the context of bagging."
