Containment theory\n\nThis theory, which was a key component of US foreign policy during the Cold War, aimed to prevent the spread of communism. The belief was that if one country fell to communism, neighboring countries would follow, like a row of dominoes (this became known as the \"domino theory\"). To prevent this, the US supported non-communist governments and fought against communist insurgencies around the world, including in Vietnam."
