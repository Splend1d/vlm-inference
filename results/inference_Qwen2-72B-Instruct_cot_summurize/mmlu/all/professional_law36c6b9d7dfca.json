                    "text": "A man who was an avid swimmer moved to a new town and began looking for a facility with a swimming pool that he could use. He signed an agreement with the local swimming club to use their swimming pool four times per week. The agreement, which had a duration of one year, stated that the man could use the poo1 four times per week for $250 per month, due on the first day of each month. For three months, the man paid the $250 on the first and made use of the swimming pool. Toward the middle of the third month, the man was involved in an automobile accident. Shortly thereafter, the man sent the following letter to the swimming club:\"Please be advised that because of injuries sustained in an automobile accident, my physician has advised me not to engage in any strenuous activities. Since I will not be able to make use of the pool anymore, no further payments will be forthcoming. \"Which of the following does not accurately state the immediate legal effect of the man's letter?\n\nA. The swimming club has the right to bar the man from any further use of the pooi.\nB. The swimming club has the right to sue the man immediately for breach of contract.\nC. The man may retract his repudiation if he does so before the swimming club initiates legal action against him.\nD. The swimming club must wait until the date of the next payment in order to sue the man for breach of contract.\n"

The swimming club has the right to sue the man immediately for breach of contract.\n\nWhen a party to a contract anticipatorily repudiates the contract (as the man did by stating he would not make further payments), the aggrieved party (the swimming club) does have the option to sue for breach of contract immediately. However, they also have the option to wait until the time for performance arrives (in this case, the date of the next payment) before taking any legal action. Therefore, while the swimming club could potentially sue immediately, it is not an absolute right; they could choose to wait as well. Option D is actually a correct statement regarding what the swimming club might do under the circumstances, but since the question asks for the statement that does NOT accurately describe the immediate legal effect, the answer is B, as it presents an option that, while possible, is not the only course of action available to the swimming club."
