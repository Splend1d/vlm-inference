Pluralists argue that no one group has a monopoly on power and that decision-making is diffused across various institutions and interest groups. This leads to a system where political parties must compete for support from a diverse electorate, and where the state's power is exercised through multiple administrative structures. Additionally, pluralists often argue that the ruling elite is not homogenous but is instead made up of individuals from various class backgrounds. However, pluralist theories do not necessarily imply that there is a close alignment between class background and party preference (option D). While class may play a role in shaping political preferences, pluralists argue that other factors such as ideology, interest group pressure, and personal values also influence voting behavior."
