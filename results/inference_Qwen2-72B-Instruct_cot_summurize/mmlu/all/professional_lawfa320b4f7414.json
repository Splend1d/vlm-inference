The grower's title to the lemon grove was subject to an unrecorded 20-year mortgage given to the mortgagee, a bank, in 1990 to secure repayment of a loan for $100,000. Beginning in November 1993, the following events occurred:November 1993: The grower died, leaving all of her real property to her husband. The grower's will was admitted to probate. No mention was made of the mortgage given to the bank. December 1993: Having heard about the grower's death, the bank recorded its mortgage to the lemon grove. August 1994: The husband executed and delivered to his sister a mortgage deed on the orange grove, which the sister immediately recorded. The mortgage instrument contained the following recitations: \"This mortgage is secured by the orange grove and all other real estate that I may own in the city or have an interest in. \" The husband defaulted on his mortgage obligation to the sister; the amount due on the debt was $100,000. February 2009: The bank brought suit against the husband to foreclose its mortgage on the lemon grove. The applicable recording statute provides in part:\"No deed or other instrument in writing, not recorded in accordance with this statute, shall affect the title or rights to, in any real estate, of any devisee or purchaser in good faith, without knowledge of the existence of such unrecorded instruments. \"Judgment should be for\n\nA. the husband, if he was unaware of the existence of the mortgage at the time he acquired title to the lemon grove.\nB. the husband, only if the lemon grove was not subject to the mortgage when he acquired title.\nC. the bank, because the husband assumed the mortgage when he acquired title to the lemon grove.\nD. the bank, because property once mortgaged remains mortgaged as against the mortgagor's successors in interest.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is D. The bank.\n\nUnder the doctrine of \"lien follows the land,\" a mortgage on a piece of property continues to encumber that property even after it changes hands, provided the mortgage has been properly recorded. In this case, although the bank did not record its mortgage until after the grower's death, the recording statute protects the bank's interest against the husband because the mortgage was eventually recorded and the husband had no knowledge of the mortgage at the time he inherited the lemon grove. However, the key factor here is that the mortgage was in place before the husband inherited the property, and recording it afterward solidified the bank's interest against subsequent purchasers or devisees who might otherwise claim ignorance of the mortgage.\n\nAdditionally, the statute cited does not protect the husband since he is not considered a \"purchaser in good faith\" in relation to the lemon grove because he inherited it rather than purchasing it. Furthermore, the statute specifically mentions \"devisee[s]\" but still requires that they lack knowledge of the unrecorded instruments to be protected. Since the husband inherited the lemon grove from his wife, and there is no indication that he had actual knowledge of the mortgage at the time of inheritance, the statute does not provide him protection against the bank's mortgage.\n\nTherefore, the bank can foreclose on the lemon grove despite the husband's inheritance of the property because the mortgage was validly created before his acquisition and was later properly recorded, attaching to the lemon grove as the bank intended."
