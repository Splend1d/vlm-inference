Officer sees nothing in the passenger compartment, but pops the trunk and finds cash and a baseball bat. Stan's motion to suppress the cash and baseball bat as evidence will likely be\n\nA.

Denied, because the Officer had probable cause to search the trunk.\n\nUnder the automobile exception to the Fourth Amendment's warrant requirement, police may conduct a warrantless search of a vehicle if they have probable cause to believe that it contains contraband or evidence of a crime. Here, the officer observed Stan running out of a darkened liquor store at 3 a.m., immediately after hearing breaking glass and a blaring alarm. These facts provide probable cause to believe that Stan committed a burglary, and thus give the officer probable cause to search the car for evidence of the crime. Since the trunk is part of the car, the officer has the authority to search it as well.\n\nChoice B is incorrect because while a search incident to a valid arrest does permit officers to search the passenger compartment of a vehicle, it does not automatically extend to the trunk. However, in this case, the officer had probable cause to search the trunk, which justifies the search.\n\nChoice C is incorrect because the automobile exception allows officers to search the entire vehicle, including areas that are not within the immediate control of the suspect, when there is probable cause to do so.\n\nChoice D is incorrect because the arrest was not illegal. The officer had probable cause to believe that Stan committed a burglary based on the circumstances described, which justified the arrest and subsequent search of the car."
