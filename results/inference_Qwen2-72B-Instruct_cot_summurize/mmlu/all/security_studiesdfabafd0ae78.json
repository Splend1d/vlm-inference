Highlighting and understanding the political subjecthoods that have been marginalized or excluded from traditional security discourses. This approach allows for a more inclusive analysis that considers the experiences and perspectives of non-state actors, minorities, and other underrepresented groups.\n\nB. Examining the foundations of power and its construction, providing a deeper understanding of how power operates within security contexts. By deconstructing dominant narratives and ideologies, post-structuralism can reveal the underlying power dynamics that shape security policies and practices.\n\nC. Challenging the notion that technology and smart weapons are the primary determinants of security. Post-structuralism encourages a critical examination of the role of technology in security, questioning its assumed neutrality and uncovering the ways in which it may reinforce existing power structures or create new forms of vulnerability.\n\nOverall, post-structuralist critique enriches security studies by offering alternative perspectives and fostering a more nuanced understanding of the complex relationships between power, identity, and security."
