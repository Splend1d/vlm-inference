He hires a crop-duster to spray the field, but the crop- duster mistakenly sprays a strong herbicide, rather than a pesticide, and kills all the corn plants in the field. Several days later, a construction company building a house near the farmer's field negligently hits a gas line and starts a fire that burns everything in the area, including the farmer's field. If the farmer brings negligence claims against the crop-duster and the construction company in order to recover damages for the destruction of his corn crop, the most likely result is\n\nA. only the crop-duster is liable, because its negligence occurred before the construction company's negligence.\nB. only the construction company is liable, because its negligence would have destroyed the farmer's corn crop no matter what the crop- duster did.\nC. both the crop-duster and the construction company are liable, because each engaged in a negligent action that was sufficient to destroy the farmer's corn crop.\nD. neither the crop-duster nor the construction company is liable, because neither is a \"but for\" cause of the harm.\n"

This concept is known as \"substantial factor\" or \"concurrent causation.\" The crop-duster's use of the wrong chemical would have destroyed the crop regardless of the fire, and the construction company's negligent action in hitting the gas line and causing the fire also would have destroyed the crop regardless of the herbicide. Therefore, both parties can be held liable for the damage to the farmer's corn crop.\n\nOption A is incorrect because liability does not depend solely on the temporal order of the events. Option B is incorrect because the crop-duster's negligence was also sufficient to cause the harm. Option D is incorrect because both the crop-duster and the construction company were \"but for\" causes of the harm, meaning that the harm would not have occurred \"but for\" their respective actions. However, the concept of \"but for\" causation alone is not sufficient to establish liability when there are multiple concurrent causes."
