While Halloween (A) has pagan origins that have been blended with Christian traditions and secular customs, foreign cuisine adapted to American tastes (B) represents cultural syncretism in culinary arts, and Catholicism in Louisiana (D) has incorporated elements from African, Native American, and French traditions, Hasidic Judaism (C) generally does not represent syncretism. Hasidic Judaism is a movement within orthodox Judaism that emphasizes joy, emotion, and spirituality in religious practice and does not typically blend with other religions or cultures in a way that would be considered syncretism."
