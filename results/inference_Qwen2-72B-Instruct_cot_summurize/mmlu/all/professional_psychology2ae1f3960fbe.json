Damage to this side can impair abilities that rely on these functions.\n\nHowever, some tasks, while they may involve cognitive processes that the left hemisphere contributes to, are not solely dependent on it. Among the options provided, the task that is least likely to be significantly impaired by unilateral damage to the left hemisphere would be:\n\nC. read a map.\n\nReading a map involves spatial reasoning and the ability to interpret visual information, which are typically associated with the right hemisphere of the brain. While the left hemisphere might contribute to the process of understanding written or numerical labels on a map, the primary difficulty in reading a map after left hemisphere damage would not be in interpreting the map itself but rather in understanding any text or numbers present on it. The actual spatial and visual aspects of reading a map would be less affected, as these are more right-hemisphere functions."
