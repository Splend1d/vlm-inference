Androgen insensitivity\n\nAndrogen insensitivity syndrome (AIS) is a condition that affects people with one X and one Y chromosome (XY), usually resulting in individuals who have female external genitalia but no uterus and may not menstruate. These individuals often have normal breast development but lack pubic and axillary hair. Since the patient has normal female body habitus and breast development but no history of menstruation and absent pubic and axillary hair, AIS is a plausible diagnosis.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that without further diagnostic tests, including genetic testing and possibly imaging studies, it's not possible to definitively diagnose the condition based on the symptoms alone. Other conditions can also present similarly, so additional evaluation would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis."
