                    "text": "The argument presented seems to commit a few logical fallacies:\n\n1. **Stereotyping**: This is not a specific fallacy but an important bias to note. The assumption that only intelligent people should go to college and that those who choose to attend college must be intelligent is a stereotype. It assumes a narrow definition of intelligence and disregards other factors that might motivate someone to attend college, such as personal growth, career advancement, or the pursuit of knowledge.\n\n2. **Denying the Antecedent (C)**: This fallacy occurs when someone invalidly argues that if the first part of a conditional statement is false, then the second part must also be false. In this case, the argument assumes that if someone is not intelligent (as defined by the speaker), they cannot succeed in college or in life. However, success in college and beyond can depend on many factors besides what the speaker considers \"intelligence,\" such as hard work, resilience, support systems, and opportunity.\n\n3. **Begging the Question (D)**: This fallacy involves making an argument that includes the conclusion within its own premises. Here, the argument presupposes that only intelligent people will succeed, which is essentially what it's trying to prove. It does not provide evidence for why intelligence (as defined) is the sole determinant of success.\n\n4. **Ad Hominem (A)**: While the argument doesn't directly attack a person, it does attack a group of people (those attending college without what the speaker considers to be \"basic intelligence\") rather than addressing the issue at hand. This could be seen as an indirect ad hominem attack, focusing on the perceived characteristics of individuals rather than discussing the validity of their actions or decisions.\n\n5. **Straw Man (B)**: The argument might also be creating a straw man by oversimplifying the concept of intelligence and assuming that everyone believes only intelligent people belong in college. It sets up a simplified version of the opposing viewpoint to easily knock it down, rather than engaging with more nuanced views on education and intelligence.\n\nIn summary, the argument contains elements of multiple logical fallacies, including denying the antecedent, begging the question, and potentially ad hominem and straw man."
