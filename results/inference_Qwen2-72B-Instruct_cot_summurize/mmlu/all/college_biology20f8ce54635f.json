Coating synthetic beads with a different glycoprotein, ZP2, fails to lead to sperm aggregation on the beads.\n\nThis observation would not be unexpected because sperm do not have receptors for ZP2; they have receptors for ZP3. Therefore, coating beads with ZP2 would not be expected to cause sperm aggregation. The other three options all describe situations that would be expected based on our understanding of how mouse sperm and eggs interact. Injecting eggs with antibodies that bind to ZP3 or incubating eggs with such antibodies would block fertilization by preventing the sperm from binding to the egg. Incubating sperm with purified ZP3 prior to mixing them with eggs would also block fertilization because it would cause the sperm to undergo the acrosomal reaction prematurely, rendering them unable to fertilize an egg."
