Substituting this into the equation gives us the new radiant flux density:\n\n\\[ j' = \\sigma (3T)^4 = 81\\sigma T^4 \\]\n\nComparing the new radiant flux density \\(j'\\) to the original \\(j\\), we see that the radiant flux density increases by a factor of 81.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.
