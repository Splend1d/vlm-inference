Wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn Scenario 1, giving chocolate to a dog is considered wrong because chocolate is toxic to dogs and can cause serious health problems or even death. Therefore, this action is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nIn Scenario 2, pawning one's wedding ring to pay for a spouse's life-saving drugs is not considered morally wrong. In fact, it could be seen as a selfless act done out of love and concern for one's partner's well-being. This action is likely to be viewed as morally right or at least not wrong, given the circumstances."
