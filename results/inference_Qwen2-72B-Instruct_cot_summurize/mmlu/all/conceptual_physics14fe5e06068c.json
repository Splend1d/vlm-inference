Plugging this into the kinetic energy formula gives us:\n\nNew kinetic energy = \\(\\frac{1}{2}m(3v)^2 = \\frac{1}{2}m \\cdot 9v^2 = 9 \\times (\\frac{1}{2}mv^2)\\)\n\nThis shows that the new kinetic energy is 9 times the original kinetic energy, because the velocity term \\(v^2\\) has been multiplied by 9 due to tripling the speed.\n\nSo, the correct answer is **not listed in your options** but corresponds to option D from your list if we interpret it as \"nine times greater\". For the sake of the provided options, the closest interpretation would be:\n\nD. None of these\n\nHowever, if the intention was to include a correct choice reflecting the actual outcome, it should have included an option stating \"nine times greater\" or similar."
