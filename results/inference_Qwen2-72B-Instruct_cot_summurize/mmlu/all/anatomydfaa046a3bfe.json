Proprioceptive information is carried by the masseteric and auriculotemporal nerves.\n\nThe temporomandibular joint (TMJ) does have an articular disc, but it is made of fibrocartilage, not hyaline cartilage. The articular surfaces are also covered with fibrocartilage rather than hyaline cartilage. Proprioceptive information from the TMJ is indeed carried by the masseteric nerve (a branch of the mandibular nerve, V3) and the auriculotemporal nerve (also a branch of the mandibular nerve). The chorda tympani is not involved in proprioception from the TMJ; it is a branch of the facial nerve (VII) that carries taste sensations from the anterior two-thirds of the tongue and parasympathetic secretomotor fibers to the salivary glands. The deep temporal nerves innervate the temporalis muscle, not the TMJ for proprioception."
