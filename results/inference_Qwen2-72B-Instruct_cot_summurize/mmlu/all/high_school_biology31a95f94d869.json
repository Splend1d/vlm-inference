Chick embryos receive their nutrition from the yolk, which is enclosed within the vitelline membrane and is part of the egg. The yolk sac in birds and reptiles serves as the connection between the embryo and the yolk for nutrient transfer. In mammals, the placenta connects the fetus to the mother's blood supply for nourishment. The amnion is the membrane that surrounds the embryo in a fluid-filled cavity, providing cushioning and protection. The chorion is involved in forming part of the placental barrier in mammals or is associated with the outer layer of the eggshell in birds and reptiles."
