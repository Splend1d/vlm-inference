High LPC (Least Preferred Coworker) leaders, who tend to focus on relationships, perform better in moderately favorable situations because they can balance task and relationship needs. Low LPC leaders, who are more focused on tasks, perform better in very favorable or very unfavorable situations. However, it's important to note that neither type of leader is always more effective than the other; their effectiveness depends on the context."
