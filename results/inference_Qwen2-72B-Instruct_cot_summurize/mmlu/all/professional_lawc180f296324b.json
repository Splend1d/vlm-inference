The written contract called for the photographer \"to produce a minimum of six acceptable photographs by August 15. \" In exchange, the photographer was to be paid $200. Which of the following is the LEAST accurate statement with regard to the photographer's taking of the photographs?\n\nA. By entering into the contract as written, the photographer assumed the risk that the mother would fail to cooperate in arranging for the taking of the photographs.\nB. The mother was under an implied duty to act in good faith to reasonably cooperate with the photographer in arranging for the taking of the photographs.\nC. An implied condition of the photographer's duty of performance was that the mother reasonably cooperate in arranging for the taking of the photographs.\nD. The mother's refusal to cooperate reasonably in arranging for the taking of the photographs would excuse the photographer from further obligation under the contract and also give the photographer a right of action against the mother for breach of contract.\n"

By entering into the contract as written, the photographer assumed the risk that the mother would fail to cooperate in arranging for the taking of the photographs.\n\nThis statement is less accurate because the contract does not explicitly state that the photographer assumes the risk of the mother's non-cooperation. Instead, contracts generally imply a duty of good faith and fair dealing, which includes reasonable cooperation between the parties. This means that both the photographer and the mother have an obligation to act in good faith and cooperate to achieve the purpose of the contract. If the mother fails to cooperate, it could be considered a breach of her implied duty and may relieve the photographer of their obligations under the contract, as stated in options B, C, and D."
