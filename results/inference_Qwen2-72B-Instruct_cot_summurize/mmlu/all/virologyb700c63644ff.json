Spread by faecal oral route\n\nMERS-CoV, the virus that causes MERS, is primarily known for its respiratory transmission through aerosol droplets rather than being spread via the faecal-oral route. While there have been reports of the virus being detected in the stool of some patients, this is not considered a primary mode of transmission for MERS. The other options listed are consistent with what is currently understood about MERS-CoV:\n\nB. Aerosol droplet transmission - This is a recognized mode of transmission for MERS-CoV, similar to how influenza and other respiratory viruses spread.\n\nC. Reservoir in bats - Bats are believed to be the natural reservoir of MERS-CoV, as they are for many other coronaviruses.\n\nD. A conduit to humans via camels - Camels are thought to be an intermediate host that transmits the virus to humans, facilitating the spillover of MERS-CoV from bats to people."
