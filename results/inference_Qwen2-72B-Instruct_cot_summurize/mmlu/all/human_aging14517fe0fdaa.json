However, it's important to note that the name Whitebear isn't associated with a famous longitudinal self-study on aging and memory retrieval in the same way that some of the other names you've listed are known for their contributions to psychology. It's possible there may be some confusion with the name or specifics of the study. A more well-known figure in this context would be Elizabeth Loftus, but she doesn't match any of the provided options. If this question comes from a specific text or course, it might refer to a particular study not widely recognized outside that context."
