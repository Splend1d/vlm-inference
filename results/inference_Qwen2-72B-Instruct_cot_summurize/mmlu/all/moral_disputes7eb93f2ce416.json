Both A and B.\n\nWellman argues that denying a country's right to freedom of association would have unpalatable implications, including the inability to explain why it would be wrong to force one country to join a trade agreement or to forcefully annex another country. In other words, if countries do not have the right to freely associate with or dissociate from others, then there would be no principled basis for objecting to such actions. Therefore, both A and B are correct implications of denying a country's right to freedom of association."
