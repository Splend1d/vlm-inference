The normal force is equal to the weight of the object, which is determined by its mass and the acceleration due to gravity.\n\nFor an object sliding on a surface, the area of contact does not directly affect the frictional force because the pressure distribution under the object remains constant as long as the total force applied (weight) remains unchanged. This means that if you change the dimensions of the object but keep its mass the same, the frictional force will remain the same.\n\nIn this case, the question states that we have a new block made of the same material (so the density and thus the mass per unit volume are the same), but it has half the height and twice the length compared to the original block. Since the volume of the block is proportional to its height, length, and width, reducing the height by half and doubling the length keeps the volume (and therefore the mass) the same, assuming the width remains unchanged. Thus, the normal force \\( N \\) remains the same, and since the coefficient of friction \\( \\mu \\) is also unchanged, the frictional force \\( f \\) will also remain the same.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. \\( f \\)"
