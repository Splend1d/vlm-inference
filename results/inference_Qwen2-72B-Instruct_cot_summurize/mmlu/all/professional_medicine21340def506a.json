                    "text": "A 37-year-old man with type 1 diabetes mellitus is admitted to the hospital because of inadequate control of his glucose concentrations for the past 2 months. Despite his poor control, he demands that he be discharged. He reports that he has had a 3-month history of fatigue, irritability, and feelings of hopelessness. He says that he has been noncompliant with his diabetic regimen, adding, \"Sometimes I forget.\" He has been avoiding his family and friends because he is not in the mood to see them but admits that he is lonely. He did not get out of bed for 2 days, which prompted his wife to call an ambulance and have him admitted to the hospital. Prior to admission to the hospital, his only medication was insulin, although he often missed doses. He does not drink alcohol. He is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb); BMI is 36 kg/m2 . His temperature is 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), pulse is 68/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 150/85 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. On mental status examination, he is tired and has a restricted affect. There is no evidence of suicidal ideation. Cognition is intact. His fasting serum glucose concentration is 120 mg/dL. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?\n\nA. Adhere to the patient's wishes and discuss home-care options\nB. Adhere to the patient's wishes on the condition that he agree to home nursing care\nC. Schedule neuropsychological testing\nD. Seek a court order to appoint a legal guardian\n"

                    "text": "The patient's symptoms of fatigue, irritability, hopelessness, social withdrawal, and non-compliance with his diabetic regimen suggest that he may be suffering from depression. Depression can significantly impact a person's ability to manage their diabetes effectively, leading to poor glycemic control and increased risk of complications.\n\nGiven the severity of his symptoms and his poor glycemic control, it would be inappropriate to simply adhere to his wishes and discharge him without further evaluation and intervention. The patient's safety and well-being must be prioritized over his autonomy in this case.\n\nOption D, seeking a court order to appoint a legal guardian, is also not appropriate at this time as there is no evidence of incompetence or inability to make informed decisions.\n\nOption C, scheduling neuropsychological testing, could be useful in assessing cognitive function and identifying any underlying neurological conditions that may contribute to his symptoms. However, it is not the most urgent step in management.\n\nThe most appropriate next step in management would be to consult with a psychiatrist or mental health professional to evaluate the patient for depression and provide appropriate treatment. This may include psychotherapy, antidepressant medication, and/or referral to a diabetes education program to improve his self-management skills. Therefore, the answer is not listed among the options provided, but the correct next step would be to refer the patient to a mental health professional for evaluation and treatment of depression."
