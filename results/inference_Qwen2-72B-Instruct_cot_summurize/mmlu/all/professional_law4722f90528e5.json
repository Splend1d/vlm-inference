An amendment to that act extends coverage to the states as employers. The federal district court allowed an injunction to prevent further discrimination but refused to allow money damages and legal fees against the state on the basis of 11th Amendment sovereign immunity. The plaintiffs appealed. What should the Court of Appeals decide based on the established jurisprudence regarding sovereign immunity?\n\nA. There is no sovereign immunity due to the First Amendment rights of the women to protest against discrimination.\nB. There is sovereign immunity that protects a state from any lawsuit by private citizens that the state does not authorize.\nC. There is no sovereign immunity where the federal law provides a remedy to women in a civil rights law intended to apply the Fourteenth Amendment enforcement rights against the states.\nD. There is sovereign immunity under the Supremacy Clause and it would take a new constitutional amendment to abrogate the immunity granted to the states.\n"

There is no sovereign immunity where the federal law provides a remedy to women in a civil rights law intended to apply the Fourteenth Amendment enforcement rights against the states.\n\nThis is because Congress has the power under Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment to enforce equal protection provisions through appropriate legislation, which includes abrogating state sovereign immunity when it comes to suits alleging violations of federal civil rights laws like Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. This principle was established in cases such as Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer (1976) and later affirmed in Kimel v. Florida Board of Regents (2000), among others. These cases recognized that Congress can abrogate state sovereign immunity when it acts pursuant to its Fourteenth Amendment enforcement powers. Therefore, the state cannot claim sovereign immunity in this case, and the plaintiffs should be able to seek money damages and legal fees if they prevail in their Title VII claims."
