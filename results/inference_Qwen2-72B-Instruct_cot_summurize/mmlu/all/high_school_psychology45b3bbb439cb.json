Hormones released in the womb can affect brain development and potentially contribute to an individual's sexual orientation. It is important to note that sexual orientation is complex and likely influenced by a combination of genetic, hormonal, and environmental factors. However, among the options provided, prenatal hormone exposure is the factor that has the strongest scientific evidence supporting its influence on sexual orientation."
