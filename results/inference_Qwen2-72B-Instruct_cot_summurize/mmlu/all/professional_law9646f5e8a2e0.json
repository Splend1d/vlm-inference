The cab driver recognized the passenger as a former girlfriend, and the passenger invited him into her house when they arrived. Unknown to the cab driver, the passenger was an undercover police officer who worked in the sex crimes unit. When they were inside the passenger's house, the cab driver made sexual advances toward the passenger, who responded by kissing him and holding his hand. The cab driver was about to kiss the passenger again, when she got up to answer the phone in the kitchen. If the cab driver is subsequently arrested and charged with the attempted rape of the passenger, he should be found\n\nA. not guilty.\nB. not guilty, solely because he was entrapped.\nC. not guilty, if he raises the proper alibi defense.\nD. not guilty, if he was predisposed to commit thecrime.\n"

However, based on the information provided, it appears that the cab driver may have a defense to the charge of attempted rape.\n\nEntrapment occurs when law enforcement officials induce someone to commit a crime that they would not otherwise have committed. In this case, the undercover police officer may have engaged in conduct that could be considered entrapment if she encouraged or coerced the cab driver into making sexual advances toward her. However, the mere fact that the officer was working undercover does not necessarily mean that entrapment occurred.\n\nAn alibi defense would require the cab driver to prove that he was somewhere else at the time the alleged crime took place. This defense would not be relevant if the cab driver was indeed present in the passenger's house at the time of the incident.\n\nPredisposition refers to the defendant's inclination or tendency to commit the crime. If the cab driver had a history of committing similar crimes, he may be considered predisposed to commit the crime. However, this does not automatically make him guilty of the current charge.\n\nIn this case, the cab driver may argue that he did not actually attempt to rape the passenger, but rather made sexual advances that were reciprocated by the passenger. If the cab driver can show that he did not use force or coercion and that the sexual contact was consensual, he may be found not guilty.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is not listed among the options provided. The cab driver's guilt or innocence will depend on the specific facts and evidence presented in court."
