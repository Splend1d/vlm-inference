This was the first action taken, and the creditor did not have a judgment. It served the notice of garnishment on the garnishee, the woman's employer. The employer honored the notice by holding all of the woman's earnings in escrow pending the creditor's lawsuit and entrance of final judgment against the woman. The state where defendant lived and worked had a provision for pre-judgment garnishment, as long as the money was held and not distributed until a judgment was entered. The money would be paid to the woman if a judgment was not entered with the next 120 days. The woman sued the employer and the creditor, demanding release of her earnings. Will the court order the garnishee to release the funds to the woman?\n\nA. No, because the state procedure for protecting the woman's money until a judgment is entered is a fair one that comports with procedural due process.\nB. No, because the state has an interest in protecting the rights of creditors to collect debts through the garnishment procedure.\nC. Yes, because the only party that has garnishment rights in the United States is the Internal Revenue Service.\nD. Yes, because the interim freezing of wages without a chance to be heard violates procedural due process.\n"

As long as the funds are not distributed before a judgment is made, this procedure generally respects the debtor's right to due process. The woman will have the opportunity to contest the garnishment during the creditor's lawsuit, and if no judgment is entered within the specified time frame (120 days in this case), the funds must be released to her. Therefore, the court is unlikely to order the release of the funds solely based on the woman's demand, as the procedure followed by the creditor and the employer is in accordance with state law and does not violate the woman's procedural due process rights."
