E \u2283 F - This is not an immediate consequence because premise 1 states the opposite, E \u2283 ~F.\n\nB. F \u2283 G - This is not an immediate consequence because there is no direct connection between F and G in a single step from the premises.\n\nC. G \u2283 E - This is not an immediate consequence because there is no direct connection between G and E in a single step from the premises.\n\nD. ~~F - This is an immediate consequence. We can see this by using premise 3 (~G) and modus tollens with premise 2 (~F \u2283 G). Since we have ~G, and if ~F were true, then G would be true according to premise 2, we can infer that ~F must be false, i.e., ~~F.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. ~~F."
