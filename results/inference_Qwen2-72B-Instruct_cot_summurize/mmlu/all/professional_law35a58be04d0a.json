After a hearing, the state court ordered possession of the land surrendered to the corporation, prior to determination of compensation, upon deposit in court of a sum deemed adequate to cover damages that might be awarded. The timber company immediately commenced an action to enjoin the court-ordered sale of its property. Which of the following would be the best ground for upholding the state court's order?\n\nA. The power of eminent domain may only be delegated directly to a private enterprise for a public related use or activity.\nB. The power of eminent domain may only be delegated to a public authority through a legislative determination.\nC. The injured party has not proved such irreparable injury to use as amounts to a \"taking. \"\nD. The Fifth Amendment's power of eminent domain, incorporated by the Fourteenth Amendment as applicable to the states, does not require that payment be made prior to condemnation of the property.\n"

The Fifth Amendment's power of eminent domain, incorporated by the Fourteenth Amendment as applicable to the states, does not require that payment be made prior to condemnation of the property.\n\nThis option correctly reflects the legal principle that the government, or in this case, a corporation acting under the authority of the state, can take private property for public use without making immediate payment, provided there is a process in place to determine just compensation afterward. The requirement for just compensation is upheld, but the timing of the payment does not necessarily precede the taking of the property."
