This is because the force due to a magnetic field is always perpendicular to the velocity of the particle and hence can only change the direction of motion, not the speed. Therefore, regardless of the time spent in the magnetic field, the speed of the proton remains the same as its initial speed.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\nC. \\(1.5 \\times 10^6 \\, \\text{m/s}\\)"
