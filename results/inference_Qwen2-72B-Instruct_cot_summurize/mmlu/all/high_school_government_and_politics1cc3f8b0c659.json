However, there is an exception known as the \"dual sovereignty doctrine,\" which allows a person to be tried for the same conduct under state and federal laws without violating the double jeopardy clause because states and the federal government are considered separate sovereigns with their own law enforcement powers.\n\nOption A, on appeal by state prosecutors, is not accurate because appeals do not result in a retrial at the federal level; they remain within the state court system unless they involve constitutional issues that could potentially be heard by the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nOption D, as civil liberties violations, is also not accurate in this context. Retrying a case at the federal level due to civil liberties violations would typically involve a different set of circumstances, such as when a federal court finds that the defendant's rights were violated during the state prosecution.\n\nTherefore, the most likely scenario where a failed felony prosecution at the state level might be retried at the federal level is if new evidence emerges that significantly changes the case, potentially leading to a different outcome."
