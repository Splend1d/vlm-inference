During the follicular phase, the lining of the uterus (endometrium) thickens in preparation for potential implantation of an embryo, which is the proliferative stage. In the luteal phase, the endometrium enters the secretory phase, where it becomes even more receptive to implantation by secreting nutrients and other factors that support pregnancy."
