This function maps from (0, 1) to (0, 1] in a one-to-one and onto manner. Hence, this statement is true.\n\nII. The image of f is compact: This statement is not necessarily true. A set in a topological space is said to be compact if every open cover of the set has a finite subcover. In the context of real numbers, a set is compact if it is both closed and bounded. The interval (0, 1] is bounded but not closed (since it does not contain its limit point 0), hence it is not compact. However, there exist functions whose images are compact subsets of (0, 1]. For instance, consider the constant function f(x) = 1/2 for all x in (0, 1). The image of this function is the singleton set {1/2}, which is compact. But since the question asks about the image being (0, 1], this statement is not true in the specific context of the given domain and codomain.\n\nIII. f is continuous, one-to-one, and onto: This statement can also be true. The function f(x) = x/(1-x) mentioned earlier is continuous on (0, 1), one-to-one, and onto from (0, 1) to (0, 1].\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. I and III only."
