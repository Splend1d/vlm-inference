It's more of a legal gray area unless you're using the content in a way that infringes on the author's rights or violates copyright laws.\n\nIn Scenario 2, copying answers from a book during a closed book test at school is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. This action is considered cheating, which is both unethical and often against school rules. Cheating undermines the fairness of academic assessment and can give an unfair advantage over others."
