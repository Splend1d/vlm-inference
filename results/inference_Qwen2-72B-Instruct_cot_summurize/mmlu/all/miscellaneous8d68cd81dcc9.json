Studies of the speeds and travel paths of seismic waves passing through Earth\n\nSeismic waves generated by earthquakes provide invaluable information about the internal structure of the Earth. By analyzing how these waves speed up, slow down, bend, or disappear at different depths, scientists can infer the properties of various layers within the Earth, including the core, mantle, and crust. This method has been crucial in understanding the composition and state (solid or liquid) of these layers."
