                    "text": "A homeowner died in 1985. His will devised his estate in a southern state to his uncle and his best friend \"to share and share alike as tenants in common. \"At the time of the homeowner's death, the uncle lived in a different part of the southern state (in which the estate was located), while the best friend resided in a northern state. After the homeowner's funeral, the uncle returned to his own residence, but the best friend decided to occupy the estate. He put his name on the mailbox and has paid the taxes and maintenance expenses. To earn extra money, the best friend rented a small house on the property to a teacher and received a monthly rental payment from her. The best friend also grew fruits on the property and sold them at a stand on Fridays. The uncle has been generally aware of this, but because he cared little about the estate, the uncle has never pressed the best friend about the property. Since 1985 the uncle has not paid any rent or other compensation to the best friend, nor has the best friend requested such payment. In January 2010, a series of disputes arose between the uncle and the best friend for the first time concerning their respective rights to the estate. The state in which the property is located recognizes the usual common law types of cotenancies and follows majority rules on rents and profits. There is no applicable legislation on the subject. The uncle brings an appropriate action for a portion of the proceeds that the best friend received from his fruit stand and a portion of the rent that the teacher paid. If the best friend contests the apportionment of the monies he received, judgment should be for whom?\n\nA. As a cotenant in possession, the best friend retains the profits from his crops and the rents paid by the teacher.\nB. As a cotenant in possession, the best friend retains the profits from his crops, and the uncle is entitled to a share of the rent paid by the teacher.\nC. The uncle is entitled to a share of the rent that the teacher paid and the profits from the best friend's crops.\nD. The uncle is entitled to no share of any of the monies raised because the uncle's lack of contact with the best friend will be deemed a waiver.\n"

As a cotenant in possession, the best friend retains the profits from his crops, and the uncle is entitled to a share of the rent paid by the teacher.\n\nUnder the common law rules governing cotenancies, when one cotenant is in exclusive possession of the property, they are entitled to retain the profits from improvements they make or the labor they expend on the land (such as growing crops). However, they must account to the other cotenant for any rents received from third parties. Here, the best friend is in possession and has grown fruits on the property and sold them at a stand, which are considered profits from his own labor and investment. Therefore, he can retain those profits. However, the rent received from the teacher is a passive income from the property, which should be shared among the cotenants according to their interest in the property. Since the uncle has not waived his interest in the property and has not contributed to the maintenance or improvement of the property, he is still entitled to a share of the rent received by the best friend."
