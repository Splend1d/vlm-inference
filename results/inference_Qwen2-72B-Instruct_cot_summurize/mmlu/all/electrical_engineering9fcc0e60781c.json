However, it's important to note that the Bohr model is a simplified representation and does not fully account for the complexities of electron configurations in larger atoms.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nC. Row number on periodic table. \n\nBut it's worth mentioning that this is a simplification, and the actual electron configuration can be more complex, especially for elements with higher atomic numbers."
