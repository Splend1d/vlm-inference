Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn both scenarios, the actions described do not constitute clear moral wrongdoing according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the main character is trying to reassure someone whose son has been captured. While it might be argued that the reassurance could be misleading if the main character knows that the situation is actually dire, there is no indication in the scenario that this is the case. Without additional context suggesting that the reassurance is false or harmful, the action is not clearly morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, adding hot sauce to a friend's dinner could be seen as a prank or playful behavior, depending on the relationship and context. However, without information indicating that the friend is allergic to hot sauce, has explicitly stated they don't want it, or that the action caused harm, it is not clearly morally wrong. It may be considered inconsiderate or potentially rude, but not necessarily morally wrong unless it leads to significant negative consequences."
