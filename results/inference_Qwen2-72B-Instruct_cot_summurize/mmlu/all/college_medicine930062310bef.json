When cortisol levels in the blood rise, they signal the hypothalamus and the pituitary gland to decrease the production and release of CRF (corticotropin-releasing factor) and ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone), respectively. This reduction in CRF and ACTH ultimately decreases the production and release of cortisol from the adrenal glands, thereby dampening the stress response."
