                    "text": "If the employee prevails in his suit against the landlord to recover damages resulting from his injury caused by the collapsing ceiling, it would most likely be because of option B: a landowner's duty of care to third parties cannot be shifted to a tenant by the terms of a lease.\n\nExplanation:\n\nA. Landowner is strictly liable for injuries occurring on his property - This statement is not necessarily true as liability often depends on the circumstances of the case and the status of the injured party (invitee, licensee, or trespasser). Strict liability does not apply to all situations where someone is injured on another's property.\n\nB. Landowner's duty of care to third parties cannot be shifted to a tenant by the terms of a lease - This is the most likely reason for the employee's success in the lawsuit. The landlord has a duty to maintain the premises in a reasonably safe condition, especially if they were aware of a dangerous condition like a defective ceiling. This duty cannot be entirely waived or transferred to the tenant, particularly if the landlord knew about the defect and failed to disclose it or fix it.\n\nC. Tenant cannot waive the implied warranty of commercial habitability - While this could be relevant in a dispute between the landlord and tenant regarding the condition of the property, it does not directly address the landlord's liability to a third party who is injured due to the landlord's failure to maintain the property.\n\nD. Covenant to indemnify by a tenant in favor of a landowner is against public policy - This statement might be true in some jurisdictions under certain circumstances, but it does not directly relate to the landlord's liability for the injury sustained by the employee. It pertains more to the enforceability of the indemnity clause between the landlord and tenant, not the landlord's duty to third parties.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: a landowner's duty of care to third parties cannot be shifted to a tenant by the terms of a lease."
