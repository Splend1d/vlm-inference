Ross was an intuitionist philosopher who believed that moral truths could be known through intuition, and he identified various prima facie duties that we have towards others. One of these duties is the duty of fidelity, which requires us to keep our promises and fulfill our contractual obligations. According to Ross, justice involves respecting this duty and holding people accountable for their commitments. However, it's worth noting that Ross's theory of justice is more complex than any single definition can capture, and he also emphasized other duties such as non-maleficence, beneficence, self-improvement, gratitude, and reparation."
