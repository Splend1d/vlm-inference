This term, often used in US foreign policy discourse, particularly during the 1990s and early 2000s, referred to countries that were considered to be in defiance of international norms and laws. These states were typically accused of pursuing weapons of mass destruction, supporting terrorism, or violating human rights. Examples often cited included Iraq under Saddam Hussein, Iran, North Korea, and Libya under Muammar Gaddafi. The term has been criticized for its vagueness and for being politically charged, as it is not a formal classification recognized by international law."
