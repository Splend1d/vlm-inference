The use of force or violence by the state goes beyond normal procedures and can be considered extraordinary, especially if it is not part of routine law enforcement activities.\nB. Measures taken in response to a securitized existential threat often transcend regular policy-making processes and can involve exceptional actions that would not be considered under normal circumstances.\nC. Actions that fall outside the usual political paradigm can also be seen as extraordinary, particularly if they involve significant departures from established norms, practices, or laws.\n\nThus, all three criteria can be used to define measures as 'special' or 'extra' ordinary."
