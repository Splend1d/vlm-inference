Instead, it requires that both series be integrated of the same order, typically non-stationary (integrated of order 1), but their linear combination is stationary (integrated of order 0).\n\nii) This statement is true. When two or more non-stationary series are cointegrated, there exists at least one linear combination of these series that is stationary. However, it's important to note that this does not mean that only one such linear combination exists; in some cases, multiple linear combinations may be stationary, but there is usually a unique vector that represents the long-term equilibrium relationship between the series.\n\niii) This statement is false. The cointegrating equation describes the long-run relationship between the series, not the short-run dynamics. Short-run dynamics would be described by models like error correction models (ECMs) that incorporate the cointegrating relationship along with short-run deviations from equilibrium.\n\niv) This statement is true. If $x_t$ and $y_t$ are cointegrated, then there exists a linear combination of the two series that is stationary. In the context of a simple regression of $y_t$ on $x_t$, if the residuals from this regression are stationary, this can be evidence of cointegration between the two series."
