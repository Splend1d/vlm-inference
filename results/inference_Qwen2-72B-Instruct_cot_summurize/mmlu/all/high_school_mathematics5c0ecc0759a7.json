Setting them equal to each other:\n\n\\[x^2 = \\cos(x)\\]\n\nThis equation does not have an algebraic solution, so we'll need to approximate it numerically. Using graphical methods or numerical approximation tools (like a graphing calculator or software like WolframAlpha), we can find that they intersect at approximately \\(x = 0.653\\) in the first quadrant.\n\nNext, we want to calculate the area between the two functions from \\(x = 0\\) to \\(x \\approx 0.653\\). The area will be the integral of the difference between the two functions over this interval. Since \\(\\cos(x) > x^2\\) for \\(0 < x < 0.653\\), we integrate \\(\\cos(x) - x^2\\):\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\int_{0}^{0.653} (\\cos(x) - x^2) dx\n\\]\n\nLet's compute this integral:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\left[ \\sin(x) - \\frac{x^3}{3} \\right]_0^{0.653}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\left( \\sin(0.653) - \\frac{(0.653)^3}{3} \\right) - \\left( \\sin(0) - \\frac{0^3}{3} \\right)\n\\]\n\nUsing a calculator:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\sin(0.653) - \\frac{(0.653)^3}{3}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} \\approx 0.614 - \\frac{0.272}{3}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} \\approx 0.614 - 0.091\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} \\approx 0.523\n\\]\n\nThe closest answer choice to 0.523 is:\n\nC. 0.547\n\nSo, the correct answer is C. 0.547.
