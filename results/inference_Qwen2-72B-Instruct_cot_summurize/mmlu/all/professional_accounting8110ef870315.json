A $20000 expense for term life insurance premiums on corporate officers was incurred. Prime was the policy owner and beneficiary.

The adjustments required for this question are related to corporate bond interest income and the expense for term life insurance premiums.\n\nThe corporate bond interest income of $17,000 is already included in the reported book income and is also taxable, so it does not need adjustment.\n\nHowever, the $20,000 expense for term life insurance premiums on corporate officers is not deductible if Prime Corp. is both the policy owner and beneficiary. This means that this expense must be added back to the book income to calculate taxable income because it was deducted from book income but is not deductible for tax purposes.\n\nThus, the calculation for taxable income would be:\n\nBook income before federal income taxes: $300,000\n\nAdd back non-deductible term life insurance premiums: +$20,000\n\nTaxable income: $320,000\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nA. $320,000"
