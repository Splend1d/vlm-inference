The security paradigm has been the development of multi-level analysis, to aid the understanding of disempowerment and to promote peace research involvement by NGOs, policy-makers, and the academic community.\nB. The security paradigm of US led strategy has been the undertaking of short-term measures, many of which are drawn from research of the peace studies community. They focus on peace-keeping, peace-making, and structural change for preventing further conflict.\nC. The security paradigm of recent years has been to some extent a reversion to 'liddism'; keeping the lid on a potentially fractured international system, without redress to the critical underlying causes of the problems.\nD. The dominant approach to security studies has been a US led initiative which recognizes the need to undertake responsibility for inter-governmental cooperation, particularly for the commitment towards ethical intervention and for securing peaceful transformations alongside demilitarization of the international community.\n"

                    "text": "The predominant paradigm in security and threat perception following the terrorist attacks of 9/11 can be described as a combination of options C and D, with a greater emphasis on C.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of 9/11, the United States and its allies adopted a paradigm that focused heavily on military and intelligence responses to counter terrorism, often referred to as the \"War on Terror.\" This involved increased surveillance, intelligence gathering, and military interventions in countries like Afghanistan and Iraq. This approach can be seen as a form of 'liddism,' where the primary goal was to contain and suppress immediate threats rather than addressing underlying causes of conflict and instability.\n\nOver time, there has been a growing recognition of the limitations of this approach and a shift towards more comprehensive strategies that include elements of option D. This includes efforts to strengthen inter-governmental cooperation, promote ethical intervention, and work towards peaceful transformations and demilitarization. However, these shifts have been gradual and often contested, with debates over the balance between hard power (military force) and soft power (diplomacy, economic assistance, cultural influence).\n\nTo what extent this paradigm is an adequate response is a matter of debate. Critics argue that it has often been reactive rather than proactive, focusing too much on short-term security measures at the expense of long-term stability and peacebuilding. There is also criticism that the emphasis on military solutions has sometimes exacerbated conflicts and created new grievances, while neglecting the root causes of terrorism such as political disenfranchisement, economic inequality, and social marginalization.\n\nIn conclusion, while the current security paradigm has evolved somewhat since 9/11 to incorporate broader approaches to security, it still faces significant challenges in effectively addressing complex threats in a rapidly changing world. A more holistic and nuanced approach that combines both short-term measures and long-term strategies aimed at addressing underlying causes of conflict would likely be more effective."
