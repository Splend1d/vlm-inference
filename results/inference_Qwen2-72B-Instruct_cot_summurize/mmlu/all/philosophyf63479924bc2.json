In this case, being naturally envious and ungenerous is something the person did not choose and could be seen as an example of bad constitutive moral luck.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that options B and C involve circumstances and actions that are not necessarily examples of constitutive moral luck. Option B involves circumstantial moral luck (being born in a particular place and time), while option C involves resultant moral luck (the consequences of an action). Option D, which suggests all of the above, is incorrect because only option A fits the definition of bad constitutive moral luck."
