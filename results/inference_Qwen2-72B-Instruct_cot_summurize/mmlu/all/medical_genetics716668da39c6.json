RNA processing mutations.\n\nExon skipping occurs when a segment of pre-mRNA (a exon) is not included in the mature mRNA during splicing. This can be caused by mutations that affect the splicing process, often involving the splice sites or splicing regulatory elements within the pre-mRNA. Such mutations fall under the category of RNA processing mutations."
