Total number of books: 3 million = 3,000,000 books\n2. Average number of pages per book: 400 pages\n3. Average number of lines per page: 50 lines\n4. Average number of words per line: 10 words\n5. Average number of characters per word: 5 characters\n6. Size of each character: 1 byte\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of characters in all the books:\n\n- Total characters per line = Number of words per line * Number of characters per word = 10 words * 5 characters = 50 characters\n- Total characters per page = Number of lines per page * Total characters per line = 50 lines * 50 characters = 2,500 characters\n- Total characters per book = Number of pages per book * Total characters per page = 400 pages * 2,500 characters = 1,000,000 characters\n- Total characters in all books = Total number of books * Total characters per book = 3,000,000 books * 1,000,000 characters = 3,000,000,000,000 characters\n\nSince each character is represented by 1 byte, the total storage required is equal to the total number of characters:\n\n- Total storage required = 3,000,000,000,000 bytes\n\nNow, let's convert this into more commonly used units:\n\n- 1 megabyte = 1,000,000 bytes\n- 1 gigabyte = 1,000,000,000 bytes\n- 1 terabyte = 1,000,000,000,000 bytes\n- 1 petabyte = 1,000,000,000,000,000 bytes\n\nThus, the total storage required = 3,000,000,000,000 bytes = 3 terabytes.\n\nTherefore, the unit in which the electronic storage required for the text in all the books of the university's libraries would best be measured is:\n\nC. Terabyte (2^40 or approximately 10^12 bytes)"
