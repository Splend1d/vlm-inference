However, in the short run, he should continue operating as long as his price covers his average variable cost (AVC). This is because he will cover his variable costs and some portion of his fixed costs, minimizing his losses.\n\nAverage Variable Cost (AVC) = Total Variable Costs / Quantity of pools cleaned\nAVC = $80 / 9\nAVC \u2248 $8.89\n\nSince Jason's price of $10 per pool is greater than his AVC of approximately $8.89, he should continue operating in the short run to minimize his losses.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Jason should clean 9 pools per day, with economic losses of $10."
