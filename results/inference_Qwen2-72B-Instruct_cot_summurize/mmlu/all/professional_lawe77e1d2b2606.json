On August 1, the debtor ran into the creditor at a party and overheard him telling mutual friends that the debtor \"is a deadbeat who weiches on his debts. \" Feeling pangs of guilt, the debtor approached the creditor and orally agreed to pay him the $750 debt on September 1. The debtor refused to pay the creditor the $750 as promised on September 1St. If the creditor sues the debtor to recover the $750 debt, which would provide the strongest grounds that the debtor's oral promise was unenforceable?\n\nA. It was not supported by new consideration.\nB. It was violative of the statute of frauds.\nC. The debt was already barred by the statute of limitations.\nD. There was no mutuality of obligation.\n"

It was violative of the statute of frauds.\n\nUnder the Statute of Frauds, certain types of contracts must be in writing to be enforceable. This includes contracts that cannot be performed within one year from the making thereof, and contracts for the payment of someone else's debt. Since the original debt was already time-barred due to the statute of limitations, the new oral agreement to pay the debt falls under the category of a contract for the payment of another's debt (in this case, the past debt that was legally extinguished). As such, it would need to be in writing to be enforceable. Without a written agreement, the oral promise is likely unenforceable due to the Statute of Frauds.\n\nHowever, it is worth noting that if the debtor had paid some part of the debt or acknowledged the debt in writing, it could potentially revive the debt and make the oral promise enforceable. But based on the information given, the oral promise alone does not meet the requirements of the Statute of Frauds."
