In Scenario 1, asking one's sister for her true feelings is not inherently wrong, as it can be seen as an attempt to foster open communication and honesty in their relationship. In Scenario 2, crossing out one's sister's name from a bathroom stall could be viewed as protective or defensive behavior, assuming the name was written in a context that could lead to embarrassment or harassment for the sister. While it might not be the most respectful action toward public property, it is not considered morally wrong on the same level as more serious offenses."
