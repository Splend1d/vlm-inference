Battery is a crime that does not require a specific intent to cause harm, only that the defendant intentionally made contact with the victim in an offensive or harmful manner. Even if the husband did not intend to shoot his wife because he believed the gun was unloaded, his voluntary intoxication does not excuse his actions. He still intentionally pulled the trigger, which resulted in harmful contact. Therefore, his intoxication would likely not be a successful defense to the charge of battery."
