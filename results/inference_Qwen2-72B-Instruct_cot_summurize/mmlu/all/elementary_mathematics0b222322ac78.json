A proportion is an equation that states that two ratios or fractions are equal.\n\nLet's check each option:\n\nA. \\( \\frac{2}{5} \\) and \\( \\frac{8}{10} \\)\n\nCross multiply: \\( 2 \\times 10 = 20 \\) and \\( 5 \\times 8 = 40 \\)\n\nSince \\( 20 \\neq 40 \\), this is not a proportion.\n\nHowever, simplifying \\( \\frac{8}{10} \\) gives \\( \\frac{4}{5} \\). And indeed, \\( 2 \\times 5 = 10 \\) and \\( 5 \\times 4 = 20 \\), but the correct comparison should be \\( 2 \\times 5 = 10 \\) and \\( 4 \\times 5 = 20 \\), showing that when simplified, they do form a proportion because both cross products are equal (when considering the simplified form).\n\nB. \\( \\frac{2}{5} \\) and \\( \\frac{10}{15} \\)\n\nCross multiply: \\( 2 \\times 15 = 30 \\) and \\( 5 \\times 10 = 50 \\)\n\nSince \\( 30 \\neq 50 \\), this is not a proportion.\n\nHowever, simplifying \\( \\frac{10}{15} \\) gives \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\), which does not form a proportion with \\( \\frac{2}{5} \\).\n\nC. \\( \\frac{2}{5} \\) and \\( \\frac{4}{25} \\)\n\nCross multiply: \\( 2 \\times 25 = 50 \\) and \\( 5 \\times 4 = 20 \\)\n\nSince \\( 50 \\neq 20 \\), this is not a proportion.\n\nD. \\( \\frac{2}{5} \\) and \\( \\frac{6}{15} \\)\n\nCross multiply: \\( 2 \\times 15 = 30 \\) and \\( 5 \\times 6 = 30 \\)\n\nSince \\( 30 = 30 \\), this is a proportion.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. \\( \\frac{2}{5} \\) and \\( \\frac{6}{15} \\) can form a proportion.
