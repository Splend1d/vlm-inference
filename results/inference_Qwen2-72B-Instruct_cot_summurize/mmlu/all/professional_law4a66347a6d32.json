                    "text": "The correct answer is C. the daughter and the doctor as tenants in common, subject to the professor's life estate.\n\nWhen the professor initially conveyed the apartment building to his son and daughter as tenants in common and reserved a life estate to himself, this established a tenancy in common between the two children, subject to the professor's life interest. When the professor executed the \"correction deed\" changing the form of ownership to joint tenancy with right of survivorship, this attempted change would only be effective if it was properly delivered and accepted. Since both children accepted delivery of the \"correction deed,\" the conveyance could potentially have changed the nature of their ownership.\n\nHowever, the death of the son six months later complicates matters because joint tenancy with right of survivorship requires all joint tenants to be alive at the time of conveyance or at the moment when the last surviving joint tenant takes full title. Since the son died before the professor (who still holds a life estate), the joint tenancy cannot vest fully until after the professor's life estate ends. Moreover, the son's interest does not pass to the daughter through the right of survivorship because the joint tenancy was not fully established due to the existence of the professor's life estate.\n\nUpon the son's death, his interest in the property reverts to his estate because the joint tenancy did not fully vest. As the son died intestate, his interest passes to his sole heir, the doctor, creating a tenancy in common between the daughter and the doctor. This tenancy in common is subject to the professor's life estate since the original conveyance included this reservation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C, indicating that title to the apartment building is held by the daughter and the doctor as tenants in common, subject to the professor's life estate."
