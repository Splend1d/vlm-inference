If they are in phase (0 degree phase difference), they will add constructively, and if they are out of phase (180-degree phase difference), they will add destructively.\n\nGiven two waves with amplitudes of 4 cm and 6 cm:\n\n- In the case of constructive interference (in phase), the resultant amplitude would be the sum of the individual amplitudes: 4 cm + 6 cm = 10 cm.\n- In the case of destructive interference (out of phase), the resultant amplitude would be the absolute difference between the individual amplitudes: |4 cm - 6 cm| = 2 cm.\n\nThus, depending on the phase relationship, the displacement \\(D\\) of the resultant wave can range from 2 cm to 10 cm.\n\nThe correct answer is **A. 2 cm \u2264 D \u2264 10 cm**."
