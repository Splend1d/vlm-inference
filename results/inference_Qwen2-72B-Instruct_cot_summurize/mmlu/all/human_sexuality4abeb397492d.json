Additionally, if Danny has previously told Sandy that he does not appreciate her advances, continuing to make such comments despite his clear discomfort and objections would also constitute harassment. The fact that Danny responds in kind does not negate the possibility that Sandy's initial comment was harassing, especially if he felt pressured to respond due to their power differential or fear of further unwanted advances. However, if Danny had not previously expressed discomfort and responded in a similar manner, it might not meet the legal definition of harassment, although it could still be inappropriate behavior in a professional setting."
