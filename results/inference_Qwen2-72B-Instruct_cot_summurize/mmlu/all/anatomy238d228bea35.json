The carotid arteries run up the sides of the neck, and the pulse can be felt by placing your fingers gently on either side of the windpipe, about an inch away from the midline of the neck, and slightly below the angle of the jaw. This is not only used for checking pulse but also in assessing blood flow to the brain in emergency situations."
