In classical conditioning, an association is formed between an unconditioned stimulus (which naturally triggers a response) and a conditioned stimulus (a previously neutral stimulus). After several pairings, the conditioned stimulus alone can elicit a response similar to the one triggered by the unconditioned stimulus. Cognitivists would suggest that this process also involves expectations and predictions about what will happen next when encountering the conditioned stimulus."
