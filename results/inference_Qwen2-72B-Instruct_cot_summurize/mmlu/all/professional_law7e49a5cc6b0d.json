The hospital negligently misidentified the husband's body and sent it to be cremated. When she was informed of the hospital's mistake, the widow suffered serious emotional distress. She has sued the hospital. Is the hospital likely to be held liable to the widow?\n\nA. No, because the widow did not witness the cremation.\nB. No, because the widow was never in any danger of bodily harm.\nC. Yes, because hospitals are strictly liable if they do not properly dispose of corpses.\nD. Yes, because the negligent handling of the husband's body was especially likely to cause his widow serious emotional distress. \u0080\u0083\n"

Yes, because the negligent handling of the husband's body was especially likely to cause his widow serious emotional distress.\n\nIn this situation, the hospital's negligence in misidentifying and improperly disposing of the husband's body could give rise to a claim for intentional or negligent infliction of emotional distress by the widow. The hospital's actions directly affected the widow's ability to properly mourn and bury her husband, which can be considered a foreseeable consequence of their negligence. Therefore, the hospital is likely to be held liable for the widow's emotional distress."
