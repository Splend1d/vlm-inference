In accordance with the statute, the President was authorized to appoint a majority of six members to the agency, and the other three positions were to be filled by the Senate. The nine members were duly appointed to the agency, and all appointees were subsequently approved in confirmation hearings. Thereafter, the agency issued the following regulations:(a) Requiring each motor vehicle operating in the United States to be equipped with a specified air/fuel control device;(b) Requiring each gas or oil furnace located in the United States to be fitted with a specified device to reduce emissions;(c) Requiring each State to establish and maintain a program under which each vehicle and each furnace shall be tested annually for compliance with federal emissions standards. Which of the following arguments would provide the strongest constitutional grounds against the authority of the statute?\n\nA. The President does not have the constitutional power to appoint a majority of members to an administrative agency.\nB. Congress does not have the executive authority to appoint members to an administrative agency.\nC. An administrative agency does not have the constitutional authority to promulgate regulations that unduly burden interstate commerce.\nD. An administrative agency does not have the constitutional authority to require states to supervise federal regulatory guidelines such as those enumerated in Subsection (c).\n"

The Supreme Court has ruled that Congress cannot compel state governments to enforce federal regulatory programs, as this would infringe upon state sovereignty. This principle is often referred to as the \"anti-commandeering\" doctrine.\n\nIn the case presented, the agency's regulation requiring each state to establish and maintain a program for testing vehicles and furnaces for compliance with federal emissions standards could be seen as commandeering state resources and personnel to enforce a federal regulatory program, potentially violating the anti-commandeering doctrine. This argument would likely be the most persuasive in challenging the constitutionality of the statute's provisions."
