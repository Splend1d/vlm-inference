The size of a McDonald\u2019s kitchen.\n\nIn economics, production inputs that can be adjusted in the long run but not in the short run are typically referred to as \"capital\" or \"fixed inputs.\" These include physical assets like buildings, machinery, and equipment. In contrast, \"variable inputs\" can be adjusted more easily in the short run, such as raw materials (wood for desks), labor (number of teacher's assistants), or certain components of production (number of pickles on a sandwich).\n\nThe size of a McDonald\u2019s kitchen is an example of a fixed input because it involves a significant investment and cannot be easily or quickly changed. Expanding or reducing the size of a kitchen would require construction, which takes time and resources, making it a decision more suited to the long run rather than something that can be altered on a day-to-day basis."
