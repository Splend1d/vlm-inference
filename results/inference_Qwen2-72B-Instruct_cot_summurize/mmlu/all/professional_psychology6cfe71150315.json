Refuse to testify unless you get written permission from your clients.\n\nThis option respects the principle of confidentiality and the therapeutic relationship between the psychologist and the client. It also aligns with ethical guidelines that require psychologists to protect the privacy of their clients and disclose information only with informed consent. If the privilege law does not specifically address divorce proceedings, it is prudent to err on the side of caution and seek explicit permission from the client before disclosing any information. This approach ensures that the client's rights are upheld and that the psychologist adheres to professional ethical standards."
