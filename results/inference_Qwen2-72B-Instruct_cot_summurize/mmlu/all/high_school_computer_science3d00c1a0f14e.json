The largest integer in this array is `7`. So, the first call returns `7`.\n\nThe second call to `max` is with `matrix[3]`, which is the fourth row of the matrix, i.e., `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. The largest integer in this array is `4`. So, the second call returns `4`.\n\nFinally, the outer call to `max` compares these two results, `7` and `4`. Since `7` is greater than `4`, the final result returned by the method call is `7`.\n\nSo the answer is C. 7."
