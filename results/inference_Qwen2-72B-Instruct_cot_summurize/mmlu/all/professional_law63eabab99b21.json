This usually involves presenting expert testimony or other evidence that suggests the defendant was legally insane at the time of the crime.\n\n2. **Burden of Persuasion**: Beyond merely introducing evidence, the defendant must also persuade the jury that the defense is true by meeting the required standard of proof (which can vary depending on jurisdiction, but often is \"by a preponderance of the evidence\" for affirmative defenses).\n\nIn many jurisdictions, the prosecution has the overall burden of proving the defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, but when it comes to affirmative defenses like insanity, the defendant bears these specific burdens."
