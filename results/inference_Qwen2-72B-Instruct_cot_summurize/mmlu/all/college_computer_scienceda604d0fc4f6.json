At each step, Mary can ask a question that divides the remaining possible numbers into two equal (or nearly equal) groups. For example, her first question might be \"Is the number less than or equal to 500?\" Depending on Bob's answer, she will know that the number is either in the first half (1-500) or the second half (501-1000) of the range.\n\nSince the range of possible numbers is halved with each question, we can find the maximum number of questions required by finding the base-2 logarithm of the total number of possibilities. Specifically, we need to find the smallest integer n such that 2^n >= 1000. Using a calculator or logarithm table, we find that log2(1000) is approximately 9.97, which means that n = 10.\n\nTherefore, Mary can determine Bob's number in the worst case with exactly 10 questions."
