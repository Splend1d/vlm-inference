This action is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, as it puts others at risk.\n\nIn Scenario 2, wearing a short skirt and tank top to a funeral may be considered inappropriate by some due to the lack of formality or respect for the occasion, but it does not cause direct harm to others. While it might be seen as disrespectful or insensitive, it is not morally wrong in the same sense that endangering others with a firearm would be. Attending a funeral dressed inappropriately is generally more a matter of social etiquette than a moral transgression."
