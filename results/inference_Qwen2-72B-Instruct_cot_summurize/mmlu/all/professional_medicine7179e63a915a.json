There is no history of trauma. The lesion transilluminates well, and no inguinal nodes are palpable. Findings from a testicular scan are normal.

A hydrocele typically transilluminates well on examination and can vary in size. Given the patient's age, the absence of pain, and the normal testicular scan, it is unlikely that this represents a malignancy.\n\nThe most appropriate management for a hydrocele in this scenario would be:\n\nB. Needle aspiration\n\nThis procedure involves using a needle to remove the fluid from the hydrocele, which can provide symptomatic relief. However, it is important to note that hydroceles often recur after aspiration, and in such cases, surgical intervention (usually a hydrocelectomy) may be necessary to prevent recurrence. Nonetheless, since the question asks for the most appropriate initial management, needle aspiration is the correct answer. Injection with a sclerosing agent (option A) is not typically used for treating hydroceles, and a needle biopsy (option C) or surgical repair (option D) would not be indicated without evidence of malignancy or other complications."
