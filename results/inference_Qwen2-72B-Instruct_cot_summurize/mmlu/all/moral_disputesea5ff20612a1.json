He believed that certain moral principles are inherent in human nature and can be discovered through reason. These principles form the basis for natural law, which Locke saw as a guide for human conduct and the foundation for just laws and government. While Locke's views on natural law were not identical to those of ancient philosophers like Thomas Aquinas, they shared some common themes, such as the belief in an objective moral order that can be discerned through human reason. However, it is important to note that Locke's political philosophy diverges from traditional natural law theory in significant ways, particularly in his emphasis on individual rights and the social contract."
