While this does pose significant challenges to weak states, such as strain on resources, social tensions, and potential for internal conflicts, it is not inherently a security threat like the others listed. Warlordism, criminal gangs, coup d'\u00e9tats, and competition for power from strongmen all directly challenge the state's authority and stability through violent means or the undermining of governance structures. In contrast, the arrival of refugees can be managed through humanitarian aid and international cooperation, though it may indirectly exacerbate other security issues if not handled properly."
