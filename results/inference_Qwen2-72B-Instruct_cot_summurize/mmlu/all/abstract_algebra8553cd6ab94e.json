If no such \\(n\\) exists, the characteristic is said to be 0.\n\nLet's consider the ring \\(\\mathbb{Z}_3 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_3\\). This is the direct product of two rings, each with three elements: \\(\\mathbb{Z}_3 = \\{[0], [1], [2]\\}\\), where \\([x]\\) denotes the equivalence class of \\(x\\) modulo 3.\n\nIn \\(\\mathbb{Z}_3 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_3\\), every element is of the form \\((a, b)\\) where \\(a, b \\in \\mathbb{Z}_3\\).\n\nTo find the characteristic of this ring, we need to determine the smallest positive integer \\(n\\) such that \\(n(a, b) = (0, 0)\\) for all \\((a, b) \\in \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_3\\).\n\nMultiplying an element \\((a, b)\\) by \\(n\\) in this context means adding \\((a, b)\\) to itself \\(n\\) times. This can be expressed as:\n\n\\[n(a, b) = (na, nb)\\]\n\nSince we're working in \\(\\mathbb{Z}_3\\), we need \\(na = 0\\) and \\(nb = 0\\) in \\(\\mathbb{Z}_3\\) for all \\(a, b \\in \\mathbb{Z}_3\\).\n\nIn \\(\\mathbb{Z}_3\\), the smallest positive integer \\(n\\) such that \\(na = 0\\) for all \\(a \\in \\mathbb{Z}_3\\) is 3. This is because in \\(\\mathbb{Z}_3\\), \\(3a = 0\\) for any \\(a \\in \\mathbb{Z}_3\\), since 3 is equivalent to 0 modulo 3.\n\nThus, the characteristic of \\(\\mathbb{Z}_3 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_3\\) is 3.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **B. 3**."
