One year later, the employer had the employee sign a covenant not to compete for a two-year period after termination. Two years later, the employee quit and went to work for a competitor company. The prior employer sued, asking for a preliminary injunction to enforce the covenant. The employee argued that the covenant was invalid because no consideration passed to her \u0080\u0093 she could be fired at any time and did not receive anything for signing. The employer argued that it provided her with continued employment when it did not have to do so. Does the employer have a legal right to enforce the covenant?\n\nA. Yes, because the employer's providing of continued employment for a substantial period after signing the covenant is adequate consideration.\nB. Yes, because modification of an existing contract does not require consideration.\nC. Yes, because the courts never question the adequacy of consideration in an agreement.\nD. No, because there was inadequate consideration for the covenant.\n"

Yes, because the employer's providing of continued employment for a substantial period after signing the covenant is adequate consideration.\n\nThe employer has a legal right to enforce the covenant if the court finds that continued employment after the signing of the covenant constitutes adequate consideration. In many jurisdictions, the promise of continued employment, even under an \"at-will\" arrangement, can serve as valid consideration for a restrictive covenant like a non-compete agreement. This is particularly true if the employee continues to work for a substantial period after signing the covenant. However, the specifics of what constitutes \"adequate consideration\" can vary by jurisdiction, and other factors such as the reasonableness of the restrictions in the covenant may also be considered by the court."
