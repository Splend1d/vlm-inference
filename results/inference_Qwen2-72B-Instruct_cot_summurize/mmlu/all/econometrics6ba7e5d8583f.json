Zero skewness and a kurtosis of three.\n\nIn the context of the Bera-Jarque test, which is a test for normality of residuals in regression analysis, under the null hypothesis, the data follows a normal distribution. A normal distribution has a skewness of 0 (it is symmetric) and an excess kurtosis of 0, which translates to a kurtosis of 3 when measured on the standard scale where a normal distribution has a kurtosis of 3. Thus, option B correctly describes the properties of the distribution under the null hypothesis of the Bera-Jarque test."
