The government charged the gun dealer and the friend with conspiracy to commit bank robbery. Can the charge of conspiracy to commit bank robbery be upheld against the gun dealer?\n\nA. Yes, he conspired to help the friend commit some unknown criminal act.\nB. Yes, he is held to the foreseeability that the friend was going to commit a crime.\nC. No, there was no agreement to conspire to rob a bank.\nD. No, a conspiracy would have required that the gun dealer go to the bank with the friend.\n"

No, there was no agreement to conspire to rob a bank.\n\nFor a conspiracy charge to be upheld, there must be an agreement between two or more persons to commit a crime. In this case, the gun dealer did not agree to commit bank robbery; he merely loaned the machine gun to his friend without knowledge of the specific crime that would be committed. While the gun dealer's actions may be negligent or illegal under other statutes (such as unlawful transfer of a machine gun), they do not constitute a conspiracy to commit bank robbery without evidence of an agreement to participate in that specific crime."
