Partners share in proportion to their voting percentage.\n\nIn the absence of any agreement specifying how profits should be shared, it is common for partnerships to distribute profits based on the agreed-upon voting percentages. Since the partners have agreed on voting percentages and those shares are unequal, it's reasonable to assume that profits would also be shared according to these same percentages unless there is a subsequent agreement that overrides this assumption. However, specific laws or regulations governing partnerships may vary by jurisdiction, so it's important to consult local legal statutes or seek professional advice for precise guidance."
