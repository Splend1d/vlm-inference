Examination shows a 6-cm, soft, nontender left scrotal mass that transilluminates; there are no bowel sounds in the mass. Examination of the testis shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely cause of the mass?\n\nA. Accumulation of scrotal adipose tissue\nB. Cryptorchidism of the left testis\nC. Dilation of the pampiniform plexus of veins around the testis\nD. Persistence of a patent processus vaginalis\n"

This condition leads to the formation of a hydrocele, which is a collection of fluid in the tunica vaginalis around the testicle. The tunica vaginalis is a double-layered sac that normally contains a small amount of fluid to allow the testicle to move freely within it. When the processus vaginalis fails to close properly after the testicle descends into the scrotum during fetal development, this can result in an accumulation of fluid and the formation of a hydrocele. The mass would be soft, painless, and transilluminate on examination, consistent with the findings described."
