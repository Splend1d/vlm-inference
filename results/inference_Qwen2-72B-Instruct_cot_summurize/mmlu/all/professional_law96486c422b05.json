Although the player attempted to continue playing for the team, he failed a physical examination and was cut from the team roster. After failing his physical, the team discontinued making contract payments to the player as per the terms of his employment contract. In his lawsuit, the player claimed that he was physically fit to continue playing but that he was cut from the team because they wanted to stop making contract payments. At trial, the team called its physician, an orthopedist, to testify that the player's hip injury was, in fact, career-threatening and, in his opinion, sufficiently serious to warrant failing his physical. The team physician stated during his testimony that his diagnosis was based, in part, upon an examination of the player's x-rays and review of an MRI test conducted by another doctor. Neither the x-rays nor the MRI test results have been admitted into evidence. In all likelihood, the team physician's testimony should be\n\nA. admissible, provided that the other doctor testifies as to the validity of the MRI test results.\nB. admissible, provided the team physician based his opinion on data reasonably relied upon by other orthopedic physicians in the field.\nC. inadmissible, because neither the x-rays nor the MRI test results had been admitted into evidence at the time he formulated his opinion.\nD. inadmissible, because the team physician's opinion was not based in part upon his own firsthand observation of the player's physical condition.\n"

This includes medical records, diagnostic tests, and other relevant data that would typically inform an expert's professional judgment. Therefore, the team physician's testimony could be admissible if it can be shown that his reliance on the x-rays and MRI test results is consistent with standard practices among orthopedic physicians."
