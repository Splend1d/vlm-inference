In positive nitrogen balance, the excretion of nitrogenous metabolites is less than the dietary intake of nitrogenous compounds.\n\nThis indicates that more nitrogen (and thus protein) is being consumed than is being lost, which can occur during growth, pregnancy, or recovery from illness or injury when the body requires more protein for tissue synthesis. \n\nConversely:\n- A negative nitrogen balance occurs when more nitrogen is excreted than is consumed, often seen in catabolic states like starvation or severe illness where the body breaks down its own proteins.\n- Nitrogen equilibrium (or zero nitrogen balance) happens when the intake and excretion of nitrogen are equal, typically in healthy adults who are neither growing nor losing weight."
