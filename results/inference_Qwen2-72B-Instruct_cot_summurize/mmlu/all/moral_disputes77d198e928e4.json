Singer argues that the moral status of animals is not based on their ability to feel pain or pleasure alone, but also on their capacity for consciousness, self-awareness, and the ability to have preferences and interests. Therefore, he believes that there is no clear-cut answer to this question and that it should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. However, he does argue that animals should be given moral consideration and that we should avoid causing them unnecessary suffering."
