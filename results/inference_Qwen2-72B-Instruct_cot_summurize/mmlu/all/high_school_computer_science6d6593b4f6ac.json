Which of the following best describes the ability of the two computers to communicate with each other across the Internet?\n\nA. The computers cannot communicate because different manufacturers use different communication protocols.\nB. The computers can communicate, but additional hardware is needed to convert data packets from one computer's protocol to the other computer's protocol.\nC. The computers can communicate directly only if the messages consist of text; other formats cannot be interpreted across computers.\nD. The computers can communicate directly because Internet communication uses standard protocols.\n"

The computers can communicate directly because Internet communication uses standard protocols.\n\nThis answer is correct because the Internet relies on standardized communication protocols such as TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol), HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol), and others that enable computers from different manufacturers to communicate effectively. These protocols ensure that data can be transmitted between any two computers connected to the Internet, regardless of their hardware or software differences."
