In her essay \"Modern Moral Philosophy,\" Anscombe argues that Kant's moral philosophy, which is grounded in the notion of duty and the Categorical Imperative, lacks a viable foundation since it does not take into account the role of divine law or natural law. She suggests that without such a foundation, the imperative to act according to universalizable maxims seems arbitrary."
