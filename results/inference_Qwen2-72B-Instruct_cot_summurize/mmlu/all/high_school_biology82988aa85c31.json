However, the most direct homologous structure among the options given would be the flipper of a cetacean (option D). Both bird wings and whale flippers evolved from the tetrapod forelimb, sharing a similar underlying skeletal structure despite their different functions and external appearances. The dorsal fin of a shark (option A) and the wing of a butterfly (option C) do not share the same basic structure as a bird's wing and are not homologous to it."
