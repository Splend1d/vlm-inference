Promotion of Democracy, free-trade, and international institutions\n\nThis approach emphasizes the importance of spreading democratic values and institutions around the world, supporting open markets and economic integration, and working through international organizations to address global challenges. Liberals generally believe that these policies can help create a more peaceful and prosperous world order, and that the United States has a responsibility to lead in this effort. They also tend to support multilateralism and diplomacy as means of achieving these goals, rather than relying solely on military power or unilateral action."
