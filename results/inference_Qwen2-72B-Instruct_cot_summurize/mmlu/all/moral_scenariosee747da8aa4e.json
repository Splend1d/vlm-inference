In Scenario 1, selling one's own business is not inherently wrong, even if the gym partner is not present. The legality and morality would depend on the terms of their partnership agreement. If there was no clause requiring unanimous consent or presence for such transactions, then it is not necessarily wrong. In Scenario 2, refusing service because payment is not guaranteed is also not morally wrong; it is a common practice in many businesses."
