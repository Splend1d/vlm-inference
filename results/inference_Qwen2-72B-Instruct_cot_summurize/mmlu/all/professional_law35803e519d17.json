At the hospital she refused the transfusion because of religious beliefs. She died shortly thereafter. The physician verified that the patient would have fully recovered if she had agreed to treatment. What damages can the pedestrian's estate collect from the driver of the car?\n\nA. All damages for wrongful death because it is foreseeable that this kind of negligence could injure someone who will not accept treatment for religious reasons.\nB. No damages, because the pedestrian's wrongdoing in not accepting treatment was the sole cause for her death.\nC. Damages for the wound and the pain and suffering up to the point that she refused the transfusion.\nD. No damages, because the pedestrian's refusal of treatment constitutes contributory negligence.\n"

Damages for the wound and the pain and suffering up to the point that she refused the transfusion.\n\nIn tort law, the concept of \"damages\" refers to compensation for harm caused by the defendant's wrongful act. In this case, the driver's negligence caused the pedestrian's injuries, which led to her needing medical attention. However, the pedestrian's decision to refuse life-saving treatment due to religious beliefs is considered an intervening act that breaks the chain of causation between the driver's negligence and her death. Therefore, the driver cannot be held liable for the pedestrian's death, but they can be held liable for the injuries and pain and suffering that occurred before the refusal of treatment."
