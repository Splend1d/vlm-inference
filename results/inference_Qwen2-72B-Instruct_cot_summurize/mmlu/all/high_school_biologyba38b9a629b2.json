Minimizing artificial lighting in the area\n\nHatchling sea turtles use natural light cues, such as the reflection of moonlight on the ocean surface, to orient themselves toward the sea after emerging from their nests. Artificial lights can disorient them, causing them to move in the wrong direction, often towards brighter lights inland. This can lead to exhaustion, dehydration, and increased predation. By minimizing artificial lighting near nesting beaches, we can help ensure that hatchlings find their way to the sea more easily and safely."
