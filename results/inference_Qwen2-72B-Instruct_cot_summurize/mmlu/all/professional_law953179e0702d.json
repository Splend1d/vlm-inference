                    "text": "The Enabling Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment grants Congress the power to enforce the provisions of the amendment through appropriate legislation. This clause is often invoked to justify federal laws that prohibit discrimination by states and their officials. Therefore, the state itself would not be regulating in these instances; rather, it would be subject to federal regulation. However, the question seems to be asking in what instance a state could regulate under this clause.\n\nGiven the options provided:\n\nA. A private individual from discriminating against a person based on race.\nB. A private individual from discriminating against a person based on nationality.\nC. A state official from discriminating against a person based on race.\nD. A federal official from discriminating against a person based on nationality.\n\nThe correct answer would be:\n\nC. A state official from discriminating against a person based on race.\n\nThis is because the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause prohibits states from denying any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. It directly addresses the actions of state officials and governments. While the amendment and subsequent laws can also impact private individuals and entities (through the application of civil rights laws), the direct regulation of state officials falls most clearly under the purview of the amendment's intent and the enabling clause. \n\nHowever, it's important to note that the state does not have the authority to regulate federal officials (option D) as that would fall under the jurisdiction of the federal government."
