While details such as who told them, where they were, or the time of day might also be remembered, the primary focus and easiest to recall is usually the actual information or content of the message. However, memory can vary greatly among individuals, especially with age-related changes in cognitive function. Some older adults may have better recall of contextual details depending on their individual memory strengths and the circumstances under which the information was received."
