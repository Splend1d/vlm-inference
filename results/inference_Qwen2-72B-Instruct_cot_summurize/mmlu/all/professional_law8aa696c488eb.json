An undercover police officer knocked on the woman's door and told her that he was willing to pay for usable credit cards. When the woman asked if he was a police officer, the officer replied, \"No,\" giving her a false name and saying, \"You can call Harvey \u0080\u0094he'll vouch for me.\" The woman admitted him to her house. After she left the room to call Harvey, the officer lifted some papers off a desk and underneath discovered three credit cards bearing different names. He seized the cards, and when the woman returned, he arrested her. The woman has moved to suppress the evidence seized on the ground that her Fourth Amendment rights were violated. Should the court grant the motion to suppress?\n\nA. No, because it was immediately apparent that the cards were stolen.\nB. No, because the woman assumed the risk that the officer would seize items in plain sight.\nC. Yes, because the woman's rights were violated when the officer lifted the papers.\nD. Yes, because the woman's rights were violated when the officer obtained entry by deceit.\n"

Yes, because the woman's rights were violated when the officer obtained entry by deceit.\n\nThe Fourth Amendment protects individuals against unreasonable searches and seizures. In this case, the officer deceived the woman into believing he was not a police officer, which may have affected her decision to allow him into her home. This deception could be seen as a violation of her Fourth Amendment rights. The court may rule that any evidence obtained as a result of this unlawful entry must be suppressed. However, the specific outcome would depend on the details of the case and how the court interprets the circumstances."
