Separate educational facilities are inherently unequal. Therefore, we hold that the plaintiffs and others similarly situated for whom the actions have been brought are, by reason of the segregation complained of, deprived of the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment.\"\nBrown v. Board of Education, 1954\nWhich of the following best represents an effect of the legal decision described above?\n\nA. Continuing white resistance slowed efforts at desegregation, sparking a series of social conflicts throughout the South.\nB. The Supreme Court decision Brown v. the Board of Education led to increased enrollment in colleges and universities.\nC. During the 1960s, increasing numbers of high school graduates rejected the notion that a college education was desirable.\nD.

Continuing white resistance slowed efforts at desegregation, sparking a series of social conflicts throughout the South.\n\nThe passage provided is from the landmark Supreme Court case Brown v. Board of Education (1954), which declared state laws establishing separate public schools for black and white students to be unconstitutional. This decision overturned the \"separate but equal\" doctrine established by Plessy v. Ferguson (1896) and paved the way for integration in public schools. However, the implementation of this ruling was met with significant resistance, particularly in the South, where many white communities opposed desegregation. This resistance often took the form of social conflicts, including protests, violence, and legal challenges, as well as the establishment of private schools to maintain segregated education. Thus, option A accurately reflects one of the major effects of the Brown v. Board of Education decision."
