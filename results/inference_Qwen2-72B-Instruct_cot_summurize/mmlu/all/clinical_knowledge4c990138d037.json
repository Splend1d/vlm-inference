The Cori cycle describes the process where lactate produced in muscles is transported to the liver and converted back into glucose, which can then be sent back to the muscles or other tissues for energy use. \n\nA. Conversion to urea in the liver does not occur with lactate; this is a process that happens with ammonia during the urea cycle.\nB. Conversion to glucose in the heart is incorrect; the heart primarily uses lactate for energy, not for glucose production.\nC. Excretion via the kidneys does happen with some waste products, but lactate is primarily metabolized rather than excreted."
