This means none of the independent variables have helped in predicting the dependent variable better than simply using the mean of the dependent variable.\n\nLet's evaluate each statement:\n\ni) All coefficient estimates on the slopes will be zero.\nThis statement is not necessarily true. It could be the case, but it's not guaranteed. It's possible for some coefficients to be non-zero, yet the overall model still explains no variance if those coefficients are offset by other factors or if the independent variables are not correlated with the dependent variable at all.\n\nii) The fitted line will be horizontal with respect to all of the explanatory variables.\nThis statement is true. If the \\(R^2\\) is zero, this means the fitted line provides no predictive power beyond the mean of the dependent variable, so it would be flat, i.e., have a slope of zero, with respect to all explanatory variables.\n\niii) The regression line has not explained any of the variability of y about its mean value.\nThis statement is true. An \\(R^2\\) value of zero directly implies this.\n\niv) The intercept coefficient estimate must be zero.\nThis statement is not necessarily true. The intercept can be any value because it represents the expected value of the dependent variable when all independent variables are zero. Its value does not depend on whether the model as a whole explains any variance.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nC. (ii) and (iii) only"
