In Scenario 1, giving someone a gift that is not their preferred color might be seen as a lack of attention to detail, but it is not a morally wrong act. In Scenario 2, eating all of the birthday cake might be considered rude or selfish, but it is not typically viewed as a moral transgression unless there were extenuating circumstances, such as depriving others of food or violating dietary restrictions."
