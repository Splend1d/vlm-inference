In situation D, the defendant broke into the guest's hotel room with the intent to confront and threaten him regarding a debt, which also meets the criteria for burglary as entering a building unlawfully with the intent to commit a crime inside.\n\nSituation A does not meet the criteria for burglary because the defendant initially entered the house to seek shelter, not to commit a crime. The theft of the transistor radio occurred after the unlawful entry but was not the purpose of the entry.\n\nSituation B does not meet the criteria for burglary because the defendant's primary intent was to harm the homeowner, not to commit a crime within the dwelling. Throwing the brick through the window could be considered vandalism or attempted murder, but not burglary."
