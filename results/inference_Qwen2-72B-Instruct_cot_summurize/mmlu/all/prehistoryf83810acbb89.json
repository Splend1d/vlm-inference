This includes creating clothing, shelter, tools, and agricultural practices suitable for various climates and landscapes. While there are some physiological variations among human populations that can be advantageous in certain environments (such as skin pigmentation in relation to UV exposure), these are not the primary reason for our species' global distribution. The key factor has been our capacity to learn, innovate, and transmit knowledge across generations, enabling us to thrive in diverse habitats."
