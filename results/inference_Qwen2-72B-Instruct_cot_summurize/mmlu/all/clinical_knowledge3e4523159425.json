While strength, power, and stride length can contribute to overall performance, they are not as essential as the endurance needed to maintain a consistent pace for 26.2 miles (42.195 kilometers). Stamina allows runners to keep their heart rate and breathing under control, manage energy stores efficiently, and resist fatigue throughout the race."
