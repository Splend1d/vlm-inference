For a tube open at both ends, the fundamental frequency is given by \\(f = \\frac{v}{2L'}\\), where \\(L'\\) is the length of this tube.\n\nRearranging these equations to solve for \\(L\\) and \\(L'\\) gives us:\n\\[L = \\frac{v}{4f}\\]\nand\n\\[L' = \\frac{v}{2f}\\]\n\nSubstituting \\(f = 256\\) Hz into both equations, we get:\n\\[L = \\frac{v}{4 \\times 256} = \\frac{v}{1024}\\]\nand\n\\[L' = \\frac{v}{2 \\times 256} = \\frac{v}{512}\\]\n\nComparing \\(L\\) and \\(L'\\) shows that \\(L'\\) is exactly half the value of \\(L\\). However, since the question asks how the length of the tube closed at one end (\\(L\\)) compares to the length of the tube open at both ends (\\(L'\\)), we see that \\(L\\) is actually twice the value of \\(L'\\).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. twice the value for a tube open at both ends."
