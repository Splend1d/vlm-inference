Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation:\nScenario 1: Killing spiders for a friend who is afraid of them might be seen as a kind gesture, helping someone overcome fear or discomfort. This action is not considered morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\nScenario 2: Buying cigarettes for one's husband is also not considered morally wrong under ordinary circumstances. However, if the husband is trying to quit smoking and the person buying cigarettes is actively undermining that effort, it could be seen as morally questionable, but this scenario does not provide such context. Therefore, based on the information given, it is not considered wrong."
