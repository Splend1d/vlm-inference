It is important to understand how different operations on the data can affect this coefficient.\n\n1. **Adding a constant to all values of one variable:** Adding or subtracting a constant from all values of one variable does not change the correlation coefficient. This is because correlation is based on the standardized values (z-scores) of the variables, and adding a constant shifts all the values but does not alter their relative spacing. Therefore, adding 0.23 to all values of the x-variable will not change the correlation coefficient.\n\n2. **Multiplying all values of one variable by a constant:** Multiplying all values of one variable by a constant changes the scale of that variable, but it does not change the shape of the scatterplot, only its scale. If you multiply all values of the y-variable by 2, the correlation coefficient may change in magnitude but not in sign unless the constant is negative. Since we're doubling the y-values, the sign of the correlation coefficient remains positive.\n\n3. **Interchanging the variables:** Swapping the roles of the x and y variables does not change the correlation coefficient. The correlation coefficient is symmetric with respect to the variables; thus, whether x predicts y or y predicts x, the correlation coefficient remains the same.\n\nGiven these points:\n\n- Adding 0.23 to all values of the x-variable: \\(r\\) remains 0.19.\n- Doubling every value of the y-variable: \\(r\\) remains 0.19 (because doubling affects the scale, not the correlation).\n- Interchanging the variables: \\(r\\) remains 0.19.\n\nTherefore, after all these operations, the new correlation is still **A. 0.19**."
