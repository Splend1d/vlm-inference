The different relationship to the concept of security: in Europe the debate has stayed as part of politico-self-reflection of the scholar who 'does security;' whereas in the US, the question of the concept of security is seen at the most a necessary 'define your' terms' operation.\nB. The different relationship to the exact form of knowledge that is valued. The US is more rationalist, Europe the more reflectivist. In the US security studies debate hypothesis is typically examined as cause-effect relationships, tied into general debates and with measurement of ideational variables.\nC. In the US major competing explanations emphasized, on the one hand, the US's liberal hegemony, and, on the other hand, the purely power based stability of presumed unipolarity in which balancing becomes impossible.\nD. All of these options.\n"

The approach to the concept of security varies, with Europe often engaging in a more self-reflective and critical discourse about the nature of security and the role of the scholar, while the US tends to see the concept of security as a more technical or definitional issue.\n\nB. The forms of knowledge valued also differ, with the US often emphasizing rationalist approaches, hypothesis testing, and empirical measurement, whereas Europe may lean more towards reflectivist approaches that consider the social construction of security and the role of ideas and identities.\n\nC. The US security studies often focus on explanations related to its own liberal hegemony or the stability provided by its unipolar power position, while European security studies might give more attention to issues of multipolarity, regional integration, and the role of international law and norms.\n\nThese differences can be attributed to historical, political, and cultural contexts, as well as the distinct academic traditions and intellectual histories present in each region."
