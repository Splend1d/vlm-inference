This is because the defendant's actions were reckless and resulted in the death of another person. Even though the defendant did not intend to kill anyone, the act of shooting a gun with the intent to harm someone demonstrates a disregard for human life and the consequences of his actions. Under the felony murder rule, if a death occurs during the commission of a felony (in this case, assault with a deadly weapon), the defendant can be charged with murder."
