This can be done using the formula for the z-score, which is:\n\n\\[z = \\frac{(X - \\mu)}{\\sigma}\\]\n\nwhere \\(X\\) is the value we want to find, \\(\\mu\\) is the mean, and \\(\\sigma\\) is the standard deviation.\n\nFirst, we need to determine the z-scores corresponding to the 25th and 75th percentiles. These are approximately \\(-0.67\\) and \\(+0.67\\), respectively, since these z-scores cut off 25% of the area in the lower and upper tails of the standard normal distribution, leaving the middle 50%.\n\nGiven that the mean (\\(\\mu\\)) is 3,250 and the standard deviation (\\(\\sigma\\)) is 320, we can substitute these values into the formula to find the values at the 25th and 75th percentiles.\n\nFor the 25th percentile:\n\\[\n-0.67 = \\frac{(X_{25} - 3250)}{320}\n\\]\nSolving for \\(X_{25}\\):\n\\[\nX_{25} = -0.67 \\times 320 + 3250 = -214.4 + 3250 = 3035.6\n\\]\n\nFor the 75th percentile:\n\\[\n0.67 = \\frac{(X_{75} - 3250)}{320}\n\\]\nSolving for \\(X_{75}\\):\n\\[\nX_{75} = 0.67 \\times 320 + 3250 = 214.4 + 3250 = 3464.4\n\\]\n\nThus, the range of customers served on the middle 50 percent of days is approximately between 3,036 and 3,464 customers.\n\nThe closest answer choice to this result is A. (3,034, 3,466). Note that the calculated numbers are not exactly the same due to rounding in the calculations, but option A is the most accurate given the options provided."
