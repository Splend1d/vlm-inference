This means that France has a comparative advantage in producing cheese, and Belgium has a comparative advantage in producing wine.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**B. France should specialize in and export cheese while Belgium should specialize in and export wine.**\n\nThis aligns with the principle of comparative advantage, where countries should specialize in the production of goods for which they have the lowest opportunity cost."
