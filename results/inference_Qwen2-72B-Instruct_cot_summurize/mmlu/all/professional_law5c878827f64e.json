The plaintiff then calls a witness who was a passenger in the plaintiff's car but who also happens to be the defendant's former employer. On direct examination, the witness testifies to how the accident occurred and also expresses his opinion that the defendant is not a truthful person. Which one of the following areas of questioning is most likely to be held beyond the proper scope of cross-examination?\n\nA. In letters to prospective employers, the witness has described the defendant as very honest and dependable.\nB. The defendant recently filed an action against the witness for breach of contract.\nC. The plaintiff's injuries were not as serious as the plaintiff is claiming.\nD. The witness has been falsifying his income tax returns.\n"

The plaintiff's injuries were not as serious as the plaintiff is claiming.\n\nCross-examination should generally be limited to matters brought up in direct examination or to issues relevant to the witness's credibility. Question C relates to the extent of the plaintiff's injuries, which is not directly related to the witness's testimony about how the accident occurred or the witness's opinion of the defendant's truthfulness. It would be more appropriate to question the plaintiff or medical experts about the severity of the injuries rather than this particular witness.\n\nOptions A, B, and D are all potentially relevant to the witness's credibility, which can be explored during cross-examination. Option A could show bias if the witness previously praised the defendant but now offers a negative opinion. Option B could suggest bias due to the ongoing legal dispute between the witness and the defendant. Option D could be used to challenge the witness's general honesty and therefore his credibility."
