During the preoperational stage (ages 2-7), children begin to use language and symbols but their thinking is still centered on themselves, making them egocentric. They have difficulty understanding another person's point of view because they lack the ability to think logically about abstract concepts and have not yet developed the capacity for conservation (understanding that quantity does not change despite changes in shape or appearance)."
