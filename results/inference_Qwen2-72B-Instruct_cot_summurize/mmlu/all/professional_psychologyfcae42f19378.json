It is important for him to acknowledge these feelings and address them. The most ethical and professional course of action would be to discuss his feelings with the client and explain that they may affect his ability to provide unbiased and effective treatment. He should then refer her to another therapist who can provide the necessary support without such personal biases. This maintains the integrity of the therapeutic relationship and ensures that the client receives the best possible care. Consulting with another psychologist could also be beneficial for Dr. Lykowski's own well-being and professional development, but it is secondary to ensuring the client's welfare by referring her to another therapist."
