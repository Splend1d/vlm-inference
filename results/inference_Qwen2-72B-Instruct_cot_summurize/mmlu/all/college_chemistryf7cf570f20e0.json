The total entropy of the system plus surroundings increases.\n\nIn thermodynamics, a spontaneous process is one that proceeds without the need for external intervention or input of energy. According to the second law of thermodynamics, in an isolated system (i.e., one that does not exchange matter or energy with its surroundings), the total entropy can never decrease over time. For a spontaneous process, this means that the total entropy of the system and its surroundings must increase.\n\nOption A is incorrect because a process can be spontaneous and endothermic (absorbing heat from the surroundings).\nOption B is incorrect because a spontaneous process can involve work; for example, the expansion of a gas against external pressure is a spontaneous process that involves work being done by the system on the surroundings.\nOption C is incorrect because while it's often the case that the entropy of the system itself increases in a spontaneous process, it's not always true. There can be cases where the entropy of the system decreases as long as the entropy of the surroundings increases enough to ensure that the total entropy (system + surroundings) increases."
