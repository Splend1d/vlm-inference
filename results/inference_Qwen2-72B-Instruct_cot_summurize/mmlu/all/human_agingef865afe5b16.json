Cardiovascular disease\n\nOmega-3 fatty acids have been shown to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease by lowering triglyceride levels, reducing blood pressure, decreasing the likelihood of plaque buildup in the arteries, and reducing the risk of abnormal heart rhythms. While omega-3s may also have benefits for other conditions like some cancers, arthritis, and even sleep, the most well-established benefit is their role in supporting heart health."
