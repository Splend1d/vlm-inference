The vesicle merges with a lysosome.\n\nAfter a vesicle is formed through phagocytosis (the process by which cells engulf large particles or other cells), it typically fuses with a lysosome. Lysosomes contain enzymes that can break down the contents of the vesicle, which may include bacteria, viruses, or other foreign material, as well as old or damaged cellular components. This process helps the cell to digest and dispose of unwanted materials."
