We'll define x as the distance between the foot of the ladder and the building, and y as the height of the ladder against the building. The length of the ladder (which is constant) is given as 26 feet.\n\nThe relationship between x and y can be expressed using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\n\\[x^2 + y^2 = 26^2\\]\n\nDifferentiating both sides with respect to time t gives us:\n\n\\[2x\\frac{dx}{dt} + 2y\\frac{dy}{dt} = 0\\]\n\nWe know that \\(\\frac{dx}{dt} = 3\\) ft/s (the rate at which the foot of the ladder is moving away from the building), and we want to find \\(\\frac{dy}{dt}\\) when \\(x=10\\) ft.\n\nFirst, let's find y when \\(x=10\\) ft:\n\n\\[10^2 + y^2 = 26^2\\]\n\n\\[100 + y^2 = 676\\]\n\n\\[y^2 = 576\\]\n\n\\[y = 24\\] ft\n\nNow, plug \\(x=10\\), \\(y=24\\), and \\(\\frac{dx}{dt}=3\\) into the differentiated equation:\n\n\\[2(10)(3) + 2(24)\\frac{dy}{dt} = 0\\]\n\n\\[60 + 48\\frac{dy}{dt} = 0\\]\n\nSolving for \\(\\frac{dy}{dt}\\):\n\n\\[48\\frac{dy}{dt} = -60\\]\n\n\\[\\frac{dy}{dt} = -\\frac{60}{48} = -\\frac{5}{4}\\]\n\nSince \\(\\frac{dy}{dt}\\) represents the rate at which the top of the ladder is moving down, we take the absolute value if we're only interested in the speed, not direction:\n\n\\[\\left|\\frac{dy}{dt}\\right| = \\frac{5}{4}\\]\n\nSo the correct answer is C. 5/4."
