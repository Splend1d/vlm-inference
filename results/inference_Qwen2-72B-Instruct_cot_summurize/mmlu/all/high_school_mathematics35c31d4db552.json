If c < d, then depending on whether the slope is positive or negative, either f(c) < f(d) or f(c) > f(d) must be true. However, f(c) cannot equal f(d) unless the slope is zero, which contradicts the given information that the slope is non-zero.\n\nTherefore:\n\n- B. f(c) \u2260 f(d) could be true because if the slope is non-zero, the function values at different points cannot be equal.\n- C. f(c) > f(d) could be true if the slope is negative.\n- D. f(c) < f(d) could be true if the slope is positive.\n\nBut A. f(c) = f(d) must be false since the slope is non-zero."
