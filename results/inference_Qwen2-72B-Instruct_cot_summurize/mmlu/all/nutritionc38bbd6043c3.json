Glucagon actually decreases the rate of glycolysis by stimulating glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis to increase blood glucose levels.\n- B. Glycolysis requires NAD+, not NADP+.\n- C. This statement is correct; during glycolysis, glucose (a six-carbon sugar) is broken down into two molecules of pyruvate (three-carbon compounds).\n- D. While true that the end-product of glycolysis is pyruvate, this statement does not specifically address red blood cells. In red blood cells, pyruvate is further converted to lactate due to the lack of mitochondria. However, the direct question was about the end-product of glycolysis, which is indeed pyruvate before any further conversion."
