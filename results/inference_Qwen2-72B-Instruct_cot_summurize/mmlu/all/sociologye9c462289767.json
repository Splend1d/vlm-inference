This is a common problem with economic aid, as loans given to developing countries often come with high interest rates and strict repayment terms that can leave these countries in a cycle of debt. This can prevent them from using the funds to invest in long-term development projects and instead forces them to focus on repaying the debt, leaving little left over for other needs. Additionally, the conditions attached to aid can sometimes be too restrictive or not well-suited to the specific needs of the recipient country, leading to poor outcomes."
