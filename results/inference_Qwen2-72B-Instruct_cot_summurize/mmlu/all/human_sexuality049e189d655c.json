However, according to various studies and surveys, estimates of adolescents who report same-sex sexual experiences range from about 4% to 10% for males. So, among the options given, the closest would be:\n\nB. 10\n\nIt's important to note that these figures can be influenced by how questions are asked, the age range considered, and whether the individuals feel safe to disclose such information. The Kinsey Reports from the 1940s and 1950s suggested that around 10% of men were \"more or less exclusively homosexual\" for at least three years between ages 16 and 55, but more recent research has provided different estimates. Always remember that sexual orientation is a complex issue and can manifest differently in different individuals."
