Commonly recognized compelling state interests include ensuring election integrity, preventing voter fraud, and managing the administrative burdens of running elections. Requiring a certain number of signatures from registered voters can help ensure that candidates have a minimum level of support, which can be seen as serving these interests.\n\nOptions A, C, and D do not provide strong legal arguments for upholding the statute:\n\nA. The Fifteenth Amendment deals with the prohibition of denying or abridging the right to vote based on race, color, or previous condition of servitude. It does not directly address candidacy requirements.\n\nC. The fact that the candidate's petition contained false signatures may speak to the enforcement of the law but does not justify the existence of the signature requirement itself.\n\nD. The number of candidates who successfully petitioned to have their names placed on the ballot is irrelevant to the question of whether the requirement serves a compelling state interest."
