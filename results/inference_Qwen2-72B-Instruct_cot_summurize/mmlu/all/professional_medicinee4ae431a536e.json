His symptoms began 15 minutes after he was stung by a bee and lasted approximately 60 minutes; they resolved before he was treated. He has been stung by bees three times over the past year, and each reaction has been more severe. Examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate recommendation to prevent future morbidity and mortality from this condition?\n\nA. Avoid areas known to have bees\nB. Avoid wearing colorful clothing outside\nC. Carrying diphenhydramine tablets\nD. Carrying self-injectable epinephrine\n"

Carrying self-injectable epinephrine\n\nThe boy's history of progressively worsening reactions to bee stings suggests that he may have anaphylaxis, a severe and potentially life-threatening allergic reaction. The most appropriate recommendation to prevent future morbidity and mortality in this case would be for him to carry self-injectable epinephrine (such as an EpiPen) at all times. This will allow for immediate treatment in case of another severe allergic reaction. Additionally, avoidance measures such as avoiding areas with bees and not wearing bright colors can also help reduce the risk of being stung, but carrying epinephrine is critical for managing potential anaphylaxis."
