                    "text": "When the car coasts up the incline without using its engine, the only forces acting on it are gravity and the normal force from the incline. Since we are neglecting friction and air resistance, these are the only factors to consider.\n\nThe gravitational force (mg) acts vertically downward. However, because the car is on an incline, this force can be resolved into two components: one that is parallel to the incline (mgsin\u03b8) and one that is perpendicular to the incline (mgcos\u03b8). The component of gravity that is parallel to the incline causes the car to decelerate as it moves uphill.\n\nThe component of gravity perpendicular to the incline is balanced by the normal force from the incline itself, so there is no net acceleration in the direction perpendicular to the incline.\n\nGiven this setup:\n\n1. **Horizontal Acceleration (ax):** Since the car's motion up the incline is along a line that makes an angle \u03b8 with the horizontal, the horizontal acceleration is not directly affected by gravity. However, since the car is decelerating due to the component of gravity along the incline, there is a deceleration component in the horizontal direction. This means ax \u2260 0, but it's also not equal to g. Instead, ax will be some value less than g because it depends on the angle of the incline (ax = -gsin\u03b8). Therefore, ax < g.\n\n2. **Vertical Acceleration (ay):** Because the car is constrained to move along the incline, there is no free-fall-like motion, and thus, there is no direct vertical acceleration due to gravity. The component of gravity perpendicular to the incline is balanced by the normal force, leading to no net acceleration in the vertical direction. Thus, ay = 0, not g. However, since the question asks for \"vertical acceleration\" and not \"downward acceleration,\" and given the options provided, ay should be considered in terms of the component of motion perpendicular to the incline, which is effectively zero when considering typical definitions of vertical acceleration in this context.\n\nGiven the options, none perfectly match this explanation because they do not account for ay being zero (which would be a more precise answer based on the description). However, if we must choose among the given options, the closest match based on the analysis above is:\n\n**D. ax < g; ay = g**\n\nThis choice is not perfect, as it incorrectly suggests ay equals g, but it is the best option available based on the literal interpretation of the choices provided, assuming \"vertical acceleration\" is interpreted in a way that aligns with the motion's perpendicular component to the incline. A more accurate answer would have been \"ax < g; ay = 0,\" but that option is not provided."
