State responses to transnational crime have evolved in correlation to the increased threat posed to the integrity of the state. Organized crime has been regarded primarily as a national security threat to be addressed domestically. The institutionalized international approaches for information sharing have been predominately bilateral to the extent of bringing to justice perpetrators of crime that are seeking to evade justice.\nB. With the expansion of TNC in the 1990s, states became increasingly willing to take measures to reduce the asymmetries between countries through harmonization of legislation and increasing police capacity and networking. The government response to transnational crime has focused on targeting the individuals and organizations perpetrating the crime, rather than the criminal markets themselves.\nC. The US war on drugs has heavily influenced the construction of the governmental response to the growing perception that the phenomenon of TNC represents a national security threat. The approach has an emphasis on bilateral and multilateral cooperation on law enforcement combined with sticks on a bi-lateral basis to induce states to increase regulation and enforcement against TNC.\nD. The emergence of norms governing the response to address the spectre of organized crime and to harmonize legislation occurred with the evolving Global War on Terror in which the terrorism-organized crime nexus resulted in the militarization of law enforcement: the use of military technology and intelligence as opposed to addressing the underlying conditions that facilitate illicit trade through an international institutionalist response.\n"

Here's how they've tackled this issue:\n\nA. Initially, organized crime was seen as a domestic issue, but as TNC grew, states began to view it as a national security threat. They have developed institutional frameworks for bilateral information sharing to apprehend criminals evading justice. This evolution reflects the growing awareness of the cross-border nature of TNC and the need for cooperative efforts.\n\nB. In response to the expansion of TNC in the 1990s, states moved towards harmonizing their legislation and enhancing police capacity and networking. The focus shifted from merely targeting criminals to addressing the structural issues that facilitate TNC. This approach acknowledges that reducing asymmetries between countries is crucial for effective law enforcement and requires collective action.\n\nC. The U.S. \"War on Drugs\" has significantly shaped government responses to TNC, emphasizing bilateral and multilateral law enforcement cooperation. This strategy often involves leveraging diplomatic and economic pressure to encourage other states to strengthen their regulatory and enforcement mechanisms against TNC. The goal is to disrupt criminal networks by targeting key players and operations.\n\nD. The Global War on Terror has led to the militarization of law enforcement in combating TNC, particularly where terrorism and organized crime intersect. This approach involves using military-grade technology and intelligence to tackle illicit activities. However, critics argue that such a militarized response may not address the root causes of TNC and could potentially exacerbate underlying issues that facilitate illegal trade.\n\nOverall, governments have adopted a mix of strategies, including legislative harmonization, enhanced law enforcement cooperation, and sometimes militarized responses, to counter the threats posed by TNC. These efforts reflect a recognition of the global nature of these crimes and the need for coordinated international action."
