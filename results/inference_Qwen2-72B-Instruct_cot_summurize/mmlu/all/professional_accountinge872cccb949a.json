However, in the consolidated balance sheet, intercompany transactions (like payables and receivables between entities within the same group) are eliminated to avoid double counting. Therefore, this payable would not be reported separately in the consolidated balance sheet as it would be offset against the corresponding receivable from Plane Co."
