The closest match to our calculation is not listed directly among the options, but if we were to choose the most appropriate based on our calculations, it would be:\n\nC. 19270\n\nHowever, this is not an exact match to our calculated result of 19690. Given the calculation process and the options provided, it appears there might be a discrepancy in either the question's options or the interpretation of the problem statement. Nonetheless, based on our calculations, the answer that comes closest to the correct response is C. 19270. However, please note that this does not perfectly align with the precise calculation result."
