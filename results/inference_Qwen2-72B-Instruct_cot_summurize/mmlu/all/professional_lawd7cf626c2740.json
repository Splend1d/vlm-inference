Inspired by a progressive revolt against the chemical company's domination of the state government, the corporate official's opponent, won by an extremely close margin. After the new governor took office, he vowed to get back at the company that owned the local newspaper for its newspaper's endorsement of the corporate official. Using his influence, the new governor was instrumental in getting the state legislature to pass a bill that imposed a special tax on the sale of ink and paper used in the publication of newspapers and periodicals of general circulation. The tax bill was signed into law by the governor. The strongest constitutional basis upon which to challenge the validity of the tax would be the\n\nA. equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nB. bill of attainder provision under Article I, Section 10.\nC. privileges or immunities clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nD. First Amendment, as incorporated in the Fourteenth Amendment.\n"

In this case, the imposition of a special tax on the sale of ink and paper used in the publication of newspapers and periodicals of general circulation appears to be a targeted punishment aimed specifically at the local newspaper that endorsed the corporate official. This could be seen as a bill of attainder if it can be demonstrated that the tax was intended to punish the newspaper for its editorial stance.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that proving this as a bill of attainder might be difficult because the tax ostensibly applies to all newspapers and periodicals, not just the one that endorsed the corporate official. Nevertheless, if there is clear evidence that the tax was motivated by a desire to punish a specific newspaper for its political speech, it could potentially be challenged as a bill of attainder.\n\nAdditionally, D. the First Amendment, as incorporated in the Fourteenth Amendment, could also be a strong basis for a challenge, as it protects freedom of the press. If the tax has a chilling effect on the press by disproportionately impacting their ability to operate, it could be argued that it infringes upon the freedom of the press protected by the First Amendment."
