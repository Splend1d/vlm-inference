However, it doesn't specifically predict:\n\nB. The equal number of terrestrial and jovian planets.\n\nIn fact, there are not an equal number of terrestrial and jovian planets in our solar system. There are four terrestrial planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars) and four jovian planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune). The Nebular Theory explains how both types of planets form, but it doesn't predict that their numbers should be equal. The distribution of these planets is more influenced by conditions within the solar nebula, such as temperature, pressure, and distance from the Sun, than by any inherent prediction of equal numbers."
