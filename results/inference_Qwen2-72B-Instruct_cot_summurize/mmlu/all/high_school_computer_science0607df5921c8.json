If you multiply this by `(high - low + 1)`, you get a double value between 0 (inclusive) and `(high - low + 1)` (exclusive). This means the result of the multiplication can be up to `(high - low)`, but not including `(high - low + 1)`.\n\nBy adding `low` to the result, you shift the range from `[0, high - low]` to `[low, high]`. The addition of `+1` in the multiplication ensures that `high` is included in the possible results.\n\nTherefore, the expression `(int) (Math.random() * (high - low + 1)) + low;` will always return an integer value in the range `[low, high]`, inclusive."
