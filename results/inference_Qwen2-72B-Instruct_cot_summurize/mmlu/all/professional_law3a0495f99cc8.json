The title was put in the woman's name and the man made the loan payments. They orally agreed that it was a shared ownership, with equal rights. After several months, their relationship deteriorated. They argued over ownership and use of the car. One day, the man attempted to leave with the car, but the woman climbed in and kept arguing as he was driving away. He then crashed into a pole and destroyed the car just to spite her, saying that if he couldn't have it no one would have it. The authorities arrested the man for auto larceny (stealing a car from the owner) and criminal mischief (damaging property of another or property shared with another). Assuming the accuracy of the foregoing facts beyond a reasonable doubt, which crime or crimes alleged can likely result in a sustainable conviction?\n\nA. He can be convicted of larceny but he cannot be convicted of criminal mischief.\nB. He cannot be convicted of any crime.\nC. He can be convicted of criminal mischief only.\nD. He can be convicted of both larceny and criminal mischief.\n"

Larceny, or theft, involves taking someone else's property without permission with the intent to permanently deprive them of it. In this case, since there was an oral agreement of shared ownership, the man did not take the car with the intent to permanently deprive the woman of it; instead, he seems to have taken it as part of a dispute over shared property. However, his actions in crashing the car to spite the woman could constitute criminal mischief, as he intentionally damaged property that is owned by another or shared with another.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. He can be convicted of criminal mischief only.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that legal outcomes can depend on various factors, including the specific laws in the jurisdiction where the incident occurred and how those laws define and interpret concepts like shared ownership and intent."
