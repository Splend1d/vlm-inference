Suspended losses can be carried forward, but not back, until utilized.\n\nThis means that if an individual has passive activity losses that they cannot deduct in the current year because their passive income is insufficient, those losses can be carried forward indefinitely to future tax years until they have enough passive income to offset them. They cannot, however, be carried back to previous tax years to adjust prior returns."
