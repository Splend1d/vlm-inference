The daughter's action of hiding the vegetables could be seen as deceitful, but the parent did not do anything that would be considered morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character is seeking medical help for their son, which is a responsible and necessary action if they believe their child is seriously ill. This is not morally wrong; it is the right thing to do in such a situation. If the illness was not serious and the main character lied about the severity to get immediate attention, that would be a different scenario, but based on the information given, this is not the case."
