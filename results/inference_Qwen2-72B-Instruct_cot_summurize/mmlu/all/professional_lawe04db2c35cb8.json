The interest is said to \"spring\" from a prior estate or interest when it becomes possessory upon the expiration of that prior interest.\n\nIn this case, the interest of the son is contingent upon two conditions precedent: (1) the failure of the dogs to receive proper care, and (2) the son being alive and owning dogs at the time the interest would vest. These conditions make the interest executory rather than vested. Furthermore, because the interest does not vest until after the death of the life tenant (the friend), and potentially long thereafter depending on when the dogs no longer receive proper care and whether the son owns dogs at that time, the interest could potentially violate the Rule against Perpetuities, which generally requires that interests must vest, if at all, no later than 21 years after some life in being at the creation of the interest. Therefore, the son's interest is an executory interest of a springing type that may be void under the Rule against Perpetuities."
