Protecting one's children in a life-threatening situation such as needing shelter during a bombing is generally seen as a parental duty.\n\nIn Scenario 2, calling the police on someone solely because they are gay is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. This action constitutes discrimination based on sexual orientation, which is against the principles of equality and human rights upheld in the United States."
