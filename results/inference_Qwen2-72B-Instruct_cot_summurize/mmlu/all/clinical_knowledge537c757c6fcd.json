Therefore, the closest answer would be:\n\nD. 4 minutes\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the exact time can vary and might be shorter or longer depending on individual factors such as training status and the specific type and intensity of the exercise being performed. For very fit individuals performing at lower intensities, the transition to predominantly aerobic metabolism could occur sooner than 2-3 minutes. Conversely, for less fit individuals or those performing high-intensity exercises, the body may rely more heavily on anaerobic pathways even beyond the 2-3 minute mark."
