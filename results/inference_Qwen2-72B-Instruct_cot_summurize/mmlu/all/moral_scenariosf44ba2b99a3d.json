Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nExplanation:\nScenario 1: Leaving the hotel room's bed messy might be considered inconsiderate by some, but it is not morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. Housekeeping services are typically included in hotel stays, and guests are not generally expected to clean their rooms before departure.\nScenario 2: Encouraging a politician to consider your proposal is not inherently morally wrong. It depends on the nature of the proposal and whether any unethical or illegal activities are involved. Without further context, this scenario does not suggest any wrongdoing."
