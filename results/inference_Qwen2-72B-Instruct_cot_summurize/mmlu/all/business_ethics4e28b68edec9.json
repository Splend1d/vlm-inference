In a simplistic sense, corporate profit maximization can be seen as an attempt to maximize pleasure (in the form of financial gain) for shareholders. However, this comparison has limitations:\n\n1. **Narrow focus on financial gain**: Corporate profit maximization focuses solely on financial outcomes for shareholders, while hedonistic utilitarianism considers all forms of pleasure and pain for all affected parties.\n2. **Consideration of stakeholders**: Hedonistic utilitarianism would require considering the well-being of all stakeholders, including employees, customers, and the broader community, whereas profit maximization often prioritizes shareholder interests above others.\n3. **Long-term vs. short-term**: Hedonistic utilitarianism advocates for maximizing long-term happiness, which might conflict with short-term profit maximization strategies that could lead to negative consequences in the future.\n\nThus, while there is a superficial similarity between hedonistic utilitarianism and corporate profit maximization due to their shared interest in maximizing certain types of positive outcomes, the underlying principles and scope of consideration differ significantly."
