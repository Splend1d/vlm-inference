This means that if you were to draw a straight line segment between any two points on the graph, no part of the graph would rise above this line segment.\n\nGiven that $f(x)$ passes through the points $(-2, 5)$ and $(2, 9)$, we can find the equation of the line that connects these two points. The slope of this line is given by:\n\n\\[m = \\frac{f(2) - f(-2)}{2 - (-2)} = \\frac{9 - 5}{4} = 1\\]\n\nThe equation of the line passing through $(-2, 5)$ with slope $1$ is:\n\n\\[y - 5 = 1(x + 2)\\]\n\\[y = x + 7\\]\n\nAt $x = 1$, the value of $y$ on this line is:\n\n\\[y = 1 + 7 = 8\\]\n\nSince $f(x)$ is strictly convex, for any point $(1, f(1))$ on the graph, $f(1)$ must be less than or equal to the value of the line at $x=1$, which is $8$. However, it cannot be equal because then the function wouldn't be strictly convex (it would just be convex), so $f(1) < 8$.\n\nBut there's no upper bound given by the question on how small $f(1)$ could be, as long as it remains strictly convex. Thus, the range of all possible values for $f(1)$ is $(-\\infty, 8)$. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. $(-\\infty, 8)$."
