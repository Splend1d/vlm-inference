It can cause a variety of symptoms, including abdominal pain, bloating, gas, diarrhea, and constipation. It is not primarily a psychological problem, nor is it a contraindication to colonoscopy. While some people may find that dietary changes help manage their symptoms, there is no one-size-fits-all solution like a gluten-free diet that will always resolve IBS."
