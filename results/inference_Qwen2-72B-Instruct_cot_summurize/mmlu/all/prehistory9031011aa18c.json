While the other options listed (elaborate burials, larger sites with larger populations, and symbolic expression through the production of art) all emerged at various points during the Upper Paleolithic period, which began around 50,000 to 40,000 years ago, the development of stone tools predates this by millions of years.\n\nStone tool technology can be traced back to the earliest hominins, such as Australopithecus, who lived around 2.6 million years ago. These early hominins used simple stone flakes and cores in what is known as the Oldowan tool culture. Over time, stone tool technology became more sophisticated, leading to the Acheulean handaxe tradition (about 1.76 million to 100,000 years ago), and eventually to the more refined tools of the Middle and Upper Paleolithic periods.\n\nThus, while the other characteristics listed are important markers of cultural complexity that emerged later in human evolution, improved stone tool technologies are the most ancient of these traits, predating the Upper Paleolithic and even the emergence of anatomically modern humans."
