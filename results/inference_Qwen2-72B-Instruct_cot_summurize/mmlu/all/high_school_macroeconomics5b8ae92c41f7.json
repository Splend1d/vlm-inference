Less effective in X because the policy will decrease net exports.\n\nIn an open economy like Economy X, expansionary monetary policy leads to lower interest rates. This makes the domestic currency less attractive to foreign investors, causing depreciation of the currency. While this can make exports cheaper and thus potentially increase them, it also raises the cost of imports, which can lead to a decrease in net exports if the effect on imports outweighs the effect on exports. Additionally, capital may flow out of the country in search of higher returns elsewhere, mitigating the effects of the expansionary policy. In contrast, in a closed economy like Economy Y, there are no such external factors to mitigate the effects of expansionary monetary policy, making it potentially more effective in stimulating demand."
