A pediatrician informed the infant's father that unless his daughter received immediate medical treatment, she would die. The father, who was very religious, refused to permit the pediatrician to administer the necessary treatment. He explained that his faith in his religion would restore his daughter to good health. As a consequence, the pediatrician sought an order from the state court, where the father was present, permitting the pediatrician to provide the necessary medical treatment to the infant. Which of the following is the father's strongest constitutional argument against the court order?\n\nA. The order violates the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nB. The order violates the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nC. The order violates the free exercise clause of the First Amendment, as incorporated by the Fourteenth Amendment.\nD. The order violates the privileges or immunities clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n"

The order violates the free exercise clause of the First Amendment, as incorporated by the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nThis argument is based on the idea that the father's religious beliefs are being infringed upon by the court order, which compels him to allow medical treatment for his daughter that he opposes on religious grounds. However, it's important to note that while this may be his strongest argument, it may not necessarily be a successful one. Courts generally balance individual rights, including religious freedom, against the state's interest in protecting the welfare of children. In cases involving the health and safety of minors, courts often rule in favor of the child's best interests, even if it means overriding a parent's religious objections."
