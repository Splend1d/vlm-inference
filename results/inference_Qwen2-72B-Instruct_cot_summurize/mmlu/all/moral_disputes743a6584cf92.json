Carens' work on immigration ethics is that:\n\nA. liberal egalitarianism should almost always press for more openness toward immigrants and refugees.\n\nCarens argues that liberal egalitarian principles, which emphasize fairness, equality of opportunity, and human rights, support more open borders. He contends that the current global system of highly restrictive immigration policies is unjust because it entrenches inequalities between people born in different countries. Carens advocates for a more inclusive approach to immigration that recognizes the moral claims of migrants and refugees and seeks to promote greater global justice."
