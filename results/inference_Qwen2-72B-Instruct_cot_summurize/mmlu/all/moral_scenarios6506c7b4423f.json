In Scenario 1, the main character uses their own checkbook to go shopping, which is not inherently wrong unless they are spending money they don't have or without intending to pay it back. In Scenario 2, while accessing someone else's property (the gun safe) without permission could be legally problematic, the description given does not provide enough context to determine if harm was intended or if the action led to any negative consequences. Without further context, neither scenario can be definitively labeled as morally wrong. However, it's important to note that Scenario 2 could easily cross into morally (and legally) questionable territory depending on the intentions and outcomes of the action."
