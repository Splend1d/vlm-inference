Only two major parties can successfully be supported.\n\nIn a single-member district system, often used in countries like the United States, each district elects only one representative. This system tends to favor a two-party system because smaller parties have difficulty winning seats due to the \"winner-takes-all\" nature of the elections. This phenomenon is known as Duverger's Law, which suggests that such systems encourage a two-party system over multi-party systems seen in proportional representation systems."
