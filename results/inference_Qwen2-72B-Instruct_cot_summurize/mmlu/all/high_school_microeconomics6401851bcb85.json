In the long run, all inputs are variable.\n\nExplanation:\nIn microeconomics, the long run and short run refer to different time frames concerning the ability of firms to adjust their production levels in response to changes in market conditions. The key difference between the two periods is the flexibility of input usage.\n\nA. In the long run, all inputs are variable: This means that in the long term, firms can adjust all of their inputs, including capital (like machinery and buildings) and labor, to respond to changes in demand or other market conditions. They can expand or contract their operations, enter or exit markets, and make significant changes to their production processes.\n\nB. In the short run, not all inputs are variable: Contrary to option B, in the short run, some inputs are fixed while others are variable. Fixed inputs cannot be easily changed in the short term (e.g., factories, equipment), whereas variable inputs can be adjusted more readily (e.g., labor, raw materials).\n\nC. In the long run, supply is able to adjust fully to changes in demand: This statement is more accurate than C. In the long run, firms have the ability to fully adjust their production levels to match changes in demand by changing all inputs, entering or exiting the market, and making other strategic decisions.\n\nD. In the short run, supply is not able to adjust fully to changes in demand: This statement is more accurate than D. In the short run, because some inputs are fixed, firms cannot immediately adjust their production levels to fully meet changes in demand. Their supply curve is less elastic due to these constraints.\n\nTherefore, the only completely correct statement from the given options is A."
