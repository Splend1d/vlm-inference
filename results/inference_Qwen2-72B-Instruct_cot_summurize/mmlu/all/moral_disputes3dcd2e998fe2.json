He claimed that this problem cannot be solved by simply appealing to people's sense of sharing and community, because there will always be some individuals who will take more than their fair share, leading to a breakdown of the resource. Hardin believed that the only way to prevent this tragedy is to establish clear property rights or government regulation to limit access to the resource."
