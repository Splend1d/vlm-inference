Thrombin\n\nThrombin is a serine protease enzyme that plays a key role in blood clotting, specifically in converting fibrinogen into fibrin during the coagulation cascade. While it can certainly be present in the extracellular space when a blood clot forms, thrombin is not a typical component of connective tissue itself.\n\nConnective tissues, on the other hand, are composed of various components including:\n\nB. Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), which are long unbranched or branched polysaccharides that, along with proteoglycans, contribute to the ground substance of connective tissues, providing hydration and resistance to compression.\n\nC. Collagens, which are the major fibrous proteins that provide tensile strength to connective tissues. They form a network that supports cells and helps maintain the structure of organs.\n\nD. Fibroblasts, which are the most common cells found in connective tissue. They synthesize collagen and other extracellular matrix components, contributing to tissue repair and maintenance."
