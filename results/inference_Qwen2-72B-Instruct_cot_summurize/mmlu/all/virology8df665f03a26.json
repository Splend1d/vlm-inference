Ability to distinguish self and non-self\n\nAdaptive immunity has the capability to recognize and remember specific pathogens, which allows for a faster and more effective response upon subsequent exposures. This memory is a hallmark of adaptive immunity and is what enables vaccines to work. While distinguishing between self and non-self is also a critical function of the immune system as a whole, it specifically highlights the precision of adaptive immunity in targeting foreign invaders while sparing the body's own cells."
