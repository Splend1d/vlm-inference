He has not had any other symptoms and has no history of severe headache. He has hypertension and gastroesophageal reflux disease. Current medications include hydrochlorothiazide and ranitidine. He is oriented to person, place, and time. His temperature is 36.7\u00b0C (98.1\u00b0F), pulse is 100/min, and blood pressure is 160/90 mm Hg. Range of motion of the neck is decreased due to pain. Neurologic examination shows no focal findings. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\n\nA. Cluster headache\nB. Meningitis\nC. Migraine\nD. Subarachnoid hemorrhage\n"

The sudden onset of a severe headache, especially in the occipital region, along with neck stiffness (nuchal rigidity) within the last 12 hours, despite no history of severe headaches, strongly suggests subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). This condition often presents with what is described as \"the worst headache of my life,\" which peaks within seconds to minutes. The decreased range of motion in the neck due to pain also supports this diagnosis.\n\nWhile the other options can present with headache and neck stiffness, they typically do not present with such acute onset and severity. Meningitis might cause similar symptoms but would likely be accompanied by fever, altered mental status, and other signs of infection. Migraines and cluster headaches usually have a different pattern and onset than described here, and they would not typically cause neck stiffness or such severe and sudden onset of symptoms."
