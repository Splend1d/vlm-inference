                    "text": "The correct answer is B. Cyclin-dependent kinases.\n\nCyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) play a crucial role in regulating the cell cycle, including the progression of cells through different phases of the menstrual cycle. The presence of abundant mitotic figures in the endometrial glands and stroma suggests that cells are actively dividing, which is regulated by CDKs in conjunction with cyclins. Other enzymes listed (AMP-dependent kinases, hexokinases, and lipid kinases) do not have direct roles in cell cycle regulation."
