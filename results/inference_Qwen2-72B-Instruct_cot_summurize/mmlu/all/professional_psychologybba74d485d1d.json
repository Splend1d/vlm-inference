Discuss the client's options with her and maintain her confidentiality unless she signs a release.\n\nAccording to the ethics codes of both the American Psychological Association (APA) and the Canadian Psychological Association (CPA), psychologists must respect client confidentiality. If a client discloses information about harm or potential harm done by another professional, the psychologist should inform the client about the limits of confidentiality and discuss possible courses of action. However, reporting the incident without the client's consent would violate confidentiality unless there is an imminent risk of harm to the client or others, which does not appear to be the case here. The psychologist should provide the client with information about her options, such as filing a complaint with the relevant licensing board or ethics committee, while respecting her wishes regarding confidentiality unless she consents to further action."
