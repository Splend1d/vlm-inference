Calculate the straight-line depreciation rate per year.\n2. Double that rate for the double-declining balance method.\n3. Apply this rate to the book value at the beginning of each year to find the annual depreciation expense.\n4. Subtract the annual depreciation from the book value at the beginning of the year to get the book value at the end of the year.\n\nLet's start with the straight-line depreciation rate. The useful life is 8 years, so the straight-line rate is 1/8 or 12.5% per year. For the double-declining balance method, we double this rate to 25%.\n\nNow let's apply this rate to the book value at the beginning of each year:\n\nYear 1:\n- Book value at the beginning of the year: $140,000\n- Annual depreciation: 25% * $140,000 = $35,000\n- Book value at the end of the year: $140,000 - $35,000 = $105,000\n\nYear 2:\n- Book value at the beginning of the year: $105,000\n- Annual depreciation: 25% * $105,000 = $26,250\n- Book value at the end of the year: $105,000 - $26,250 = $78,750\n\nTherefore, the carrying amount of the machine at the end of the second year is $78,750.\n\nThe correct answer is C. $78,750."
