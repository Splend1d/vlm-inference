The significance level (\\(\\alpha\\)) is indeed equal to the size of the test, which is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true.\n\n(ii) is incorrect. The power of the test is not equal to the significance level. The power of the test is the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when it is false, usually denoted as \\(1 - \\beta\\), where \\(\\beta\\) is the probability of a Type II error (failing to reject the null hypothesis when it is false).\n\n(iii) is correct for a two-tailed test at a 5% significance level. In this case, the rejection regions are split evenly between the two tails, so 2.5% of the total distribution will be in each tail.\n\n(iv) is incorrect. For a two-tailed test at a 5% significance level, 2.5% would be in each tail, not 5%. If 5% were in each tail, the total significance level would be 10%, not 5%."
