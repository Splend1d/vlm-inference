Of the following approaches to diagnostic assessment, the most appropriate is one that\n\nA. uses an interpreter who is fluent in the language of the country in which the student was born\nB. uses the results of at least two Englishlanguage intelligence tests\nC. accounts for sociocultural and adaptive behavior in the process of identifying skills and abilities\nD. includes parent interviews and classroom observations as well as the results of an intelligence test\n"

This approach takes into account multiple sources of information about the student's skills and abilities, including their performance in the classroom, their home environment, and their cognitive abilities. Using an interpreter or administering multiple intelligence tests may also be useful, but they do not address the broader context of the student's life and experiences that can impact their academic performance. Accounting for sociocultural and adaptive behavior is also important, but it is not a specific approach to diagnostic assessment."
