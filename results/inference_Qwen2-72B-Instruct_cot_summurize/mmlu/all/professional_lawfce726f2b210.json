Here are the answers to your multiple-choice question based on UCC rules:\n\nA. **Must be separately signed if the offeree supplies a form contract containing the offer.**\n   - This statement is incorrect. The UCC does not require that a firm offer be separately signed. It can be included in a form contract.\n\nB. **Is valid for three months.**\n   - This statement is partially correct. A firm offer by a merchant can be made irrevocable without consideration for a maximum period of three months. However, it can be for a shorter period as well.\n\nC. **Is nonassignable.**\n   - This statement is incorrect. A firm offer is not automatically nonassignable. Its assignability depends on the terms of the offer and other contractual provisions or agreements between the parties.\n\nD. **Can not exceed a three-month duration even if consideration is given.**\n   - This statement is incorrect. While a firm offer by a merchant can be made irrevocable for up to three months without consideration, if consideration is given, the offer can be made irrevocable for a longer period. The three-month limit applies only when no consideration is provided in exchange for the irrevocability of the offer.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate statement from the options given is **B**. However, it's important to note that while a firm offer can indeed be valid for three months, it doesn't mean it must be for that duration\u2014it can be less. Also, with consideration, it can be for a longer duration than three months."
