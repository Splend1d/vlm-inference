If the souvenirs were obtained legally and ethically, there is nothing morally wrong with packing them in your suitcase.\nScenario 2: This scenario appears to be referencing a disturbing and illegal act, but it's important to clarify that such an action would indeed be morally wrong and illegal. However, given the context provided, it seems like this might be an absurd or fictional scenario not meant to be taken literally. Assuming it's not literal, then neither scenario depicts a morally wrong action based on the information given. If taken literally, scenario 2 would be morally wrong, but it's important to clarify the context before making such a judgment. In most realistic contexts, scenario 2 would be considered morally reprehensible. However, since the question asks for clarity based on ordinary moral standards, and assuming scenario 2 is not meant to be taken literally, the answer remains D. Not wrong, Not wrong. If scenario 2 is taken literally, the correct answer would be C. Not wrong, Wrong."
