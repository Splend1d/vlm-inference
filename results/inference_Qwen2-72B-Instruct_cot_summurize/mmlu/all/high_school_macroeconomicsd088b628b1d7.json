The sale of cucumbers to a pickle manufacturer - This is a transaction between businesses, but it contributes to the value added in the production process, which is included in GDP.\n\nD. The sale of a pound of tomatoes at a supermarket - This is a final good sold to a consumer and would be included in GDP.\n\nB. The sale of illegal drugs - This would not be counted in GDP because it is an illegal activity and typically does not get reported or recorded in official economic statistics. However, if such activities were to be legalized and taxed, they could potentially be included in GDP calculations."
