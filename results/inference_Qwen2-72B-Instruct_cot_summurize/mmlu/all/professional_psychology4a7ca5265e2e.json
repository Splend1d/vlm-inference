Self-regulating psyche, the unconscious, therapist\u2013patient relationship, stages of self-improvement\n\nHowever, it's important to note that Jung's theory is more complex than this simplified list might suggest. The options provided don't perfectly align with Jung's concepts, but among them, option B comes closest. Jung emphasized the importance of the self-regulating nature of the psyche, the role of the unconscious (including both personal and collective aspects), the dynamic between therapist and patient, and the process of individuation, which could be seen as stages of self-improvement."
