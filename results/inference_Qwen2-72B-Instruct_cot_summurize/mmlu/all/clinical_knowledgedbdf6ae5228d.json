An opening in the anterior wall of the trachea below the cricoid cartilage.\n\nA tracheostomy is a surgical procedure that creates an opening through the neck into the trachea (windpipe). This opening allows a tube to be inserted, which can help a person breathe when the usual route for breathing is obstructed or if they have difficulty breathing due to illness or injury. The opening is made below the cricoid cartilage to avoid injury to the vocal cords."
