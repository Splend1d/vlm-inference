This is a result of the Heine-Cantor theorem which states that any continuous function from a compact metric space to any metric space is uniformly continuous.\n\nStatement 2 is also true. If both \\(f(x)\\) and \\(g(x)\\) are everywhere differentiable functions from \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) to \\(\\mathbb{R}\\), then their composition \\(f(g(x))\\) will also be everywhere differentiable. This follows from the chain rule in calculus, which allows us to compute the derivative of the composite function at any point where both functions are differentiable.\n\nThus, the correct answer is A. True, True."
