It is a misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment of up to six months. \"A defendant was a lawyer who worked in a law firm located in the state. The defendant, who had a reputation of being a prankster, decided to play a practical joke on the senior partner of the law firm. The defendant donned a cowboy mask and entered the senior partner's office. As the senior partner was talking on the phone with his back to the door, the defendant pulled out a toy cap gun and said, \"This is a stickup . . . give me your wallet or I'll shoot. \" When the senior partner turned around to face the defendant, he pulled the trigger of the gun. This caused the toy pistol to make a loud noise. Although the senior partner was not frightened, he fired the defendant because of the incident, citing unprofessional conduct. The defendant was subsequently charged with criminal assault under the above mentioned statute. At trial, the defendant testified that he was only playing a practical joke on the senior partner and was trying to scare him as a harmless prank. If the jury believes the defendant, they should find him\n\nA. guilty, because he intended to frighten the senior partner.\nB. guilty, because the statute does not require the present ability to commit a battery.\nC. not guilty, because the defendant did not intend to cause physical injury to the senior partner.\nD. not guilty, because the facts state that the senior partner was not frightened.\n"

Assault is defined as an unlawful attempt, with or without present ability, to commit a battery on the person of another. The defendant's actions of pointing a toy gun at the senior partner and demanding his wallet could be seen as an attempt to commit a battery (in this case, potentially a robbery), even though the gun was a toy and there was no real threat of harm. The fact that the senior partner was not actually frightened does not negate the defendant's actions, which could reasonably be interpreted as an attempt to instill fear or apprehension of imminent harmful or offensive contact. Therefore, under the statute provided, the defendant's intent to frighten the senior partner through the act of pointing a gun at him and demanding his wallet constitutes an assault, regardless of the toy nature of the weapon used."
