Dollar bills\n\nFiat money is currency that has value because the government has declared it to be legal tender, but it is not backed by a physical commodity such as gold or silver. Dollar bills are an example of fiat money since their value is not derived from any intrinsic worth but rather from the government's authority and the public's confidence in the currency."
