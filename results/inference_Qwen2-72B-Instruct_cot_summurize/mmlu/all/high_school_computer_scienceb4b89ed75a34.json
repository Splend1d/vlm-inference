Insertion sort performs well when the array is nearly sorted or has some pre-sorted segments, but not necessarily when it's sorted in descending order. In fact, both insertion and selection sorts have worst-case time complexities of O(n^2), but selection sort will always make n*(n-1)/2 comparisons regardless of the initial state of the array, whereas insertion sort can potentially make fewer comparisons if the array is partially sorted.\n\nB. This statement is true. Selection sort will always make n*(n-1)/2 comparisons regardless of the initial arrangement of the elements in the array. It finds the minimum (or maximum) element from the unsorted part and swaps it with the first unsorted element.\n\nC. This statement is false. The number of comparisons for insertion sort does depend on the initial arrangement of the elements. If the array is already sorted, insertion sort will make only n-1 comparisons. However, if the array is sorted in reverse order, it will make the maximum number of comparisons, i.e., n*(n-1)/2.\n\nD. This statement is false. The number of data movements (swaps) in selection sort does not depend on the initial arrangement of elements. Selection sort will always make n-1 swaps, one for each pass through the array, regardless of how the elements are arranged initially."
