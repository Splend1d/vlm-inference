This frequency range is suitable for generating eddy currents that can heat materials efficiently for various industrial applications such as welding, brazing, and heat treatment. Higher frequencies in this range can penetrate shallower depths, making them suitable for surface treatments, while lower frequencies can penetrate deeper, making them suitable for larger components. However, it's worth noting that some specialized applications might use frequencies up to several MHz."
