This increased economic activity leads to a greater demand for money for transactions (to buy and sell goods and services). As the demand for money increases, it puts upward pressure on the interest rate if the money supply remains constant, because people are willing to pay more to borrow money when it is in high demand. However, it's important to note that central banks can adjust the money supply to mitigate these effects on interest rates."
