If this is within the context of a lawful military action or a video game, for instance, it might not be considered morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. However, if this action involves unnecessary violence or harm without just cause, it could be seen as morally questionable or wrong. Without further context, it's not clear that the action is \"clearly morally wrong.\"\n\nIn scenario 2, picking up someone else's dropped money and returning it to them is generally considered a morally right action, as it demonstrates honesty and integrity."
