The cave paintings and elaborate burials mentioned in option B are more typically associated with later hominins such as Neanderthals and Homo sapiens. However, the discovery of a shell with intentionally engraved lines at the Trinil site on Java, Indonesia, which has been attributed to Homo erectus, does suggest the potential for symbolic behavior and artistic expression. This find indicates that these early humans might have had the cognitive capacity for abstract thought and self-expression, which are key components of an aesthetic sense."
