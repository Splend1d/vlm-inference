The halo effect refers to the tendency for an overall impression of a person, based on one positive characteristic, to influence judgments about other characteristics. In this case, Tina's good academic performance and involvement in extracurricular activities may have led her instructor to assume that she would also be a good driver, despite her lack of experience. When she caused an accident during her second day of driver's ed, it likely came as a surprise to the instructor who had already formed a positive overall impression of Tina."
