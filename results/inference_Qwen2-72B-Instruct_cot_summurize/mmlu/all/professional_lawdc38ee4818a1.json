This means that they can be admitted into evidence without the need for extrinsic evidence of authenticity, such as a witness or certification. The rationale behind this rule is that the publication itself bears indicia of reliability sufficient to support a finding of authenticity. However, it's important to note that while the newspaper itself may be self-authenticating, any electronic copies or reproductions may require additional authentication if there is a question about their accuracy or integrity."
