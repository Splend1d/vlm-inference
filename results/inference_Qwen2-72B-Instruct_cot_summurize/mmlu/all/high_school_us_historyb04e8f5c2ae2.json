Therefore, it is impossible to accurately answer your question based on the information given. However, I can provide you with some historical context about Andrew Carnegie and how he was often criticized.\n\nAndrew Carnegie was a Scottish-American industrialist who led the enormous expansion of the American steel industry in the late 19th century. He was one of the most important \"captains of industry\" of the Gilded Age and was once the richest man in the world. Carnegie was also known for his philanthropy, giving away over $350 million in the last eighteen years of his life (approximately $7.8 billion in 2020).\n\nCriticism of Carnegie often focused on his business practices and treatment of workers. During the Homestead Strike of 1892, for example, Carnegie's company used hired strikebreakers to violently suppress striking steelworkers. This event, among others, led to accusations that Carnegie built his fortune on the backs of exploited workers. Therefore, option A, \"Carnegie was able to give away a great deal of money only because he violated his workers\u2019 rights,\" would be a likely criticism found in a cartoon of the time period.\n\nHowever, without seeing the cartoon in question, it is impossible to know for sure which of these criticisms it may be making. If you can provide more information about the cartoon, I would be happy to help you further."
