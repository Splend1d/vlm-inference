When he saw the headlights of another car appear in the distance, he reached to turn the high beams off. Instead of turning from high-beam to low-beam, the headlights on the car turned off completely. The man tried repeatedly to turn the lights on again but could not do so. He collided with the other car and suffered injuries. The man has brought an action against the manufacturer of the headlight controls in his car, the manufacturer of his car, and the retailer who sold him the car. If the man can establish that a defect in the controls caused the accident, from whom can he recover?\n\nA. Only the manufacturer of the car and the retailer of the car.\nB. Only the manufacturer of the car.\nC. Only the manufacturer of the headlight controls and the manufacturer of the car.\nD. All three defendants.\n"

All three defendants.\n\nThe man may be able to recover damages from all three defendants: the manufacturer of the headlight controls, the manufacturer of the car, and the retailer who sold him the car. Each party could potentially bear some responsibility for the defective product that led to the accident. The manufacturer of the headlight controls is directly responsible for the faulty component, the car manufacturer for incorporating it into the vehicle without ensuring its safety, and the retailer for selling a defective product to the consumer."
