When the parties were unable to agree on the terms of a the parties were unable to agree on the terms of a final contract, the producer made reasonable but unsuccessful efforts to hire another singer before abandoning the production. If the producer sues the singer, what will he likely recover?\n\nA. Expectation damages in the form of the profits that the production would have made if it had been performed.\nB. Reliance damages in the form of the actual expenses the producer incurred while negotiating with the singer.\nC.

Reliance damages in the form of the actual expenses the producer incurred while negotiating with the singer.\n\nIn this scenario, the producer may be entitled to reliance damages. These damages are intended to compensate the non-breaching party for losses incurred as a result of relying on the expectation that a contract would be formed. Since the producer spent money on the production based on the expectation that the singer would perform, and these expenses were incurred during the negotiation phase before it became clear that a final contract would not be reached, the producer can seek to recover those specific expenses. This is justified under the principle that encourages parties to negotiate in good faith and prevents one party from benefiting at the expense of the other's reliance."
