At trial, the jury found each of the drivers liable for negligence. The jury found that the amount of the truck driver's injuries was $10,000, and the amount of the car driver's injuries was $8,000. The jury assigned 50 percent of the fault for the accident to the truck driver and 50 percent of the fault to the car driver. Assume that the jurisdiction has a statute in effect that provides: \"Contributory negligence shall not bar recovery in an action to recover damages for negligence resulting in injury to person or property if such negligence was not as great as the negligence of the person from whom recovery is sought. Any damages allowed shall be diminished in proportion to the amount of negligence attributable to the person who is seeking recovery. \"Which of the following is the appropriate judgment in the case?\n\nA. The truck driver recovers $10,000, and the car driver recovers $8,000.\nB. The truck driver recovers $5,000, and the car driver recovers $4,000.\nC. The truck driver recovers $1,000, and the car driver recovers nothing.\nD. Neither party recovers anything from the other.\n"

The truck driver recovers $5,000, and the car driver recovers $4,000.\n\nAccording to the statute provided, contributory negligence does not bar recovery, but any damages allowed shall be diminished in proportion to the amount of negligence attributable to the person seeking recovery. Since the jury assigned 50% of the fault to each driver:\n\n- The truck driver's damages of $10,000 are reduced by his own 50% fault, so he can recover $5,000 (50% of $10,000).\n- The car driver's damages of $8,000 are reduced by his own 50% fault, so he can recover $4,000 (50% of $8,000).\n\nTherefore, the truck driver recovers $5,000, and the car driver recovers $4,000."
