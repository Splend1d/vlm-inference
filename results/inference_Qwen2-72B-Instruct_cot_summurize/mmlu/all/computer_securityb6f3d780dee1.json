While spammers may use botnets for various purposes, such as sending spam emails or launching DDoS attacks, it's not necessarily true that they run their spam-advertised websites on compromised user machines. They could host these sites on legitimate servers or other types of infrastructure.\n\nB. True. Spammers often need to register domain names to host their spam-advertised websites. These domains are used to direct traffic from spam messages to the advertised products or services.\n\nC. True. Switching acquiring banks can be costly for spammers because they often engage in fraudulent activities, such as credit card processing for illegitimate sales. Acquiring banks are responsible for handling merchant accounts and processing transactions. If a spammer's activities are discovered, the bank may terminate the relationship, leading the spammer to incur costs associated with finding and setting up a new acquiring bank, including potential fees and the time required to establish a new account.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D, as both B and C are true statements based on the information provided in the paper \"Click Trajectories: End-to-End Analysis of the Spam Value Chain.\""
