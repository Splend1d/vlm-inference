This is in line with the requirements for a compilation engagement under Statements on Standards for Accounting and Review Services (SSARS) issued by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA). The accountant does not issue an opinion on the financial statements as in an audit or review engagement but must disclose the departure from GAAP when it is known."
