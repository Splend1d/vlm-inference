That means there are 5 choices for each digit.\n\nSince it's a 4-digit number, we need to choose a digit for each of the four places (thousands, hundreds, tens, and units).\n\nSo, for the thousands place, we have 5 choices (it can't be 0 since it's a 4-digit number).\nFor the hundreds, tens, and units places, we also have 5 choices each.\n\nThus, the total number of such 4-digit numbers is \\(5 \\times 5 \\times 5 \\times 5 = 5^4\\).\n\nCalculating that gives us \\(5^4 = 625\\).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. 625."
