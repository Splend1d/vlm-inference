Let's analyze each statement:\n\nI. \\(P\\) is invertible.\nThis statement is not necessarily true. If \\(P\\) is the zero transformation, then it is not invertible. Moreover, if \\(P\\) is an idempotent matrix that is not the identity matrix, it cannot be invertible since its determinant will be 0 (because \\(det(P^2) = det(P)^2 = det(P)\\), implying that \\(det(P)\\) is either 1 or 0, but if \\(P\\) is not the identity matrix, then \\(det(P) = 0\\)).\n\nII. \\(P\\) is diagonalizable.\nThis statement is true. An idempotent matrix \\(P\\) can always be diagonalized to a diagonal matrix with entries 0 or 1 on the diagonal. This follows from the fact that the minimal polynomial of \\(P\\) divides \\(x(x-1)\\), which has distinct roots, so by the Cayley-Hamilton theorem and the theory of Jordan normal forms, \\(P\\) is diagonalizable.\n\nIII. \\(P\\) is either the identity transformation or the zero transformation.\nThis statement is not necessarily true. While both the identity matrix and the zero matrix satisfy the given condition, there exist other idempotent matrices that are neither the identity nor the zero matrix. For example, consider the matrix \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\\).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. II only\n\n\\(P\\) being diagonalizable is the only statement that must be true for all idempotent matrices \\(P\\)."
