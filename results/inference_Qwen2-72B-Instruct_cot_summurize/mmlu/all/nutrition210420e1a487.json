Therefore, option B is correct, but it only covers one aspect of food security. Option C provides a more comprehensive answer as it includes the four dimensions of food security: availability, access, utilization, and stability. Option A is incorrect because it refers to food defense, not food security. Option D is also incorrect because while ending micronutrient malnutrition is an important part of food security, it is not its primary focus."
