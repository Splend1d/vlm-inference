This can be caused by conditions such as an enlarged prostate, bladder neck obstruction, or a urethral stricture. These conditions can physically block the flow of urine from the bladder, leading to acute retention. While kidney stones (option D) can also cause urinary retention, they typically cause more of a partial obstruction and pain rather than acute retention. Drinking alcohol (option C) does not typically cause acute urinary retention, although it can contribute to dehydration and other urinary issues. Haematuria (option A), or blood in the urine, is a symptom rather than a cause of urinary retention."
