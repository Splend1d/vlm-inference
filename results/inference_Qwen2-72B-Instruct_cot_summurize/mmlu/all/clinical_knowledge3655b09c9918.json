It leads to loss of sensation over the medial half of the hand and medial one and a half digits on both palmar and dorsal aspects of the hand.\n\nUlnar nerve palsy can indeed lead to sensory loss over the medial (little finger) side of the hand, including the little finger and half of the ring finger on both the palm and back of the hand. This is because the ulnar nerve provides sensory innervation to these areas.\n\nA. Although the ulnar nerve does run in the spiral groove of the humerus, it is less commonly affected by fractures at this location compared to the more common site of compression at the elbow or wrist.\nB. Phalen's sign is associated with carpal tunnel syndrome, which affects the median nerve, not the ulnar nerve.\nD. The biceps muscle is supplied by the musculocutaneous nerve, not the ulnar nerve."
