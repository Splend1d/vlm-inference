                    "text": "When a second block of equal mass falls on and sticks to the oscillating block, the total mass of the system increases while the spring constant remains unchanged. The period \\(T\\) of a spring-mass system is given by the equation:\n\n\\[T = 2\\pi\\sqrt{\\frac{m}{k}}\\]\n\nwhere \\(m\\) is the mass of the object attached to the spring and \\(k\\) is the spring constant. As the mass \\(m\\) doubles due to the addition of the second block, the period \\(T\\) also increases because the square root of the mass is now larger.\n\nHowever, the question asks about the amplitude of the oscillations. The amplitude of a simple harmonic oscillator is not directly related to its mass or spring constant; it depends on the initial conditions (such as the initial displacement or velocity) and energy conservation. Assuming no external forces except for gravity acting during the collision (which is vertical), and assuming the collision is perfectly inelastic (the blocks stick together), the kinetic energy right before the collision is converted into potential energy in the spring after the collision.\n\nIf we consider the situation just before the second block falls onto the first, let's assume the first block is at some point in its oscillation cycle. When the second block lands, if it lands when the first block is at the maximum displacement (amplitude), it will add to the potential energy of the system but will not necessarily change the amplitude if the collision is perfectly inelastic and occurs at the point of maximum potential energy. However, if the collision occurs when the first block is moving towards the equilibrium position (or beyond), part of the kinetic energy from the first block's motion might be absorbed by the collision, potentially reducing the amplitude.\n\nIn practice, however, without specific details about the timing and exact mechanics of the collision, it's difficult to determine the exact effect on the amplitude. However, since the question seems to imply a general scenario without specific timing details, the most accurate answer based on the information provided would be:\n\nD. It would depend on where the original block was in its cycle when the second block fell.\n\nThis is because the timing of the collision could lead to different outcomes regarding the amplitude, depending on whether the collision occurs near the equilibrium position, which could reduce the amplitude due to loss of kinetic energy, or at an extreme of the oscillation, which might not significantly affect the amplitude if the collision does not significantly dissipate energy."
