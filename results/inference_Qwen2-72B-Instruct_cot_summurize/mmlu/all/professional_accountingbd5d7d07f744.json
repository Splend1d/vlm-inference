As a $60,000 debit to insurance expense, a $120,000 debit to prepaid asset, and an $180,000 credit to retained earnings.\n\nWhen Bailey Co. purchased the four-year insurance policy in the prior year, it paid $240,000 in cash. Under the cash basis of accounting, the entire amount was recognized as an expense at that time. However, under the accrual basis, expenses should be recognized when they are incurred and not necessarily when they are paid. Therefore, the $240,000 should have been recorded as a prepaid asset (a current asset) and expensed evenly over the four-year life of the policy.\n\nSince one year has already passed under the cash basis, Bailey Co. needs to adjust its books to reflect the change in accounting principle. For the current year, Bailey Co. should recognize one-fourth of the total cost ($240,000 / 4 = $60,000) as insurance expense. The remaining $180,000 ($240,000 - $60,000) should be recorded as a prepaid asset since this represents the cost of the insurance coverage for the next three years.\n\nTo make this adjustment, Bailey Co. would record a $60,000 debit to insurance expense (for the current year's portion), a $120,000 debit to prepaid asset (to adjust the balance for the two remaining years of coverage), and an $180,000 credit to retained earnings (to correct the overstatement of expenses in the prior year)."
