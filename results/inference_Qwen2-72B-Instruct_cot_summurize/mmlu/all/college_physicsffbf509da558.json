Hall coefficient\n\nThe Hall coefficient is a measure of the magnitude of the Hall effect, which is the production of a voltage difference across an electrical conductor when a magnetic field and an electric current are applied. The sign of the Hall coefficient indicates the type of charge carriers (electrons or holes) in the material. A positive Hall coefficient indicates that the charge carriers are holes (positive charges), while a negative Hall coefficient indicates that the charge carriers are electrons (negative charges). Therefore, the Hall coefficient can be used to determine the sign of the charge carriers in a doped semiconductor."
