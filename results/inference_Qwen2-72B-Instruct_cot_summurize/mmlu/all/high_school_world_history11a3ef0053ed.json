The Bahr [al-Fava'id, or \"Sea of Precious Virtues,\" written in the 1150s or 1160s] insists that the first duty of a Muslim ruler is to prosecute the jihad and bring about the victory of Islam, and if he does not do so and he makes peace with the infidel, that ruler would be better dead than alive, for he would be corrupting the world.\nRobert Irwin, \"Islam and the Crusades,\" 1995\nIt is strange how the Christians round Mount Lebanon, when they see any Muslim hermits, bring them food and treat them kindly, saying that these men are dedicated to the Great and Glorious God and that they should therefore share with them. Likewise, not one Christian merchant was stopped or hindered in Muslim territories.\nIbn Jubayr, Muslim scholar, traveling to Mecca and Jerusalem, ca. 1185\nThese two passages are best understood in the context of which of the following?\n\nA.

The influence of religion on interaction between cultures\n\nThe passages provided highlight the complex relationship between Christianity and Islam during the Middle Ages. The first passage discusses the Islamic concept of jihad as interpreted by various theorists, emphasizing its role in the expansion of Islam. This perspective shows how religious beliefs can shape political actions and intercultural conflicts.\n\nThe second passage describes an instance of peaceful coexistence and mutual respect between Christians and Muslims, as evidenced by the interactions between Christian communities and Muslim hermits. This example illustrates the influence of shared religious values on cross-cultural cooperation and understanding.\n\nTogether, these passages demonstrate the multifaceted nature of religious influence on interactions between different cultures during this period. They show how religion can both motivate conflict and promote harmony, depending on the specific historical context and interpretations of religious teachings."
