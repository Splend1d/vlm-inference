Quality circles are small groups of employees who voluntarily meet regularly to identify and solve problems related to their workplace. These groups typically include workers from various levels of the organization and are facilitated by a trained leader. The goal of quality circles is to improve the quality of products or services, increase productivity, and enhance employee satisfaction by involving workers in decision-making processes and empowering them to make changes that can benefit the organization."
