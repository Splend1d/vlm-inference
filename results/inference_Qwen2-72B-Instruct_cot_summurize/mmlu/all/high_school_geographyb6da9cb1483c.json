Among the options given:\n\nA. Vietnam - This country has a relict boundary with China that dates back to the 19th century when France colonized Indochina.\n\nB. United Kingdom - The UK has several relict boundaries, such as Hadrian's Wall, which was built by the Romans and marks an early boundary between England and Scotland.\n\nC. Germany - Germany's borders have changed significantly over history, particularly after World War II. The division into East and West Germany until reunification in 1990 is considered a relict boundary due to the Cold War era.\n\nD. Bolivia - While Bolivia has had border disputes and changes throughout its history, it doesn't have a widely recognized relict boundary like the other countries listed. Its current borders are mostly the result of wars and treaties from the 19th and 20th centuries.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be D. Bolivia. However, it's important to note that the concept of a \"relict boundary\" can be somewhat subjective and dependent on historical context."
