Second Agricultural Revolution.\n\nThis period, often referred to as the Industrial Revolution, began in the late 18th century and saw significant changes in agriculture, manufacturing, mining, and transportation. The shift from rural, agrarian societies to urban, industrial ones was driven by technological advancements that increased agricultural productivity, allowing fewer people to produce more food and freeing up labor for work in factories and other industries. This transformation also led to the development of new machinery and methods of production that characterized the Second Agricultural Revolution."
