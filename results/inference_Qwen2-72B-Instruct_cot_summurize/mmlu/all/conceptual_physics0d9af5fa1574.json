Assuming no external forces act on the system (just the two fish), the center of mass of the system will remain unchanged. However, because the big fish has now gained mass, if it was moving before it swallowed the small fish, it would be moving with less velocity to conserve the total momentum of the system (since momentum = mass * velocity).\n\nIf the big fish was at rest before eating the small fish, it would remain at rest after eating the small fish, since there's no net external force acting on it. But its mass would increase.\n\nMomentum is defined as the product of an object's mass and velocity (p=mv). Since the mass of the big fish increases, if its velocity remains the same, its momentum must also increase. If its velocity changes (decreases) to keep the system's total momentum constant, then both its momentum and velocity have changed.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Both\n\nThe speed (and thus the velocity, considering direction as well) of the big fish might change (likely decrease) to conserve the total momentum of the system, and its momentum definitely changes due to the increase in mass."
