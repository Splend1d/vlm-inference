This is because the elements in \\(S\\) are self-pairs, so they satisfy the condition trivially. Hence, \\(S\\) is symmetric.\n\n2. **Anti-symmetry**: A relation \\(S\\) on a set \\(A\\) is said to be anti-symmetric if for all \\(a, b \\in A\\), whenever \\((a, b) \\in S\\) and \\((b, a) \\in S\\), then \\(a = b\\).\n\n   For the given relation \\(S = \\{(1, 1), (2, 2)\\}\\), any pair \\((a, b) \\in S\\) also has \\((b, a) \\in S\\) and indeed \\(a = b\\) for these pairs. Thus, \\(S\\) is anti-symmetric.\n\n3. **Equivalence Relation**: A relation is an equivalence relation if it is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive. Reflexivity means that for every element \\(a \\in A\\), \\((a, a) \\in S\\). Symmetry and transitivity have been defined above.\n\n   The relation \\(S = \\{(1, 1), (2, 2)\\}\\) appears to be reflexive for the elements 1 and 2, but not for 3 since \\((3, 3)\\) is not in \\(S\\). Therefore, \\(S\\) is not an equivalence relation on \\(A\\), as it fails to be reflexive for all elements in \\(A\\).\n\nGiven these analyses:\n\n- \\(S\\) is symmetric.\n- \\(S\\) is anti-symmetric.\n- \\(S\\) is not an equivalence relation due to lack of reflexivity for all elements in \\(A\\).\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\n**C. both symmetric and anti-symmetric**"
