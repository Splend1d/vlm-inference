Uruk, an ancient city in the region of Sumer (modern-day Iraq), is often considered one of the first cities in human history. The estimated population of Uruk during its peak in the Early Dynastic Period (around the mid-4th to early 3rd millennium BCE) was around 10,000 people, making option B correct.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the concept of \"first city\" can be debated, as there were other contemporaneous urban centers in different parts of the world. For instance, \u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck in modern-day Turkey, which dates back to around 7500 BCE, could also be considered one of the earliest urban settlements, although it might not have reached the size or complexity of Uruk.\n\nAs for the other options:\n\nA. Nagada is not typically listed as one of the first cities. It refers to a predynastic culture in Egypt, but the term does not specifically denote a city.\nC. Knossos was an important city on the island of Crete during the Minoan civilization, but it developed much later than Uruk.\nD. Giza is known for its pyramids and was part of ancient Egypt, but it was not a major city until much later periods, and the population figures you've provided are not historically accurate for the time when the pyramids were built."
