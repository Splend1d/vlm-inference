The dominant allele B codes for black fur, the recessive allele b codes for brown hair. A second gene consisting of two alleles, E and e, codes for the deposition of pigment in the hair. In this case, the alleles for pigment deposition (E or e) are said to be epistatic to the gene that codes for black or brown pigment. If the dominant allele (E) is not present, regardless of the genotype at the black/brown locus, the animal's fur will be yellow.\n\nA. BBEe will be brown.\nB. BbEe will be brown.\nC.

BBee will be yellow.\n\nHere's why:\n\nIn this scenario, the presence of the dominant allele E is necessary for the expression of either black (B) or brown (b) coat color. Without the E allele, the fur color defaults to yellow, regardless of the genotype at the B/b locus.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. BBEe: With the presence of the E allele, the genotype BBEe would express the black coat color because B is dominant over b.\n\nB. BbEe: Again, with the presence of the E allele, the genotype BbEe would also express the black coat color since B is present and dominant.\n\nC. Bbee: Here, the E allele is absent (ee), but because B is present, the fur would normally be black if not for the absence of E. However, due to the absence of E, the fur color will default to yellow, not brown.\n\nD. BBee: Similarly, the absence of the E allele means that even though BB is present, which would normally result in black fur, the fur color will instead default to yellow. Therefore, BBee will be yellow."
