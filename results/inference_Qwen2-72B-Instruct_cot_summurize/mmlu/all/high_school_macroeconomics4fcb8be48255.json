This increases the demand for money as people require more cash on hand to facilitate transactions.\n\nC. higher interest rates: Higher interest rates can lead to an increase in the demand for money because borrowing becomes more expensive. People and businesses might prefer to hold onto their cash rather than borrow at high interest rates. Additionally, if interest rates on savings accounts or other liquid assets increase, people might want to hold more money in these accounts to earn higher returns.\n\nD. expected future inflation: If people expect prices to rise in the future (inflation), they may demand more money now to make purchases before prices go up further. This is known as \"inflationary expectations.\"\n\nA recession typically leads to a decrease in the demand for money as spending decreases and people hoard cash, but it's not directly listed as one of the reasons that would increase the demand for money. However, the relationship between recessions and money demand can be complex, and in some cases, such as during times of economic uncertainty, the demand for money can increase as people become more cautious with their spending and investment activities."
