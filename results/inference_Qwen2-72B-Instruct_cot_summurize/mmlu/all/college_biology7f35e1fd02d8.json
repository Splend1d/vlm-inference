                    "text": "The cross involves two traits: height (dominant tall D, recessive dwarf d) and flower color (dominant violet W, recessive white w). The parental genotypes are DDWw (tall violet) and ddww (dwarf white).\n\nFor height, the cross is DD x dd. Since DD is homozygous dominant, all offspring will inherit at least one D allele and thus will be tall.\n\nFor flower color, the cross is Ww x ww. Half of the offspring will inherit the W allele and half will inherit the w allele.\n\nThus, the expected phenotypic ratio of the progeny is:\n\nAll tall, with half being violet (Ww) and half being white (ww).\n\nSo the answer is A. All tall violet and white, but since the question seems to imply a simple ratio and choice A doesn't differentiate between violet and white, the most accurate choice given is:\n\nD. 1 tall violet: 1 tall white\n\nThis reflects that all offspring will be tall, but half will be violet and half will be white."
