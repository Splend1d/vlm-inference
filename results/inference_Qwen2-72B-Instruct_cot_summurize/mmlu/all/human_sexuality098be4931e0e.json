Engaging in homosexual acts is considered a sin because they view such acts as going against the natural law and God's plan for human sexuality, which is intended for procreation within the context of marriage between one man and one woman.\n\nB. Engaging in heterosexual acts outside of marriage (fornication) is also considered a sin for similar reasons as above. Sexual activity is meant to be reserved for the sacrament of marriage.\n\nC. Using artificial contraception, including the birth control pill, is considered a sin because the Church believes that sex should always be open to the possibility of procreation, and artificial contraception separates the unitive and procreative aspects of sexual intercourse.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer would be D. all of the above.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the Church does not condemn people but rather certain actions or behaviors. It teaches that every person has inherent dignity and should be treated with respect and love, regardless of their actions. The Church encourages individuals to seek forgiveness and to follow its teachings."
