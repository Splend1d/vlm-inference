No, technological and institutional innovations have permitted food supplies to more than keep pace with population growth.\nB. Yes, it is only because of widespread famines that population has not overwhelmed food supplies altogether.\nC. No, but it is only because of the introduction of genetically modified food that supplies have kept pace with population growth.\nD. No, but supplies are not likely to keep pace with population growth over the next 10 years.\n"

No, technological and institutional innovations have permitted food supplies to more than keep pace with population growth.\n\nWhile Thomas Robert Malthus's predictions in his 1798 essay \"An Essay on the Principle of Population\" suggested that population would grow geometrically while food production would grow arithmetically, leading to inevitable shortages, this has not proven true in the long term. Advances in agricultural technology, such as the Green Revolution, improvements in farming techniques, and better distribution systems have allowed food production to increase at rates sufficient to feed an expanding global population. However, this does not mean that there are no areas of concern or that everyone has access to adequate food; issues of inequality, poverty, and environmental sustainability still pose significant challenges."
