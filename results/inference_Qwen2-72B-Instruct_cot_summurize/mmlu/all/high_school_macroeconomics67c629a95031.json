This occurs when banks lend out a portion of their deposits, keeping only a fraction (the reserve requirement) on hand. When the reserve requirement is 20%, it means that for every dollar deposited, the bank must keep 20 cents in reserve and can lend out the remaining 80 cents.\n\nThe formula to calculate the total money created through this process is:\n\nTotal Money Created = Initial Deposit * (1 / Reserve Ratio)\n\nIn this case, the initial deposit is $1000 and the reserve ratio is 20% or 0.20. Plugging these values into the formula gives:\n\nTotal Money Created = $1000 * (1 / 0.20)\n                     = $1000 * 5\n                     = $5000\n\nSo, if the reserve requirement is 20% and assuming no excess reserves are held, the banking system could potentially create up to $5000 in new loans from an initial deposit of $1000.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. $5,000."
