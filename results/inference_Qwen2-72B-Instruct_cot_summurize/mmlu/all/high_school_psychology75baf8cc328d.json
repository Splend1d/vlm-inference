The collective unconscious refers to a part of the unconscious mind that is derived from ancestral memory and experience and is common to all humankind. Archetypes are universal, symbolic patterns or images that are found in the collective unconscious. Individuation is the process by which an individual becomes fully conscious of their unique identity, integrating both the conscious and unconscious aspects of the psyche."
