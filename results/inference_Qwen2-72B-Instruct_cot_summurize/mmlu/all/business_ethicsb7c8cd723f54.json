Insolvency typically occurs when a company's debts exceed the value of its assets and it is unable to pay its debts as they come due. This can happen even if the company has positive working capital or is making a profit, although those factors can certainly contribute to financial distress. Making a loss can also lead to insolvency if the losses are significant enough to erode the company's equity over time. However, the key indicator of insolvency is the inability to meet debt obligations even after liquidating assets."
