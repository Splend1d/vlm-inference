However, generally speaking, Apple has offered iMacs in various colors over the years, including tangerine, strawberry, kiwi, and grape. \n\nHowever, there have been some models where certain colors were not available. For example, the original 1998 iMac was available in a range of colors, but grape was not one of them. Similarly, more recent models of the iMac have only been available in silver or space gray.\n\nSo, without more context, it's impossible to say definitively which color is not available for the iMac. But if we're assuming that you're asking about the original 1998 iMac, then the answer would be D. Grape."
