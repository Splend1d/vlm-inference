Dangers and difficulties, instead of deterring, seemed to have a charm in his eyes.\u2026 He conceived, at the first moment of his landing in Mexico, the design of its conquest. When he saw the strength of its civilization, he was not turned from his purpose.\u2026 This spirit of knight-errantry might lead us to undervalue his talents as a general, and to regard him merely in the light of a lucky adventurer. But this would be doing him injustice; for Cortes was certainly a great general, if that man be one, who performs great achievements with the resources which his own genius has created. There is probably no instance in history, where so vast an enterprise has been achieved by means apparently so inadequate.\u2026 He brought together the most miscellaneous collection of mercenaries who ever fought under one standard: adventurers from Cuba and the Isles, craving for gold; hidalgos, who came from the old country to win laurels; \u2026 wild tribes of the natives from all parts of the country, who had been sworn enemies from their cradles, and who had met only to cut one another's throats, and to procure victims for sacrifice; men, in short, differing in race, in language, and in interests, with scarcely anything in common among them. Yet this motley congregation was assembled in one camp, compelled to bend to the will of one man, to consort together in harmony, to breathe, as it were, one spirit, and to move on a common principle of action!\n\u2014William Hickling Prescott, History of the Conquest of Mexico, 1843\nAs Prescott makes clear in the passage above, an important reason for Cortes's military success was which of the following?\n\nA. The advantage of superior numbers\nB. The superior military skill of mercenaries\nC. Taking advantage of divisions among the Indians\nD. Effective use of European artillery\n"

                    "text": "The passage does not mention that Cortes had superior numbers (A), nor does it emphasize the role of European artillery (D). While the skill of mercenaries may have played a part (B), Prescott highlights something else as being crucial to Cortes's success. According to Prescott, Cortes was able to bring together a diverse group of individuals \"differing in race, in language, and in interests\" and unite them under his command. He compelled these various groups to work together harmoniously and towards a common goal. This suggests that an important reason for Cortes's success was his ability to take advantage of divisions among the Indians (C), rallying different native tribes against a common enemy, thereby weakening the overall resistance they faced.\n\nHowever, the exact phrasing of the correct answer choice is not provided among the options given. Based on the information in the passage, the closest match to what Prescott emphasizes would be:\n\nC. Taking advantage of divisions among the Indians\n\nThis interpretation assumes that the phrase \"taking advantage of divisions among the Indians\" encompasses not just exploiting existing divisions but also creating a unified force from previously divided groups, which is what Prescott describes."
