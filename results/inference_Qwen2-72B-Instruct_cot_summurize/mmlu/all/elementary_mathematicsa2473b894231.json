The difference between these two rates is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Difference} = 120 - 50 = 70 \\, \\text{beats per minute} \\]\n\nFor every minute she exercises, her heart rate increases by 5 beats per minute. To find out how many minutes it takes for her heart rate to increase by 70 beats per minute, we divide the difference by the rate of increase:\n\n\\[ \\text{Time} = \\frac{\\text{Difference}}{\\text{Rate of Increase}} = \\frac{70}{5} = 14 \\, \\text{minutes} \\]\n\nTherefore, it will take Trish 14 minutes to reach a heart rate of 120 beats per minute.\n\nThe correct answer is B. 14 minutes."
