Decreasing the partial pressure gradient of the gas would decrease the driving force for diffusion, slowing down the rate of gas exchange.\nB. Decreasing the solubility of the gas in water would also decrease the rate of diffusion because less gas would dissolve into the liquid lining of the alveoli and the plasma of the blood.\nC. Increasing the total surface area available for diffusion would increase the rate of gas exchange because more molecules of the gas could simultaneously cross the respiratory membrane.\nD. Decreasing the rate of blood flow through the pulmonary capillary would decrease the rate of gas exchange because less blood would be available to pick up the gas that diffuses across the respiratory membrane."
