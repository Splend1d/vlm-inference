The altitude of the NCP is the same as your latitude.\n\nExplanation: The North Celestial Pole (NCP) appears to be stationary in the night sky and marks the direction of Earth's axis of rotation. The angle between the NCP and the horizon, which is its altitude, is equal to the observer's latitude. Therefore, if you know the altitude of the NCP, you can determine your latitude. For example, if the NCP has an altitude of 45 degrees, then the observer is at 45 degrees north latitude."
