How nuclear attacks are identified and responded to; who controls the weapons\n\nBureaucratic politics theory emphasizes the role of internal bureaucratic processes in shaping foreign policy decisions. In the context of nuclear weapons, this perspective would suggest that we should be concerned about how decisions regarding the use of nuclear weapons are made within government bureaucracies, who has control over these weapons, and how potential nuclear attacks are identified and responded to. This is because miscommunications, bureaucratic infighting, or accidents could lead to unintended nuclear escalation or conflict."
