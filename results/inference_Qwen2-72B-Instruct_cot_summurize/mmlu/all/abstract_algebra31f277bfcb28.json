According to the properties of group homomorphisms, if \\(f: G \\rightarrow H\\) is a homomorphism from group \\(G\\) to group \\(H\\), then the image of \\(G\\) under \\(f\\), denoted as \\(f(G)\\), is a subgroup of \\(H\\). By Lagrange's theorem, the order (number of elements) of any subgroup of \\(H\\) must divide the order of \\(H\\). If \\(G\\) has 6 elements and we consider its image under a homomorphism, the number of elements in \\(f(G)\\) must be a divisor of 6 (which are 1, 2, 3, and 6). It cannot possibly be 12 because 12 does not divide 6.\n\n**Statement 2:** \"There is a homomorphism of some group of 6 elements into some group of 12 elements.\"\n\nThis statement is true. A homomorphism from a group of 6 elements into a group of 12 elements can exist. For example, consider \\(G = \\mathbb{Z}_6\\) (the cyclic group of order 6) and \\(H = \\mathbb{Z}_{12}\\) (the cyclic group of order 12). We can define a homomorphism \\(f: G \\rightarrow H\\) by \\(f(x) = 2x\\) for all \\(x \\in G\\). This mapping preserves the group operation (addition modulo 6 in \\(G\\) and addition modulo 12 in \\(H\\)) and maps \\(G\\) into \\(H\\).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **D. False, True**."
