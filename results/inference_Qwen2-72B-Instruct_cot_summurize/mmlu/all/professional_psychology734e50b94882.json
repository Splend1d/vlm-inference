In other words, there's a 1% chance of getting these results by random chance alone, assuming the null hypothesis is true. This is also known as the p-value, and in this case, it indicates strong evidence against the null hypothesis because the p-value is very low. The 1% chance refers to the Type I error rate, which is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true."
