In the context of Cop\u00e1n, studies have shown that many of the individuals buried there, including some of the rulers, had strontium isotope ratios that were inconsistent with local values, suggesting that they came from other parts of the Maya world or beyond. This finding supports the idea that the rulers of Cop\u00e1n were often foreigners from different regions across much of the Maya territory."
