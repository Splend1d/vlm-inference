Not wrong, Wrong\n\nIn Scenario 1, throwing a piece of bread at a bird might not be the best way to feed it, but it's generally not considered morally wrong according to ordinary standards unless the action causes harm or distress to the bird. However, feeding wild animals is sometimes discouraged because it can alter their natural eating habits and lead to dependency on human-provided food, which can have negative long-term effects on the animal population.\n\nIn Scenario 2, giving your son prescription medication without consulting a doctor first is generally considered morally wrong and potentially illegal. Prescription medications are typically prescribed based on specific medical conditions and dosages determined by a healthcare professional. Giving someone else's medication to another person could result in serious health complications and is against medical advice and legal regulations."
