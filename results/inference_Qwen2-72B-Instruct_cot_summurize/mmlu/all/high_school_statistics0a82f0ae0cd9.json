Since both sets have an odd number of elements (7), the median will be the fourth element in the ordered list.\n   - For set X: Median = 50\n   - For set Y: Median = 50\n   - This statement is true.\n\nB. **The sets have identical means.**\n   - To find the mean, we sum all the numbers in the set and divide by the number of elements.\n   - For set X: Mean = (10 + 30 + 45 + 50 + 55 + 70 + 90) / 7 = 350 / 7 = 50\n   - For set Y: Mean = (10 + 30 + 35 + 50 + 65 + 70 + 90) / 7 = 350 / 7 = 50\n   - This statement is also true.\n\nC. **The sets have identical ranges.**\n   - The range of a set is the difference between the highest and lowest values.\n   - For set X: Range = 90 - 10 = 80\n   - For set Y: Range = 90 - 10 = 80\n   - This statement is true as well.\n\nGiven that all three statements A, B, and C are true, the correct answer is:\n\nD. **None of the above are false.**"
