It relies heavily on employee involvement at all levels, as well as continuous improvement, to achieve high levels of quality and customer satisfaction. When employees feel disconnected from the decision-making process or do not have a say in how their work is performed, they may become disengaged and less committed to the TQM principles, leading to its failure.\n\nWhile the other options can also contribute to TQM's failure, insufficient employee involvement in decision-making is particularly detrimental because it undermines one of the core tenets of TQM: that everyone in the organization has a role to play in achieving and maintaining high quality standards. Without active participation and input from all employees, the organization may miss out on valuable insights and innovations that could improve processes and products."
