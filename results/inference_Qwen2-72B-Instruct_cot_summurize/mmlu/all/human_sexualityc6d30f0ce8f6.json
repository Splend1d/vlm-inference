Infections: Certain infections, such as sexually transmitted infections (STIs) or yeast infections, can cause coital pain in both men and women. For example, conditions like chlamydia, gonorrhea, herpes, or bacterial vaginosis can lead to inflammation, sores, or other irritations that make intercourse painful.\n\nC. Vaginismus: This is a condition characterized by involuntary spasms of the muscles of the vaginal wall, which can make penetration painful or impossible. While vaginismus directly affects women, it can also cause distress and discomfort for their male partners due to the physical resistance encountered during intercourse, potentially leading to erectile dysfunction or performance anxiety in some cases. \n\nB. Foreskin too tight (phimosis) can cause pain specifically for men during intercourse because it restricts the movement of the foreskin over the glans penis. However, it does not typically cause direct pain for women during intercourse. Therefore, it is not included in the answer since the question asks about causes of pain for both men and women."
