                    "text": "When an atom emits an alpha particle, it undergoes alpha decay, which results in the formation of a new nucleus with an atomic number that is 2 less and a mass number that is 4 less than the original nucleus. This means the atom becomes an atom of a different element (option A). For example, when uranium-238 decays by alpha emission, it forms thorium-234.\n\nWhen an atom emits a beta particle, it undergoes beta decay, which can take two forms: beta-minus decay and beta-plus decay (also known as positron emission). In beta-minus decay, a neutron is converted into a proton, an electron (beta particle), and an antineutrino. The emitted electron escapes from the nucleus, and the result is a new nucleus with an atomic number that is 1 greater but the same mass number. This also means the atom becomes an atom of a different element (option A). For example, when carbon-14 decays by beta-minus emission, it forms nitrogen-14.\n\nIn beta-plus decay (positron emission), a proton is converted into a neutron, a positron (the antiparticle of an electron), and a neutrino. The emitted positron escapes from the nucleus, and the result is a new nucleus with an atomic number that is 1 less but the same mass number. Again, this means the atom becomes an atom of a different element (option A). For example, when oxygen-15 decays by positron emission, it forms nitrogen-15.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer to your question is:\n\nA. becomes an atom of a different element always."
