March has 31 days, which means:\n\n- March 1: Wednesday\n- March 2: Thursday\n- March 3: Friday\n- March 4: Saturday\n- March 5: Sunday\n- March 6: Monday\n- March 7: Tuesday\n\nAnd so on until the end of March.\n\nTo find the day of the week for April 1st, we need to count forward from the last day of March, which is a Friday (since March 31 is a Thursday).\n\nThus, April 1st will be the following day, which is a Saturday.\n\nThe answer is D. Saturday."
