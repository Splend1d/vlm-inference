She plays field hockey and has noticed she coughs when running up and down the field. The cough is nonproductive and resolves with rest. She has not had chest pain or palpitations. She takes no medications and does not smoke. Her sister has asthma. The patient appears well. Her pulse is 68/min, respirations are 16/min, and blood pressure is 100/75 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 99%. Cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities. An x-ray of the chest shows no abnormalities. Spirometry shows an FEV1:FVC ratio of 90% and an FEV1 of 90% of predicted. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\n\nA. Asthma\nB. Chronic bronchitis\nC. Gastroesophageal reflux disease\nD. Postnasal drip syndrome\n"

The patient's symptoms of exercise-induced cough and nasal congestion, which resolve with rest, along with her family history of asthma, suggest that she may have exercise-induced asthma. The normal findings on physical examination and chest x-ray, as well as the normal spirometry results, also support this diagnosis over other possibilities such as chronic bronchitis or gastroesophageal reflux disease. Postnasal drip syndrome could be a contributing factor to her symptoms but the exercise-induced cough and family history of asthma makes asthma more likely."
