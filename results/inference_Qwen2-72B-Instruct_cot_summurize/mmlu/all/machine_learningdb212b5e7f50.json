False, True\n\nL1 regularization tends to make models more sparse than L2 regularization because it can shrink coefficients to exactly zero, whereas L2 regularization shrinks them closer to zero but not exactly to zero. Thus, the first statement is false.\n\nResidual connections can indeed be found in both ResNets and Transformers. In ResNets, they help to address the vanishing gradient problem by allowing gradients to flow through the network more easily. In Transformers, residual connections are used around the sub-layers (such as the self-attention mechanism and the feed-forward networks) to improve model performance. Therefore, the second statement is true."
