The summons and complaint were served at the stockbroker's office in State B, where the process server handed the documents to the stockbroker's administrative assistant. The stockbroker has answered the complaint, asserting the defense of improper service of process. Assume that both states' requirements for service of process are identical to the requirements of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Is the court likely to dismiss the action for improper service of process?\n\nA. No, because service was made on a person of suitable age found at the stockbroker's place of employment.\nB. No, because the stockbroker waived her claim for improper service of process by asserting it in her answer.\nC. Yes, because an individual defendant may not be served by delivering process to a third party found at the defendant's place of employment.\nD. Yes, because the process of State A courts is not effective in State B.\n"

No, because service was made on a person of suitable age found at the stockbroker's place of employment.\n\nUnder the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 4(e)(2), service can be made on an individual by \"leaving a copy of the summons and of the complaint at the individual\u2019s dwelling house or usual place of abode with someone of suitable age and discretion who resides there; or ... leaving a copy of each at the individual\u2019s workplace with someone of suitable age and discretion.\" Since the administrative assistant is a person of suitable age and discretion at the stockbroker's place of employment, the service is considered proper under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n\nB is incorrect because the stockbroker did not waive the defense by asserting it in their answer. In fact, by doing so, they preserved the defense.\n\nC is incorrect because the service to a third party at the defendant's place of employment is allowed under certain conditions as outlined in Rule 4(e)(2).\n\nD is incorrect because the question assumes that both states' requirements for service of process are identical to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which means that the service is valid regardless of the state where it occurred."
