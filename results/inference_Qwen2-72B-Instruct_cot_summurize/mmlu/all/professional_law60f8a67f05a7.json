After missing two practices, the football player was dropped from the team by the head football coach. Following his dismissal, the football player met with the coach and asked if he could rejoin the team. The coach said that the football player was despised by the other players and under no circumstances could he return to the team. As the football player was leaving the coach's office, feeling very dejected, the coach then said to him, \"Hope you decide to transfer, because everybody hates your guts around here. \"Later that same evening, the football player wrote a suicide note in which he stated, \"The coach is responsible for my despondency. If I can't play football, I don't want to live. \" After swallowing a bottle of Quaalude barbiturates, the football player fell unconscious in his dormitory room. Moments later, the football player's roommate entered the room and saw his limp body on the floor. The roommate read the suicide note and then attempted to administer aid. Failing to revive him, the roommate picked up the football player and carried him to the college's first aid center. The football player received prompt medical attention and soon recovered from his drug overdose. If the football player asserts a claim against the coach based on intentional infliction of emotional distress, the football player will most likely\n\nA. prevail, because the coach intended to cause him to suffer emotional distress.\nB. prevail, because the coach's remark did, in fact, cause the football player to suffer emotional distress.\nC. not prevail, because the football player's drug overdose resulted from his own voluntary act.\nD. not prevail, because the coach acted reasonably under the circumstances, since everyone on the team hated the football player.\n"

While the coach's words were harsh and may have contributed to the football player's emotional state, they do not necessarily meet the legal standard of being extreme and outrageous. Additionally, the football player's decision to overdose on drugs was his own action, and while it may have been influenced by the coach's words, it cannot be directly attributed to the coach. Therefore, the football player is unlikely to prevail in an IIED claim against the coach."
