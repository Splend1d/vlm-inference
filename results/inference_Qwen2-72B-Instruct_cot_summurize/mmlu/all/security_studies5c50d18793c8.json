All of these options.\n\nThe preoccupation with human rights significantly influences the human rights-oriented school of liberalism in multiple ways:\n\nA. Modern human rights oriented liberalism is indeed concerned with self-determination. This means that individuals and groups should have the right to make their own choices about how they live, what they believe, and how they govern themselves. This includes the right to participate in free and fair elections and to be governed by laws that they have consented to.\n\nB. In cases where conflict and bloodshed seem inevitable without it, human rights orientated liberalism may indeed advocate for separatism. This is based on the belief that people have the right to live in peace and security, and that this sometimes requires the creation of separate states or territories where different groups can govern themselves according to their own values and traditions.\n\nC. Human rights orientated liberalism is particularly focused on protecting the rights of persons who are subject to various forms of persecution, discrimination, or deprivation. This includes not only political persecution but also economic, sexual, gender, and religious persecution. The liberal human rights agenda seeks to protect these individuals from harm and ensure that they have equal access to justice, education, healthcare, and other basic necessities.\n\nOverall, the preoccupation with human rights is central to the human rights-oriented school of liberalism, influencing its views on self-determination, separatism, and the protection of vulnerable populations."
