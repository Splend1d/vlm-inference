Transnational crime developed as a result of the declining expenditure on defence and the standing down of armies, which reduced the risk of activities.\nB. TNC as a concept emerged in the academic sphere as linked to human security concerns and developmental opportunities in weak states as a means of conflict resolution and peace building in Europe.\nC. Transnational criminal activities have always been a feature of the international system. In the policy community, the growth of interest in TNC is due to the increasing sophistication of intelligence and communications technology, which has enabled the true representation of the scale and the scope of the problem to be known.\nD. International trends such as globalization may have had the unintentional consequence of opening up new spaces for the development of transnational crime.\n"

                    "text": "The expansion of transnational crime (TNC) in the 1990s can be attributed to multiple factors. Here's an analysis of each of the factors you've mentioned:\n\nA. While it's true that declining defence expenditures and the standing down of armies might have indirectly contributed to the rise of TNC by reducing state capacity to monitor and control borders and territories, this factor alone does not fully explain the phenomenon. The reduction in military spending was often associated with the end of the Cold War and the reallocation of resources, but it doesn't directly correlate with an increase in criminal activities.\n\nB. The emergence of TNC as a concept in academia and its link to human security and weak states is more about how TNC came to be recognized and addressed rather than a cause of its expansion. Weak states with porous borders and corrupt institutions do provide fertile ground for TNC, but this recognition did not necessarily drive the expansion of TNC itself.\n\nC. This statement acknowledges that TNC has been a part of the international system for a long time but emphasizes that the growing interest in TNC within the policy community is due to advancements in intelligence and communications technology. This enhanced ability to gather and analyze information indeed played a role in revealing the extent of TNC, but it did not cause the expansion of TNC. Rather, it helped expose what was already happening on a larger scale.\n\nD. International trends such as globalization, including the liberalization of trade, increased mobility of people, and technological advancements, are key factors that enabled the expansion of TNC in the 1990s. Globalization created new opportunities for criminals to operate across borders, exploit regulatory gaps, and move illicit goods and money more efficiently. This factor is widely accepted as one of the main drivers behind the growth of TNC during that period.\n\nIn summary, while all these factors play a role in understanding the context of TNC, option D\u2014international trends such as globalization\u2014most directly explains the expansion of TNC in the 1990s. The interconnectedness of the world economy and societies facilitated the spread of criminal networks and activities across national boundaries."
