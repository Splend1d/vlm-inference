This cube has side length $2$ (from $-1$ to $1$), and therefore its volume is $2^3 = 8$.\n\nThe condition $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \\le 1$ describes the interior of a sphere centered at the origin with radius $1$. The volume of this sphere can be calculated using the formula for the volume of a sphere, which is $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3$. Since the radius of the sphere is $1$, its volume is $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi(1)^3 = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi$.\n\nTo find the probability that a randomly selected point from the cube also lies inside the sphere, we need to divide the volume of the sphere by the volume of the cube:\n\n\\[P = \\frac{\\text{Volume of sphere}}{\\text{Volume of cube}} = \\frac{\\frac{4}{3}\\pi}{8} = \\frac{\\pi}{6}\\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. $\\boxed{\\frac{\\pi}{6}}$."
