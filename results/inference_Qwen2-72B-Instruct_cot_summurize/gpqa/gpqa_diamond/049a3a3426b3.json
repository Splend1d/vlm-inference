                    "text": "The first reaction is a cyanohydrin formation which occurs when an aldehyde or ketone reacts with hydrogen cyanide (HCN) in the presence of a base. The base protonates the cyanide ion to form the more reactive species HCN. Here, NaCN is already present and butan-2-one (a ketone) is reacting to form a cyanohydrin. The base required for this reaction could be water (H2O), as it can protonate CN- to form HCN, which then adds to the carbonyl group. However, none of the options provided include water as a base, so we must consider the role of other reagents.\n\nOption A includes NaHSO3, which can act as a reducing agent but does not serve as a suitable base for this reaction. Option C also includes H3O+ which would protonate the CN- ion, but the presence of H3O+ suggests acidic conditions that might not favor the retention of the nitrile group.\n\nThe second reaction involves converting a nitrile into a carboxylic acid, which typically requires strong acid conditions such as hydrochloric acid (HCl) or sulfuric acid (H2SO4). The nitrile group is hydrolyzed under these conditions to form the corresponding carboxylic acid.\n\nConsidering both reactions:\n1. For the first reaction, we need a proton source to convert CN- to HCN for the addition to the carbonyl group. Water (H2O) is usually sufficient, but it's not listed among the reagents. H3O+ from option B or C can serve as a proton source.\n2. For the second reaction, we need a strong acid to hydrolyze the nitrile group into a carboxylic acid. HCl (option B or D) can perform this function.\n\nBetween options B and C, B is the correct choice because it provides HCl for the second reaction, which is necessary for the hydrolysis of the nitrile group to a carboxylic acid. Additionally, the presence of H3O+ in option B can help facilitate the first reaction by protonating the cyanide ion.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**B. A = H3O+, B = HCl**"
