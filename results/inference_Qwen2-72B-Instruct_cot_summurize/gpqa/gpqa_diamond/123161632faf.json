A = 2-methyl-1-phenylbutan-1-one, B = 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-1-phenylbutan-1-one, C = 2,2,2-tris(4-methoxyphenyl)-1-phenylethan-1-one.\n\nIn a Pinacol rearrangement, the hydroxyl group and the adjacent carbon (with its substituents) switch places. The product will have a carbonyl group at the site of the former hydroxyl group, and the substituent that was originally on the carbon adjacent to the hydroxyl group will now be attached to the carbon where the hydroxyl group used to be.\n\nLet's look at each compound:\n\nA. In 3-methyl-4-phenylhexane-3,4-diol, the methyl and phenyl groups will switch places with the hydroxyl groups. So, the hydroxyl group on the 3rd carbon will move to the 4th carbon along with the phenyl group, leaving the methyl group on the 3rd carbon. This results in 2-methyl-1-phenylbutan-1-one.\n\nB. In 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-phenylpentane-2,3-diol, the phenyl and 4-hydroxyphenyl groups will switch places with the hydroxyl groups. The hydroxyl group on the 3rd carbon will move to the 2nd carbon along with the phenyl group, leaving the 4-hydroxyphenyl group on the 3rd carbon. This results in 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-1-phenylbutan-1-one.\n\nC. In 1,1,2-tris(4-methoxyphenyl)-2-phenylethane-1,2-diol, the phenyl and two 4-methoxyphenyl groups will switch places with the hydroxyl groups. The hydroxyl group on the 1st carbon will move to the 2nd carbon along with the phenyl group, leaving the two 4-methoxyphenyl groups on the 1st carbon. This results in 2,2,2-tris(4-methoxyphenyl)-1-phenylethan-1-one."
