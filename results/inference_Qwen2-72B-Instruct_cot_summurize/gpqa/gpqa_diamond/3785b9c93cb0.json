                    "text": "The presence of the cavity does not affect the electric field outside the conductor because of the principle of electrostatic shielding. This principle states that no electric field lines can penetrate a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium, and thus any charges inside a cavity do not affect the electric field outside the conductor.\n\nWhen a small amount of positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, it induces an equal amount of negative charge $-q$ on the inner surface of the conductor directly opposite to the charge. This induced charge will be distributed in such a way that the electric field inside the conductor is zero. As a result, the total charge enclosed within a Gaussian surface drawn around the conductor is zero (the $+q$ inside the cavity and the $-q$ on the inner surface cancel each other out).\n\nHowever, this does not mean that there is no electric field outside the conductor. The induced charge $-q$ on the inner surface will induce an equal but opposite charge $+q$ on the outer surface of the conductor. This charge $+q$ on the outer surface will create an electric field outside the conductor as if the charge was located at the center of the conductor due to the spherical symmetry.\n\nTherefore, the electric field at any point outside the conductor, including point P, will be as if the charge $+q$ is located at the center of the conductor. Thus, we can calculate the electric field using Coulomb's law with the distance $L$ from the center of the conductor to point P:\n\n\\[ E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_0} \\dfrac{q}{L^2} \\]\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nA. $E = \\dfrac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_0} \\dfrac{q}{L^2}$"
