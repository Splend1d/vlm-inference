The star has a mass of 1.5 times that of the Sun, a radius 1.2 times that of the Sun, and an effective temperature (Teff) of 6300 K. Planet1 has a mass equivalent to 7 Earth masses and a radius 1.7 times that of Earth, while Planet2 has a mass equivalent to 5 Earth masses and a radius 1.3 times that of Earth. Interestingly, both planets are in circular orbits. Planet1 induces a periodic shift of up to 0.03 \u00c5 in the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 \u00c5, while the gravitational impact of Planet2 on the same line results in a periodic Doppler shift of up to 0.04 \u00c5. Assuming that both planets possess the same albedo, what is the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2?\n\nA. ~ 0.53\nB. ~ 0.98\nC. ~ 1.05\nD. ~ 1.30\n"

                    "text": "To find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, we can use the formula for the equilibrium temperature of a planet, assuming it has no atmosphere and receives all its energy from the star. This formula is:\n\n\\[ T_{eq} = \\left( \\frac{L}{16\\pi\\sigma D^2} \\right)^{1/4} \\]\n\nwhere \\(T_{eq}\\) is the equilibrium temperature, \\(L\\) is the luminosity of the star, \\(\\sigma\\) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and \\(D\\) is the distance of the planet from the star.\n\nGiven that the two planets have the same albedo and the star's properties are known, we can assume that the only variable affecting the equilibrium temperature is the distance from the star (\\(D\\)). Thus, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures will be directly related to the ratio of their distances from the star raised to the power of -1/4.\n\nFirst, we need to determine the semi-major axes of the planets' orbits. We know that the radial velocity (RV) method gives us information about the gravitational pull of the planets on the star. The amplitude of the RV curve (\\(\\Delta V\\)) is proportional to the planet-to-star mass ratio and inversely proportional to the square root of the semi-major axis (\\(a\\)) of the planet's orbit:\n\n\\[ \\Delta V \\propto \\frac{M_p}{M_s} \\times \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a}} \\]\n\nGiven that the star has a mass of \\(1.5 M_\\odot\\) and the induced RV shifts are \\(0.03 \\AA\\) for Planet1 and \\(0.04 \\AA\\) for Planet2, we can set up the ratios of the induced shifts to solve for the ratio of the semi-major axes:\n\n\\[ \\frac{\\Delta V_1}{\\Delta V_2} = \\frac{M_{p1}/M_s \\times 1/\\sqrt{a_1}}{M_{p2}/M_s \\times 1/\\sqrt{a_2}} \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{0.03}{0.04} = \\frac{7 M_\\oplus / 1.5 M_\\odot \\times 1/\\sqrt{a_1}}{5 M_\\oplus / 1.5 M_\\odot \\times 1/\\sqrt{a_2}} \\]\n\nSimplifying this equation by canceling out common terms:\n\n\\[ \\frac{0.03}{0.04} = \\frac{7/\\sqrt{a_1}}{5/\\sqrt{a_2}} \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{7\\sqrt{a_2}}{5\\sqrt{a_1}} \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{15\\sqrt{a_1}}{28} = \\sqrt{a_2} \\]\n\n\\[ \\left(\\frac{15\\sqrt{a_1}}{28}\\right)^2 = a_2 \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \\left(\\frac{28}{15}\\right)^2 \\]\n\nThe ratio of the semi-major axes is \\(\\left(\\frac{28}{15}\\right)^2\\). Now, let's find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures:\n\n\\[ \\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\left(\\frac{a_2}{a_1}\\right)^{1/4} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\left(\\left(\\frac{15}{28}\\right)^2\\right)^{1/4} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\left(\\frac{15}{28}\\right)^{1/2} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\left(\\frac{15}{28}\\right)^{1/2} \\approx 0.98 \\]\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. ~ 0.98. However, please note that the calculation assumes that the relationship between the induced RV shifts and the semi-major axes is direct and that other factors such as eccentricity do not significantly affect the outcome, which may not always be the case in real-world scenarios."
