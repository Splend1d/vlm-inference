The potential energy between one pair of charges is:\n\nU_pair = k * (2e * 2e) / 2 m\n\nNow, since there are 12 such pairs, the total potential energy of the system is:\n\nU_total = 12 * U_pair\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\nU_total = 12 * (8.9875 \u00d7 10^9 N\u00b7m\u00b2/C\u00b2) * (2e * 2e) / 2 m\n\nNote that e = 1.602 \u00d7 10^-19 C\n\nU_total = 12 * (8.9875 \u00d7 10^9 N\u00b7m\u00b2/C\u00b2) * (2 * 1.602 \u00d7 10^-19 C * 2 * 1.602 \u00d7 10^-19 C) / 2 m\n\nU_total = 12 * (8.9875 \u00d7 10^9 N\u00b7m\u00b2/C\u00b2) * (1.024 \u00d7 10^-37 C\u00b2) / 2 m\n\nU_total = 12 * (4.602 \u00d7 10^-28 J)\n\nU_total = 5.522 \u00d7 10^-27 J\n\nRounding off to three decimal places, the answer is approximately:\n\nU_total \u2248 5.522 \u00d7 10^-27 J\n\nHowever, this answer does not match any of the options provided. It appears there might be a typo in the options or the question. Based on the calculations, the closest option would be:\n\nB. 5.645 x 10^-26 J\n\nBut this is not accurate based on our calculations. Please verify the question and options again."
