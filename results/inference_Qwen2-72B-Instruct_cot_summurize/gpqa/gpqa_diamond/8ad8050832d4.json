This discrepancy suggests that my calculations may have taken an incorrect turn or that there's an error in the question's options or details provided. Given the typical range for interplanar distances and the options provided, it seems likely that there might have been a misunderstanding or misinterpretation of the question's parameters.\n\nConsidering the standard approach and the options provided, the correct answer based on the information and typical values for interplanar distances in crystals would be closest to one of the given options. However, based on the calculation, none of the provided options A-D directly matches the calculated value, indicating a possible need for reevaluation of the problem statement or calculation methodology.\n\nFor the sake of choosing from the given options, and assuming there might have been an oversight in the question formulation or interpretation, none of the options A-D (\\(10.05 \u00c5\\), \\(9.54 \u00c5\\), \\(9.08 \u00c5\\), \\(8.95 \u00c5\\)) directly corresponds to the calculated value. Thus, without further clarification, it's challenging to definitively select among them based purely on the provided calculations. However, considering the typical scale and nature of such problems in crystallography, the closest option to a realistic interplanar distance in this context might be evaluated differently depending on additional contextual information or corrections to the problem setup or calculation steps. \n\nGiven the options, and acknowledging the discrepancy between the calculated value and the provided choices, the closest numerical match based on the calculation process attempted would not align with any of the options A-D, suggesting potential issues with the question's parameters or the calculation pathway as initially pursued. Further examination or clarification regarding the specific details or intended solution methodology might be required to accurately resolve this query within the context of the provided options."
