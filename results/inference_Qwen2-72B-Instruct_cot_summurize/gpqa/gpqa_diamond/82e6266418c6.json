The Lorentz symmetry and Poincare symmetry are fundamental to the relativistic quantum field theories that form the basis of the Standard Model. CPT symmetry, which combines charge conjugation (C), parity (P), and time reversal (T), is also a crucial symmetry in quantum field theory and must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT.\n\nCP symmetry itself can be violated in the Standard Model through the CKM matrix in the quark sector and the PMNS matrix in the lepton sector, among other mechanisms. Therefore, it is not necessarily respected by all operators in the SMEFT. However, the combined CPT symmetry must be respected."
