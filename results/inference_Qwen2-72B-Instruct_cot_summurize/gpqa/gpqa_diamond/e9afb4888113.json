It is often claimed that string theory does not require regularization because it naturally avoids the infinities that plague other quantum field theories at high energies. This is because, in string theory, point particles are replaced by one-dimensional strings, which have a natural length scale (the string scale) that prevents the formation of singularities and ultraviolet divergences. However, this claim is somewhat controversial, as some physicists argue that string theory still requires some form of regularization or renormalization to be mathematically consistent. Nonetheless, it is generally accepted that string theory has better ultraviolet behavior than other quantum field theories, making it a leading candidate for a theory of everything."
