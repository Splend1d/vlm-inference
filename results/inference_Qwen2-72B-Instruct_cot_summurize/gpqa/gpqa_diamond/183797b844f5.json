                    "text": "Let's analyze the reactions and their outcomes:\n\n**Reaction I:**\n(S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one reacts with LAH (lithium aluminum hydride), which is a strong reducing agent. It will reduce the ketone group to an alcohol. The product would be (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Note that the stereochemistry should be retained because LAH reduces aldehydes and ketones in a stereospecific manner, preserving the configuration at any pre-existing stereocenters.\n\n**Reaction II:**\nPentane-2,4-dione (also known as acetylacetone or diacetyl) reacts with excess NaBH4 (sodium borohydride). This reaction will reduce both carbonyl groups to form two primary alcohols, resulting in 2,4-pentanediol. Since there are no pre-existing stereocenters in pentane-2,4-dione, this reaction will not produce any enantiomers but will give a single product.\n\nAfter combining the products from both reactions, we have:\n\n1. (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n2. 2,4-pentanediol\n\nIn **normal-phase HPLC**, the separation is based on polarity, and since these compounds have different polarities due to the number and position of functional groups, they should separate into two distinct peaks.\n\nHowever, when running them through **chiral HPLC**, the situation changes. Chiral HPLC can separate enantiomers based on their interaction with the chiral stationary phase. In Reaction I, we have (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, which is an enantiomer. When it interacts with the chiral stationary phase, it may or may not separate into its (R) and (S) forms depending on whether the stationary phase can distinguish between them. However, since the question implies that the chiral HPLC can indeed differentiate between enantiomers, we expect (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol to split into two peaks (R) and (S).\n\nFor Reaction II's product, 2,4-pentanediol, since it has no pre-existing chirality, it will not split into additional peaks on chiral HPLC.\n\nThus, in total, for chiral HPLC, we have:\n- Two peaks from the (R) and (S) forms of 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol\n- One peak from 2,4-pentanediol\n\nFor normal-phase HPLC, we have:\n- One peak from 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (both (R) and (S) forms would elute together if not separated by chiral HPLC)\n- One peak from 2,4-pentanediol\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\n**C. 3 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC**"
