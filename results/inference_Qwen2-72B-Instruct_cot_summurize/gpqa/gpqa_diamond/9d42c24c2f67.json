The star has an effective temperature (Teff) of 6000K, and the spots exhibit a temperature difference of 1000K. As only one hemisphere is spotty, photometric time-series observations will reveal periodic variations in brightness due to rotational modulation. Interestingly, this situation can closely resemble the presence of an exoplanet. To produce the same amplitude signal in the star's light curve (if the star was not covered by spots!), what should be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet relative to the radius of the host star (i.e. Rpl/Rstar)?\n\nA. ~0.07\nB. ~0.32\nC. ~0.39\nD. ~0.11\n"

The relative change in brightness \u0394F/F caused by a transiting exoplanet can be approximated as:\n\n\u0394F/F \u2248 (Rpl/Rstar)^2\n\nWhere Rpl is the radius of the exoplanet and Rstar is the radius of the star.\n\nIn this case, we have a filling factor of 20% of the star's hemisphere covered by dark spots, which corresponds to a fractional area of 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 of the total surface area of the star. The temperature difference between the spots and the rest of the star is 1000K, so the flux from the spotted region is reduced by a factor of (Tspots/Tstar)^4 = (5000/6000)^4 \u2248 0.482.\n\nThus, the fractional change in brightness due to the spots is approximately:\n\n\u0394F/F_spots \u2248 0.1 * (1 - 0.482) \u2248 0.0518\n\nWe want to find the radius of an exoplanet that would cause the same fractional change in brightness. Using the equation for \u0394F/F given above, we can solve for Rpl/Rstar:\n\n(Rpl/Rstar)^2 = \u0394F/F_spots\nRpl/Rstar = sqrt(\u0394F/F_spots)\n\nPlugging in the value of \u0394F/F_spots we found earlier:\n\nRpl/Rstar = sqrt(0.0518) \u2248 0.2276\n\nHowever, this answer is not among the options given. This discrepancy may be due to rounding errors or simplifying assumptions made in the problem statement. Among the given options, the closest one to our calculated value is:\n\nD. ~0.11\n\nAlthough it's not an exact match, option D is the closest to our calculated value of 0.2276. However, if we consider the options strictly, none of them matches the calculated value precisely. But in the context of the provided options, D is the closest approximation."
