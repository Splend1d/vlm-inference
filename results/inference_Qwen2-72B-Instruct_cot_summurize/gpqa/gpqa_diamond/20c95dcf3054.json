                    "text": "The key to answering this question is understanding how the redshift (z) of an object affects the observed wavelength of its spectral lines, and specifically, how it relates to the detectability of the Lyman-alpha line at ~1216 Angstroms by optical ground-based telescopes.\n\nThe observed wavelength (\\(\\lambda_{obs}\\)) of a spectral line emitted at rest wavelength (\\(\\lambda_0\\)) by an object at redshift \\(z\\) is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_0(1 + z)\n\\]\n\nGround-based optical telescopes typically operate in the visible spectrum, which ranges approximately from 400 to 700 nanometers (nm), or 4000 to 7000 Angstroms (\\(\\AA\\)). For a Lyman-alpha line at 1216 \\(\\AA\\) to be shifted into the observable optical range, we need to find the minimum redshift \\(z\\) that shifts this line into this range.\n\nLet's set the lower bound for the visible spectrum as 4000 \\(\\AA\\) and solve for \\(z\\):\n\n\\[\n4000 = 1216(1 + z)\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\(z\\):\n\n\\[\n1 + z = \\frac{4000}{1216}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nz = \\frac{4000}{1216} - 1\n\\]\n\n\\[\nz = \\frac{4000}{1216} - \\frac{1216}{1216}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nz = \\frac{2784}{1216}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nz \u2248 2.3\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the lower limit on the redshift of these objects such that they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes is approximately 2.3. The closest option given is B. 2.4. However, it's important to note that the actual value calculated here is slightly less than 2.3, but since the options do not include a precise match, the closest answer would be B. 2.4."
