The time elapsed in the ejecta's reference frame is 50 seconds. Since there is no acceleration involved, we can use the formula:\n\ndistance = velocity \u00d7 time\n\nSo, in the Galaxy's reference frame, the distance traveled by the ejecta is:\n\ndistance = 60,000 km/s \u00d7 50 s = 3,000,000 km\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. 3,000,000 km."
