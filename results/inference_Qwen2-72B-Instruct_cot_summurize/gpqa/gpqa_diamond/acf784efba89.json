The goal of meiosis, unlike mitosis, is to separate not only the replicated sister chromatids but also the homologous chromosome pairs to form haploid cells. Fertilized gametes enter embryogenesis and ultimately develop into an organism. Meiosis is not always perfectly executed, and most such cases result in embryonic lethality. Viable events can already be detected in the karyotype of embryonic cells from the amniotic fluid. One such event results in Klinefelter's syndrome in boys. Which molecular mechanism is responsible for less prominent phenotypic consequences of Klinefelter's syndrome compared to better known Down's syndrome?\n\nA. chiasmata resolution by separase in diakinesis\nB. attachment of spindle to kinetochores in the metaphase I\nC. chromatin methylation by histone methyltransferases in the post-zygote\nD. progression of the polymerase alpha in the morula/blastocyst\n"

                    "text": "The molecular mechanism responsible for less prominent phenotypic consequences of Klinefelter's syndrome compared to better known Down's syndrome is not directly related to any of the options provided (A-D). However, it can be explained by the process of X-chromosome inactivation. In Klinefelter's syndrome, males have an extra X chromosome (XXY), whereas females typically have two X chromosomes (XX). To balance gene expression between males and females, one of the two X chromosomes in females is inactivated during early embryogenesis. This process, called X-chromosome inactivation, silences most of the genes on the inactivated X chromosome, leading to dosage compensation. In Klinefelter's syndrome, the same mechanism of X-chromosome inactivation occurs, which helps mitigate the effects of the extra X chromosome. Therefore, the phenotypic consequences of Klinefelter's syndrome are generally less severe than those of Down's syndrome, where there is an extra copy of chromosome 21, and no similar mechanism exists to compensate for the extra genetic material."
