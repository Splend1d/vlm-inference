(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: This compound does not have any chiral centers, so it won't exhibit optical activity.\n2. (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione: This compound has two chiral centers (3a and 7a), so it will exhibit optical activity.\n3. (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: This compound has two chiral centers (2 and 3), so it will exhibit optical activity.\n4. (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: This compound also has two chiral centers (2 and 3), so it will exhibit optical activity.\n5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: This compound has one chiral center (the carbon with the hydroxyl group), so it will exhibit optical activity.\n6. (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: This compound has three chiral centers (1, 3, and 5), so it will exhibit optical activity.\n7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: This compound does not have any chiral centers, so it won't exhibit optical activity.\n\nOut of these seven compounds, five will exhibit optical activity.\n\nThe answer is D. 5."
