Among the given compounds, benzoquinone does not show tautomerism because it doesn't have the necessary structure to undergo such a rearrangement.\n\nOptical isomerism (also known as enantiomerism) occurs when a molecule has a chiral center, meaning that the molecule cannot be superimposed on its mirror image. Molecules with this property exist as two or more distinct forms that are mirror images of each other. Among the given compounds, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral carbon atom, which means it can exhibit optical isomerism.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC.
