However, for this question, we will focus on how the phase shifts relate to the scattering amplitude.\n\nIn non-relativistic quantum mechanics, the scattering amplitude $f(\\theta)$ is related to the phase shifts $\\delta_l$ by the partial wave expansion:\n\\[ f(\\theta) = \\sum_{l=0}^\\infty (2l+1) j_l(kr) e^{i\\delta_l}, \\]\nwhere $j_l(kr)$ are the spherical Bessel functions and $k$ is the wave number of the incident particles. In the forward direction ($\\theta=0$), all the spherical Bessel functions $j_l(kr)$ become 1, and the scattering amplitude simplifies to:\n\\[ f(0) = \\sum_{l=0}^\\infty (2l+1) e^{i\\delta_l}. \\]\n\nThe imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude is then given by:\n\\[ \\text{Im}[f(0)] = \\sum_{l=0}^\\infty (2l+1) \\sin(\\delta_l). \\]\n\nGiven the phase shifts $\\delta_0 = 90^\\circ$, $\\delta_1 = 67^\\circ$, $\\delta_2 = 55^\\circ$, $\\delta_3 = 30^\\circ$, and $\\delta_4 = 13^\\circ$, we can calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{Im}[f(0)] &= (2\\times0+1)\\sin(90^\\circ) + (2\\times1+1)\\sin(67^\\circ) \\\\\n&\\quad + (2\\times2+1)\\sin(55^\\circ) + (2\\times3+1)\\sin(30^\\circ) \\\\\n&\\quad + (2\\times4+1)\\sin(13^\\circ) \\\\\n&= 1\\cdot1 + 3\\cdot0.9205 + 5\\cdot0.8192 + 7\\cdot0.5 + 9\\cdot0.225 \\\\\n&= 1 + 2.7615 + 4.096 + 3.5 + 2.025 \\\\\n&= 13.3825.\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the units provided in the options (fm, or femtometers) do not match the dimensionless result we obtained here. The calculation above gives us a dimensionless quantity, while the options provided are in units of femtometers. This discrepancy suggests that there might be additional factors or conversion constants involved in the problem statement that were not included in the question.\n\nWithout knowing the exact conversion factor from our calculated value to the physical unit of femtometers, we cannot directly match our result with the provided options. It's also possible that the question intends for you to understand the relationship between phase shifts and the scattering amplitude, rather than expecting a precise numerical answer.\n\nAssuming the calculation above is conceptually correct but missing the conversion to femtometers, none of the provided options directly match the calculated value. Therefore, without further information, we cannot definitively select an answer from the given options based solely on the calculation performed."
