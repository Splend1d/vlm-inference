The mass of Star_1 is also larger by the same factor (1.5 times). Through spectroscopy, the astronomers managed to determine the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same. Astronomers also calculated the radial velocities of the two stars to be 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. Assuming that the stars radiate as black bodies, they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of:\n\nA. ~2.35\nB. ~2.23\nC. ~2.32\nD. ~2.25\n"

                    "text": "The luminosity of a star can be determined using the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that the total power radiated per unit surface area of a black body across all wavelengths is directly proportional to the fourth power of the black body's thermodynamic temperature \\(T\\). However, since the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same, we can assume that their surface temperatures are approximately equal.\n\nGiven this information, the luminosity of a star can also be expressed in terms of its radius and temperature. Since the temperatures are equal, we only need to consider the radius when comparing the luminosities of the two stars. The luminosity (\\(L\\)) of a star is proportional to the surface area (\\(A\\)), which is given by \\(4\\pi R^2\\), where \\(R\\) is the radius of the star. Therefore, if one star has a radius \\(R_1\\) and another star has a radius \\(R_2\\), the ratio of their luminosities (\\(\\frac{L_1}{L_2}\\)) will be proportional to the square of the ratio of their radii (\\(\\left(\\frac{R_1}{R_2}\\right)^2\\)).\n\nIn this case, Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than that of Star_2. Thus,\n\n\\[\n\\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\left(\\frac{R_1}{R_2}\\right)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of **~2.25**.\n\nSo the correct answer is **D. ~2.25**. \n\nThe radial velocities provided do not affect the luminosity calculation based on the information given. They would be relevant if we were considering Doppler shifts or other motion-related effects, but those are not part of the question here."
