This could mean that during a separation or purification process, such as chromatography or recrystallization, the compounds are sticking together, making it difficult to separate them from each other. This can happen if the compounds have strong intermolecular attractions, which could be due to hydrogen bonding, dipole-dipole interactions, or van der Waals forces."
