The 1H NMR spectrum of the crude compound appears consistent with the expected molecule, with the exception of two peaks that both correspond to the same alpha-proton. These two peaks have similar chemical shifts and roughly equal integrals (together they integrate to 1H - the expected integral); based on the coupling pattern, you can rule out spin-spin coupling as an explanation for the duplicate peaks. LC-MS analysis of the crude compound at elevated temperature shows two clearly defined peaks of equal intensities. Both peaks have the same mass spectrum, which is consistent with the expected molecule. What is the most likely explanation for these observations?\n\nA. The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers\nB. 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction\nC. The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers\nD. The compound is contaminated with a precursor\n"

                    "text": "The most likely explanation for these observations is C. The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers.\n\nWhen a peptidic compound is synthesized, if there are stereocenters present in the amino acids or elsewhere in the molecule, it is possible to obtain a mixture of diastereoisomers. Diastereoisomers are non-superimposable, non-mirror image isomers that differ in the arrangement of atoms around one or more stereocenters. They will have different physical properties such as melting points, boiling points, and solubilities but will have identical molecular masses.\n\nThe fact that the two peaks in the LC-MS analysis at elevated temperatures have the same mass spectrum but are present in equal intensities suggests that there are two different molecular arrangements present in equal amounts. This is consistent with a mixture of diastereoisomers. Additionally, since the peaks in the 1H NMR spectrum have similar chemical shifts and roughly equal integrals, this also supports the idea of diastereoisomers, as they would be expected to have similar but not identical chemical environments, leading to slightly different chemical shifts.\n\nOption A (a mixture of enantiomers) is less likely because enantiomers would have identical chemical shifts in a chiral solvent and typically do not separate by LC-MS unless chiral chromatography is used. Option B ('double coupling') does not make sense in the context provided as it is not a recognized phenomenon in peptide synthesis. Option D (contamination with a precursor) could potentially explain the additional peak, but the observation of two peaks with the same mass spectrum and similar chemical shifts points more strongly towards the presence of diastereoisomers."
