                    "text": "The question is quite complex and requires a deep understanding of chemistry and isotopes. However, let's try to break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Gas W has equal numbers of protons and neutrons**: This suggests that the gas W could be Neon (Ne), which has 10 protons and 10 neutrons. However, since the question mentions a \"keto acid,\" we can infer that the gas might be Carbon Dioxide (CO2), which also fits the criteria (6 protons and 6 neutrons for each carbon atom, but since we're looking for a single molecule, CO2 would not fit the \"equal number of protons and neutrons\" criterion). Yet, this part is more about the context clue than a direct identification.\n\n2. **Precipitate G releases B when heated, and B has a melting point close to 277K**: This could suggest that B is ice (H2O), given its melting point at standard atmospheric pressure is around 273.15K. Therefore, G could be hydrated salt (like copper sulfate pentahydrate), which releases water upon heating.\n\n3. **Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope**: This suggests that X could contain deuterium (D), a heavier isotope of hydrogen (H).\n\n4. **Product of the reaction between a keto acid and X contains 2 atoms of oxygen**: This indicates that X likely reacts with a keto acid (like pyruvic acid) to form a compound containing oxygen. Since the keto acid already contains oxygen, the presence of two oxygen atoms in the final product does not give us much information about X itself.\n\n5. **X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry**: This points towards X being a common organic chemistry reagent. Given the previous clues, it seems likely that X is related to hydrogen in some way, possibly involving deuterium.\n\n6. **Calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X**: If we consider the lightest element to be hydrogen (atomic mass = 1) and the heaviest to be deuterium (atomic mass = 2), the cumulative atomic masses would be 1 + 2 = 3. However, none of the answer choices match this calculation. \n\nGiven the complexity and the potential misinterpretations involved in the question, let's reconsider the answer choices:\n\n- A. 31: This doesn't seem to directly relate to any of the elements mentioned or implied.\n- B. 35: This could potentially include the sum of the atomic masses of hydrogen (1) and chlorine (35), considering that chlorine has heavier isotopes.\n- C. 29: This could be the sum of the atomic masses of nitrogen (14) and hydrogen (1), but nitrogen isn't directly mentioned, and it doesn't seem to fit the context.\n- D. 25: This could potentially be the sum of the atomic masses of hydrogen (1) and magnesium (24), but again, magnesium isn't mentioned, and it doesn't seem to fit the context either.\n\nConsidering the context clues and the nature of the question, the best fit among the options provided might be **B. 35**, assuming that Substance X involves chlorine in some capacity, perhaps as a chloride ion or a chlorinated compound, although this is speculative based on the given information."
