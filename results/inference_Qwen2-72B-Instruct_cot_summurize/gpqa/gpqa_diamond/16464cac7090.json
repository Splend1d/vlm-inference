                    "text": "The problem statement provides several clues that can be used to identify the substances involved. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Decolorization of Bromine Water**: This indicates that the substances in mixture X contain carbon-carbon double or triple bonds since they react with bromine to form addition products, thus decolorizing the bromine water.\n\n2. **Disproportionation on Heating with Platinum**: This suggests a redox reaction where one compound gets oxidized and another gets reduced. Given that the starting materials have double or triple bonds, this could involve the formation of more saturated compounds.\n\n3. **Hydrogenation of Mixture X and Y**: The fact that both mixtures give rise to the same hydrocarbon Z under hydrogenation implies that Z is a saturated hydrocarbon, possibly an alkane.\n\n4. **Mass Fraction of Hydrogen in Z**: Given as 14.28%, we can use this information to determine the molecular formula of Z. Knowing that hydrogen has an atomic mass of approximately 1 and carbon has an atomic mass of approximately 12, we can set up an equation to find the ratio of hydrogen to carbon in Z. Let H = number of hydrogen atoms and C = number of carbon atoms:\n\n\\[ \\frac{H \\times 1}{(C \\times 12) + (H \\times 1)} = 0.1428 \\]\n\nRearranging and solving for H/C ratio, we get:\n\\[ H = 2C \\]\n\nGiven that hydrogen makes up 14.28% of the molecule's mass, we can solve for the actual values of C and H. Using trial and error or algebra, we find that C = 6 and H = 12 satisfies the given percentage (for hexane, C6H12, but note that hexane has a hydrogen mass fraction of about 13%, so there's a slight discrepancy; however, for the sake of the problem, let's assume C6H12).\n\n5. **No Conjugated Multiple Bonds in X**: This means that the unsaturated compounds in X do not have continuous \u03c0-bond systems, ruling out structures like alkynes or conjugated dienes.\n\nGiven that Z is C6H12 (hexene or hexyne, but hexene fits better here), and knowing that the original mixture X contains unsaturated compounds that upon hydrogenation yield Z, we can deduce that X likely contains one or more alkenes. Since hexene (C6H12) is obtained from X after hydrogenation, the unsaturated compounds in X must collectively have 12 fewer hydrogen atoms than Z (because hydrogenation adds hydrogen). Therefore, if Z has 12 hydrogen atoms, and we're assuming X consists of two equimolar liquids, each liquid in X must contribute to the final product without adding any extra hydrogen atoms beyond what Z already has.\n\nThus, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X must also equal 12, because these two liquids will combine to form Z (C6H12) upon complete hydrogenation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **B. 12**."
