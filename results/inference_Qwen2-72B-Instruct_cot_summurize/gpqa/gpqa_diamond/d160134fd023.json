                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to identify the element Y and understand the reactions described. From the information given:\n\n1. Five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y are known.\n2. A1 decomposes at 293 K into A2 (with \u03c9F = 31.96%) and fluorine. This suggests that A1 is a compound of Y with more than one F atom per molecule, as it can release F2 upon decomposition.\n3. A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. This indicates that A1 is a powerful oxidizing agent.\n4. A3 interacts with xenon and is obtained by fluorination of Y with fluorine. This suggests that A3 is another Y-F compound.\n5. A5 is formed by adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot, colorless, concentrated solution of A4. A5 decomposes in water to form two substances.\n\nLet's deduce the identity of Y:\n\n- Only a few elements can form five binary compounds with fluorine. These elements are typically from groups 14 to 17 on the periodic table (C, Si, P, S, Cl, etc.), but given the properties mentioned (powerful oxidizer and interaction with xenon), the most likely candidate is chlorine (Cl).\n- Chlorine can form various fluorides, such as ClF, ClF3, ClF5, etc., which are strong oxidizers and can react with noble gases like xenon under certain conditions.\n\nGiven that A5 decomposes in water and is formed from A4, let's analyze the possible identities of A4:\n\n- Since A5 decomposes in water, it could be a chloride or fluoride of chlorine, suggesting that A4 might be a more stable compound that can undergo a reaction to form A5.\n- Considering the process of forming A5 from A4 involves heating and adding Y (chlorine) in a 1:1 molar ratio, it seems plausible that A4 could be a chloride of chlorine, such as Cl2O (dichlorine monoxide) or Cl2O5 (dichlorine pentoxide).\n\nNow, to find the molecular weight of A4:\n\n- Dichlorine monoxide (Cl2O) has a molecular weight of about 67.36 g/mol, which is too low for any of the given options.\n- Dichlorine pentoxide (Cl2O5) has a molecular weight of about 138.90 g/mol, which is closer to the lower end of the options but still does not fit perfectly.\n\nGiven the options provided, none directly matches the molecular weights of Cl2O or Cl2O5, but considering the context and the options given, the closest match would be:\n\nD. 140-160\n\nThis is based on the assumption that A4 could be Cl2O5, which has a molecular weight within the given range. However, without additional context or information, this is an estimation based on the clues provided."
