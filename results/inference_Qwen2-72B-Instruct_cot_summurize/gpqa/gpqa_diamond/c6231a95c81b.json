The formula to calculate the enthalpy of formation is:\n\n\u0394Hf\u00b0 = \u03a3(Bond energies of reactants) - \u03a3(Bond energies of products)\n\nHowever, in this case, we're trying to find the enthalpy of formation of the compound itself, which means we need to consider its bond energies and subtract the enthalpy of atomization of its constituent atoms.\n\nLet's analyze the structure: (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2\n\nThis structure has:\n- 18 C-H bonds\n- 15 C-C single bonds\n- 2 C=C double bonds\n- 14 Carbon atoms\n\nThe enthalpy of formation can be calculated as follows:\n\n\u0394Hf\u00b0 = [14 * 1000 (enthalpy of atomization of carbon)] - [(18 * 400) + (15 * 200) + (2 * 300)]\n\n\u0394Hf\u00b0 = [14000] - [(18 * 400) + (15 * 200) + (2 * 300)]\n\u0394Hf\u00b0 = [14000] - [7200 + 3000 + 600]\n\u0394Hf\u00b0 = [14000] - [10800]\n\n\u0394Hf\u00b0 = 3200 kJ/mol\n\nNone of the provided options match this result, which suggests there might have been an error in the interpretation of the question or the given data. However, based on the calculation with the provided information, the closest answer would be D. 11200 kJ/mol if we were to misinterpret the subtraction, but that's not a valid approach.\n\nPlease review the question details again to ensure accuracy or provide additional context. If the question aims for the enthalpy of formation per gram, then additional steps involving the molar mass of the compound would be required. But based on the information given and the calculation performed, the correct enthalpy of formation is 3200 kJ/mol, which isn't listed among your options."
