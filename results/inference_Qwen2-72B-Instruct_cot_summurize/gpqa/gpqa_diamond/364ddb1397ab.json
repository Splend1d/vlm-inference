                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to use conservation of energy and momentum in the center-of-mass frame. The total energy and momentum before the annihilation (just a single particle's rest mass for each proton and antiproton since they are at rest relative to each other) must equal the total energy and momentum after the annihilation.\n\nLet's denote the masses of the proton ($p$) and antiproton ($\\bar{p}$) as $m_p$, which for simplicity we will consider to be the same as that of a proton, and the mass of the $A^{\\pm}$ particles as $m_A$. The speed of light is denoted by $c$.\n\nBefore the annihilation, the total energy in the center-of-mass frame is:\n\n\\[E_{\\text{initial}} = m_p c^2 + m_{\\bar{p}} c^2 = 2m_p c^2\\]\n\nAfter the annihilation, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the four $A^{\\pm}$ particles:\n\n\\[E_{\\text{final}} = 4m_A c^2\\]\n\nSince energy is conserved, we have:\n\n\\[2m_p c^2 = 4m_A c^2\\]\n\nHowever, we don't actually need to solve for the mass of the proton here since we're given the mass of the $A^{\\pm}$ particles and asked for their velocity. We can use the conservation of momentum principle instead. Before the annihilation, the total momentum is zero because the proton and antiproton are moving slowly towards each other. After the annihilation, the total momentum must still be zero, but the momenta of the two pairs of $A^{\\pm}$ particles must cancel each other out.\n\nFor each pair of $A^{\\pm}$ particles, the momentum is:\n\n\\[p_{\\text{pair}} = 2m_A v\\]\n\nwhere $v$ is the velocity of the $A^{\\pm}$ particles. Since the momenta of the two pairs cancel each other out, the total momentum is indeed zero, confirming that our initial conditions are met.\n\nTo find the velocity $v$ of the $A^{\\pm}$ particles, we use the relativistic expression for energy:\n\n\\[E = \\gamma m_A c^2\\]\n\nwhere $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-\\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$ is the Lorentz factor. Given that $E = m_A c^2$ for each $A^{\\pm}$ particle at rest, the total energy of all four particles after the annihilation is:\n\n\\[E_{\\text{final}} = 4\\gamma m_A c^2\\]\n\nEquating this to the initial energy $2m_p c^2$ (and noting again that we don't need to explicitly solve for $m_p$), we can find the velocity $v$ by solving for $\\gamma$ and then for $v$ using the relation between $\\gamma$ and $v$.\n\nFirst, we solve for $\\gamma$:\n\n\\[2m_p c^2 = 4\\gamma m_A c^2\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[\\gamma = \\frac{m_p}{2m_A}\\]\n\nWe know that $m_A c^2 = 300\\,MeV$, so let's assume a typical proton mass of $m_p c^2 \\approx 938\\,MeV$. Then,\n\n\\[\\gamma = \\frac{938\\,MeV}{2\\times300\\,MeV} = \\frac{938}{600} = 1.5633\\]\n\nNow, we use the definition of $\\gamma$ to find $v$:\n\n\\[\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-\\frac{v^2}{c^2}}} = 1.5633\\]\n\nSolving for $v$, we get:\n\n\\[1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2} = \\left(\\frac{1}{1.5633}\\right)^2\\]\n\n\\[1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2} = 0.406\\]\n\n\\[\\frac{v^2}{c^2} = 0.594\\]\n\n\\[v = c\\sqrt{0.594} \\approx 0.77c\\]\n\nSo, the correct answer is **C. 0.77c**."
