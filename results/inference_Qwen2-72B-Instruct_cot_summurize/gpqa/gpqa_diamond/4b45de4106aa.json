The rest masses of the fermions involved are:\n\n- u, d, s quarks: approximately negligible (<< 1 GeV)\n- c quark: approximately 1.5 GeV\n- b quark: approximately 4.2 GeV\n- t quark: approximately 173 GeV\n- e, \u03bc leptons: approximately 0.511 MeV and 105.7 MeV respectively (<< 1 GeV)\n- \u03c4 lepton: approximately 1.777 GeV\n\nGiven this information, the decay must respect the conservation of energy, meaning the total rest mass of the fermion pair cannot exceed the mass of the boson X. Therefore, the t quark pair is immediately ruled out due to its high mass.\n\nThus, the kinematically allowed decays at the lowest order would be those that involve fermion pairs whose combined rest masses are less than or equal to 6 GeV. This rules out the t quark pair and the b quark pair since two b quarks would have a combined mass greater than 8.4 GeV.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: \\(X \\rightarrow c\\bar{c}, s\\bar{s}, u\\bar{u}, d\\bar{d}, \\tau^{+}\\tau^{-}, \\mu^{+}\\mu^{-}, e^{+}e^{-}\\)."
