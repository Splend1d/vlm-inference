The energy of the emitted light is given as 2.3393 eV, which corresponds to a wavelength in the visible spectrum.\n\nFirst, let's convert the energy to wavelength using the equation:\n\n\\[E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda}\\]\n\nwhere \\(E\\) is the energy (in eV), \\(h\\) is Planck's constant (\\(4.1357 \\times 10^{-15} eV\\cdot s\\)), \\(c\\) is the speed of light (\\(3.00 \\times 10^8 m/s\\)), and \\(\\lambda\\) is the wavelength (in meters). However, it's more convenient to use the relationship between electronvolts (eV) and nanometers (nm) for visible light, which can be approximated as:\n\n\\[E(eV) = \\frac{1240}{\\lambda(nm)}\\]\n\nRearranging this to solve for \\(\\lambda\\):\n\n\\[\\lambda(nm) = \\frac{1240}{E(eV)}\\]\n\nSubstituting the given energy:\n\n\\[\\lambda = \\frac{1240}{2.3393} \\approx 529.6 nm\\]\n\nThis wavelength falls within the green region of the visible spectrum. Therefore, the dye absorbs light that is complementary to green, which is magenta or violet (C).\n\nHowever, the exact answer from the options provided would be:\n\nC. Violet\n\nThis is because the visible spectrum ranges approximately from 380 nm (violet) to 740 nm (red), and colors are complementary across this spectrum. Green and magenta/violet are complementary colors."
