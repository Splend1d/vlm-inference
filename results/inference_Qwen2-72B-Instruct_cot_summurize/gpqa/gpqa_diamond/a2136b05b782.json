Thermodynamically, oxygen is a stronger oxidant in basic solutions: Oxygen has a higher reduction potential in basic conditions (due to the formation of hydroxide ions) than in acidic conditions (where it forms water). This means that it is more thermodynamically favorable for oxygen to act as an oxidizing agent in basic solutions.\n\n2. Kinetically, oxygen reacts faster in acidic solutions: Although oxygen is a stronger oxidant in basic solutions from a thermodynamic standpoint, its reaction rate (kinetics) is often faster in acidic conditions. This is because protons (H+) can facilitate the reaction mechanism, making the reaction proceed more quickly than in basic solutions where hydroxide ions (OH-) are present.\n\nTherefore, the correct combination is \"stronger\" for the thermodynamic part and \"faster\" for the kinetic part, which corresponds to option C."
