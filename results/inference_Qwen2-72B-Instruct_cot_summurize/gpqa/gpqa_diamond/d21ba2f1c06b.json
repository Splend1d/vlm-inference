                    "text": "The key to this question lies in understanding the behavior of racemic mixtures under the influence of a catalyst that promotes a reaction which conserves stereochemistry, such as the Grubbs metathesis catalyst.\n\nRacemic 3-methylpent-1-ene consists of two enantiomers: one with the methyl group on the left side when looking down the double bond (let's call this S configuration) and one with the methyl group on the right side (let's call this R configuration).\n\nUpon treatment with Grubbs catalyst, each molecule of 3-methylpent-1-ene can react with another molecule of the same or opposite configuration, leading to the formation of cyclic or acyclic products through an olefin metathesis reaction. The cyclic products will be formed by the self-metathesis of each enantiomer, while the acyclic products will result from cross-metathesis between the two enantiomers.\n\nFor each enantiomer:\n- Self-metathesis can produce one cyclic product.\n- Cross-metathesis with the other enantiomer can produce two different acyclic products due to the different ways the substituents can be arranged on the new double bonds.\n\nTherefore, for the racemic mixture:\n- There will be 2 cyclic products (one for each enantiomer).\n- There will be 4 acyclic products (two for each type of cross-metathesis event between the two enantiomers).\n\nAdding these together gives a total of 6 possible products, excluding ethene, which could potentially form but is not counted here based on the options given.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\nB. 6"
