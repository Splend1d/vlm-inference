                    "text": "The \"impulse\" approximation in many-body nuclear calculations assumes that the interaction occurs with individual nucleons without accounting for the effects of the nuclear medium on the interaction. This means that the interaction current should only interact with individual nucleons (1), and the interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces (4). Additionally, the nucleus is considered transparent apart from the selected nucleon (2), which means that other nucleons do not significantly affect the interaction. The behavior of quarks within the nucleon (3) is not directly relevant to the impulse approximation since it deals with the interaction at the nucleon level rather than at the quark level.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. 1,2,4"
