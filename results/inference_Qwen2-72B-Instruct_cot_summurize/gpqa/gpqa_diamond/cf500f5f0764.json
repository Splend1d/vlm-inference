                    "text": "The equilibrium temperature of a planet can be calculated using the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that the power radiated by a black body is proportional to the fourth power of its absolute temperature. For planets, this can be simplified to the following relationship:\n\n\\[T_{eq} = \\left( \\frac{L}{16\\pi\\sigma D^2 A} \\right)^{\\frac{1}{4}}\\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\(T_{eq}\\) is the equilibrium temperature,\n- \\(L\\) is the luminosity of the star,\n- \\(\\sigma\\) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant,\n- \\(D\\) is the distance from the star,\n- \\(A\\) is the albedo.\n\nGiven that the albedo \\(A\\) is the same for both planets and assuming the star's luminosity \\(L\\) does not change significantly over the range of distances considered here, the equilibrium temperatures of two planets will depend on their distances from the star. Since we are comparing two planets orbiting the same star and having the same albedo, the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures will be related to the inverse fourth root of the ratio of their orbital radii (since the orbital radius is proportional to the distance from the star).\n\nAccording to Kepler\u2019s third law, the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (which is the orbital radius for circular orbits). Therefore:\n\n\\[P^2 \\propto r^3\\]\n\nSo, if we denote the orbital periods of Planet_2 and Planet_4 as \\(P_2\\) and \\(P_4\\), respectively, then:\n\n\\[\\frac{P_4^2}{P_2^2} = \\frac{r_4^3}{r_2^3}\\]\n\nGiven that the orbital periods are in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5, we have \\(P_2 = 2\\) and \\(P_4 = 3.5\\). Therefore,\n\n\\[\\frac{r_4^3}{r_2^3} = \\frac{P_4^2}{P_2^2} = \\frac{(3.5)^2}{(2)^2} = \\frac{12.25}{4} = 3.0625\\]\n\nThus,\n\n\\[\\frac{r_4}{r_2} = (3.0625)^{\\frac{1}{3}} \\approx 1.45\\]\n\nNow, considering the relationship between equilibrium temperature and distance from the star,\n\n\\[\\frac{T_{eq,4}}{T_{eq,2}} = \\left(\\frac{r_2}{r_4}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{4}} = (1.45)^{-\\frac{1}{4}}\\]\n\nCalculating this value,\n\n\\[(1.45)^{-\\frac{1}{4}} \\approx 0.69\\]\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is approximately 0.69, making the correct answer:\n\nA. ~0.69"
