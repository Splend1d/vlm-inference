                    "text": "Optical isomerism, a type of stereoisomerism, occurs when a molecule has chiral centers and can exist in two mirror-image forms that cannot be superimposed on each other. These mirror-image forms are called enantiomers.\n\nLet's analyze the given compounds:\n\n1. **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This compound does not necessarily indicate the presence of a chiral center based on its name alone. Biphenyls and carboxylates do not inherently have chiral centers unless there is an asymmetrical carbon present elsewhere in the structure that is not indicated by the compound's name. Without specific structural information, we cannot definitively say this compound shows optical isomerism.\n\n2. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (also known as methyl lactate)**: This compound contains a hydroxyl group attached to a carbon atom that is also bonded to three other different atoms or groups (a hydrogen, a methyl group, and a carbonyl oxygen). This makes the carbon atom a chiral center, allowing for optical isomerism. Therefore, it can exist as two enantiomers.\n\n3. **Benzophenone**: This compound consists of two phenyl rings attached to a carbonyl group. It does not contain any chiral centers; thus, it does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n4. **Dimethyl fumarate**: Fumaric acid has two double-bonded carbons that can exist in either a cis or trans configuration. However, optical isomerism typically refers to chirality, which involves asymmetric carbon atoms rather than geometric isomerism (cis/trans). Dimethyl fumarate does not have any chiral centers, so it does not show optical isomerism.\n\nBased on the analysis above, only compound 2, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, is guaranteed to show optical isomerism due to the presence of a chiral center. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**B. 2 and 3** - However, this choice includes benzophenone (compound 3), which does not exhibit optical isomerism. Since only compound 2 is confirmed to display optical isomerism from the given options, the most accurate response would be \"only 2,\" but since that option is not provided, the question might be misinterpreted or incorrectly structured. The closest correct answer based on the options given is **B**, but with the understanding that only compound 2 actually exhibits optical isomerism."
