One chlorine atom attached at the 6th carbon.\n2. An ethyl group attached at the 9th carbon.\n3. A methyl group attached at the 2nd carbon.\n4. Two double bonds at the 3rd and 7th carbons (making it an alkene with two sites of cis-trans isomerism).\n5. An alcohol functional group at the 5th carbon, which can be either R or S, making it a chiral center.\n\nLet's analyze the structure:\n\n1. **Chiral Centers**: The 5th carbon, where the hydroxyl group is attached, is a chiral center because it has four different substituents: OH, H, and two different alkyl chains (one from the left side and one from the right side). There are no other chiral centers since the 2nd and 9th carbons have two identical substituents (methyl and ethyl groups, respectively).\n\n2. **Double Bonds**: The two double bonds at the 3rd and 7th carbons can each exist in two configurations: cis or trans. This gives rise to four possible combinations (cis-cis, cis-trans, trans-cis, and trans-trans) for the two double bonds.\n\nSo, combining the information about the chiral center and the double bonds:\n\n- For the chiral center, we have 2 possibilities (R or S).\n- For the two double bonds, we have 4 possibilities (cis-cis, cis-trans, trans-cis, and trans-trans).\n\nMultiplying these possibilities together gives us the total number of stereoisomers:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total Stereosiomers} = (\\text{Number of configurations for chiral centers}) \\times (\\text{Number of configurations for double bonds}) \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Total Stereosiomers} = 2 \\times 4 = 8 \\]\n\nTherefore, the answer is **A. 8**."
