U = - (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 + R^2)\n\nExplanation: The potential energy of a system consisting of a point charge q placed at a distance d from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius R can be calculated using the formula for the potential energy of two charges, which is U = (1/2) kq1q2/r, where k is Coulomb's constant, q1 and q2 are the charges, and r is the distance between them.\n\nHowever, since we have a grounded conducting sphere, we need to consider its effect on the potential energy. A grounded conducting sphere will shield the charge q from any external electric field inside the sphere, and it will induce an equal and opposite charge on the surface of the sphere. This induced charge will create an electric field that cancels out the electric field due to the charge q inside the sphere.\n\nTo calculate the potential energy of this system, we need to find the equivalent charge q' on the surface of the sphere that creates the same potential as the charge q at a distance d. This is given by the formula q' = -(R/d)q.\n\nSubstituting this into the formula for the potential energy of two charges, we get:\n\nU = (1/2) kq(-R/d)q/(d-R) = - (1/2) kq^2 R/d(d-R)\n\nHowever, we want the potential energy in terms of d and R, not d-R. To do this, we use the fact that d-R = -(R-d), so:\n\nU = - (1/2) kq^2 R/d(R-d) = - (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 + R^2)\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. U = - (1/2) kq^2 d/(d^2 + R^2)."
