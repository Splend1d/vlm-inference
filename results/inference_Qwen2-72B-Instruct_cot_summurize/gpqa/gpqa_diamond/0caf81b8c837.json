                    "text": "The reaction of 1-bromobenzene (also known as bromobenzene) with sodium amide (NaNH2) in liquid ammonia is a typical nucleophilic aromatic substitution (SNAr) reaction. However, due to the presence of the deuterium label at the ortho position (2-d), we need to consider how this might affect the outcome.\n\nIn a typical SNAr reaction, the nucleophile (in this case, the amide ion, NH2-) would attack the electrophilic carbon of the benzene ring, displacing the leaving group (Br-). However, since this is an aromatic system, the reaction mechanism is more complex and generally not favorable under normal conditions because the aromaticity is lost during the transition state. Nevertheless, if the reaction proceeds via an unusual pathway or under special conditions that favor it, the amide ion could replace the bromine atom.\n\nThe deuterium label does not directly participate in the reaction but can be used to trace the position of hydrogen atoms in the product. In the case of 1-bromobenzene-2-d, the deuterium is on the ortho position relative to the bromine. The reaction could potentially lead to deuterium retention or exchange with hydrogen from the ammonia solvent.\n\nGiven that the bromine can be replaced by the amide ion, the primary organic product would be aniline (phenylamine) where the bromine is replaced by an amino group (-NH2). However, the deuterium label complicates things slightly because it could either be retained in the final product (if no deuteration/exchange occurs) or exchanged for hydrogen (if there is back-exchange with the ammonia solvent).\n\nThus, considering the deuterium label:\n\n1. If deuterium is retained, you have one product: aniline with deuterium at the ortho position.\n2. If deuterium exchanges with hydrogen, you have another product: \"normal\" aniline without any isotopic labeling.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the reaction conditions and the extent of deuterium exchange would determine whether both products are formed or only one. Without specific information about the extent of deuterium exchange under these conditions, we can only speculate based on what is chemically possible.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **B. 2** potential organic products, assuming some level of deuterium exchange occurs during the reaction."
