                    "text": "To find the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalues of both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$, we need to analyze the given coupled angular momentum state $|1,1,2,-1\\rangle$. This state represents the coupling of two individual angular momenta with $l_1 = l_2 = 1$ into a total angular momentum state with $l = 2$ and its $z$-component $m = -1$.\n\nRecall that for an electron in a $p$ orbital (i.e., $l=1$), the possible eigenvalues of the $z$-component of its angular momentum, $m_l$, are $1, 0, -1$, each corresponding to $\\hbar, 0, -\\hbar$ respectively.\n\nGiven the total angular momentum state $|1,1,2,-1\\rangle$, we can decompose it into the uncoupled basis states (the product states of the individual angular momenta) using Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. The state $|1,1,2,-1\\rangle$ can be expressed as a linear combination of the product states $|1,m_1;1,m_2\\rangle$:\n\n\\[|1,1,2,-1\\rangle = \\sum_{m_1,m_2} C^{2,-1}_{1,m_1;1,m_2} |1,m_1;1,m_2\\rangle,\\]\n\nwhere $C^{2,-1}_{1,m_1;1,m_2}$ are the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.\n\nThe relevant Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for this problem are those that couple $m_1$ and $m_2$ to give $m=-1$. These are:\n- $C^{2,-1}_{1,0;1,-1}$\n- $C^{2,-1}_{1,-1;1,0}$\n- $C^{2,-1}_{1,-1;1,-1}$\n\nHowever, the last one corresponds to a situation where both electrons have their $z$-components at the minimum value of $-1$, which is the scenario we're interested in.\n\nUsing the standard Clebsch-Gordan tables or formulae, we find that:\n\n\\[C^{2,-1}_{1,-1;1,-1} = 0.\\]\n\nThis means that the state $|1,-1;1,-1\\rangle$, which corresponds to both electrons having their $z$-component of angular momentum equal to $-\\hbar$, does not contribute to the given coupled state $|1,1,2,-1\\rangle$. Therefore, the probability of measuring both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\\hbar$ is zero.\n\nSo, the answer is **A. 0**."
