This compound makes it impossible to use this cultivar for food purposes. After an extensive investigation, you discover the gene responsible for the synthesis of this compound. This gene consists of five exons and four introns. You decide to use old-school approaches and produce a collection of mutants using EMS chemical mutagen. You sequence a target gene in all mutant lines and discover some changes at the beginning of its sequence in the first exon area. Which of the following mutations will most probably let you eliminate the anti-nutritional compound in the cultivar?\n\nIntact gene:\n5\u2019-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA-3\u2019\n\nMutant 1:\n5\u2019-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC\u2026TGA-3\u2019\nMutant 2:\n5\u2019-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC\u2026TGA-3\u2019\nMutant 3:\n5\u2019-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA-3\u2019\nMutant 4:\n5\u2019-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA-3\u2019<b>\n\nA.

                    "text": "The mutation that will most likely eliminate the production of the anti-nutritional compound is one that causes a premature stop codon or significantly alters the protein's structure, function, or expression level. Let's analyze each mutant:\n\nMutant 1: The change is from TTT to TTA at position 6, resulting in a leucine (Leu) to serine (Ser) substitution. This is a missense mutation that might alter the protein but may not necessarily prevent its function.\n\nMutant 2: The change is from TTT to TAA at position 6, introducing a stop codon (TAA) very early in the gene sequence. This is a nonsense mutation that would result in a truncated, non-functional protein, potentially eliminating the anti-nutritional compound.\n\nMutant 3: The change involves multiple nucleotides, introducing a new sequence (TAC) and altering the following nucleotide (G to T). This mutation also introduces a stop codon (TGA) immediately after the new sequence, leading to a truncated protein if the reading frame is maintained.\n\nMutant 4: Similar to Mutant 3, there is an insertion of a new sequence (TAC) followed by an alteration in the next nucleotide (G to A). However, unlike Mutant 3, the stop codon (TGA) is not immediately present after the new sequence, but it could still significantly alter the protein if the reading frame is disrupted.\n\nBetween Mutants 3 and 4, Mutant 3 has a more immediate and definitive effect because it introduces a stop codon right after the mutation, making it the best candidate for eliminating the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n**Answer: A.
