We know that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%, so:\n\nP(decay in 100 min) = 1 - P(no decay in 100 min) = 1 - N(100)/N0\n\nSince N(t) = N0 * e^(-\u03bbt), we have:\n\nP(decay in 100 min) = 1 - e^(-\u03bb*100)\n\nGiven that P(decay in 100 min) = 32% = 0.32, we can solve for \u03bb:\n\n0.32 = 1 - e^(-\u03bb*100)\ne^(-\u03bb*100) = 0.68\n-\u03bb*100 = ln(0.68)\n\u03bb = -ln(0.68)/100 \u2248 0.003769 per minute\n\nNow, we want to find the probability that the atom decays between 50 and 200 minutes. This can be calculated as:\n\nP(decay between 50 and 200 min) = P(decay in 200 min) - P(decay in 50 min)\n\nUsing the formula for the probability of decay within a certain time:\n\nP(decay in t min) = 1 - e^(-\u03bb*t)\n\nwe have:\n\nP(decay between 50 and 200 min) = [1 - e^(-\u03bb*200)] - [1 - e^(-\u03bb*50)]\nP(decay between 50 and 200 min) = e^(-\u03bb*50) - e^(-\u03bb*200)\n\nPlugging in the value of \u03bb:\n\nP(decay between 50 and 200 min) \u2248 e^(-0.003769*50) - e^(-0.003769*200)\nP(decay between 50 and 200 min) \u2248 0.817 - 0.372\nP(decay between 50 and 200 min) \u2248 0.445\n\nTherefore, the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes is approximately 44.5%.\n\nThe closest answer choice is C. 44%."
