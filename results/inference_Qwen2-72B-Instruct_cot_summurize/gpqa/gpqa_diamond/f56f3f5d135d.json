                    "text": "The problem describes a scenario where a spin-1/2 particle with magnetic moment \\(\\mu = \\gamma S_z\\) experiences an abrupt change in the direction of the external magnetic field. Initially, the field is in the \\(+\\hat{z}\\) direction, and then it is suddenly switched to the \\(+\\hat{y}\\) direction.\n\nThe time evolution of the state of the particle can be described by the Schr\u00f6dinger equation in the presence of a magnetic field. When the magnetic field changes direction, the Hamiltonian of the system also changes, leading to a transition from one eigenstate to another. This transition causes the oscillations in the z-component of the particle's magnetic moment.\n\nThe new Hamiltonian in the presence of the magnetic field in the \\(+\\hat{y}\\) direction is given by:\n\n\\[H = -\\mu \\cdot B = -\\gamma S_y B\\]\n\nThe energy eigenstates of this Hamiltonian are not the same as the eigenstates of \\(S_z\\). In fact, they correspond to the eigenstates of \\(S_y\\), which are linear combinations of the \\(|+\\rangle\\) and \\(|-\\rangle\\) states (the eigenstates of \\(S_z\\)). Therefore, when the magnetic field is switched, the particle's state will evolve into a superposition of these two states, causing the expectation value of \\(S_z\\) to oscillate.\n\nThe frequency of these oscillations is determined by the energy difference between the two eigenstates of the new Hamiltonian. For a spin-1/2 particle, this energy difference is given by:\n\n\\[\\Delta E = 2\\gamma B\\]\n\nThe frequency of oscillation (\\(\\nu\\)) is related to the energy difference through Planck's constant (\\(h\\)):\n\n\\[\\nu = \\frac{\\Delta E}{2\\pi h} = \\frac{2\\gamma B}{2\\pi h} = \\frac{\\gamma B}{\\pi h}\\]\n\nHowever, since we're typically dealing with angular frequencies (\\(\\omega\\)) rather than regular frequencies, we should multiply by \\(2\\pi\\) to convert:\n\n\\[\\omega = 2\\pi\\nu = \\gamma B\\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer for the oscillation frequency is:\n\nC. \\(\\gamma B\\)\n\nThis result makes sense because the frequency of precession of a magnetic moment in a magnetic field is directly proportional to the strength of the field and the gyromagnetic ratio."
