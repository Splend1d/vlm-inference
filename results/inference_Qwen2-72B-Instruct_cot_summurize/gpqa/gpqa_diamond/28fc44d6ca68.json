                    "text": "Let's denote the mass of the lighter fragment as \\(m\\) and the mass of the heavier fragment as \\(2m\\). Given that the total rest mass of the two fragments is 99% of the original mass \\(M\\), we can write:\n\n\\[ m + 2m = 0.99M \\]\n\n\\[ 3m = 0.99M \\]\n\n\\[ m = 0.33M \\]\n\nSo the masses of the fragments are \\(0.33M\\) and \\(0.66M\\).\n\nThe total rest-mass energy before the fission was \\(300 \\text{ GeV}\\). After the fission, the total rest-mass energy of the two fragments will be:\n\n\\[ E_{rest} = 0.33M c^2 + 0.66M c^2 = 0.99Mc^2 \\]\n\nSince the total energy must be conserved, the kinetic energy released in the fission will be:\n\n\\[ E_{kinetic} = 300 \\text{ GeV} - 0.99Mc^2 \\]\n\nHowever, since \\(Mc^2 = 300 \\text{ GeV}\\), we have:\n\n\\[ E_{kinetic} = 300 \\text{ GeV} - 0.99 \\times 300 \\text{ GeV} = 3 \\text{ GeV} \\]\n\nThis is the total kinetic energy of both fragments.\n\nIn a center-of-momentum frame, the two fragments move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta. Let \\(p\\) be the magnitude of the momentum of each fragment. The total kinetic energy is then given by:\n\n\\[ E_{kinetic} = \\frac{p^2}{2m} + \\frac{p^2}{2(2m)} = \\frac{3p^2}{4m} \\]\n\nSetting this equal to the total kinetic energy gives:\n\n\\[ 3 \\text{ GeV} = \\frac{3p^2}{4m} \\]\n\n\\[ p^2 = 4m \\times 1 \\text{ GeV} \\]\n\nNow let's find the relativistic kinetic energy for the heavier fragment. The relativistic kinetic energy \\(T_1\\) is given by:\n\n\\[ T_1 = E - mc^2 = \\sqrt{m^2c^4 + p^2c^2} - mc^2 \\]\n\nSubstituting \\(m = 0.66M\\) and \\(p^2 = 4m \\times 1 \\text{ GeV}\\):\n\n\\[ T_1 = \\sqrt{(0.66M)^2c^4 + 4(0.66M)c^2 \\times 1 \\text{ GeV}} - 0.66Mc^2 \\]\n\n\\[ T_1 = \\sqrt{(0.66M)^2c^4 + 2.64Mc^2 \\times 1 \\text{ GeV}} - 0.66Mc^2 \\]\n\nThe non-relativistic approximation for the kinetic energy is given by:\n\n\\[ T_{1, nr} = \\frac{p^2}{2m} = \\frac{4(0.66M)c^2 \\times 1 \\text{ GeV}}{2(0.66M)} = 2 \\text{ GeV} \\]\n\nTo find the difference between the correct \\(T_1\\) and the non-relativistic approximation \\(T_{1, nr}\\), we need to calculate \\(T_1\\) exactly and subtract \\(2 \\text{ GeV}\\) from it. However, the exact calculation of \\(T_1\\) requires solving a quadratic equation under the square root, which is not straightforward without a calculator or numerical methods.\n\nGiven the options provided (A. 10 MeV, B. 2 MeV, C. 20 MeV, D. 5 MeV), we can estimate that the difference would likely be on the order of several MeV, considering that the non-relativistic approximation is generally less accurate at higher energies. Without calculating the exact value of \\(T_1\\), we cannot definitively choose between these options. However, based on the information given and the typical errors introduced by non-relativistic approximations at high energies, option A (10 MeV) seems like a plausible estimate for the difference between the correct \\(T_1\\) and its non-relativistic approximation."
