They depend on the specific matrix elements of the dipole operator between the states involved in the transitions, which can be calculated using quantum mechanics. Without detailed calculations, it is not possible to determine which of the probabilities given in the options is correct. In practice, the branching ratios would be obtained from either experimental data or precise theoretical calculations.\n\nTo summarize, all transitions mentioned in the options are allowed based on the selection rules, but the probabilities provided require further calculation to confirm their accuracy."
