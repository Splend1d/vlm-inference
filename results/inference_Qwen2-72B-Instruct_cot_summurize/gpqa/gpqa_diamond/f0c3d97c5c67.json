Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive.\n\nWhile it's true that dual catalyst systems are used industrially for polymerization, and specific activators are required, the key point here is about introducing regular branches in the polymer backbone using only ethylene. Noble metals like platinum or palladium can indeed be used for such purposes due to their ability to perform specific types of catalysis, but they are often avoided because of their high cost. Group VIa transition metals typically refer to chromium (Cr), molybdenum (Mo), and tungsten (W), which are not usually associated with this type of catalysis, especially for introducing regular branching. Aluminum-based activators are commonly used in Ziegler-Natta catalyst systems for polymerization but might not be suitable for the specific additional reaction step required for introducing regular branches. However, the statement about aluminum activators not working is not universally true for all cases of branch introduction; it could be context-specific to the process being discussed. Therefore, based on the information provided, option B is the most directly correct answer."
