However, we also need to consider the thermal energy at room temperature, which is much larger than the uncertainty in energy due to the lifetime of the states.\n\nTherefore, the energy difference between the two states should be significantly larger than 2.5*10^-3 eV (the thermal energy at room temperature). Among the given options, only option A (10^-4 eV) satisfies this condition.\n\nAnswer: A. 10^-4 eV. However, it's worth noting that this value is still relatively small compared to the thermal energy at room temperature, and may not be easily resolved in practice. In reality, the energy difference would need to be even larger to ensure clear resolution of the two energy levels."
