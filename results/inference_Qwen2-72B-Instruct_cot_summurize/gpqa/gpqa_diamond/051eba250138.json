                    "text": "To find the concentration of orthophosphate ions (\\(PO_4^{3-}\\)) in the solution, we need to consider the equilibrium reactions of phosphate species and their respective \\(K_a\\) values. However, given the \\(K_a\\) values provided, we can primarily focus on the second dissociation step because it's the one that produces \\(HPO_4^{2-}\\), which can then undergo the third dissociation step to produce \\(PO_4^{3-}\\).\n\nThe reaction for the second dissociation step is:\n\\[HPO_4^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons H^+ + PO_4^{3-}\\]\n\nwith a \\(K_a2 = 6.2 \\times 10^{-8}\\).\n\nFirst, let's calculate the initial concentrations of \\(KH_2PO_4\\) and \\(Na_2HPO_4\\cdot2H_2O\\) before any dissociation occurs.\n\nThe molarities (\\([M]\\)) of \\(KH_2PO_4\\) and \\(Na_2HPO_4\\cdot2H_2O\\) can be calculated as follows:\n\nFor \\(KH_2PO_4\\):\n\\[ [M] = \\frac{mass}{molar~mass \\times volume~in~L} = \\frac{1.00~g}{136.09~g/mol \\times 0.200~L} = 0.367~M\\]\n\nFor \\(Na_2HPO_4\\cdot2H_2O\\):\n\\[ [M] = \\frac{mass}{molar~mass \\times volume~in~L} = \\frac{1.00~g}{177.99~g/mol \\times 0.200~L} = 0.281~M\\]\n\nInitially, there is no \\(PO_4^{3-}\\) or free \\(H^+\\) from these compounds (assuming water's contribution to \\(H^+\\) is negligible at this pH scale). Let's assume the change in concentration due to dissociation is \\(x\\). Thus, after dissociation:\n\n\\[ [HPO_4^{2-}] = 0.367~M - x + 0.281~M = 0.648~M - x \\]\n\\[ [H^+] = x \\]\n\\[ [PO_4^{3-}] = x \\]\n\nThe expression for the equilibrium constant \\(K_a2\\) is:\n\\[ K_a2 = \\frac{[H^+][PO_4^{3-}]}{[HPO_4^{2-}]} \\]\n\nSubstituting the expressions for the concentrations gives us:\n\\[ 6.2 \\times 10^{-8} = \\frac{x \\times x}{0.648 - x} \\]\n\nSolving this quadratic equation for \\(x\\) gives us the concentration of \\(PO_4^{3-}\\) ions. Since \\(x\\) will be small compared to \\(0.648\\), we can approximate \\(0.648 - x\\) by \\(0.648\\).\n\n\\[ 6.2 \\times 10^{-8} = \\frac{x^2}{0.648} \\]\n\n\\[ x^2 = 6.2 \\times 10^{-8} \\times 0.648 \\]\n\n\\[ x^2 = 4.0176 \\times 10^{-8} \\]\n\n\\[ x = \\sqrt{4.0176 \\times 10^{-8}} \\]\n\n\\[ x = 6.34 \\times 10^{-4} M \\]\n\nHowever, this value seems significantly higher than any of the options provided, indicating an error in either the calculation or assumptions made. Given the \\(K_a\\) values and the fact that \\(PO_4^{3-}\\) is produced via a much weaker acid's dissociation, the concentration should indeed be much lower, in line with the \\(K_a3\\) value.\n\nUpon reevaluation, considering the \\(K_a3\\) value for the \\(PO_4^{3-}\\) formation directly and the fact that the concentration of \\(HPO_4^{2-}\\) is significantly higher than what would result from the \\(PO_4^{3-}\\) concentration, the correct approach is to use \\(K_a3\\) to estimate the \\(PO_4^{3-}\\) concentration, recognizing that the \\(PO_4^{3-}\\) concentration will be approximately equal to the \\([H^+]\\) produced in the third dissociation step.\n\nGiven the \\(K_a3\\) value and the approximation that the \\([HPO_4^{2-}]\\) concentration is much greater than the \\([PO_4^{3-}]\\) concentration, we can simplify the calculation to:\n\\[ [PO_4^{3-}] \\approx \\sqrt{K_a3 \\times [HPO_4^{2-}]} \\]\n\n\\[ [PO_4^{3-}] \\approx \\sqrt{1.8 \\times 10^{-12} \\times 0.648} \\]\n\n\\[ [PO_4^{3-}] \\approx \\sqrt{1.1664 \\times 10^{-12}} \\]\n\n\\[ [PO_4^{3-}] \\approx 1.08 \\times 10^{-6} M \\]\n\nThis value is still not among the options, but it suggests that the concentration of \\(PO_4^{3-}\\) ions is likely in the range of \\(10^{-6}\\) M, which is closest to option B. However, none of the provided options exactly match the calculated value, indicating potential rounding errors or simplifications in the calculation process. Given the options, the closest match to our calculated value is:\n\nB. 2.81x10^-7 M\n\nBut based on the detailed calculations, this answer may not be exact, highlighting the importance of understanding the underlying chemistry and mathematical processes involved."
