                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of the Hill sphere and the stability criterion for the orbits of two planets in the same system. The Hill sphere is the region around a planet where its gravitational influence dominates over the gravitational influence of the central star. The stability criterion states that the semi-major axis of the inner planet (in this case, the planet with 1 Earth radius) must be at least about 2/3 of the Hill sphere radius of the outer planet (the one with 2.5 Earth radii) for their orbits to be stable.\n\nThe Hill sphere radius (R_H) of a planet can be calculated using the formula:\n\nR_H = a * (m / (3M))^1/3\n\nwhere:\n- a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit,\n- m is the mass of the planet,\n- M is the mass of the star.\n\nWe know that the mass of a planet is proportional to its volume, which is proportional to its radius cubed. Therefore, if the radius of the first planet is 1 Earth radius, its mass is m_1 = m_E, where m_E is the mass of the Earth. Similarly, if the radius of the second planet is 2.5 times that of the Earth, its mass is m_2 = 2.5^3 * m_E = 15.625 * m_E.\n\nThe mass of the star is given as 1.5 times that of the Sun, so M = 1.5 * M_Sun.\n\nUsing the stability criterion, we have:\n\na_1 + 2/3 * R_H2 >= a_2\n\nwhere:\n- a_1 is the semi-major axis of the first planet,\n- a_2 is the semi-major axis of the second planet,\n- R_H2 is the Hill sphere radius of the second planet.\n\nSince the first planet has an orbital period of 3 days, we can calculate its semi-major axis using Kepler's third law:\n\nP^2 = (4 * pi^2 / G * M) * a^3\n\nwhere:\n- P is the orbital period,\n- G is the gravitational constant.\n\nSolving for a_1, we get:\n\na_1 = (P^2 * G * M / (4 * pi^2))^(1/3)\n\nSubstituting the values, we get:\n\na_1 = (3^2 * G * 1.5 * M_Sun / (4 * pi^2))^(1/3) = 0.047 AU\n\nNow, we can calculate the Hill sphere radius of the second planet:\n\nR_H2 = a_2 * (m_2 / (3M))^1/3\n\nUsing the stability criterion, we have:\n\na_1 + 2/3 * R_H2 >= a_2\n\nSubstituting the expression for R_H2, we get:\n\na_1 + 2/3 * a_2 * (m_2 / (3M))^1/3 >= a_2\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\na_2 <= 3/2 * a_1 * (3M / m_2)^1/3\n\nSubstituting the values, we get:\n\na_2 <= 3/2 * 0.047 AU * (3 * 1.5 * M_Sun / 15.625 * m_E)^1/3 = 0.189 AU\n\nFinally, we can calculate the maximum orbital period of the second planet using Kepler's third law again:\n\nP_2^2 = (4 * pi^2 / G * M) * a_2^3\n\nSubstituting the values, we get:\n\nP_2 <= (4 * pi^2 / G * 1.5 * M_Sun) * 0.189^3 = 33.5 days\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. ~ 33.5."
