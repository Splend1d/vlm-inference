(i) LDA, DME (ii) CH3CH2I (iii) H3O+ B = pentan-2-one + N,N-dimethylethanamine.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe given starting material is an enamine salt, which is a conjugate acid of an enamine. The first step involves deprotonation of the enamine salt using a strong base like LDA (Lithium Diisopropylamide) in DME (1,2-Dimethoxyethane) solvent. This forms the enolate ion. \n\nIn the second step, the enolate ion reacts with an alkyl halide (CH3CH2I) to form a new carbon-carbon bond, leading to the formation of a tertiary amine. \n\nFinally, the addition of acid (H3O+) leads to the protonation of the amine and the cleavage of the amine-carbonyl bond, resulting in the formation of the ketone (pentan-2-one) and the release of the amine (N,N-dimethylethanamine). \n\nTherefore, the correct sequence of reagents and the product of the reaction is as follows: \n\n(i) LDA, DME (ii) CH3CH2I (iii) H3O+ B = pentan-2-one + N,N-dimethylethanamine."
