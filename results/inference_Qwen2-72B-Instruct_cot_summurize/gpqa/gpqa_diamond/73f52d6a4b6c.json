The substrate is an allylic amine, and under the influence of acid and heat, the reaction will proceed to form (Z)-1-(but-2-en-2-yloxy)ethen-1-amine.\n\nB. The second reaction involves a Claisen rearrangement, which is a [3,3] sigmatropic rearrangement. The substrate is a cumulene, and upon heating, it will undergo a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement to form (3Z,4E)-3,4-diethylidenecyclobut-1-ene.\n\nC. The third reaction involves a [1,5]-hydride shift, which is also a type of sigmatropic rearrangement. The substrate is a vinyl ether, and under the influence of heat, the reaction will proceed to form 4-methylenehexanal.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. A = (Z)-1-(but-2-en-2-yloxy)ethen-1-amine, B = (3Z,4E)-3,4-diethylidenecyclobut-1-ene, C = 4-methylenehexanal. \n\nHowever, it's important to note that in actuality, the third reaction could produce either an alcohol or an aldehyde depending on the conditions and the stability of the intermediate formed. But based on the options given, D is the most appropriate choice."
