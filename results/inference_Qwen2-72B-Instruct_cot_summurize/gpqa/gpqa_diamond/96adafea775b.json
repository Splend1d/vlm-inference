This equation assumes that there is only one type of charge carrier (either electrons or holes), that all carriers are generated at one electrode and collected at the other, that there are no traps to capture the carriers, and that the electric field is uniform across the device. It also assumes that the diffusion current is negligible compared to the drift current."
