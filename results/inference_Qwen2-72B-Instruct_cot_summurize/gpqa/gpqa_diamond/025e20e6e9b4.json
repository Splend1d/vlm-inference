You are interested in the iPSCs fate in the embryo and their co-localization with apoptotic events. The iPSC cells are labeled with a mRaspberry fused under a lineage-specific promoter for each cell type. You inject the dedifferentiated cells into the 32-cell stage blastocyst and track them over 48. Every 12 h, you prepare embryos with the TUNEL - FITC staining and observe under the confocal microscope.\n\nWhat is the first thing you notice?\n\nA. cytoplasmic localization of the red signal\nB. there is no green signal\nC. cell line-specific red signals label different organelles\nD. green signal colocalizes with the red signal\n"

The mRaspberry fluorescent protein, which is red, would be the only visible signal at this point, marking the location of the injected iPSCs. After performing the TUNEL-FITC staining every 12 hours, you would then be able to observe the green signal that indicates apoptotic events, and subsequently look for any co-localization with the red signal from the iPSCs."
