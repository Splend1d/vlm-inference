You then develop a real time PCR kit for quick and accurate diagnosis.\n\nSince the infectious agent is a retrovirus, it contains RNA as its genetic material. Therefore, you need to perform cDNA (complementary DNA) sequencing to obtain the DNA sequence complementary to the viral RNA. This will allow you to identify specific regions of the viral genome that can be targeted for detection. Once you have identified these regions, you can design primers and probes for a real time PCR (polymerase chain reaction) assay. Real time PCR is a sensitive and specific technique that allows for the rapid amplification and quantification of nucleic acids, making it an ideal choice for the development of a molecular diagnostic kit for the detection of a viral infection. The kit would include all necessary reagents and instructions for use, allowing for quick and accurate diagnosis of the retroviral infection."
