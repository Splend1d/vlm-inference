                    "text": "To calculate the probability that the measurement of the observable \\(P\\) yields 0 at time \\(t\\), we need to understand how quantum mechanics treats measurements. In this context, an observable is represented by a Hermitian operator, and the probabilities of measuring different eigenvalues of this operator correspond to the squared amplitudes of the projection of the state onto the eigenvectors of the operator associated with those eigenvalues.\n\nGiven the state vector \\(\\left| \\psi \\right\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\\) and the observable \\(P\\) represented by the matrix:\n\n\\[P = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\\\ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\\\ 0 & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\\]\n\nFirst, find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of \\(P\\). The characteristic equation for \\(P\\) is given by:\n\n\\[\\det(P - \\lambda I) = 0\\]\n\nWhere \\(I\\) is the identity matrix and \\(\\lambda\\) represents the eigenvalues. For \\(P\\):\n\n\\[\\begin{vmatrix} -\\lambda & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\\\ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & -\\lambda & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\\\ 0 & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & -\\lambda \\end{vmatrix} = 0\\]\n\nSolving for \\(\\lambda\\) yields three eigenvalues: \\(\\lambda_1 = 0\\), \\(\\lambda_2 = \\sqrt{2}\\), and \\(\\lambda_3 = -\\sqrt{2}\\).\n\nNext, find the eigenvectors corresponding to each eigenvalue. We only care about the eigenvector(s) corresponding to \\(\\lambda = 0\\), since the question asks for the probability of measuring 0.\n\nFor \\(\\lambda = 0\\), solve the homogeneous system:\n\n\\[\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\\\ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\\\ 0 & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\\\ z \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\\]\n\nThis leads to two equations (\\(y = 0\\) and \\(x + z = 0\\)). Thus, the eigenvector corresponding to \\(\\lambda = 0\\) can be chosen as \\(\\left| \\phi \\right\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}\\) or any scalar multiple thereof.\n\nNow, calculate the probability of finding the system in the state described by the eigenvector \\(\\left| \\phi \\right\\rangle\\) when the initial state is \\(\\left| \\psi \\right\\rangle\\):\n\n\\[p = \\left| \\left\\langle \\phi | \\psi \\right\\rangle \\right|^2 = \\left| \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(-1 - 1) \\right|^2 = \\left| -\\sqrt{2} \\right|^2 = 2\\]\n\nHowever, this result is not directly interpretable as a probability because it exceeds 1. The issue lies in normalizing the eigenvector and the state vector. Both should have unit norm. Normalizing \\(\\left| \\psi \\right\\rangle\\) and \\(\\left| \\phi \\right\\rangle\\):\n\n\\[\\left| \\psi \\right\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}}\\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\\]\n\n\\[\\left| \\phi \\right\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}\\]\n\nRe-calculating the probability using normalized vectors:\n\n\\[p = \\left| \\left\\langle \\phi | \\psi \\right\\rangle \\right|^2 = \\left| \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}}(-1 - 1) \\right|^2 = \\left| -\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3} \\right|^2 = \\frac{1}{3}\\]\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\nB. \\(1/3\\)"
