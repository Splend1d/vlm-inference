                    "text": "The compound with the formula C9H11NO2 and the given spectral data is most likely A. ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.\n\nExplanation:\n\n- The IR spectrum shows absorption bands at 3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1, which are characteristic of primary amine groups (-NH2). This suggests that the compound contains an amine group.\n- The strong band at 1720 cm-1 indicates the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O), which is consistent with either an ester or amide functional group.\n- In the 1H NMR spectrum:\n    - The triplet at 1.20 ppm (3H) corresponds to an ethyl group.\n    - The broad singlet at 4.0 ppm (2H) could be due to an NH group or an OH group, but in this context, it's more likely to be an NH group because of the amine functionality suggested by the IR data.\n    - The quartet at 4.5 ppm (2H) is characteristic of an ethyl ester linkage (-COOCH2CH3).\n    - The doublets at 7.0 ppm (2H) and 8.0 ppm (2H) are indicative of aromatic protons. The fact that they appear as doublets suggests that there are two sets of equivalent aromatic protons, which is typical for a benzene ring with substituents in the para position relative to each other.\n    \nPutting all these pieces together, the compound is most likely an aromatic compound containing an amine group, an ester group, and an ethyl group. Ethyl 4-aminobenzoate (option A) fits this description perfectly. The other options do not match the spectral data as closely. For example, option B has an amide group instead of an ester group, option C has a formamide group which does not match the NMR data, and option D has a propionate group which would give different NMR signals than those observed."
