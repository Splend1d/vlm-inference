This is because ring-closing metathesis (RCM) typically involves the formation of a cyclic alkene from an acyclic diene. The diene must have substituents in positions that allow the formation of the desired ring size and structure upon cyclization. In this case, the desired product is a cyclohexene with specific substitution patterns. To achieve this, the starting material should be a diene that can cyclize to form a six-membered ring with the substituents at the appropriate positions. Answer D has the required substituents (isopropyl, methyl, and methyl) in the right positions to form the target compound via RCM."
