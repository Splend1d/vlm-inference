                    "text": "The key to solving this problem is understanding that the total momentum must be conserved in the annihilation process. Since the electron and positron are moving along the horizontal axis, their momenta will cancel each other out in the horizontal direction, leaving only vertical components for the photons. This means that the photons must have equal and opposite vertical momenta to conserve momentum in the vertical direction.\n\nLet's denote the energy of each photon as \\(E\\). According to Einstein's equation, \\(E = \\gamma mc^2\\), where \\(\\gamma\\) is the Lorentz factor, \\(m\\) is the rest mass, and \\(c\\) is the speed of light. For photons, which are massless, the energy is given by \\(E = pc\\), where \\(p\\) is the momentum of the photon. Thus, the momentum of each photon is \\(p = E/c\\).\n\nSince the momenta of the two photons are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction (to conserve momentum), we can write:\n\n\\[p_{\\text{upper}} = p_{\\text{lower}}\\]\n\nAnd since \\(p = E/c\\), we get:\n\n\\[E_{\\text{upper}}/c = E_{\\text{lower}}/c\\]\n\nGiven that the energies of the photons are the same, we can say that their momenta are also the same. Now, let's consider the angles the photons make with the horizontal axis. Let \\(\\theta\\) be the angle made by one photon with the horizontal, then the other photon makes an angle of \\(-\\theta\\) with the horizontal (since they are symmetrically placed about the horizontal axis).\n\nUsing trigonometry, the vertical component of the momentum of the upper photon is \\(p\\sin(\\theta)\\), and for the lower photon, it's \\(-p\\sin(\\theta)\\). These must cancel each other out to conserve momentum in the vertical direction:\n\n\\[p\\sin(\\theta) + (-p\\sin(\\theta)) = 0\\]\n\nThis confirms our earlier conclusion that the momenta are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. However, this doesn't directly give us the angle. To find the angle, we need to consider the conservation of momentum in the horizontal direction. Since the electron and positron had momenta in the horizontal direction before collision, and the photons have no horizontal momentum after collision (as they are moving at angles above and below the horizontal), the initial momenta must have canceled out. This implies that the electron and positron must have had equal and opposite momenta, leading to the photons being emitted at equal and opposite angles to maintain horizontal momentum conservation.\n\nSince the question states that one photon is moving in the upper-right direction and the other in the lower-right direction, the angle between them is simply twice the angle one photon makes with the horizontal. Given the options provided, the answer must be related to these angles.\n\nThe answer choices suggest that we're looking for the total angle between the two photons, not the individual angles they make with the horizontal. Considering the symmetry and the fact that the photons are moving in opposite directions relative to the horizontal axis, the total angle between them would be close to 180 degrees if they were moving nearly parallel to the horizontal axis. However, since the electron and positron had significant horizontal momentum, the photons must be emitted at a significant angle away from the horizontal to conserve momentum.\n\nAmong the given options, **C. 172** is the closest to 180 degrees, suggesting that the photons are emitted at a small angle away from the horizontal, which is consistent with the conservation of momentum in this scenario. Therefore, the correct answer is **C. 172** degrees."
