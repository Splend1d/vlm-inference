The other substituents must be listed as prefixes according to their positions on the benzene ring.\n\nThe highest priority groups are:\n1. Carboxylic acid (-COOH)\n2. Nitrile (-CN)\n3. Aldehyde (-CHO)\n4. Alcohol (-OH)\n5. Amino group (-N(CH3)2)\n6. Methoxy group (-OCH3)\n\nThe positions are described relative to the carboxylic acid, which is placed at position 1. The substituents are all meta to each other, meaning they are 1,3,5 positions on the benzene ring. The nitrile and the aldehyde are thus at positions 3 and 5, respectively, and the methoxy group is at position 4. The alcohol and dimethylamino groups are ortho to the carboxylic acid, so they are at positions 2 and 6, respectively.\n\nThe IUPAC name should list the substituents in alphabetical order with respect to their locants (positions). Thus, we have:\n\n- 2-hydroxy (for the -OH at position 2)\n- 3-cyano (for the -CN at position 3)\n- 4-methoxy (for the -OCH3 at position 4)\n- 5-formyl (for the -CHO at position 5)\n- 6-(dimethylamino) (for the -N(CH3)2 at position 6)\n\nPutting it all together, the correct IUPAC name is:\n\n**3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**\n\nSo, the answer is **C. 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**."
