The product will be formed via the addition of the enolate of ethyl acrylate to the carbonyl group of the ketone. The major product will be the one that forms with the least steric hindrance, which means the substituent on the enolate will be placed at the position that has the least substitution on the cyclohexane ring. Therefore, the ethyl group will be placed at the 4-position of the cyclohexane ring, leading to the formation of ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate.\n\nThe second reaction is a Gabriel synthesis of primary amines using nitroalkanes and nitriles. In this case, 1-nitropropane reacts with (E)-but-2-enenitrile in the presence of KOH and water to form an amine. However, the final product is oxidized to a nitrile, which indicates that there is an additional step involving oxidation. The major product will be the one that forms with the least steric hindrance, which means the methyl group will be placed at the position that has the least substitution. Therefore, the methyl group will be placed at the 3-position of the hexane chain, leading to the formation of 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile."
