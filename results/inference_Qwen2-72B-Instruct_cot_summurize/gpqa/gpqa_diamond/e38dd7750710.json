These double bonds act as a good Lewis acid and react with nucleophiles to produce enolate ions. In this case, when a nucleophile attacks the \u03b2 position, it produces a resonance-stabilized intermediate. When a nucleophile attacking the \u03b2-carbon is enolate, such reaction is known as the Michael reaction.\nWhat are the reactants and major final products of the following Michael addition reactions?\ndimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) -->(A)\n1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + (MeOH, H3O+) --> (B)\nC + but-3-en-2-one + (KOH, H2O) ---> 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione\n\nA.

                    "text": "The Michael addition is a conjugate addition of a nucleophile to an \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated carbonyl compound. The products are formed by adding the nucleophile across the double bond of the \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated carbonyl compound.\n\nFor reaction (A), dimethyl malonate is reacting with methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of sodium ethoxide (NaOEt) in ethanol (EtOH). Sodium ethoxide is a strong base which can deprotonate dimethyl malonate to form its enolate ion. This enolate ion then acts as a nucleophile and adds across the double bond of the acrylate ester, producing a resonance-stabilized intermediate. The final product will be a 1,5-dicarbonyl compound where the malonate group is attached to the \u03b2-position of the acrylate ester. Therefore, the product for reaction (A) should be trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate.\n\nFor reaction (B), 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine is reacting with (E)-but-2-enenitrile in methanol (MeOH) in the presence of acid (H3O+). Piperidine is a basic nitrogenous heterocycle that can be protonated by the acid, forming a positively charged species that acts as a nucleophile. This nucleophile then adds across the double bond of the acrylonitrile, producing a resonance-stabilized intermediate. The final product will be a \u03b2-keto nitrile where the cyclohexene ring is attached to the \u03b2-position of the acrylonitrile. Therefore, the product for reaction (B) should be 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile.\n\nFor reaction (C), but-3-en-2-one is reacting with cyclohexane-1,3-dione in the presence of potassium hydroxide (KOH) in water (H2O). Potassium hydroxide is a strong base which can deprotonate the enone to form its enolate ion. This enolate ion then acts as a nucleophile and adds across the double bond of the cyclohexane-1,3-dione, producing a resonance-stabilized intermediate. The final product will be a 1,3-diketone compound where the but-3-en-2-one is attached to the cyclohexane-1,3-dione at the \u03b2-position. Therefore, the product for reaction (C) should be 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione. However, there seems to be a mistake in the product for reaction (C) since the correct product should not contain a hydroxy group. The correct product for reaction (C) should be 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione."
