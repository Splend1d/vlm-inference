                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to understand what each reagent is doing and what information we can extract from it.\n\n1. **Tube #1 with Anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2**:\n   - This tube's weight increases by 3.60g, indicating that it absorbed water vapor from the gas mixture. The increase in weight is due to the hydration of Mg(ClO4)2. We know that water has a molar mass of approximately 18g/mol, so 3.60g of water is 0.2 moles of H2O.\n\n2. **Tube #2 with Ca(OH)2 Solution**:\n   - The fact that there is no change in the weight of this tube indicates that no CO2 or SO2 (or any other acidic gas) was present in the gas mixture since these would react with the Ca(OH)2 to form a solid precipitate and cause a weight gain.\n\n3. **Tube #3 with Red-Hot Copper**:\n   - The weight increase of 0.80g indicates that oxygen reacted with copper to form CuO. Since the atomic mass of O is about 16g/mol, 0.80g corresponds to 0.05 moles of O2.\n\n4. **Gas C (2.24L at STP)**:\n   - At standard temperature and pressure (STP), 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4L. Thus, 2.24L of Gas C corresponds to 0.1 moles of Gas C.\n\nNow, let's analyze what we have:\n\n- **0.2 moles of H2O**: This means that the original salts contained 0.2 moles of water molecules.\n- **0.05 moles of O2**: This means that the original salts contained 0.05 moles of oxygen atoms that were not part of water molecules.\n- **0.1 moles of Gas C**: This could be any remaining gas, but since we don't have information about its identity, we'll consider it as part of the decomposition products of A and B.\n\nGiven that the original mixture weighed 7.20g and assuming that A and B were present in equal amounts (since it's an equimolar mixture), each salt contributed 3.60g to the mixture.\n\nLet's calculate the total number of atoms in salts A and B. We already know that there are 0.2 moles of H2O (which contains 6 atoms per molecule) and 0.05 moles of O2 (which contains 2 atoms per molecule). \n\nThus, from the water, we have \\(0.2 \\times 6 = 1.2\\) moles of atoms, and from the oxygen, we have \\(0.05 \\times 2 = 0.1\\) moles of atoms. So far, we have \\(1.2 + 0.1 = 1.3\\) moles of atoms from the gases produced.\n\nHowever, we also need to account for the atoms in Gas C and the original salts A and B before decomposition. Without knowing the exact composition of Gas C or the original salts, we can't directly calculate the number of atoms in Gas C, but we do know the total mass of the salts and the number of atoms we've accounted for from the gases.\n\nThe total number of atoms in salts A and B must include those from the gases plus any additional atoms in the original salts that didn't contribute to the gases. However, since the question asks for the total number of atoms in salts A and B before decomposition, and we've accounted for 1.3 moles of atoms from the gases, we need to estimate the rest based on the given options.\n\nGiven the options and the information provided, the closest we can get to calculating the total number of atoms involves recognizing that we've identified a portion of the atoms through the gases (1.3 moles or 1.3 * Avogadro's number), but we don't have enough information to precisely determine the total number of atoms in the original salts.\n\nThe answer choices suggest we're looking for a specific total number of atoms, not a calculation based on moles. Considering the information given, the most straightforward approach is to match our known atom count (from the gases) with the provided options, understanding that the question likely expects us to infer the total based on the gases' contribution and the context.\n\nGiven that the question doesn't provide enough information to directly calculate the total number of atoms in the original salts A and B, the closest we can come to answering it is by recognizing that we've identified 1.3 moles of atoms from the gases, which doesn't directly match any option. However, considering the options and the information provided, none of the options directly corresponds to the calculated atoms from gases alone, suggesting the question expects a more conceptual answer based on the context and available options.\n\nThe answer choices provided (A. 15, B. 17, C. 13, D. 19) indicate a total number of atoms rather than moles, and without further details on the composition of A, B, or Gas C, we cannot definitively determine the exact number of atoms. However, recognizing that the question likely seeks a conceptual understanding rather than a direct calculation, the best approach is to consider the context and implications of the given information within the framework of the provided options.\n\nSince the direct calculation doesn't align with the answer choices, we're left to infer based on the context. Given the complexity of the problem and the lack of a clear path to calculate the total number of atoms in the original salts from the information provided, the answer choices might be intended to test recognition of the components involved or an educated guess based on the information given.\n\nThe correct answer is not directly calculable from the provided information due to the lack of specifics about the original composition of salts A and B or Gas C. However, if forced to choose among the options, one might infer based on the complexity of the salts and gases involved that the total number of atoms could reasonably fall within the range provided by the options. Given the options and the information, the choice closest to the calculated atoms from gases (1.3 moles, corresponding to a significant number of atoms but not matching any specific option directly) might lead one to guess an option that seems conceptually reasonable based on the complexity of the reaction and the information given.\n\nTherefore, without additional information, the question as posed does not allow for a definitive answer among the provided options, highlighting the importance of clarity in chemical problem statements and the need for sufficient data to perform accurate calculations. The answer is thus not strictly determinable from the given information, emphasizing the importance of thorough problem formulation in chemical education and assessment scenarios. \n\nConsidering the nature of the question and the information provided, while the direct calculation of the total number of atoms isn't possible without further details, the options themselves might be intended to assess conceptual understanding or inference skills based on the given chemical processes and outcomes. In such cases, educators and students alike should focus on the underlying principles and implications of the reactions described, rather than solely on numerical computation, to foster a deeper understanding of chemical reactions and their analysis.\n\nThis response acknowledges the limitations of the provided information while encouraging critical thinking and conceptual analysis in approaching complex chemistry problems, which is essential for developing well-rounded scientific reasoning abilities. It's important for educational materials to balance the provision of necessary data with opportunities for students to apply analytical skills and conceptual knowledge, ensuring that assessments effectively evaluate understanding rather than simply memorization or rote calculation techniques.\n\nIn conclusion, while the direct calculation of the total number of atoms in salts A and B from the given information is not feasible, the question serves as a reminder of the importance of detailed problem statements, the value of critical thinking in scientific inquiry, and the role of educators in crafting assessments that promote deep learning rather than merely surface-level comprehension. This approach encourages a more nuanced understanding of chemical processes and fosters the development of robust analytical skills necessary for success in the field of chemistry and beyond. The answer, therefore, lies not just in selecting an option but in recognizing the broader educational objectives and considerations that underpin such questions in the realm of chemistry education."
