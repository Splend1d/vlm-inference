                    "text": "The mean decay distance (L) of a particle can be calculated using the following formula:\n\n\\[ L = \\frac{\\hbar c \\cdot \\beta}{\\Gamma} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\(\\hbar\\) is the reduced Planck constant (\\(1.0545718 \\times 10^{-34}\\) J s),\n- \\(c\\) is the speed of light in vacuum (\\(3.00 \\times 10^8\\) m/s),\n- \\(\\beta\\) is the velocity of the particle divided by the speed of light,\n- \\(\\Gamma\\) is the decay width of the particle.\n\nThe velocity of the particle in terms of the speed of light can be calculated from its total energy (\\(E\\)) and its rest mass (\\(m\\)). The total energy \\(E\\) is given by the relativistic equation:\n\n\\[ E^2 = p^2c^2 + m^2c^4 \\]\n\nwhere \\(p\\) is the momentum of the particle. For a particle at rest, \\(p=0\\), and we have:\n\n\\[ E_0 = mc^2 \\]\n\nHowever, since the particle is not at rest, we need to calculate its momentum from its total energy (\\(E_X = 8 GeV\\)) and rest mass (\\(m_X = 1.2 GeV/c^2\\)). Rearranging the energy equation for momentum gives us:\n\n\\[ p = \\sqrt{\\frac{E^2}{c^2} - m^2c^2} \\]\n\nLet's convert all energies into Joules before calculating. Remember that \\(1 GeV = 1.602176634 \\times 10^{-10} J\\).\n\n\\[ E_X = 8 GeV = 8 \\times 1.602176634 \\times 10^{-10} J = 1.2817413072 \\times 10^{-9} J \\]\n\\[ m_X = 1.2 GeV = 1.2 \\times 1.602176634 \\times 10^{-10} J = 1.9226119608 \\times 10^{-10} J \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the momentum:\n\n\\[ p = \\sqrt{\\frac{(1.2817413072 \\times 10^{-9} J)^2}{(3.00 \\times 10^8 m/s)^2} - (1.9226119608 \\times 10^{-10} J)^2} = \\sqrt{5.4777514784 \\times 10^{-19} - 3.6982444629 \\times 10^{-19}} = \\sqrt{1.7795070155 \\times 10^{-19}} = 4.218439177 \\times 10^{-10} kg \\cdot m/s \\]\n\nThen, the velocity (\\(v\\)) can be calculated as:\n\n\\[ v = \\frac{p}{m} = \\frac{4.218439177 \\times 10^{-10} kg \\cdot m/s}{1.9226119608 \\times 10^{-10} kg} = 2.194365262 m/s \\]\n\nBut this result doesn't make sense because it's much less than the speed of light. This is due to an error in our calculation. We should instead calculate the Lorentz factor (\\(\\gamma\\)) and use it to find \\(\\beta\\). The correct calculation should be:\n\n\\[ \\gamma = \\frac{E}{mc^2} = \\frac{1.2817413072 \\times 10^{-9} J}{1.9226119608 \\times 10^{-10} J / (3.00 \\times 10^8 m/s)^2} = \\frac{1.2817413072 \\times 10^{-9} J}{1.9226119608 \\times 10^{-10} J / 9.00 \\times 10^{16} m^2/s^2} = \\frac{1.2817413072 \\times 10^{-9} J}{2.136235512 \\times 10^{-26} J \\cdot m^2/s^2} = 6.00194933 \\]\n\nAnd then:\n\n\\[ \\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(6.00194933)^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{36.02339209}} = \\sqrt{1 - 0.0277588497} = \\sqrt{0.9722411503} = 0.9860223984 \\]\n\nFinally, the mean decay distance \\(L\\) is:\n\n\\[ L = \\frac{\\hbar c \\cdot \\beta}{\\Gamma} = \\frac{1.0545718 \\times 10^{-34} J \\cdot s \\cdot 3.00 \\times 10^8 m/s \\cdot 0.9860223984}{320 MeV} = \\frac{3.1637154 \\times 10^{-26} J \\cdot m}{320 \\times 1.602176634 \\times 10^{-13} J} = \\frac{3.1637154 \\times 10^{-26} J \\cdot m}{5.126965229 \\times 10^{-11} J} = 6.17109404 \\times 10^{-16} m \\]\n\nThis value does not match exactly with any of the provided options, but it is closest to option D. However, given the complexity of the calculations and potential rounding errors, it is recommended to double-check the values and calculations to ensure accuracy. Assuming no significant rounding or calculation errors, the answer would be closest to:\n\nD. 5.0223 * 10^-15 m\n\nHowever, this seems to be an order of magnitude off from our calculated value, which could indicate a mistake either in the calculation process or in the provided options. Given the exact calculations, the closest match in the options provided would still be D, but with the understanding that there may be a discrepancy based on the precise calculations."
