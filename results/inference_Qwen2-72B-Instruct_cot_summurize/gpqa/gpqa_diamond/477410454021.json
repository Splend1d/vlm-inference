                    "text": "For a one-dimensional infinite potential well, the energy levels for a single particle are given by:\n\n\\[ E_n = n^2 \\cdot \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2} = n^2 E \\]\n\nwhere \\(n\\) is the quantum number corresponding to the energy level.\n\nFor four identical spin-1/2 particles (like electrons), we need to consider the Pauli exclusion principle, which states that no two fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously within a quantum system. This means that each energy level can be occupied by at most two particles with opposite spins.\n\nLet's calculate the total energy of the system for the three cases:\n\n### Ground State\n\nIn the ground state, the lowest possible energy levels will be filled. The first two particles will occupy the \\(n=1\\) state, and the next two particles will occupy the \\(n=2\\) state. Therefore, the total energy of the system is:\n\n\\[ E_{total}^{(ground)} = 2E_1 + 2E_2 = 2\\cdot1^2E + 2\\cdot2^2E = 2E + 8E = 10E \\]\n\n### First Excited State\n\nThe first excited state could occur when one particle is moved to the \\(n=3\\) state while the rest remain as in the ground state. However, due to symmetry and considering the lowest possible energy configuration, we consider the scenario where two particles are in the \\(n=1\\) state and two particles are in the \\(n=3\\) state. This is because moving just one particle to the \\(n=3\\) state would not represent the lowest energy configuration for an \"excited state\" involving four particles. So, the total energy of this configuration is:\n\n\\[ E_{total}^{(1st\\ excited)} = 2E_1 + 2E_3 = 2\\cdot1^2E + 2\\cdot3^2E = 2E + 18E = 20E \\]\n\nHowever, since none of the options provided matches exactly 20E, we must reconsider the question's intention regarding the \"first excited state.\" Typically, it refers to the configuration with the minimum increase in energy from the ground state, which would involve only one particle being promoted to the next available energy level. In that case, if we promote one particle to the \\(n=2\\) state and leave the other three in the ground state (\\(n=1\\)), the total energy would be:\n\n\\[ E_{total}^{(1st\\ excited)} = 3E_1 + E_2 = 3\\cdot1^2E + 1\\cdot2^2E = 3E + 4E = 7E \\]\n\nBut since we're looking for the correct answer among the given options and considering the typical interpretation, let's move on to the next case.\n\n### Second Excited State\n\nThis would typically be the next step up from the first excited state, where another particle is promoted to a higher energy level. If we take the scenario where two particles are in the \\(n=1\\) state, one particle is in the \\(n=2\\) state, and one particle is in the \\(n=3\\) state, the total energy is:\n\n\\[ E_{total}^{(2nd\\ excited)} = 2E_1 + E_2 + E_3 = 2\\cdot1^2E + 1\\cdot2^2E + 1\\cdot3^2E = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E \\]\n\nHowever, based on the options provided, the most likely interpretation of the question intends us to understand the \"first excited state\" as the configuration with the least increase in energy from the ground state, which would then be when all particles are moved to the next energy level (n=2 for all) resulting in:\n\n\\[ E_{total}^{(1st\\ excited)} = 4E_2 = 4\\cdot2^2E = 16E \\]\n\nwhich isn't listed among the options. Given the options provided, the intended interpretation seems to be based on promoting particles to the next available energy level without necessarily considering the \"least increase\" criterion.\n\nGiven these considerations and the provided options, the most suitable interpretation for the question would lead us to choose **Option A** as the closest match to the calculated energies, understanding that there might be slight discrepancies due to differing interpretations of the \"excited states\":\n\nA. 4E, 10E, 15E\n\nHowever, it should be noted that the direct calculations based on promoting particles to the next available energy level from the ground state do not perfectly align with any of the provided options. The intended interpretation here seems to be based on promoting particles to the next available energy level without necessarily considering the \"least increase\" criterion, which leads us to select the option that best fits the calculated values under that interpretation."
