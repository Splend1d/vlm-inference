                    "text": "The given information about the NMR signals can help us determine the structure of the compound. Let's break it down:\n\n- Two signals corresponding to aromatic-H suggest there are at least two aromatic protons.\n- Two signals corresponding to vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets) imply there is an alkene group present in the molecule with different coupling patterns, which could indicate the presence of a substituent on one of the carbon atoms of the alkene.\n- Two signals corresponding to -CH3 groups suggest there are two methyl groups attached to the molecule.\n\nSince the compound is described as a disubstituted 6-membered aromatic ring with an ester group indicated by the FTIR spectrum, we know that the ester functionality (-COO-) must be part of the substitution pattern on the aromatic ring.\n\nGiven the absence of any -CH2 signals, we can infer that all carbons are either part of the aromatic ring, the ester group, or directly attached to the ring (like the methyl groups mentioned).\n\nLet's analyze the options based on the molecular formulas provided:\n\nA. C12H12O2\nB. C11H12O2\nC. C12H14O2\nD. C11H14O2\n\nThe benzene ring itself is C6H6. Since the compound is disubstituted, we need to add the substituents' formulae to the basic benzene formula. An ester group (-COO-) has the formula C2H2O2. We also have two methyl groups (-CH3), adding up to C2H6.\n\nConsidering these additions:\n- For the ester and two methyl groups, we have C4H8O2.\n- Adding this to the benzene ring gives us a total of C10H14O2.\n\nHowever, this doesn't match any of the options directly. This discrepancy arises from not accounting for hydrogen loss due to bonding within the ring structure. The ester group and methyl groups bond to the benzene ring, reducing the overall hydrogen count compared to if they were standalone entities.\n\nGiven the information and the options, the most suitable formula that matches the description of having an ester group, two methyl groups, and being consistent with the provided NMR data would be **C12H12O2** (Option A). This option accounts for the additional carbon atoms required by the ester group and potentially larger substituent(s) than just methyl groups, while maintaining the appropriate oxygen count for an ester and the correct hydrogen count considering the aromatic system. \n\nThus, the answer is **A. C12H12O2**."
