                    "text": "You perform a high-throughput experiment on white lupine to find genes contributing to resistance to the fungal disease anthracnose. As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function \u2013 G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3. You know that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of (an)other gene(s). You start to test those mutant plants: do they have a higher sensitivity to anthracnose than the wild-type because they cannot produce certain gene products? \nAfter tests with the pathogen, you receive the following results where 100% is the level of resistance to the pathogen in control; 50% is half of the control\u2019s resistance; 25% is a quarter of the control\u2019s resistance; 0% \u2012 all plants show signs of infection:\n- resistance of g1: 75% of control\n- resistance of g2: 0% from control\n- resistance of g3: 50% from control\n-resistance of g1g3: 10% from control\n- resistance of g2g3: 0% from control\n- resistance of g1g2: 0% from control\n\nWhich conclusion regarding those genes' interaction can you draw from this experiment?\n\n\nA. G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3\nB. G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1\nC.

                    "text": "The data suggest that G2 is a key player, as its loss completely abolishes resistance (g2: 0%). This observation indicates that G2 could be a transcription factor that regulates other genes necessary for resistance.\n\nG1 and G3 both reduce resistance when knocked out (g1: 75%, g3: 50%), but the double mutant g1g3 shows a much greater reduction in resistance (10%) than would be expected if their effects were simply additive. This suggests that G1 and G3 may have overlapping functions or act in the same pathway. The fact that the double mutant g1g3 has a lower resistance than either single mutant implies that G1 and G3 are not fully redundant but that G1 might be epistatic over G3, meaning that the effect of G3 is masked in the presence of a mutation in G1.\n\nThe double mutants involving G2 (g1g2 and g2g3) also show complete loss of resistance (0%), indicating that G2's role is essential regardless of whether G1 or G3 is present. This supports the idea that G2 acts upstream of G1 and G3.\n\nThus, the most accurate conclusion based on the experimental data is:\n\nA. G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3."
