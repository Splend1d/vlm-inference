Nitration: Using a mixture of nitric acid (HNO3) and sulfuric acid (H2SO4), benzene is converted into nitrobenzene.\n\n2. Reduction: The nitro group is reduced to an amino group using iron (Fe) in hydrochloric acid (HCl).\n\n3. Acylation: The Friedel-Crafts acylation reaction uses acetyl chloride (CH3COCl) and aluminum chloride (AlCl3) to convert the aniline into acetanilide.\n\n4. Bromination: Using bromine (Br2) and iron(III) bromide (FeBr3), the acetanilide is brominated at the ortho position relative to the acetyl group (since the acetyl group is an activating but slightly deactivating group).\n\n5. Re-Nitration: Another round of nitration using nitric acid (HNO3) and sulfuric acid (H2SO4) introduces a second nitro group at the ortho position relative to the first nitro group, giving us 3-bromo-5-nitroacetanilide.\n\n6. Diazotization: The amino group is converted into a diazonium salt using sodium nitrite (NaNO2) and hydrochloric acid (HCl). This is a key step in the Sandmeyer reaction which will follow.\n\n7. Sandmeyer Reaction: The diazonium salt is treated with phosphorous acid (H3PO2) to replace the diazo group with a hydrogen atom, leaving behind the desired product, 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.\n\nThus, option A is the correct sequence. However, it's important to note that the Sandmeyer reaction typically uses cuprous chloride or other reagents to replace the diazo group with a halogen, not phosphorous acid for hydrogenation. The use of phosphorous acid as described seems incorrect for this purpose. In practice, you might replace steps vi and vii with a Sandmeyer reaction condition using CuCl or another appropriate reagent to introduce the hydrogen atom."
