                    "text": "The information given points towards option A, 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\nExplanation:\nMass Spectrum: The molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 and the peak at m/z = 158 (32%) indicates the presence of chlorine in the molecule. The molecular weight of C7H5O2Cl is 156.52 g/mol, which matches the molecular ion peak. The peak at m/z = 158 corresponds to the isotopic peak due to the presence of the heavier isotope of chlorine (^37Cl).\n\nInfrared (IR) Spectrum: The broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1 indicates the presence of an O-H stretch, which is consistent with a carboxylic acid group. The strong sharp peak at 1720 cm-1 corresponds to a C=O stretch, again consistent with a carboxylic acid group.\n\nProton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (1H NMR) Spectrum: The singlet at 11.0 ppm corresponds to the proton on the hydroxyl group of the carboxylic acid. The two doublets at 8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm indicate the presence of two sets of equivalent protons in an aromatic ring, which are not adjacent to each other (J = 8 Hz). This pattern is consistent with a para-disubstituted benzene ring, such as 4-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\nTherefore, based on the spectral data provided, the most likely structure for the unknown compound is 4-chlorobenzoic acid."
