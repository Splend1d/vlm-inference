                    "text": "The disappearing peaks upon using PFA+DSG fixation instead of just PFA fixation are most likely to be found at B. Active promoters and enhancers.\n\nHere's why: Formaldehyde (PFA) crosslinks proteins to DNA, stabilizing protein-DNA interactions for ChIP-seq analysis. However, it does not crosslink all protein-DNA contacts equally. Some interactions, especially those involving transcription factors (TFs) at active promoters and enhancers, may be more dynamic and transient. These interactions might not be sufficiently stabilized by formaldehyde alone, leading to lower signal in ChIP-seq data.\n\nDi-succinimidyl glutarate (DSG) is another crosslinker that can form stronger and more stable crosslinks than formaldehyde. When used in combination with formaldehyde (PFA+DSG), it can better capture weak or transient interactions between proteins and DNA. Therefore, if peaks disappear when DSG is added to the fixation protocol, it suggests that these peaks were associated with interactions that were only weakly or transiently bound to DNA under PFA fixation alone. This is more likely to occur at active promoters and enhancers where TF binding can be more dynamic compared to other genomic regions.\n\nThus, the answer is B. At active promoters and enhancers."
