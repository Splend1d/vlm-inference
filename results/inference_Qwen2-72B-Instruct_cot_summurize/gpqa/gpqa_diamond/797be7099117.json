                    "text": "First, let's calculate the initial concentration of acetic acid after dilution.\nThe volume of solution doubles when we add equal volume of water, so the concentration of acetic acid becomes half, i.e., 0.025 M.\n\nAt 25% titration, the volume of added NaOH is 25% of the volume required for complete neutralization. Since the concentration of acetic acid is 0.025 M and the concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume of NaOH required for complete neutralization is 5 times the volume of acetic acid. Therefore, the volume of NaOH added at 25% titration is 20.00 * 0.25 = 5.00 cm3.\n\nAt this point, the number of moles of acetic acid remaining in the solution can be calculated as follows:\nNumber of moles of acetic acid initially present = 0.025 * 20.00 * 10^-3 = 0.0005 mol\nNumber of moles of NaOH added = 0.1 * 5.00 * 10^-3 = 0.0005 mol\n\nSince one mole of NaOH reacts with one mole of acetic acid, the number of moles of acetic acid remaining in the solution is:\n0.0005 - 0.0005 = 0 mol\n\nHowever, there is also 0.0005 mol of sodium acetate formed. The pH of the solution at this point can be calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n\npH = pKa + log([conjugate base]/[weak acid])\npH = -log(1.85x10^-5) + log([0.0005]/[0]) \n\nBut the weak acid concentration is zero at this point which makes the equation undefined. However, we know that the solution will be basic due to the presence of sodium acetate. The pH can be estimated by considering the hydrolysis of acetate ions:\n\nCH3COO- + H2O \u21cc CH3COOH + OH-\n\nThe equilibrium constant for this reaction is Kw/Ka = 10^-14 / 1.85x10^-5 = 5.4x10^-10.\n\nThe concentration of OH- ions can be calculated using the formula [OH-] = sqrt(Kw/Ka * [sodium acetate]), where [sodium acetate] = 0.0005 mol / 0.045 L = 0.0111 M. So, [OH-] = sqrt(5.4x10^-10 * 0.0111) = 7.4x10^-6 M.\n\nThus, pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - (-log(7.4x10^-6)) = 5.13 approximately.\n\nAt the equivalence point, the number of moles of acetic acid and NaOH are equal, and all the acetic acid has been converted to sodium acetate. The pH of the solution can again be estimated using the hydrolysis of acetate ions:\n\nThe concentration of sodium acetate at the equivalence point = 0.0005 mol / 0.040 L = 0.0125 M.\n\nSo, [OH-] = sqrt(5.4x10^-10 * 0.0125) = 7.4x10^-6 M.\n\nThus, pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - (-log(7.4x10^-6)) = 5.13 approximately.\n\nNone of the options match these values. However, it should be noted that the calculations above are approximations and the actual values may differ slightly. The pH at the equivalence point should be around 8.7, which is closer to option C. But none of the options match the calculated value for the pH at 25% titration. Therefore, the question might have some error or it could be that none of the given options are correct. \n\nThe most accurate answer based on the provided options would be C, but please note that this is an approximation and not an exact match to the calculated values. \n\nFor a more precise calculation, you may want to use a more advanced method such as the ICE table or a computer simulation. \n\nPlease let me know if you have any further questions!"
