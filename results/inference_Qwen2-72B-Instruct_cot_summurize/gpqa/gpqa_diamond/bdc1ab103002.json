Mutually incompatible data formats can cause problems when trying to integrate data from different sources. The \"chr\" / \"no chr\" confusion arises when dealing with chromosome nomenclature inconsistencies between databases or tools. Reference assembly mismatch occurs when the reference genome used for alignment does not match the actual genome being studied. Incorrect ID conversion happens when identifiers for genes or other genomic features are incorrectly mapped between databases, leading to misinterpretation of data."
