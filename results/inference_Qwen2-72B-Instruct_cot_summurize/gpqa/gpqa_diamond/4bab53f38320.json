                    "text": "To determine which two compounds are present in the mixture based on the given \\(^1H\\) NMR data, let's analyze each compound's expected NMR pattern:\n\n1. **1,2,4,5-Tetramethylbenzene** (\\(C_6H_2(CH_3)_4\\)):\n   - This compound has only one type of hydrogen (the hydrogen atoms on the benzene ring), which would result in a single signal for the aromatic protons.\n   - The methyl groups are equivalent, so they would also give a single signal.\n   - However, due to symmetry, this compound will show two distinct signals: one for the four methyl groups (12 H) and another for the two aromatic hydrogens (2 H). Thus, the NMR would show two signals in a 12:2 ratio, but since the question specifies that the aromatic signals are in a 1:1 ratio, we need to adjust our interpretation to consider the integration of these signals rather than their multiplicity.\n\n2. **1,2,3,5-Tetramethylbenzene** (\\(C_6H_2(CH_3)_4\\)):\n   - Similar to 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, this compound will have a single signal for the aromatic protons and a single signal for the methyl groups.\n   - Due to the lack of symmetry compared to 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, the aromatic hydrogens are not equivalent, leading to different chemical shifts for them. However, since the question specifies only two signals at around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio, this compound alone does not fit the description.\n\n3. **1,2,3,4-Tetramethylbenzene** (\\(C_6H_2(CH_3)_4\\)):\n   - Like the previous two compounds, this one will also have a single signal for the aromatic protons and a single signal for the methyl groups.\n   - Due to its structure, the aromatic hydrogens are not equivalent, and the methyl groups can be considered as two sets (adjacent to each other vs. opposite each other), potentially leading to more complex splitting patterns not described in the question.\n\n4. **1,4-Diethylbenzene** (\\(C_8H_{10}\\)):\n   - This compound has ethyl groups attached to the benzene ring, which means there will be signals for the ethyl groups' CH2 and CH3 protons.\n   - The aromatic hydrogens will show as two signals due to the symmetry of the compound, corresponding to the ortho- and meta-positions relative to the ethyl groups.\n   - The ethyl groups' CH2 protons will show as a singlet because they are equivalent, and the CH3 protons will also show as a singlet but separate from the CH2 signal due to their different chemical environments.\n\nGiven the NMR data:\n- Two signals (singlets) at around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio, indicating two equivalent aromatic hydrogens.\n- Three signals at around 2.2 ppm (all singlets) in a 2:1:1 ratio, indicating the presence of alkyl substituents (likely ethyl groups).\n\nThe only pair of compounds that fits this description is:\n\n**A. 1,2,4,5-Tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-Diethylbenzene**\n\nThis pair matches the given NMR data perfectly, with 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene contributing the 1:1 aromatic signal and 1,4-diethylbenzene contributing both the aromatic signal and the 2:1:1 alkyl group signals."
