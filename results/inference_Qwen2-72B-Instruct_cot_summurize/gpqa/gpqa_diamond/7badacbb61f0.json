However, option D is a true statement regarding quantum mechanics:\n\nD. The eigenfunction of the operator \\(A_y\\) can also be an eigenfunction of \\(A^2\\), but not of the Z-component, \\(A_z\\).\n\nIn quantum mechanics, if an operator commutes with another (\\([A,B] = AB - BA = 0\\)), then they can have common eigenfunctions. Since \\(A_y\\) and \\(A^2\\) commute, their eigenfunctions can be the same. However, \\(A_y\\) does not generally commute with \\(A_z\\), so they do not necessarily share eigenfunctions.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement during the calculation would be **D**."
