The reaction is:\n\nCa^2+ + Y^4- -> CaY^2-\n\nWhere Y^4- is the EDTA ion and CaY^2- is the Ca-EDTA complex.\n\nThe equilibrium expression for this reaction is:\n\nK = [CaY^2-] / ([Ca^2+] [Y^4-])\n\nWe know that the total concentration of Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M, and we're assuming that all the Ca^2+ ions have formed complexes with EDTA. Therefore, [CaY^2-] = 0.02 M.\n\nLet's assume that x is the concentration of free Ca^2+ ions. Then the concentration of free Y^4- ions will also be x because one Ca^2+ ion reacts with one Y^4- ion to form one CaY^2- complex.\n\nSubstituting these values into the equilibrium expression gives:\n\nK = [CaY^2-] / ([Ca^2+] [Y^4-]) = 0.02 / (x * x) = 5*10^10\n\nSolving for x gives:\n\nx^2 = 0.02 / (5*10^10)\n\nTaking the square root of both sides gives:\n\nx = sqrt(0.02 / (5*10^10)) = 6.3 * 10^-7 M\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. 6.3x10^-7 M."
