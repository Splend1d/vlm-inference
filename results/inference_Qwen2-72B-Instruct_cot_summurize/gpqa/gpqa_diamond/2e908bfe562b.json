In the Li\u00e9nard\u2013Wiechert potentials, which describe the electromagnetic potentials of a point charge that moves with arbitrary velocity, the scalar potential \\(V\\) and the vector potential \\(\\vec{A}\\) are given by:\n\n\\[V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0|\\vec{d}|(1-\\hat{d}\\cdot\\frac{\\vec{v}}{c})}\\]\n\n\\[\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0q\\vec{v}}{4\\pi|\\vec{d}|(1-\\hat{d}\\cdot\\frac{\\vec{v}}{c})}\\]\n\nwhere \\(|\\vec{d}|\\) is the distance between the retarded position of the charge and the observer, \\(\\hat{d}\\) is the unit vector pointing from the retarded position to the observer, and \\(\\vec{v}\\) is the velocity of the charge at the retarded time.\n\nIn your question, you have defined \\(d\\) as the magnitude of the vector \\(\\vec{d}\\), which represents the distance between the retarded position of the charge and the observer. Therefore, \\(|\\vec{d}| = d\\). Moreover, the term \\((1-\\hat{d}\\cdot\\frac{\\vec{v}}{c})\\) can be rewritten using the definition of the dot product as:\n\n\\[1-\\hat{d}\\cdot\\frac{\\vec{v}}{c} = 1 - \\frac{\\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v}}{dc}\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\\frac{dc - \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v}}{dc}\\]\n\nSince the denominator \\(dc\\) appears in both the scalar and vector potentials, we can simplify them to:\n\n\\[V(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0(dc - \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v})}\\]\n\n\\[\\vec{A}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\mu_0qc\\vec{v}}{4\\pi(dc - \\vec{d}\\cdot\\vec{v})}\\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. \\(V(\\vec{r},t) = \\dfrac{qc}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}, \\vec{A(\\vec{r},t)} = \\dfrac{\\mu_0 qc \\vec{v}}{4\\pi (d c - \\vec{d}. \\vec{v})}\\)"
