Let's analyze each option:\n\na) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet: This would have the same density as Earth, which is about \\(5.52\\) g/cm\\(^3\\).\n\nb) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm\\(^3\\): Since the mass is doubled but the density is given as the same as Earth\u2019s, without knowing if the radius also changes, we cannot directly calculate the new density. However, since the question implies this planet already has a density, we assume it to be \\(5.5\\) g/cm\\(^3\\), similar to Earth\u2019s.\n\nc) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth: Assuming the composition leads to a similar density as Earth, increasing the mass while keeping the density constant would mean that the radius must increase as well. However, because the density is inversely proportional to the cube of the radius when mass increases linearly, the density would actually remain the same if the radius increased in proportion to accommodate the greater mass. In this case, the density remains close to \\(5.52\\) g/cm\\(^3\\).\n\nd) A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth: If the mass is halved and the composition (density) is kept the same, the radius would decrease accordingly to maintain the same density. However, the question asks for the highest density, and since we\u2019re told the composition is the same as Earth\u2019s, the density will also be around \\(5.52\\) g/cm\\(^3\\).\n\nThe question asks for the planet with the highest density. Given the information provided, all planets except option (b) have densities assumed or directly stated to be similar to Earth\u2019s (\\(5.52\\) g/cm\\(^3\\)). Option (b) specifies a density of \u201capproximately\u201d \\(5.5\\) g/cm\\(^3\\), which could imply slightly less than Earth\u2019s density due to the use of \"approximately.\" Therefore, assuming the others have densities very close or equal to Earth\u2019s exact density, the answer is:\n\nA. c\n\nHowever, this assumes that the density does not change with an increase in mass, which in reality might not be the case due to gravitational compression effects at higher masses. But based on the information given and the direct comparison asked for in the question, option (c) appears to have the highest density among the options, assuming it maintains Earth\u2019s density despite its larger mass."
