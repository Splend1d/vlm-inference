However, in this case, we can use the stoichiometry of the reactions and the volume and concentration of the reactants to determine how many moles of water will be formed.\n\nThe reactions involved are:\n\\[ \\text{H}^+ + \\text{OH}^- \\rightarrow \\text{H}_2\\text{O} \\]\n\nFor HCl (strong acid) and Ba(OH)2 (strong base):\n\\[ \\text{HCl} + \\text{Ba(OH)}_2 \\rightarrow \\text{BaCl}_2 + \\text{H}_2\\text{O} \\]\n\\[ \\text{H}^+ + \\text{OH}^- \\rightarrow \\text{H}_2\\text{O} \\]\n\nFor H2SO4 (strong acid) and Ba(OH)2 (strong base):\n\\[ \\text{H}_2\\text{SO}_4 + \\text{Ba(OH)}_2 \\rightarrow \\text{BaSO}_4 + 2\\text{H}_2\\text{O} \\]\n\\[ 2\\text{H}^+ + 2\\text{OH}^- \\rightarrow 2\\text{H}_2\\text{O} \\]\n\nLet's find out the moles of each reactant:\n\n- For HCl: \\(0.5\\ L \\times 0.2\\ M = 0.1\\ mol\\)\n- For H2SO4: \\(0.3\\ L \\times 0.3\\ M = 0.09\\ mol\\)\n- For Ba(OH)2: \\(0.2\\ L \\times 0.5\\ M = 0.1\\ mol\\)\n\nSince Ba(OH)2 produces two hydroxide ions per molecule, it can neutralize twice as many moles of H+ ions as there are molecules of Ba(OH)2.\n\nLet's consider the limiting reagent for each reaction:\n\n1. For HCl + Ba(OH)2, the reaction is limited by Ba(OH)2 because only 0.1 mol is available. Thus, 0.1 mol of HCl can react with Ba(OH)2 to form 0.1 mol of H2O.\n2. For H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2, since Ba(OH)2 is already used up from the first reaction, the limiting reagent here is also Ba(OH)2. However, since Ba(OH)2 has been fully consumed by HCl, no more H2SO4 can react with Ba(OH)2.\n\nThus, only 0.1 mol of H2O is formed from the reaction of HCl with Ba(OH)2.\n\nThe standard enthalpy of neutralization for strong acid and strong base is about -57.3 kJ/mol of water formed. Therefore, the total enthalpy change is:\n\\[ \\Delta H = -57.3\\ kJ/mol \\times 0.1\\ mol = -5.73\\ kJ \\]\n\nThis value is not listed among your options, which suggests that either there was an assumption or information missing in the question (like the specific heats of the solutions), or perhaps the options were meant to account for different scenarios or miscalculations. Given the calculations based on the provided information, the closest answer in terms of magnitude would be B. -2.72 kcal (since 1 kcal = 4.184 kJ, -5.73 kJ is approximately -1.37 kcal). However, none of the given options exactly matches the calculated value."
