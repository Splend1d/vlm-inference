Phonon.\n\nPhonons are quasiparticles that represent lattice vibrations or sound waves in a solid, and they are not directly related to a spontaneously broken symmetry. The other three options\u2014magnons, pions, and skyrmions\u2014are all associated with spontaneous symmetry breaking:\n\n- Magnons are the quasiparticles associated with spin waves in a magnetic material, and they arise from the spontaneous breaking of rotational symmetry due to magnetization.\n- Pions (or more specifically, the light pseudoscalar mesons) are the Goldstone bosons associated with the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics.\n- Skyrmions are topological solitons that can emerge in certain types of field theories, including some models of nuclear physics, where they are associated with baryon number conservation and the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry."
