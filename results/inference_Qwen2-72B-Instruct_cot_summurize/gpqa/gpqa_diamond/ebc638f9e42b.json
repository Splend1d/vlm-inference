The average lifetime of these aliens is roughly 150 solar years.  Now, having Earth as their destination in mind, they are determined to travel with this spacecraft at a constant speed of 0.99999987*c, where c is the speed of light. Approximately, how long will it take for their 22 years old astronaut (from the point of view of the astronaut) to reach the Earth using this incredibly fast spacecraft?\n\nA. 77 years\nB. The astronaut will die before reaching to the Earth.\nC. 72 years\nD. 81 years\n"

This distance is about 163,000 light-years.\n\nSince the spacecraft travels at 0.99999987*c, we can calculate the time it takes to cover this distance from our perspective (t):\n\nt = distance / velocity\nt = 163,000 light-years / 0.99999987*c\n\nNow we can use this value of t to find the time experienced by the astronaut (t'):\n\nt' = t * sqrt(1 - 0.99999987^2)\n\nAfter calculating this, we find that t' is approximately 72 years.\n\nSo, the correct answer is C. 72 years."
