(1+n*v)/(n+v)\n\nThis problem can be solved using the formula for the relativistic velocity addition, which is given by:\n\nu = (u' + v) / (1 + u'v/c^2)\n\nwhere u is the velocity of the light beam relative to the observer in the laboratory, u' is the velocity of the light beam relative to the glass (which is c/n), and v is the velocity of the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory.\n\nSubstituting u' = c/n and v = v into this formula, we get:\n\nu = (c/n + v) / (1 + (c/n)v/c^2)\n\nSimplifying this expression, we get:\n\nu = (c + nv) / (nc + v)\n\nSince we are asked for the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in the laboratory, we need to divide both sides of the equation by n:\n\nu/n = (c + nv) / (n^2c + nv)\n\nFinally, we can simplify this expression to obtain the answer:\n\nu/n = (1 + nv/c) / (n + v/c)\n\nMultiplying both the numerator and denominator by c, we get:\n\nu/n = (c + nv) / (nc + v)\n\nThus, the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in the laboratory is:\n\nu = (c + nv) / (nc + v)\n\nUsing the fact that c = 1, we can simplify this expression to obtain the final answer:\n\nu = (1 + nv) / (n + v) = (1+n*v)/(n+v)\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.
