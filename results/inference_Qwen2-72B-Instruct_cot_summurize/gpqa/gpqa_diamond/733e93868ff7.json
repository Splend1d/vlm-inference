                    "text": "The provided NMR data corresponds to a compound that has two methyl groups, as indicated by the singlets at \u03b4 2.28 and 2.31 ppm in the 1H-NMR spectrum. These peaks are likely associated with two sets of equivalent methyl protons, each integrated for three protons. The multiplicity of these signals (s for singlet) suggests that these methyl groups are not adjacent to any other hydrogen atoms.\n\nThe aromatic region of the 1H-NMR spectrum shows four signals: a doublet at \u03b4 6.75 ppm, another doublet at \u03b4 7.08 ppm, a doublet at \u03b4 7.68 ppm, and another doublet at \u03b4 7.71 ppm. This indicates the presence of a substituted benzene ring, with two pairs of equivalent protons (each pair integrated for two protons). \n\nThe 13C-NMR spectrum shows nine distinct carbon environments, which matches the number of signals seen in the 1H-NMR spectrum (excluding the two methyl groups, which appear as one signal each due to equivalence). The chemical shifts suggest the presence of two methyl carbons (\u03b4 21.3 and 28.4 ppm), five sp2-hybridized carbons in the range typical for aromatic systems (\u03b4 126.9, 127.1, 129.1, 130.3, and 141.5 ppm), and two additional sp2-hybridized carbons at \u03b4 144.1 and 197.7 ppm, the latter of which could correspond to a carbonyl group.\n\nGiven this information, we can rule out options A and C because they do not have a carbonyl group or the required number of methyl groups. Option B does not have the necessary methyl groups either. Therefore, the only option left is D, 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane, but it should be noted that the presence of a carbonyl group suggests that the compound has undergone some form of oxidation or rearrangement during the reaction.\n\nHowever, based on the given options and the NMR data, the most likely answer is:\n\nD. 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane\n\nThis compound would have two methyl groups and an aromatic system, consistent with the observed NMR data. However, the presence of a carbonyl group (\u03b4 197.7 ppm) suggests that the compound might not be exactly as listed in option D, but rather a derivative that includes a carbonyl functionality."
