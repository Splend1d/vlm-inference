                    "text": "The pp-III branch of the proton-proton chain reaction in the Sun produces neutrinos with energies peaking around 830 keV, making it a significant contributor to the flux in the energy range of 800-900 keV. If this process suddenly stopped, the flux of neutrinos in band 2 (800-900 keV) would be significantly reduced since there would be no more neutrinos from this particular reaction channel in that energy range.\n\nHowever, other reactions, such as the pp-I and pp-II branches, would continue to contribute to the neutrino flux, including in both band 1 (700-800 keV) and band 2 (800-900 keV). The pp-I branch has a broader energy spectrum and peaks at lower energies, so its contribution to band 1 might be relatively larger than to band 2. Without the pp-III contribution, the ratio of the flux in band 1 to band 2 would likely increase.\n\nGiven that the pp-III branch specifically contributes significantly to the higher end of the energy spectrum considered here, the sudden cessation of this reaction would disproportionately affect the flux in band 2 compared to band 1. Therefore, the ratio of the flux in band 1 to band 2 would increase, possibly to a factor of 10 or more, depending on the relative contributions of other reactions in these energy bands.\n\nSo, the answer could be:\n\nC. 10.\n\nThis assumes that the contribution from the pp-III branch was substantial for the 800-900 keV band and that the other reactions do not compensate for this loss in that energy range. However, without precise quantitative information on the relative contributions of different reactions to the neutrino flux in these specific energy bands, this answer is based on qualitative reasoning."
