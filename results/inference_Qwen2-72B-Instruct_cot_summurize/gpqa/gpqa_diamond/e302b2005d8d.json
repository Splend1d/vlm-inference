                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to use the relativistic formula for kinetic energy, which is given by:\n\nK = (\u03b3 - 1)mc^2\n\nwhere \u03b3 is the Lorentz factor, m is the rest mass of the particle, and c is the speed of light.\n\nThe Lorentz factor is given by:\n\n\u03b3 = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nwhere v is the velocity of the particle.\n\nIn this case, we know that v = 0.96c, so we can calculate the Lorentz factor as follows:\n\n\u03b3 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) = 2.666\n\nNext, we need to find the rest mass of the Li nucleus with 3 neutrons. The atomic number of Li is 3, so it has 3 protons. The atomic mass of Li is approximately 7 (since it has 3 protons and 4 neutrons), but we need to subtract the mass of one proton to account for the fact that our nucleus has only 3 neutrons. Therefore, the rest mass of the Li nucleus with 3 neutrons is:\n\nm = (7 - 1) * 931.5 MeV/c^2 = 5589 MeV/c^2\n\nNow we can substitute these values into the formula for kinetic energy:\n\nK = (\u03b3 - 1)mc^2 = (2.666 - 1)(5589 MeV/c^2)(c^2) = 9937 MeV = 9.937 GeV\n\nHowever, this is the kinetic energy per nucleon. Since the Li nucleus has 7 nucleons, we need to multiply this value by 7 to get the total kinetic energy of the nucleus:\n\nK_total = 7 * 9.937 GeV = 69.559 GeV\n\nTherefore, none of the answer choices match the calculated value. However, if we round the calculated value to four decimal places as specified in the question, we get:\n\nK_total \u2248 69.56 GeV\n\nSo the closest answer choice is:\n\nA. 23.069 GeV\n\nHowever, this answer choice is not very close to our calculated value, and it's possible that there was an error in the calculation or in the way the question was phrased. Without more information, it's difficult to say for sure. \n\nBut based on the calculation, the correct answer would be around 69.56 GeV. Unfortunately, this option is not available in the provided answer choices."
