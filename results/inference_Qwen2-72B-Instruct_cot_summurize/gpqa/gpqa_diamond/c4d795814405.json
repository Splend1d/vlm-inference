You identify the fluorescent Peyer patches and isolate the proliferating cell population. You sequence their variable heavy chain gene and observe high variability.

It occurs in germinal centers of secondary lymphoid tissues, such as the Peyer's patches in the gut-associated lymphoid tissue, where B cells undergo rapid proliferation and mutation of their variable region genes. This results in a high degree of variability in the antibody repertoire, allowing for the selection of high-affinity antibodies against specific antigens. The observation of high variability in the sequenced variable heavy chain genes supports that somatic hypermutation is occurring in the isolated proliferating cell population from the Peyer's patches."
