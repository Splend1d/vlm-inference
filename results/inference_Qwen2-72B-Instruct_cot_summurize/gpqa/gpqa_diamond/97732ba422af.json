It is known that the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles is continuous, with some endpoint value Q.\n\nA variant of this decay emits one exotic, massless particle M instead of the 2V. In this case, how does the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles compare to that of the original decay?\n\nA. The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint decreases.\nB.

                    "text": "In the original decay, 2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V, the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles is continuous due to the multiple possible ways the total available energy can be divided among the 2V particles. When one of these particles is replaced by a massless particle M (2A -> 2B + 2E + M), the situation changes because a massless particle carries away zero rest mass energy.\n\nThe endpoint energy Q in the original decay is determined by the mass difference between the initial and final states and any other energies involved in the decay process. When we replace 2V with M, we remove the rest mass energy associated with the two V particles. Since M is massless, it does not contribute to the rest mass energy of the system, so the total available energy for the decay increases. This leads to an increase in the endpoint energy of the E particles' spectrum.\n\nHowever, the spectrum will still be continuous because the energy can still be distributed continuously among the remaining particles. The shape of the spectrum might change due to differences in the kinematics of the decay when a massless particle is involved, but it will remain continuous.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint increases."
