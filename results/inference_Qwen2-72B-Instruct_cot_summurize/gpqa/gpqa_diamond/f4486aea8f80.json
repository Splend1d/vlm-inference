The sequence chosen should also take into account safety, environmental impact, and economic factors. In practice, some steps might require optimization or alternative reagents based on these considerations.\n\nAlso, the diazonium salt formation and subsequent loss of nitrogen gas as part of the process to move the nitro group from the para to the ortho position relative to the tert-butyl group is not typically how nitro groups are moved around on aromatic rings. This sequence assumes that the initial nitration occurs at the para position, and the diazonium salt formation and subsequent steps are used to move the nitro group to the desired ortho position. This is a somewhat unusual approach and may not reflect industrial practices for such syntheses. Typically, the directing effects of substituents on the benzene ring would guide where nitration occurs, and careful selection of conditions could direct the nitration to the desired position without the need for such elaborate manipulations."
