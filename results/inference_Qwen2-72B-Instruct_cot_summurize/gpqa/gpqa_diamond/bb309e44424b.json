                    "text": "The relationship between the number of stars, N, and parallax, plx, is given as \\(N \\propto \\frac{1}{plx^5}\\). Parallax is inversely proportional to distance, i.e., \\(plx \\propto \\frac{1}{r}\\), where \\(r\\) is the distance to the stars.\n\nSubstituting this into the relationship for N, we get:\n\n\\[N \\propto \\left(\\frac{1}{r}\\right)^5 = \\frac{1}{r^5}\\]\n\nHowever, this relationship doesn't directly account for the volume element that increases with the cube of the distance due to the three-dimensional nature of space. The volume of a spherical shell (which is what we're considering when we talk about a unit range of distance) increases as \\(r^2 dr\\), where \\(dr\\) is the infinitesimal thickness of the shell. Therefore, the number of stars per unit volume (and hence per unit range of distance) would be:\n\n\\[N \\propto \\frac{1}{r^5} \\times r^2 = \\frac{1}{r^3}\\]\n\nBut since we want the number of stars per unit range of distance, not per unit volume, we need to consider how the volume element scales with distance. The volume element increases as \\(r^2 dr\\), so if we are looking at the number of stars within a certain distance range, we multiply by \\(r^2\\):\n\n\\[N \\propto r^2 \\times \\frac{1}{r^3} = \\frac{1}{r}\\]\n\nHowever, this doesn't match any of the options provided. It seems there was an oversight in translating the volume scaling into the context of the question, which asks for the number of stars per unit range of distance, considering the initial \\(N \\propto \\frac{1}{plx^5}\\) relationship and the volume scaling.\n\nGiven that the number of stars decreases with the fifth power of the parallax, and knowing that parallax is inversely proportional to distance, the correct relationship after accounting for the increase in volume (and thus potential number of stars) with distance should be:\n\n\\[N \\propto \\frac{1}{r^5} \\times r^3 = \\frac{1}{r^2}\\]\n\nThis isn't a direct match to any option provided either, but it seems the question might be asking for how the number of stars increases with distance before considering the inverse square law of parallax. In that case, the volume element's increase with the cube of distance could be the focus:\n\n\\[N \\propto r^3\\]\n\nTherefore, the answer that most closely matches the intended interpretation of the question is:\n\nB. ~ r^3"
