They have limited observing time and want to observe the one that has the highest probability of transiting. Both of these planets have already been detected via the RV method, allowing us to know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Although both planets share the same masses, the orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than that of Planet_2. Interestingly, they both have circular orbits. Furthermore, we know the masses and radii of the host stars of these two planets. The star hosting Planet_1 has a mass that is twice that of the host star of Planet_2. As the host of Planet_2 is slightly evolved, both host stars have the same radii. Based on the provided information, the researchers have chosen to observe:\n\nA. Planet_2 is preferred due to its ~1.5 times higher probability to transit.\nB. Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit.\nC. Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~2.7 times higher probability to transit.\nD. Planet_2 is preferred due to its ~2.25 times higher probability to transit.\n"

                    "text": "The probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the star and the size of the orbit of the planet. Specifically, the probability of a transit is given by the formula:\n\nP(transit) = (R_star + R_planet) / a\n\nwhere R_star is the radius of the star, R_planet is the radius of the planet, and a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.\n\nSince the two planets have the same mass and the same circular orbit, their radii are also the same. Therefore, the ratio of their transit probabilities is simply the ratio of their host stars' radii divided by the ratio of their semi-major axes:\n\nP(transit)_1 / P(transit)_2 = (R_star_1 / R_star_2) * (a_2 / a_1)\n\nWe know that R_star_1 = R_star_2, so this cancels out. We also know that the orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than that of Planet_2. Since the orbital period is proportional to the cube root of the semi-major axis for a circular orbit, we can write:\n\nP(transit)_1 / P(transit)_2 = (a_2 / a_1) = (P_orb_2 / P_orb_1)^(2/3) = (3)^(2/3) = 1.442\n\nTherefore, the probability of Planet_1 transiting its star is about 1.442 times higher than the probability of Planet_2 transiting its star. None of the answer choices exactly matches this value, but B is the closest at 1.65 times higher probability. However, since the question asks for the highest probability, the correct answer would be:\n\nB. Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.44 times higher probability to transit. \n\nBut if we have to choose from the given options, then B is the closest answer."
