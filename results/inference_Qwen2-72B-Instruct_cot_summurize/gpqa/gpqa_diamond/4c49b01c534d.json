                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to use the conservation of energy and momentum. Since the pion (\\(\\pi^+\\)) is stationary, its initial momentum is zero. The total energy before the decay is just its rest mass energy, which is given by \\(E_{\\pi} = m_{\\pi}c^2 = 139.6 \\, \\text{MeV}\\).\n\nAfter the decay, the total energy and momentum must be conserved. Let's denote the energies of the muon (\\(\\mu^+\\)) and neutrino (\\(\\nu\\)) as \\(E_{\\mu}\\) and \\(E_{\\nu}\\), respectively, and their momenta as \\(\\vec{p}_{\\mu}\\) and \\(\\vec{p}_{\\nu}\\), respectively. Since the pion was at rest, the total momentum after the decay must also be zero, meaning \\(\\vec{p}_{\\mu} + \\vec{p}_{\\nu} = \\vec{0}\\). This implies that the magnitudes of the momenta of the muon and neutrino are equal but opposite in direction, i.e., \\(|\\vec{p}_{\\mu}| = |\\vec{p}_{\\nu}|\\).\n\nThe total energy is also conserved, so:\n\\[E_{\\pi} = E_{\\mu} + E_{\\nu}\\]\n\nWe know that for any particle, \\(E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2\\), where \\(E\\) is the total energy, \\(p\\) is the momentum, and \\(m_0\\) is the rest mass. Therefore, for the muon:\n\\[E_{\\mu}^2 = (p_{\\mu}c)^2 + (m_{\\mu}c^2)^2 = (p_{\\mu}c)^2 + (105.7 \\, \\text{MeV})^2\\]\n\nAnd for the neutrino (assuming it's massless, which is a good approximation):\n\\[E_{\\nu}^2 = (p_{\\nu}c)^2 + (m_{\\nu}c^2)^2 \\approx (p_{\\nu}c)^2\\]\n\nSince \\(p_{\\mu} = p_{\\nu}\\), let's call this common momentum \\(p\\). Then:\n\\[E_{\\nu}^2 = (pc)^2\\]\n\nThe total energy after the decay is:\n\\[E_{\\mu} + E_{\\nu} = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (105.7 \\, \\text{MeV})^2} + \\sqrt{(pc)^2}\\]\n\nThis should equal the initial energy of the pion:\n\\[139.6 \\, \\text{MeV} = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (105.7 \\, \\text{MeV})^2} + \\sqrt{(pc)^2}\\]\n\nLet's solve for \\(p\\):\n\\[139.6^2 = (pc)^2 + 105.7^2 + 2\\sqrt{(pc)^2((pc)^2 + 105.7^2)} + (pc)^2\\]\n\nSimplifying and solving for \\(p\\), then finding \\(E_{\\mu}\\) and \\(E_{\\nu}\\), we can find the kinetic energies of both particles since \\(KE = E - m_0c^2\\).\n\nLet's do some calculations:\n\nFirst, isolate \\((pc)^2\\) in the equation:\n\\[139.6^2 - 105.7^2 = 2(pc)^2 + 2\\sqrt{(pc)^2((pc)^2 + 105.7^2)}\\]\n\n\\[19481.16 - 11172.49 = 2(pc)^2 + 2\\sqrt{(pc)^2((pc)^2 + 11172.49)}\\]\n\n\\[8308.67 = 2(pc)^2 + 2\\sqrt{(pc)^2((pc)^2 + 11172.49)}\\]\n\nLet \\(x = (pc)^2\\):\n\n\\[8308.67 = 2x + 2\\sqrt{x(x + 11172.49)}\\]\n\nRearrange to solve for \\(x\\):\n\\[4154.335 = x + \\sqrt{x(x + 11172.49)}\\]\n\n\\[4154.335 - x = \\sqrt{x(x + 11172.49)}\\]\n\nSquare both sides:\n\\[(4154.335 - x)^2 = x(x + 11172.49)\\]\n\n\\[17261616.4225 - 8308.67x + x^2 = x^2 + 11172.49x\\]\n\n\\[17261616.4225 = 19481.16x\\]\n\n\\[x = 886.21 \\, \\text{MeV}^2\\]\n\nThus, \\(pc = \\sqrt{886.21} \\approx 29.77 \\, \\text{MeV}\\).\n\nNow calculate \\(E_{\\mu}\\) and \\(E_{\\nu}\\):\n\\[E_{\\mu} = \\sqrt{(29.77)^2 + (105.7)^2} \\approx 109.84 \\, \\text{MeV}\\]\n\\[E_{\\nu} = \\sqrt{(29.77)^2} \\approx 29.77 \\, \\text{MeV}\\]\n\nFinally, calculate the kinetic energies:\n\\[KE_{\\mu} = E_{\\mu} - m_{\\mu}c^2 = 109.84 - 105.7 = 4.14 \\, \\text{MeV}\\]\n\\[KE_{\\nu} = E_{\\nu} - m_{\\nu}c^2 \\approx 29.77 \\, \\text{MeV}\\]\n\nThus, the closest answer is:\nC. 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV"
