The conditions include THF (a solvent), KH (a strong base), and H+ (an acid). This suggests an elimination reaction where the OH group is removed with the protonation of the alcohol, followed by an E2 elimination to form a more stable carbocation intermediate, which then undergoes a ring closure to form a cyclic compound. The product would be a cyclic ketone, which matches with (E)-bicyclo[5.3.1]undec-1(11)-en-4-one. So, A = (E)-bicyclo[5.3.1]undec-1(11)-en-4-one.\n\nFor Reaction B:\nThe reactant is (E)-pent-2-en-1-ol, and it's treated with acetyl bromide in the presence of LDA (lithium diisopropylamide), a strong base. This suggests an acylation reaction where the alcohol is converted into its corresponding alkoxide by deprotonation using LDA. Then, the alkoxide acts as a nucleophile and attacks the carbonyl carbon of the acetyl bromide to form an ester. However, since the question asks for the final product, the ester will hydrolyze under acidic or basic conditions to form the corresponding carboxylic acid. But, without further reaction conditions specified, the immediate product would be the lithium salt of the carboxylic acid. So, B = lithium 3-ethylpent-4-enoate.\n\nSo, the correct answer would be:\n\nB. A = (E)-bicyclo[5.3.1]undec-1(11)-en-4-one, B = lithium 3-ethylpent-4-enoate"
