Observations reveal that both systems exhibit eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively, for system_1 and system_2. These periods are calculated as the time between two consecutive primary eclipses. Further spectroscopic observations indicate that in system_1, the two stars display sinusoidal variations of radial velocities with amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. In system_2, the amplitudes of the RV sinusoidal variations are 15 km/s and 10 km/s. By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?

                    "text": "To compare the total masses of the two binary star systems based on the given information, we can use the properties of binary star systems, specifically the mass function derived from Kepler's laws and the analysis of radial velocity curves.\n\nThe mass function \\(f(m)\\) for a binary system observed through radial velocity measurements is given by:\n\\[f(m) = \\frac{(m_2^3\\sin^3i)}{(m_1 + m_2)^2}\\]\nwhere \\(m_1\\) and \\(m_2\\) are the masses of the two stars, and \\(i\\) is the inclination angle of the orbit relative to our line of sight.\n\nHowever, for this question, we need to relate the period and radial velocity amplitude directly to the mass ratio. The semi-amplitude of the radial velocity curve (\\(K\\)) is proportional to the mass of the companion and inversely proportional to the total mass of the system:\n\\[K \\propto \\frac{m_2}{(m_1+m_2)}\\]\n\nIn practice, for a binary system where both components contribute to the observed radial velocity curve, the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocity curves provide a direct measure of the mass ratio of the two stars. If we consider the total mass of the system to be \\(M = m_1 + m_2\\), then the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity curve for each star is proportional to the mass of the other star divided by the total mass of the system. Therefore, the ratio of the total masses of the two systems can be approximated by considering the ratio of their semi-amplitudes of the radial velocity curves, under the assumption that the systems have similar orbital configurations (inclinations and eccentricities).\n\nFor system_1, the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocity curves are 10 km/s and 5 km/s, which suggests a mass ratio of \\(m_2/m_1 = 0.5\\). For system_2, the semi-amplitudes are 15 km/s and 10 km/s, suggesting a mass ratio of \\(m_2/m_1 = 2/3\\) or approximately 0.67.\n\nTo compare the total masses, we must consider the effect of the period as well. The longer period for system_1 compared to system_2 indicates that system_1 has a larger total mass, since the period of a binary system is proportional to the cube root of the semi-major axis (which is proportional to the total mass for a given orbital period). However, without knowing the exact masses or the semi-major axes, we cannot directly calculate the total masses but can make an educated comparison based on the semi-amplitudes and periods.\n\nGiven the semi-amplitude ratios and assuming that the systems have comparable orbital configurations, we can infer that system_1, with larger semi-amplitudes and a longer period, would likely have a greater total mass than system_2. However, determining the precise factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2 requires additional information about the systems' inclinations, eccentricities, and possibly their individual masses.\n\nNone of the provided options (A. ~1.2, B. ~0.4, C. ~0.7, D. ~0.6) directly follows from the information given, as they would require more specific data about the systems. However, if we must choose based on the information provided and the principle that a system with larger semi-amplitudes and a longer period would likely have a greater total mass, option A (system_1 is roughly 1.2 times more massive than system_2) might be the closest to a reasonable guess, assuming that the semi-amplitude differences are indicative of mass differences and that the longer period of system_1 reflects a higher total mass.\n\nIn summary, the answer to the question, given the provided options and without additional information, could be interpreted as A. ~1.2, acknowledging that this is an approximation based on limited data and assumptions about the systems' orbital properties."
