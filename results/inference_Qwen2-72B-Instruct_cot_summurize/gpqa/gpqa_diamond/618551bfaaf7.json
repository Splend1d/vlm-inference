                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total moles of each species (CH3COOH, HCl, Ba(OH)2), determine which species will remain in solution after all possible reactions have occurred, and then calculate the pH from the concentrations of these species.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the moles of each substance:\n\n- Moles of CH3COOH = 0.5 L * 0.1 M = 0.05 mol\n- Moles of HCl = 0.4 L * 0.2 M = 0.08 mol\n- Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.3 L * 0.3 M = 0.09 mol\n\nNext, let's consider the reactions that can occur:\n1. HCl + Ba(OH)2 -> BaCl2 + H2O\n2. CH3COOH + OH- -> CH3COO- + H2O\n\nSince HCl is a strong acid and Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, they will react completely until one of them is used up. Since there are more moles of HCl than Ba(OH)2, Ba(OH)2 will be completely consumed, leaving behind excess HCl. The remaining moles of HCl after reacting with Ba(OH)2 will be:\n\n- Remaining moles of HCl = 0.08 mol - 0.09 mol * 2 (because each mole of Ba(OH)2 has two moles of OH-) = 0.08 mol - 0.18 mol = -0.1 mol\n\nThis calculation suggests that all the HCl would be used up and some Ba(OH)2 would remain, but since HCl is in excess over Ba(OH)2, we need to correct our approach here. The reaction will consume 0.09 mol of HCl for every mole of Ba(OH)2, leaving us with:\n\n- Remaining moles of HCl = 0.08 mol - 0.09 mol = -0.01 mol\n\nThis calculation indicates an error in logic as it suggests a negative amount of HCl left, meaning that HCl was not in excess; actually, Ba(OH)2 was in excess, neutralizing all of the HCl. So, we should have:\n\n- Remaining moles of HCl = 0 (all HCl is neutralized)\n- Remaining moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.09 mol - 0.04 mol (since HCl neutralizes half of the Ba(OH)2) = 0.05 mol\n\nNow, let's consider the reaction between CH3COOH and the remaining OH-. The reaction will proceed until all of the CH3COOH or OH- is consumed:\n\n- Remaining moles of CH3COOH = 0.05 mol (all will be consumed by the excess OH-)\n- Remaining moles of OH- = 0.05 mol * 2 (from Ba(OH)2) - 0.05 mol (from CH3COOH) = 0.1 mol - 0.05 mol = 0.05 mol\n\nThe volume of the final solution is the sum of the volumes of the initial solutions:\n\n- Total volume = 0.5 L + 0.4 L + 0.3 L = 1.2 L\n\nThe concentration of OH- in the final solution is:\n\n- [OH-] = 0.05 mol / 1.2 L = 0.0417 M\n\nUsing the relationship pOH = -log[OH-], we can find the pOH:\n\n- pOH = -log(0.0417) \u2248 1.38\n\nRemembering that pH + pOH = 14 for water at 25\u00b0C, we can find the pH:\n\n- pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\nB. 12.62"
