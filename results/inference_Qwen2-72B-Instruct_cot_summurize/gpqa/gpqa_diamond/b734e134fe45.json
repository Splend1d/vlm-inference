                    "text": "To answer this question, we need to understand how the Lorentz factor affects the distance that a particle travels before decaying. The Lorentz factor (\u03b3) is defined as:\n\n\\[ \\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}}} \\]\n\nwhere \\(v\\) is the velocity of the particle and \\(c\\) is the speed of light. When a particle moves at ultra-relativistic speeds, its lifetime as measured in the lab frame is dilated by a factor of \u03b3 compared to its proper lifetime. This means that if a particle has a proper lifetime \u03c4, it will live for a time \u03b3\u03c4 in the lab frame before decaying.\n\nThe distance that the particle travels before decaying can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[ d = v \\cdot t \\]\n\nwhere \\(t\\) is the time the particle lives in the lab frame. Substituting \\(t = \\gamma \\tau\\) and \\(v = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}}\\) (from rearranging the Lorentz factor formula), we get:\n\n\\[ d = c \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}} \\cdot \\gamma \\tau \\]\n\nSimplifying, we obtain:\n\n\\[ d = c \\tau \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1} \\]\n\nWe know that when the Lorentz factor is approximately 20, one third of the particles reach the detector's inner walls. Let's call this fraction \\(f_1\\). We want to find the Lorentz factor (\\(\\gamma_2\\)) that corresponds to two thirds of the particles (\\(f_2\\)) reaching the detector's inner walls.\n\nLet \\(d_1\\) be the distance traveled by particles with \\(\\gamma = 20\\) and \\(d_2\\) be the distance traveled by particles with \\(\\gamma = \\gamma_2\\).\n\nGiven that \\(d_1 = r f_1\\) and \\(d_2 = r f_2\\), where \\(r = 30\\) m is the radius of the detector, we can set up the following equation:\n\n\\[ c \\tau \\sqrt{\\gamma_1^2 - 1} = r f_1 \\]\n\\[ c \\tau \\sqrt{\\gamma_2^2 - 1} = r f_2 \\]\n\nDividing the second equation by the first equation, we get:\n\n\\[ \\frac{\\sqrt{\\gamma_2^2 - 1}}{\\sqrt{\\gamma_1^2 - 1}} = \\frac{f_2}{f_1} \\]\n\nGiven that \\(f_1 = \\frac{1}{3}\\) and \\(f_2 = \\frac{2}{3}\\), we have:\n\n\\[ \\frac{\\sqrt{\\gamma_2^2 - 1}}{\\sqrt{20^2 - 1}} = \\frac{2}{1} \\]\n\nSolving for \\(\\gamma_2\\):\n\n\\[ \\sqrt{\\gamma_2^2 - 1} = 2 \\sqrt{20^2 - 1} \\]\n\n\\[ \\gamma_2^2 - 1 = 4(20^2 - 1) \\]\n\n\\[ \\gamma_2^2 = 4(20^2 - 1) + 1 \\]\n\n\\[ \\gamma_2^2 = 4(400 - 1) + 1 \\]\n\n\\[ \\gamma_2^2 = 4(399) + 1 \\]\n\n\\[ \\gamma_2^2 = 1597 \\]\n\n\\[ \\gamma_2 = \\sqrt{1597} \\approx 40 \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. 40. However, this is an approximation, and the exact value would require more precise calculations considering the specific properties of the particles involved and their decay rates."
