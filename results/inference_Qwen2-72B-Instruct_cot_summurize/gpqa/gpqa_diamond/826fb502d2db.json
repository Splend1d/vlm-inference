                    "text": "To find the relative velocity of the two objects moving at relativistic speeds, we use the relativistic velocity addition formula:\n\nv_rel = (v_1 - v_2) / (1 - v_1*v_2/c^2)\n\nwhere v_1 and v_2 are the velocities of the two objects in the same reference frame.\n\nIn this case, v_1 = 0.6c and v_2 = 0.5c. Plugging these values into the formula gives:\n\nv_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c^2)\nv_rel = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3)\nv_rel = 0.1c / 0.7\nv_rel \u2248 0.14c\n\nSo the relative velocity is approximately 0.14c.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the total energy of the system. The total energy of an object with mass m moving at a velocity v is given by:\n\nE = mc^2 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nWe can calculate the total energy for each astronaut and then add them together:\n\nE_1 = (2m)c^2 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2/c^2) = (2m)c^2 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = (2m)c^2 / sqrt(0.64) = (2m)c^2 / 0.8 = 2.5mc^2\n\nE_2 = (3m)c^2 / sqrt(1 - (0.5c)^2/c^2) = (3m)c^2 / sqrt(1 - 0.25) = (3m)c^2 / sqrt(0.75) = (3m)c^2 / 0.866 = 3.46mc^2\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the energies of the two astronauts:\n\nE_total = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5mc^2 + 3.46mc^2 = 5.96mc^2\n\nTherefore, the answer is D: v_rel = 0.14c , E= 5.96 mc^2."
