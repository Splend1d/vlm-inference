                    "text": "The reactions described involve the epoxidation of (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene using meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid (mCPBA), followed by hydrolysis with aqueous acid. This sequence converts an alkene into a vicinal diol via an epoxide intermediate.\n\nIn Reaction 1, the (E)-oct-4-ene will form an epoxide which, when hydrolyzed, will give a single diastereomer of the vicinal diol due to the retention of configuration at the newly formed stereocenters. Similarly, in Reaction 2, the (Z)-oct-4-ene will also form an epoxide which, upon hydrolysis, will yield another diastereomer of the vicinal diol.\n\nThe resulting diols from both reactions have different stereochemistry at the newly formed stereocenters. On a standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC column, the two diastereomers would be detected as separate peaks because they have different polarities and hydrophobicities, leading to different retention times. However, since there are only two different molecules (the two diastereomers), we would expect only two peaks in this case.\n\nWhen analyzed on a chiral HPLC column, however, each diastereomer can resolve into its enantiomers if they are not superimposable. Since the starting materials were (E)- and (Z)-alkenes, which do not contain any pre-existing chirality, the epoxidation step should lead to racemic mixtures of the epoxides, which upon hydrolysis would yield racemic mixtures of the vicinal diols. Therefore, on a chiral column, each of the two diastereomers would resolve into two peaks corresponding to its enantiomers, resulting in four peaks in total.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\nD. 4 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC\n\nHowever, this assumes that the chiral HPLC column can indeed separate the enantiomers of the diastereomers, which might not be the case for all chiral columns. If the chiral column cannot resolve the enantiomers, then the answer would be B. 2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC. But given the question's assumption of high resolution, option D is correct."
