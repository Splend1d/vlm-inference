Upon phosphorylation on the Ser residues in the transactivation domain, it dimerizes, shuttles into the nucleus, and serves in gene transcription. A missense mutation X in the transactivation domain is a recessive loss-of-function mutation. You observe that a heterozygous mutation Y in the dimerization domain acts as a dominant-negative mutation. Which of the following molecular phenotypes is most likely observed in the presence of mutation Y?\n\nA. loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype\nB. protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype\nC. protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele\nD. change of protein conformation and gain-of-function phenotype\n"

This can lead to the formation of non-functional heterodimers, which could prevent the wild-type protein from functioning correctly, resulting in a loss-of-function phenotype. Additionally, these non-functional heterodimers might aggregate, further exacerbating the loss of function by sequestering functional proteins."
