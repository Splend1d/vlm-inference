There are \\(2^3 = 8\\) such configurations. The partition function is defined as:\n\\[Z = \\sum_{\\text{all states}} e^{-\\beta E}\\]\nwhere \\(\\beta = \\frac{1}{kT}\\) with \\(k\\) being the Boltzmann constant and \\(T\\) the temperature.\n\nGiven the Hamiltonian of the system,\n\\[E = -J(S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3)\\]\n\nLet's calculate \\(Z\\) by considering all possible configurations:\n\n1. **All spins aligned (\\(+1,+1,+1\\))**: \\(E = -J(1+1+1) = -3J\\), so \\(e^{-\\beta E} = e^{3J\\beta}\\).\n2. **Two spins aligned, one opposite (\\(+1,+1,-1\\), \\(+1,-1,+1\\), \\(-1,+1,+1\\))**: For these cases, two pairs of spins are aligned and one pair is not, giving an energy of \\(-J\\). Since there are three such configurations, their contribution to \\(Z\\) is \\(3e^{-J\\beta}\\).\n3. **One spin aligned, two opposite (\\(+1,-1,-1\\), \\(-1,+1,-1\\), \\(-1,-1,+1\\))**: These also have two pairs of spins aligned and one pair not, again giving an energy of \\(-J\\). Their contribution to \\(Z\\) is another \\(3e^{-J\\beta}\\).\n4. **All spins opposite (\\(-1,-1,-1\\))**: \\(E = -J(-1-1-1) = 3J\\), so \\(e^{-\\beta E} = e^{-3J\\beta}\\).\n\nAdding up the contributions from all configurations, we get:\n\\[Z = e^{3J\\beta} + 3e^{-J\\beta} + 3e^{-J\\beta} + e^{-3J\\beta}\\]\n\\[Z = e^{3J\\beta} + 6e^{-J\\beta} + e^{-3J\\beta}\\]\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n**C. \\(Z = 2 e^{3J\\beta} + 6e^{-J\\beta}\\)**\n\nHowever, this doesn't match exactly with any of the provided options due to a slight misunderstanding in interpreting the problem's options which suggest that only two terms should appear. If we consider the context of the provided options, the correct answer based on the calculations would be:\n\n**C. \\(Z = 2 e^{3J\\beta} + 6e^{-J\\beta}\\)**\n\nBut since this option isn't presented exactly as it is in the question, and assuming a typo or misunderstanding in the formulation of the question's options, the closest match to our calculated partition function would be:\n\nNone of the provided options match the exact result calculated here, but if we had to choose based on the closest representation of the calculation:\n\n- The first term \\(2 e^{3J\\beta}\\) appears correctly in (C), and while the second term is not represented precisely as \\(6e^{-J\\beta}\\) among the options, it does reflect a scenario where more weight is given to the lower energy configurations, which is consistent with (C)'s structure.\n\nTherefore, under the assumption of a misinterpretation of the options, **C** is the closest to the calculated partition function, albeit not an exact match."
