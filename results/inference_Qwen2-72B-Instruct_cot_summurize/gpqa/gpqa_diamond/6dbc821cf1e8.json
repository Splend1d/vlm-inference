The surface area \\(A\\) of the event horizon is then given by\n\n\\[A = 4\\pi r_s^2\\]\n\nWe can also relate the angular size \\(\\theta\\) of the black hole as seen from Earth to its actual size and distance using the small angle approximation:\n\n\\[\\theta \\approx \\frac{r_s}{d}\\]\n\nwhere \\(d\\) is the distance to the black hole in radians (we'll convert it later).\n\nGiven that \\(\\theta = 10^{-17}\\) degrees, we need to convert this to radians since all physical equations use radians for angles. There are approximately \\(57.3\\) degrees in one radian, so\n\n\\[\\theta = 10^{-17} \\times \\frac{\\pi}{57.3} \\approx 5.2 \\times 10^{-19}\\] radians.\n\nRearranging the small angle approximation gives us the Schwarzschild radius:\n\n\\[r_s \\approx d\\theta = 10^{10} \\times 5.2 \\times 10^{-19} = 5.2 \\times 10^{-9}\\] parsecs.\n\nTo find the surface area \\(A\\), we first need to convert the Schwarzschild radius into meters because the Planck length is in meters:\n\n\\[r_s = 5.2 \\times 10^{-9} \\times 3.0857 \\times 10^{16} = 1.6 \\times 10^{8}\\] meters.\n\n\\[A = 4\\pi r_s^2 = 4\\pi (1.6 \\times 10^{8})^2 = 3.2 \\times 10^{17}\\] square meters.\n\nNow we can calculate the entropy:\n\n\\[S = \\frac{k_B A}{4 l_P^2} = \\frac{(1.38 \\times 10^{-23})(3.2 \\times 10^{17})}{4(1.6 \\times 10^{-35})^2}\\]\n\n\\[S \\approx 1.3 \\times 10^{77}\\] joules per kelvin.\n\nHowever, this is not among the choices provided, which suggests there may have been an error in either the calculation or the conversion factors used. Given the options, the closest in terms of order of magnitude would be:\n\nB. \\(10^{66}\\) J/K\n\nBut note that our calculation resulted in a much larger value than any of the options provided, indicating a possible discrepancy in how the problem was interpreted or solved. If we strictly compare the calculated order of magnitude with the given options, none match exactly, but B. \\(10^{66}\\) J/K is closest to our calculated result in terms of being the largest option available. However, the correct answer based on the provided calculation should not be among these choices if we strictly adhere to the numerical results obtained."
