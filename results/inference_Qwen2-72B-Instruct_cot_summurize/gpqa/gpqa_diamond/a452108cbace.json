                    "text": "The radial velocity (RV) method measures the wobble of a star due to the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet. The amplitude of this wobble is proportional to the product of the planet's mass and its orbital speed, which in turn depends on its distance from the star and the period of its orbit. According to Kepler's third law, the square of the orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a) of the orbit:\n\n\\[ P^2 \\propto a^3 \\]\n\nSince the planets are assumed to be in circular orbits, their semi-major axes are equal to their distances from the star. Also, since the stars have the same mass and the planets have similar masses, we can say that the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity curve (K), which is directly proportional to the planet's mass and inversely proportional to the square root of the semi-major axis, is proportional to the orbital period as follows:\n\n\\[ K \\propto \\frac{M_p}{\\sqrt{a}} \\propto \\frac{M_p}{\\sqrt[3]{P^2}} \\]\n\nThus, if we compare the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocity curves for two planets orbiting stars of the same mass, we can relate them to the ratio of their orbital periods:\n\n\\[ \\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\left( \\frac{P_1}{P_2} \\right)^{2/3} \\]\n\nGiven that \\( K_1 = 5 \\) milliangstroms and \\( K_2 = 7 \\) milliangstroms, we can find the ratio of the orbital periods:\n\n\\[ \\left( \\frac{P_1}{P_2} \\right)^{2/3} = \\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{5}{7} \\]\n\nTaking the reciprocal and raising both sides to the power of \\( \\frac{3}{2} \\) gives us the ratio of the orbital periods:\n\n\\[ \\left( \\frac{P_2}{P_1} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{7}{5} \\right)^{3/2} \\]\n\n\\[ \\left( \\frac{P_2}{P_1} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{7}{5} \\right)^{1.5} \\approx 1.96 \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. ~ 1.96."
