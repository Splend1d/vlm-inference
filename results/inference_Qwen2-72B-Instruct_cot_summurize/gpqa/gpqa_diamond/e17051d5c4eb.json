                    "text": "The regioselectivity of electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions is determined by the nature of substituents on the benzene ring. Activating groups, which increase the electron density of the ring, favor ortho and para products while deactivating groups, which decrease the electron density of the ring, favor meta products. \n\nHere are the substituents and their effects:\n\n1. \u04216H5-CH3 (Methyl group): Activating, ortho/para directing.\n2. C6H5-COOC2H5 (Ester group): Deactivating, meta directing.\n3. C6H5-Cl (Chloro group): Deactivating, ortho/para directing but less than methyl.\n4. C6H5-NO2 (Nitro group): Strongly deactivating, meta directing.\n5. C6H5-C2H5 (Ethyl group): Similar to methyl, slightly less activating.\n6. C6H5-COOH (Carboxylic acid group): Strongly deactivating, meta directing.\n\nThus, the order of increasing para-substitution would be influenced by the ability of the substituent to activate or deactivate the ring towards electrophilic attack, with more deactivating substituents leading to a lower para:ortho ratio and more activating substituents leading to a higher para:ortho ratio.\n\nConsidering these facts, the correct sequence should be from the most deactivating to least deactivating:\n\n4 (NO2) > 2 (COOC2H5) > 6 (COOH) > 3 (Cl) > 1 (CH3) > 5 (C2H5)\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nC. 4<2<6<3<1<5\n\nHowever, this may need some adjustments based on the specific conditions of the reaction and the exact mechanism of how the bromine interacts with the different substituents. But under normal circumstances, this order should hold true."
