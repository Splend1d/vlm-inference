                    "text": "The radiation pattern of an oscillating charge distribution can be described by its multipole moments, with the lowest-order term being the electric dipole moment for a non-spherical charge distribution. For a spheroidal charge distribution oscillating about its symmetry axis (z-axis), the radiation field can be characterized as a combination of electric dipole and higher-order multipoles.\n\nHowever, to simplify the problem, we will consider only the electric dipole contribution since it is typically the dominant term in the far-field (radiation zone) for such systems. The power radiated per unit solid angle by an electric dipole is given by:\n\n\\[ dP/d\\Omega = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{p^2\\omega^4}{c^3}\\sin^2\\theta \\]\n\nwhere \\( p \\) is the electric dipole moment, \\( \\omega \\) is the angular frequency, \\( c \\) is the speed of light, and \\( \\mu_0 \\) is the permeability of free space. Note that this expression assumes that the dipole is oscillating along the direction of measurement (in this case, along the z-axis).\n\nGiven that the question asks for the power radiated at an angle \\( \\theta \\), we can see from the equation above that the power radiated per unit solid angle is proportional to \\( \\sin^2\\theta \\). This means that the fraction of the maximum power \\( A \\) radiated at an angle \\( \\theta = 30^\\circ \\) is given by:\n\n\\[ \\frac{dP(\\theta=30^\\circ)}{d\\Omega} / \\frac{dP(\\theta=0^\\circ)}{d\\Omega} = \\frac{\\sin^2(30^\\circ)}{\\sin^2(0^\\circ)} = \\sin^2(30^\\circ) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{4} \\]\n\nThis eliminates options A and B since they do not match the calculated fraction of the maximum power.\n\nNext, let's consider the dependency on wavelength \\( \\lambda \\). Since \\( \\lambda = \\frac{2\\pi c}{\\omega} \\), and \\( \\omega \\) appears in the power formula as \\( \\omega^4 \\), the power radiated per unit solid angle will have a dependency on \\( \\lambda^{-4} \\) when expressed in terms of wavelength. This is because:\n\n\\[ \\omega^4 = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi c}{\\lambda}\\right)^4 = \\frac{(2\\pi c)^4}{\\lambda^4} \\]\n\nThus, the correct answer is D: the fraction of the maximum power radiated at an angle \\( \\theta = 30^\\circ \\) is \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\), and the power radiated per unit solid angle has a dependency on \\( \\lambda^{-4} \\)."
