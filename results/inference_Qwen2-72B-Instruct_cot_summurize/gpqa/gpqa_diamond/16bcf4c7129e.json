The FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption peak at 3000 wavenumbers. Two other strong absorption peaks are observed at 1700 and 1650 wavenumbers. Several peaks were observed in the 1H NMR spectrum including peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens. The mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z = 45.

                    "text": "The FTIR spectrum provides information about functional groups present in the compound. A very broad absorption peak at around 3000 cm\\(^{-1}\\) is typically associated with O-H stretching vibrations in alcohols, phenols, or carboxylic acids, but since it's broad, it suggests there might be hydrogen bonding, which is common in alcohols and carboxylic acids. Peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm\\(^{-1}\\) suggest the presence of carbonyl (\\(C=O\\)) groups, with the 1700 cm\\(^{-1}\\) peak indicative of a ketone, ester, or carboxylic acid, while the 1650 cm\\(^{-1}\\) could also indicate a conjugated carbonyl group (like in \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated ketones/esters) or even a contribution from a C=C stretch in the case of an alkene bond.\n\nThe observation of vinyl hydrogens in the \\(^1\\)H NMR spectrum confirms the presence of an alkene (\\(C=C\\)) group. This aligns with the potential interpretation of the 1650 cm\\(^{-1}\\) peak in the FTIR spectrum.\n\nThe mass spectrum showing a fragment peak at m/z = 45 is significant because it matches well with the molecular ion of isopropyl (\\(C_3H_7^+\\), m/z = 45) or a methyl ester fragment (\\(CH_3COO^\\cdot\\), m/z = 45). This suggests that the compound may contain an isopropyl group or a methyl ester functionality.\n\nConsidering all the information:\n- The presence of a carbonyl group and a vinyl group indicates the compound is unsaturated.\n- The broad peak around 3000 cm\\(^{-1}\\) indicates the presence of an O-H group, likely an alcohol or carboxylic acid.\n- The fragment peak at m/z = 45 suggests an isopropyl or methyl ester group.\n\nGiven these observations, let\u2019s analyze the provided options for the molecular formula:\n\nA. \\(C_6H_{10}O_2\\) - This formula can accommodate both the carbonyl and vinyl functionalities along with the oxygen necessary for an alcohol or ester group. It is consistent with a compound that has an unsaturated ester or acid structure.\n\nB. \\(C_6H_{12}O_2\\) - This formula suggests a fully saturated compound, which contradicts the presence of a vinyl group.\n\nC. \\(C_6H_{12}O\\) - This formula does not account for the additional oxygen atom needed for the carbonyl group(s) and potentially an alcohol group.\n\nD. \\(C_6H_{10}O\\) - This formula does not account for the two oxygens required based on the FTIR data indicating at least one carbonyl group and potentially an alcohol or another carbonyl group.\n\nBased on the provided data, the most plausible formula is **A. \\(C_6H_{10}O_2\\)**, which can accommodate an unsaturated ester or acid structure."
