Since we're assuming the stars are uniformly distributed, the number of stars within a given volume is constant. Therefore, the number of stars per unit volume remains the same, but since the volume increases as the cube of the distance (or inversely, as the cube of the parallax), the number of stars per unit parallax decreases as the inverse cube of the parallax."
