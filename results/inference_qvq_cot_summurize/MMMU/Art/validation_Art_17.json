                "text": "So I'm looking at this image of a stone sculpture, and it's supposed to be a Mayan chacmool figure. It's sitting on a pedestal with a beautiful beach in the background\u2014clear blue sky, fluffy white clouds, and the ocean stretching out to the horizon. A few people are walking along the sand, and there are some small waves breaking near the shore. The sculpture itself is quite striking; it's made of stone and appears to be reclining, with one arm resting on its chest and the other along its body. It has a distinctive headdress, and the overall style seems ancient and intricate.\n\nNow, the question is asking which twentieth-century sculptor was influenced by these Mayan chacmool sculptures. The options are Louise Bourgeois, Henry Moore, Barbara Hepworth, and Constantin Brancusi. I need to recall some art history here.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand what a chacmool is. From what I remember, chacmolos or chacmools are pre-Columbian sculptures, particularly from the Maya and Aztec cultures. They are often depicted as human figures, usually lying on their backs with their knees bent and sometimes holding a bowl or container on their stomachs. They were possibly used for ritual purposes, maybe for offerings or sacrifices.\n\nSo, considering that, I need to think about which of these sculptors might have been influenced by such forms.\n\nLet me consider each option one by one.\n\nStarting with Louise Bourgeois. I know she was a French-American sculptor, famous for her large-scale installations and sculptures that often explored themes of family, sexuality, and the human condition. Her works can be quite abstract and sometimes have a sense of tension or unease. While she did work with various materials, including stone, I'm not sure if her style was directly influenced by Mayan sculptures. Maybe she was inspired by the emotional depth or the symbolic nature of these figures, but I don't recall any specific references to chacmools in her work.\n\nNext, Henry Moore. He's a British sculptor, known for his abstract, often organic forms that seem to evoke the human body or natural elements. Moore worked extensively with stone and was famous for his reclining figures, which sometimes resemble the human form in a very stylized way. I seem to remember that Moore was interested in ancient art from various cultures, including Mexican art. In fact, I think he was particularly drawn to the way Mexican artists handled stone and the forms they created. So, it's possible that the Mayan chacmool sculptures influenced his work, especially his reclining figures.\n\nBarbara Hepworth is another British sculptor, known for her modernist sculptures that often incorporated holes or cavities, giving them a sense of openness and lightness. Her works were more geometric and abstract compared to Moore's organic forms. While she was part of the same artistic circle and even collaborated with Moore at times, I don't see as direct a connection between her style and the Mayan chacmool sculptures. Her sculptures don't seem to reference the same kind of figurative forms found in chacmools.\n\nLastly, Constantin Brancusi, a Romanian sculptor who worked in France. Brancusi is famous for his extremely simplified, almost minimalist sculptures that often resemble human heads or other basic forms. His works are characterized by smooth, polished surfaces and a reduction to essential shapes. While Brancusi was influenced by folk art and ancient sculptures from various cultures, including Egyptian and African art, I don't recall any specific connection to Mayan chacmool sculptures. His figures are more upright and abstracted rather than reclining like the chacmools.\n\nConsidering all this, I think Henry Moore is the most likely answer. His interest in stone carving, his creation of reclining figures, and his known admiration for Mexican art make him a strong candidate for having been influenced by Mayan chacmool sculptures.\n\nJust to double-check, I can try to recall if any of his famous works resemble the chacmool figures. For example, his \"Reclining Figure\" series does share some similarities in pose with the chacmools\u2014lying on their backs, sometimes with arms positioned in a similar manner. Additionally, Moore was known for incorporating elements from ancient art into his modernist approach, so this seems plausible.\n\nI don't think Louise Bourgeois's work has the same figurative qualities or poses as the chacmools, although her sculptures can be quite expressive and bodily. Barbara Hepworth's sculptures are more abstract and less figurative, focusing on form and space rather than representational figures. Brancusi's works are also more abstract and stylized, with less emphasis on the human figure in a reclining position.\n\nTherefore, I'm fairly confident that Henry Moore is the correct answer to this question.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
