There are no visual frills or adornments, no reliance on gaudy color or superfluous detail. There is little more than fluidity of line and grace. Yet the sculpture speaks volumes about the deepest and most profound of all human relationships. Personification is a literary device in which human qualities are ascribed to a nonhuman subject.

                "text": "Alright, I've got this passage about a sculpture by Elizabeth Catlett, and it's describing how the sculpture tells a story of the bond between a mother and her child. The language used is really poetic and emphasizes the simplicity and grace of the sculpture. There's a question at the end about personification, and I need to choose which statement best captures that.\n\nFirst, let me make sure I understand what personification is. Personification is when human characteristics are attributed to something that isn't human, like an object, an animal, or an abstract concept. So, in this passage, I should look for a place where the author describes the sculpture or something related to it with human-like qualities.\n\nLet's look at each option:\n\nA. The bond between mother and child is described as unbreakable.\n\nWell, a bond is an abstract concept, and describing it as \"unbreakable\" is a metaphor, but is it personification? Hmm, not really. \"Unbreakable\" suggests strength and durability, which can be applied to both literal and figurative bonds. I don't think this is personification.\n\nB. A sculpture is described as speaking.\n\nOh, this sounds promising. Sculptures can't literally speak; they're inanimate objects. So, if the passage says the sculpture \"speaks volumes,\" that's attributing a human-like quality to it\u2014communication through speech. That seems like personification.\n\nC. The artist is described as a storyteller.\n\nHere, the artist is being compared to a storyteller. But the artist is a person, and being a storyteller is a human activity. So, this doesn't seem like personification because both are human entities.\n\nD. A sculpture is without frills.\n\n\"This sculpture is without frills\" means it's simple and not overly decorated. \"Frills\" here refer to unnecessary decorations or embellishments. This is more of a description of the sculpture's style, not attributing human qualities to it.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, option B seems to be the best example of personification in the passage. The sculpture is described as \"speaking volumes,\" which gives it a human-like quality of communication.\n\nJust to double-check, let me read the passage again to make sure I'm not missing anything.\n\n\"Elizabeth Catlett's sculpture tells a warm and tender story. It is a story of the unbreakable bond that unites a mother and her child. Like a good storyteller, Catlett is economical in her use of imagery. There are no visual frills or adornments, no reliance on gaudy color or superfluous detail. There is little more than fluidity of line and grace. Yet the sculpture speaks volumes about the deepest and most profound of all human relationships.\"\n\nYes, there it is: \"the sculpture speaks volumes.\" That's definitely personification because sculptures don't actually speak; they communicate through visual means. So, attributing speech to the sculpture is giving it a human quality.\n\nI think I'm confident with this answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
