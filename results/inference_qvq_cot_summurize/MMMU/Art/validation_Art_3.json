                "text": "So I've got this image here, and I need to name the artist. The options are Claude Monet, Henri Matisse, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, and Edouard Manet. Hmm, let's see. I'm not an expert on art, but I do recognize some styles.\n\nFirst off, the image is a poster featuring a woman named Jane Avril. She's depicted in a dynamic pose, with her red hair flowing and her dress mostly black with some red and yellow accents. The background is a plain, beige color, which makes the figures stand out. The text \"JANE AVRIL\" is prominently displayed below her, and there's some smaller text that says \"H. Stern, Paris. 1899\" at the bottom right corner.\n\nOkay, so this is from 1899, which gives me a timeframe. Let's think about the artistic movements around that time. Impressionism was big in the late 19th century, Post-Impressionism was emerging, and Art Nouveau was also popular.\n\nClaude Monet is a prominent Impressionist, known for his landscapes and light effects. His works often have a soft, brushy quality with bright colors. This poster seems more bold and graphic, with cleaner lines and flatter areas of color. So, maybe not Monet.\n\nHenri Matisse was more active in the early 20th century, leading the Fauvism movement, which is known for its use of intense colors and bold brushstrokes. While this poster does use bold colors, the style seems a bit earlier than Matisse's Fauvism.\n\nEdouard Manet was a key figure in the transition from Realism to Impressionism. His works often featured modern-life subjects and had a certain immediacy. However, his style was more realistic compared to this poster's more stylized and decorative approach.\n\nHenri de Toulouse-Lautrec was famous for his posters and paintings depicting the nightlife of Paris, particularly in the Montmartre district. He was associated with both Impressionism and Art Nouveau, and his posters are known for their vibrant colors, dynamic compositions, and sometimes, their depiction of performers and dancers.\n\nWait a minute, Jane Avril was a famous can-can dancer in Paris during the late 19th century, and Toulouse-Lautrec is known for portraying her in several of his works. In fact, I think he did a few posters featuring her.\n\nLooking back at the poster, the stylized representation, the use of bold colors, and the dynamic pose all align with Toulouse-Lautrec's poster art. He often used strong outlines and flattened areas of color, which is evident here.\n\nLet me double-check some details. The way the dress curves and flows with her movement is characteristic of his style. Also, the way the hair is rendered with sweeping lines and the expressive face of Jane Avril seem consistent with his portraiture.\n\nAnother thing I notice is the signature \"H. Stern, Paris. 1899.\" Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec was active during this period, and 1899 falls within his lifetime. He died in 1901.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider if any of the other artists were known for producing posters at this time. Claude Monet was primarily a painter and not known for poster art. Henri Matisse was still a student in 1899 and hadn't yet made a name for himself in poster design. Edouard Manet did some illustration work but wasn't particularly known for posters.\n\nTherefore, based on the style of the poster and the context of the subject and the date, it seems most plausible that Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec is the artist of this image.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C. HENRI DE TOULOUSE-LAUTREC}} \\]"
