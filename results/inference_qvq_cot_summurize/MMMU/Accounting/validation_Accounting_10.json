                "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to find two things for Rocket Transport: first, the net cash provided by or used in investing activities, and second, the net increase or decrease in cash for the year. I'm given a list of cash transactions, each with an amount, and I need to categorize and sum them appropriately.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what constitutes investing activities. Generally, investing activities involve long-term assets and other investments not related to everyday operations. This includes purchasing or selling assets like property, plant, and equipment, and buying or selling investments in other companies.\n\nLooking at the list:\n\n- Cash dividend: $80,000\n\n- Purchase of bus: $33,000\n\n- Interest paid on debt: $25,000\n\n- Sales of old equipment: $72,000\n\n- Repurchase of stock: $55,000\n\n- Cash payments to suppliers: $95,000\n\n- Cash collections from customers: $300,000\n\nI need to identify which of these are investing activities.\n\nStarting with the purchase of a bus: that sounds like an asset purchase, probably for operations, so that should be an investing activity. It's a cash outflow, so it's money used in investing activities.\n\nNext, sales of old equipment: that's selling an asset, which is also an investing activity. This is a cash inflow.\n\nSo, for investing activities, I have:\n\n- Purchase of bus: ($33,000)\n\n- Sales of old equipment: $72,000\n\nNet cash from investing activities would be the sum of these: $72,000 - $33,000 = $39,000\n\nWait a minute, is that a positive $39,000? Yes, because sales exceed purchases, so it's net cash provided by investing activities.\n\nBut looking at the options:\n\nA. (1)$39,000 ; (2)84,000\n\nB. (1)$36,000 ; (2)77,000\n\nC. (1)$38,650 ; (2)82,910\n\nOption A has (1)$39,000, which matches my calculation for net cash from investing activities.\n\nNow, for the net increase or decrease in cash for the year, I need to look at all the cash inflows and outflows and sum them up.\n\nLet's categorize the transactions:\n\n1. Cash dividend: $80,000 \u2013 this is likely a financing activity (paying dividends to shareholders).\n\n2. Purchase of bus: $33,000 \u2013 investing activity.\n\n3. Interest paid on debt: $25,000 \u2013 financing activity.\n\n4. Sales of old equipment: $72,000 \u2013 investing activity.\n\n5. Repurchase of stock: $55,000 \u2013 financing activity.\n\n6. Cash payments to suppliers: $95,000 \u2013 operating activity.\n\n7. Cash collections from customers: $300,000 \u2013 operating activity.\n\nNow, to find the net increase or decrease in cash, I need to sum all cash inflows and subtract all cash outflows.\n\nFirst, sum all cash inflows:\n\n- Sales of old equipment: $72,000\n\n- Cash collections from customers: $300,000\n\nTotal cash inflows: $72,000 + $300,000 = $372,000\n\nNow, sum all cash outflows:\n\n- Purchase of bus: $33,000\n\n- Cash dividend: $80,000\n\n- Interest paid on debt: $25,000\n\n- Repurchase of stock: $55,000\n\n- Cash payments to suppliers: $95,000\n\nTotal cash outflows: $33,000 + $80,000 + $25,000 + $55,000 + $95,000 = $288,000\n\nNet increase in cash: total inflows - total outflows = $372,000 - $288,000 = $84,000\n\nSo, the net increase in cash for the year is $84,000.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. (1)$39,000 ; (2)84,000\n\nB. (1)$36,000 ; (2)77,000\n\nC. (1)$38,650 ; (2"
