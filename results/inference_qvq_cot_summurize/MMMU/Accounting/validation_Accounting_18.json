                "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a manufacturing company with various inventory accounts and some costs incurred during the year. We need to find the cost of materials used in production. The options are close to each other, so I need to be careful with my calculations.\n\nFirst, let's list out what we know:\n\n- Beginning raw materials inventory: \\$15,394\n\n- Ending raw materials inventory: \\$17,432\n\n- Purchases of raw materials: \\$77,321\n\n- Direct labor costs: \\$125,900\n\n- Overhead is applied at 75\\% of direct labor cost.\n\nWe need to find the cost of materials used in production.\n\nI recall that the cost of materials used in production can be calculated using the formula:\n\nCost of materials used = Beginning raw materials inventory + Purchases of raw materials - Ending raw materials inventory\n\nLet me plug in the numbers:\n\nCost of materials used = \\$15,394 + \\$77,321 - \\$17,432\n\nLet's add \\$15,394 and \\$77,321 first:\n\n\\$15,394\n\n+ \\$77,321\n\n= \\$92,715\n\nNow, subtract the ending raw materials inventory:\n\n\\$92,715 - \\$17,432 = \\$75,283\n\nLooking at the options, D. \\$75,283 seems to be the answer. But wait, I should double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nLet me verify the addition:\n\n\\$15,394\n\n+ \\$77,321\n\nAdding 15,394 and 77,321:\n\n94 + 321 = 415 \u2192 but wait, that doesn't seem right. Maybe I should carry over properly.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n4 + 1 = 5 (thousands place)\n\n3 + 3 = 6 (ten thousands place)\n\n5 + 7 = 12 (hundred thousands place)\n\nSo, \\$15,394 + \\$77,321 = \\$92,715. That seems correct.\n\nNow, subtract \\$17,432 from \\$92,715:\n\n92,715\n\n- 17,432\n\n= 75,283\n\nYes, that matches option D.\n\nBut let me think again. Is there any other way this could be calculated? Maybe considering direct labor and overhead? Wait, no, because the cost of materials used should only relate to the raw materials inventory accounts.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes companies use direct materials used in their calculations, but in this case, it's straightforward using the inventory balances.\n\nI don't think we need to involve direct labor or overhead in this specific calculation. The question is directly asking for the cost of materials used in production, which should be derived from the raw materials inventory accounts.\n\nSo, my final answer is \\$75,283, which corresponds to option D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
