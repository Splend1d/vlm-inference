                "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these finance concepts, but I think I can figure it out with the information provided.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the required rate of return for SmileWhite Corporation using the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). The CAPM formula is:\n\n\\[ r = r_f + \\beta \\times (r_m - r_f) \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( r \\) is the required rate of return\n\n- \\( r_f \\) is the risk-free rate\n\n- \\( \\beta \\) is the beta of the stock\n\n- \\( r_m \\) is the expected market return\n\nFrom the table, I have:\n\n- Risk-free rate (\\( r_f \\)) = 4.50%\n\n- Expected market return (\\( r_m \\)) = 14.50%\n\n- Beta for SmileWhite = 1.15\n\nPlugging these values into the CAPM formula:\n\n\\[ r = 4.5\\% + 1.15 \\times (14.5\\% - 4.5\\%) \\]\n\nLet me calculate the difference in the expected market return and the risk-free rate:\n\n\\[ 14.5\\% - 4.5\\% = 10\\% \\]\n\nNow, multiply that by the beta:\n\n\\[ 1.15 \\times 10\\% = 11.5\\% \\]\n\nFinally, add that to the risk-free rate:\n\n\\[ r = 4.5\\% + 11.5\\% = 16\\% \\]\n\nSo, the required rate of return for SmileWhite is 16%.\n\nWait a minute, the options are:\n\nA. 14%\n\nB. 15%\n\nC. 16%\n\nSo, according to my calculation, the answer should be C. 16%.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, the CAPM formula seems right: \\( r = r_f + \\beta \\times (r_m - r_f) \\).\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n- Risk-free rate (\\( r_f \\)) = 4.5%\n\n- Beta (\\( \\beta \\)) = 1.15\n\n- Expected market return (\\( r_m \\)) = 14.5%\n\nSubtracting:\n\n\\[ 14.5\\% - 4.5\\% = 10\\% \\]\n\nMultiplying by beta:\n\n\\[ 1.15 \\times 10\\% = 11.5\\% \\]\n\nAdding back the risk-free rate:\n\n\\[ 4.5\\% + 11.5\\% = 16\\% \\]\n\nEverything checks out. So, I'm confident that the correct answer is 16%.\n\nI think that's it for this part. Now, if there's more to this problem, I'll need to proceed accordingly, but for now, calculating the required rate of return for SmileWhite using CAPM seems straightforward.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{16\\%} \\]"
