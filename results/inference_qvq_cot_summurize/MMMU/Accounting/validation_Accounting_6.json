                "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. I've got this table here that shows job costs for four different jobs\u2014AA2, AA4, AA5, and AA3\u2014across the months of January, February, and March. There are also columns indicating when each job was completed and when they were sold. My task is to find the balances for work in process inventory, finished goods inventory, and cost of goods sold for January.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these terms means:\n\n1. **Work in Process (WIP) Inventory**: This includes the costs of jobs that are started but not yet completed.\n\n2. **Finished Goods Inventory**: This is the cost of completed jobs that haven't been sold yet.\n\n3. **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**: This is the cost of the jobs that have been completed and sold.\n\nGiven that, I need to categorize each job's costs based on their status in January.\n\nLet's look at each job one by one:\n\n1. **Job AA2**:\n\n- January: \\$2,500\n\n- February: \\$1,200\n\n- Completed: February\n\n- Sold: Not sold\n\nSo, for AA2, the total cost is \\$2,500 + \\$1,200 = \\$3,700.\n\n- In January, it's in progress (since it was completed in February).\n\n2. **Job AA4**:\n\n- January: \\$4,838\n\n- Completed: January\n\n- Sold: February\n\nTotal cost: \\$4,838.\n\n- In January, it's completed and then sold in February.\n\n3. **Job AA5**:\n\n- February: \\$3,250\n\n- Completed: February\n\n- Sold: March\n\nTotal cost: \\$3,250.\n\n- In January, it hasn't started yet.\n\n4. **Job AA3**:\n\n- February: \\$3,409\n\n- March: \\$2,319\n\n- Completed: April\n\nTotal cost: \\$3,409 + \\$2,319 = \\$5,728.\n\n- In January, it hasn't started yet.\n\nNow, for January, I need to consider:\n\n- **WIP Inventory**: Jobs that are started but not completed by the end of January.\n\n- **Finished Goods Inventory**: Jobs that are completed by January but not sold by January.\n\n- **COGS**: Jobs that are both completed and sold in January.\n\nFrom the above:\n\n- Job AA2 is in progress in January.\n\n- Job AA4 is completed in January and sold in February.\n\n- Jobs AA5 and AA3 haven't started yet in January.\n\nTherefore:\n\n- **WIP Inventory for January**: Cost of Job AA2 up to January, which is \\$2,500.\n\n- **Finished Goods Inventory for January**: Cost of Job AA4, which is \\$4,838 (completed in January but sold in February).\n\n- **COGS for January**: No jobs were both completed and sold in January, so \\$0.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 2,500 4,838 0\n\nB. 3,409 6,950 4,838\n\nC. 5,728 3,700 3,250\n\nD. 5,728 3,409 2,500\n\nOption A seems to match my calculations.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check to make sure I haven't missed anything.\n\nFirst, WIP for January should include only the costs incurred up to January for jobs not completed by January. Job AA2 had \\$2,500 in January and was completed in February, so its WIP cost is \\$2,500.\n\nFinished Goods for January should include the costs of jobs completed in January that weren't sold by the end of January. Job AA4 was completed in January and sold in February, so its cost of \\$4,838 should be in Finished Goods Inventory for January.\n\nCOGS for January would include jobs completed and sold in January. Looking at the table, no jobs were both completed and sold in January. Job AA4 was completed in January but sold in February, so its cost shouldn't be in COGS for January.\n\nTherefore, the correct balances are:\n\nWIP Inventory: \\$2,500\n\nFinished Goods Inventory: \\$4,838\n\nCost of Goods Sold: \\$0\n\nWhich corresponds to option A.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there are any other jobs that might affect these balances in January.\n\nJob AA5 starts in February and is completed in February, sold in March. So, in January, it hasn't started yet, so no costs to consider for WIP, FG, or COGS in January.\n\nJob AA3 starts in"
