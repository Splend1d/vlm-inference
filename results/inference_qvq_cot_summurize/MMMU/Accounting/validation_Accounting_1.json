                "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have Baxter Company with a relevant range of production between 15,000 and 30,000 units. The cost data given is for 25,000 units, and we need to find out what the per unit manufacturing overhead costs would be if 30,000 units are produced.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's included in manufacturing overhead. From the table, we have direct materials, direct labor, indirect materials, fixed manufacturing overhead, variable manufacturing overhead, fixed selling and administrative expenses, and variable sales commissions. Manufacturing overhead typically includes both variable and fixed costs related to the manufacturing process. So, in this case, manufacturing overhead would consist of indirect materials and both fixed and variable manufacturing overhead.\n\nGiven that, let's identify the costs that make up manufacturing overhead:\n\n- Indirect materials: \\$3 per unit\n\n- Fixed manufacturing overhead: \\$6 per unit\n\n- Variable manufacturing overhead: \\$2 per unit\n\nSo, total manufacturing overhead per unit at 25,000 units is \\$3 + \\$6 + \\$2 = \\$11 per unit.\n\nNow, the question is asking for the per unit manufacturing overhead costs if 30,000 units are produced. Since we're still within the relevant range (15,000 to 30,000 units), we can assume that the variable costs per unit remain the same, and the fixed costs are spread over more units.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. Variable manufacturing overhead per unit: This should stay the same as long as we're within the relevant range. So, variable manufacturing overhead per unit remains \\$2.\n\n2. Fixed manufacturing overhead per unit: This changes based on the number of units produced because fixed costs are spread over more or fewer units.\n\nAt 25,000 units, fixed manufacturing overhead is \\$6 per unit. At 30,000 units, the fixed cost\u603b\u989d should remain the same, but spread over more units, so the per unit fixed manufacturing overhead should decrease.\n\nFirst, let's find the total fixed manufacturing overhead cost. At 25,000 units, it's \\$6 per unit, so total fixed cost is 25,000 units * \\$6 = \\$150,000.\n\nNow, if production increases to 30,000 units, the fixed cost is still \\$150,000, but now spread over 30,000 units. So, the new fixed manufacturing overhead per unit is \\$150,000 / 30,000 units = \\$5 per unit.\n\nAdding back the variable manufacturing overhead per unit of \\$2, the total manufacturing overhead per unit at 30,000 units would be \\$5 (fixed) + \\$2 (variable) = \\$7 per unit.\n\nWait a minute, but the answer options include \\$6, \\$7, \\$8, and \\$9. So, \\$7 is one of the options. But let's double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nIndirect materials are part of manufacturing overhead and are likely variable costs, given that they vary with production volume. So, indirect materials are \\$3 per unit, which should remain the same at 30,000 units.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I only considered fixed and variable manufacturing overhead, but didn't include indirect materials. Maybe I need to include that as well.\n\nLet's re-examine the manufacturing overhead components:\n\n- Indirect materials: \\$3 per unit (variable)\n\n- Fixed manufacturing overhead: \\$6 per unit\n\n- Variable manufacturing overhead: \\$2 per unit\n\nTotal manufacturing overhead per unit at 25,000 units: \\$3 + \\$6 + \\$2 = \\$11 per unit.\n\nNow, at 30,000 units:\n\n- Indirect materials remain \\$3 per unit (since it's variable)\n\n- Fixed manufacturing overhead decreases to \\$5 per unit (as calculated earlier)\n\n- Variable manufacturing overhead remains \\$2 per unit\n\nSo, total manufacturing overhead per unit at 30,000 units: \\$3 + \\$5 + \\$2 = \\$10 per unit.\n\nBut the question is specifically asking for the per unit manufacturing overhead costs incurred if 30,000 units are produced. So, should I include indirect materials in that? It seems like manufacturing overhead includes both indirect materials and manufacturing overhead costs.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to just consider manufacturing overhead excluding indirect materials. But that seems odd because indirect materials are part of manufacturing overhead.\n\nLet me check the definition. Manufacturing overhead typically includes all manufacturing costs except direct materials and direct labor. So, indirect materials are part of manufacturing overhead.\n\nMaybe the question is referring only to manufacturing overhead excluding indirect materials. But that doesn't make much sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps"
