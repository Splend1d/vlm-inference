                "text": "So I've got this table here that shows the number of invoices processed each month and the corresponding overtime wages paid. It's for the whole year of 2020, from January to December. The question is asking me to predict the overtime wages if 6,500 invoices are processed. And there are four options to choose from: A. \\$4,840, B. \\$4,940, C. \\$5,040, or D. \\$5,140.\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to understand the relationship between the number of invoices processed and the overtime wages. From the table, it seems like there's a connection between these two variables. Maybe more invoices processed lead to higher overtime wages, or perhaps there's some fixed cost plus a variable cost per invoice.\n\nLet me look at the data closely. In January, 12,000 invoices were processed with \\$7,760 in overtime wages. In February, it was 8,000 invoices and \\$6,800. Then March has 1,000 invoices and \\$6,000. April is 7,000 invoices and \\$6,100. May has 5,000 invoices and \\$6,200. June is 10,000 invoices and \\$7,300. July is 11,000 invoices and \\$7,400. August is 9,000 invoices and \\$6,900. September is 5,000 invoices and \\$6,500. October is 9,000 invoices and \\$6,600. November is 8,000 invoices and \\$6,800. And finally, December is 11,000 invoices and \\$7,450.\n\nHmm, I need to find a pattern here. Maybe there's a linear relationship between the number of invoices and the overtime wages. Perhaps I can plot these points and see if they form a straight line or something close to it.\n\nLet me consider invoices on the x-axis and overtime wages on the y-axis. For example, in January, x=12000, y=7760; in February, x=8000, y=6800; and so on.\n\nIf I plot these points, maybe I can draw a line of best fit and use that to predict the wages for 6,500 invoices.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a fixed cost plus a variable cost per invoice. If that's the case, I can set up an equation like y = mx + b, where m is the cost per invoice, x is the number of invoices, and b is the fixed cost.\n\nI need to find the values of m and b.\n\nOne way to approach this is to use the method of least squares to find the line of best fit.\n\nBut that might be a bit time-consuming, especially if I have to calculate it manually.\n\nMaybe there's a simpler way. Perhaps I can look at the average cost per invoice.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nFirst, calculate the total invoices processed over the year: 12,000 + 8,000 + 1,000 + 7,000 + 5,000 + 10,000 + 11,000 + 9,000 + 5,000 + 9,000 + 8,000 + 11,000.\n\nLet me add these up step by step:\n\n12,000 + 8,000 = 20,000\n\n20,000 + 1,000 = 21,000\n\n21,000 + 7,000 = 28,000\n\n28,000 + 5,000 = 33,000\n\n33,000 + 10,000 = 43,000\n\n43,000 + 11,000 = 54,000\n\n54,000 + 9,000 = 63,000\n\n63,000 + 5,000 = 68,000\n\n68,000 + 9,000 = 77,000\n\n77,000 + 8,000 = 85,000\n\n85,000 + 11,000 = 96,000\n\nSo total invoices processed in the year"
