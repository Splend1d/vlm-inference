                "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm a bit rusty on process costing, but I remember that the weighted-average method combines the costs of beginning work in process (WIP) and the costs added during the period, then calculates the equivalent units based on the units completed and transferred out, plus the equivalent units in ending WIP.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what equivalent units are. Equivalent units measure the amount of work done during the period, taking into account both the units completed and the units in process. Since materials are added at the beginning of the process, the materials component should be fully completed for the units started and partially completed for the ending WIP. However, since materials are added at the beginning, the units started should have \\(100 \\%\\) materials cost, and the ending WIP should also have \\(100 \\%\\) materials cost, regardless of the conversion percentage.\n\nBut the problem asks for equivalent units for conversion costs only. Conversion costs include labor and overhead, and these are typically added uniformly throughout the production process. The percentage of completion for conversion costs is given for the ending WIP in each quarter.\n\nSo, for each quarter, I need to calculate the equivalent units for conversion costs using the weighted-average method.\n\nLet's recall the formula for equivalent units under weighted-average:\n\nEquivalent Units = Units Transferred Out + (Ending WIP Units \u00d7 Percentage Complete for Conversion)\n\nBut since we're using the weighted-average method, we need to consider the beginning WIP and the units started.\n\nWait, in the weighted-average method, the beginning WIP is considered as part of the current period's work, and we don't distinguish between units started in prior periods and units started in the current period.\n\nLet me list out the data for each quarter:\n\nQuarter 1:\n\n- Beginning WIP: 0\n\n- Started: 255,000 units\n\n- Transferred Out: 235,000 units\n\n- Conversion (\\%): 50\\%\n\nQuarter 2:\n\n- Beginning WIP: 2,500 units\n\n- Started: 275,000 units\n\n- Transferred Out: 250,000 units\n\n- Conversion (\\%): 40\\%\n\nQuarter 3:\n\n- Beginning WIP: 3,600 units\n\n- Started: 290,000 units\n\n- Transferred Out: 275,000 units\n\n- Conversion (\\%): 45\\%\n\nQuarter 4:\n\n- Beginning WIP: 6,500 units\n\n- Started: 300,000 units\n\n- Transferred Out: 280,000 units\n\n- Conversion (\\%): 60\\%\n\nFor each quarter, I need to calculate the equivalent units for conversion costs.\n\nLet's start with Quarter 1.\n\nFirst, calculate the units in ending WIP:\n\nEnding WIP = Units Started - Units Transferred Out\n\nWait, no. Actually, ending WIP is the units not yet transferred out. In process costing, the flow of units is:\n\nBeginning WIP + Units Started = Units Transferred Out + Ending WIP\n\nSo, Ending WIP = Beginning WIP + Units Started - Units Transferred Out\n\nFor Quarter 1:\n\nEnding WIP = 0 + 255,000 - 235,000 = 20,000 units\n\nNow, equivalent units for conversion = Units Transferred Out + (Ending WIP \u00d7 Percentage Complete for Conversion)\n\nSo, equivalent units = 235,000 + (20,000 \u00d7 50\\%) = 235,000 + 10,000 = 245,000\n\nWait, but that's not among the options provided. Maybe I need to check my calculation again.\n\nActually, in the weighted-average method, the beginning WIP is considered as part of the current period's production. So, the total units accounted for are Beginning WIP + Units Started.\n\nEnding WIP is calculated as Total units accounted for - Units Transferred Out.\n\nBut in Quarter 1, beginning WIP is 0.\n\nSo, total units accounted for = 0 + 255,000 = 255,000\n\nEnding WIP = Total units - Units Transferred Out = 255,000 - 235,000 = 20,000 units\n\nEquivalent units for conversion = Units Transferred Out + (Ending WIP \u00d7 Percentage Complete)\n\n= 235,000 + (20,000 \u00d7 0.50) = 235,000 + 10,000 = 245,000\n\nBut since this isn't among"
