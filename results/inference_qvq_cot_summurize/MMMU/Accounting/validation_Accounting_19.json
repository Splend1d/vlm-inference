                "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have Baxter Company with a relevant range of production between 15,000 and 30,000 units. The cost data given is for 25,000 units, and it's average variable costs per unit. The question is asking for the per unit manufacturing overhead costs if 15,000 units are produced.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's included in manufacturing overhead. From the table provided, we have direct materials, direct labor, indirect materials, fixed manufacturing overhead, variable manufacturing overhead, fixed selling and administrative expenses, and variable sales commissions. Manufacturing overhead typically includes both fixed and variable costs that are indirect to the production process. So, in this case, manufacturing overhead would consist of indirect materials and both fixed and variable manufacturing overhead.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Direct materials: \\$10\n\n- Direct labor: \\$9\n\n- Indirect materials: \\$3\n\n- Fixed manufacturing overhead: \\$6\n\n- Variable manufacturing overhead: \\$2\n\n- Fixed selling and administrative expenses: \\$8\n\n- Variable sales commissions: \\$14\n\nSo, manufacturing overhead per unit at 25,000 units is indirect materials (\\$3) plus fixed manufacturing overhead (\\$6) plus variable manufacturing overhead (\\$2), which totals to \\$11 per unit.\n\nNow, the question is, if 15,000 units are produced, what are the per unit manufacturing overhead costs incurred?\n\nI need to consider how fixed and variable costs behave with changes in production volume.\n\nVariable costs change in direct proportion to changes in production volume, while fixed costs remain constant in total regardless of production volume, within the relevant range.\n\nSo, for variable manufacturing overhead, which is \\$2 per unit at 25,000 units, if production decreases to 15,000 units, the variable manufacturing overhead per unit should still be \\$2 per unit, assuming no changes in variable costs per unit.\n\nFixed manufacturing overhead, on the other hand, remains constant in total but is spread over fewer units at lower production levels. So, the per unit fixed manufacturing overhead will increase when production decreases.\n\nFirst, let's find out the total fixed manufacturing overhead.\n\nGiven that fixed manufacturing overhead is \\$6 per unit at 25,000 units, the total fixed manufacturing overhead is \\$6 per unit \u00d7 25,000 units = \\$150,000.\n\nNow, if production is reduced to 15,000 units, the same total fixed manufacturing overhead of \\$150,000 will be spread over 15,000 units.\n\nSo, the new fixed manufacturing overhead per unit would be \\$150,000 \u00f7 15,000 units = \\$10 per unit.\n\nNext, indirect materials are likely to be variable costs, as they are indirect materials used in production. Assuming they vary with production, the per unit cost should remain the same unless there are economies of scale or other factors that change the per unit cost.\n\nGiven that, indirect materials per unit remain \\$3, regardless of the production level within the relevant range.\n\nVariable manufacturing overhead per unit remains \\$2, as it's a variable cost.\n\nTherefore, the total manufacturing overhead per unit at 15,000 units would be:\n\nIndirect materials: \\$3\n\nFixed manufacturing overhead: \\$10\n\nVariable manufacturing overhead: \\$2\n\nTotal manufacturing overhead per unit: \\$3 + \\$10 + \\$2 = \\$15 per unit.\n\nWait a minute, but looking back at the options:\n\nA. \\$10\n\nB. \\$11\n\nC. \\$12\n\nD. \\$13\n\nNone of these match my calculation of \\$15. Maybe I missed something.\n\nLet me double-check my assumptions.\n\nFirst, I assumed that indirect materials are variable costs. Is that correct? Generally, yes, indirect materials are considered variable costs because they vary with the level of production.\n\nSimilarly, variable manufacturing overhead is directly related to production levels.\n\nFixed manufacturing overhead doesn't change with production levels, but its per unit cost does change based on the number of units produced.\n\nSo, my calculation for fixed manufacturing overhead per unit seems correct: total fixed overhead divided by the number of units.\n\nBut perhaps there's something else to consider.\n\nWait, maybe the average cost per unit provided is based on 25,000 units, which is within the relevant range, and 15,000 units is also within that range, but the costs may not scale linearly.\n\nHowever, the problem states that the relevant range is between 15,000 and 30,000 units, so within this range, cost behaviors should hold.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the indirect materials are not strictly variable, or there are other cost components I'm missing.\n\nLet me look back at the problem.\n\n"
