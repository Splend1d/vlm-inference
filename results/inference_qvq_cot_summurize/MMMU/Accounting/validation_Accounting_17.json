                "text": "So I've got this problem here, and I need to find the balance of an account. The options are A. \\$135,726, B. \\$112,500, C. \\$126,925, and D. \\$116,350. But I'm not sure which one is correct yet.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. It says \"Assume accounts have normal balances, what is the balance of the account?\" and there's some adjustments needed: Physical count of supplies inventory remaining at end of period, \\$2,150; Taxes payable at end of period, \\$3,850.\n\nLooking at the list provided:\n\n- Accounts payable \\(\\$ 10,075\\)\n\n- Accounts receivable \\(\\$ 15,500\\)\n\n- Cash \\(\\$ 64,575\\)\n\n- Common stock \\(\\$ 31,000\\)\n\n- Fees earned revenue \\(\\$ 82,000\\)\n\n- Operating expense \\(\\$ 38,000\\)\n\n- Supplies \\(\\$ 5,000\\)\n\nI think these are account balances before adjustments. So, to find the adjusted balance, I need to apply the adjustments provided.\n\nOne adjustment is a physical count of supplies inventory remaining at end of period, \\$2,150. The other is taxes payable at end of period, \\$3,850.\n\nFirst, let's consider the supplies. The original balance is \\$5,000, and the physical count is \\$2,150. Normally, if you have a physical count that differs from the book balance, you need to adjust the supplies account.\n\nSo, if the book balance is \\$5,000 and the actual count is \\$2,150, that means there's an overstatement of supplies by \\$2,850 (\\$5,000 - \\$2,150). Therefore, I need to adjust the supplies account downward by \\$2,850.\n\nNext, taxes payable is \\$3,850. If there was no previous taxes payable balance, this would be a new account balance. But I need to check if there was an existing balance or if this is just the amount accrued at the end of the period.\n\nSince no previous balance is provided, I'll assume that taxes payable was zero before, and now it's \\$3,850.\n\nNow, I need to figure out what account is being asked for its balance. The question is \"what is the balance of the account?\" but it doesn't specify which account. That's confusing. Maybe it's asking for the total of all accounts after adjustments, like the total assets or something similar.\n\nWait, perhaps it's asking for the balance of the retained earnings account, which is often calculated after adjustments.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let's list out all the accounts and their normal balances:\n\n- Assets:\n\n- Accounts receivable \\$15,500\n\n- Cash \\$64,575\n\n- Supplies \\$5,000 (before adjustment)\n\n- Total assets before adjustments: \\$15,500 + \\$64,575 + \\$5,000 = \\$85,075\n\n- Liabilities:\n\n- Accounts payable \\$10,075\n\n- Taxes payable \\$3,850 (adjusted)\n\n- Total liabilities: \\$10,075 + \\$3,850 = \\$13,925\n\n- Stockholders' equity:\n\n- Common stock \\$31,000\n\n- Retained earnings: need to calculate\n\n- Total equity: \\$31,000 + retained earnings\n\nAccording to the balance sheet equation:\n\nTotal assets = total liabilities + total equity\n\nSo, after adjustments, total assets should equal total liabilities plus total equity.\n\nBut I need to find the balance of a specific account, probably retained earnings.\n\nLet me calculate the adjusted supplies balance first.\n\nOriginal supplies balance: \\$5,000\n\nPhysical count: \\$2,150\n\nAdjustment needed: \\$5,000 - \\$2,150 = \\$2,850 decrease in supplies.\n\nSo, adjusted supplies balance: \\$2,150\n\nNow, total adjusted assets: \\$15,500 (accounts receivable) + \\$64,575 (cash) + \\$2,150 (supplies) = \\$82,225\n\nTotal liabilities: \\$10,075 (accounts payable) + \\$3,850 (taxes payable) = \\$13,925\n\nTotal equity: common stock \\$31,000 + retained earnings\n\nSo, according to the equation:\n\n"
