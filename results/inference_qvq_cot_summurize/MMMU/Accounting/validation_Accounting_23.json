                "text": "Let's see here. I've got this problem about comparing two put options, A and B, with the same time to maturity, strike price, and volatility, but different prices. The risk-free interest rate is 6%, and the stocks don't pay dividends. I need to figure out which put option is written on the stock with the lower price.\n\nFirst, I should recall how the price of a put option is determined. I think it's based on the Black-Scholes model, right? For puts, the price is influenced by the stock price, the strike price, the time to maturity, the volatility, and the risk-free interest rate.\n\nGiven that both options have the same time to maturity (T = 0.5 years), the same strike price (X = $50), and the same volatility (\u03c3 = 0.2), but different prices ($10 and $12), there must be something else different, which is probably the stock prices.\n\nBut wait, the problem says to assume the risk-free interest rate is 6%, which I need to consider as well.\n\nLet me think about the put option pricing formula. For a European put option, the Black-Scholes formula is:\n\nP = X * e^{-rT} * N(-d2) - S * N(-d1)\n\nWhere:\n\n- P is the put option price\n\n- X is the strike price\n\n- S is the current stock price\n\n- r is the risk-free interest rate\n\n- T is the time to maturity\n\n- \u03c3 is the volatility\n\n- N is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution\n\n- d1 and d2 are intermediate calculations:\n\nd1 = [ln(S/X) + (r + \u03c3\u00b2/2)*T] / (\u03c3*sqrt(T))\n\nd2 = d1 - \u03c3*sqrt(T)\n\nGiven that both options have the same T, X, \u03c3, and r, the only variable left is S, the stock price.\n\nSo, if I can find the stock prices for both options based on their put prices, I can compare which one has the lower stock price.\n\nLet's try to solve for S in the put option formula.\n\nGiven:\n\nP = X * e^{-rT} * N(-d2) - S * N(-d1)\n\nI need to find S in terms of P.\n\nThis seems a bit complicated because d1 and d2 depend on S. Maybe there's a better way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the relationship between the put price and the stock price.\n\nI know that as the stock price decreases, the put option becomes more valuable because the option gives the right to sell the stock at a higher price (the strike price).\n\nSo, if the put option price is higher, it implies that the underlying stock price is lower.\n\nGiven that option B has a higher put price ($12 vs. $10), it must be written on the stock with the lower price.\n\nWait, but is that always true? Let me double-check.\n\nIf the stock price decreases, all else being equal, the put option should increase in value because it's more likely that the stock will be below the strike price at expiration.\n\nSo, if option B has a higher put price, it suggests that its underlying stock price is lower than that of option A.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B.\n\nBut let's see if there's any other factor that could affect this.\n\nFor example, if there were dividends, that could affect the stock price's impact on the put option price, but the problem states that there are no dividends.\n\nAnother consideration: is the put option European or American? The problem doesn't specify, but since it's using the Black-Scholes model, I assume they're European puts.\n\nAlso, the risk-free interest rate is given as 6%, but since both options have the same r, T, X, and \u03c3, the only difference in their put prices should be due to the stock prices.\n\nSo, yeah, I think the conclusion is that option B is written on the stock with the lower price.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should try to calculate the stock prices for both options to confirm.\n\nLet's take option A with P = $10.\n\nI have:\n\nX = 50\n\nr = 0.06\n\nT = 0.5\n\n\u03c3 = 0.2\n\nP = 10\n\nI need to find S such that:\n\n10 = 50 * e^{-0.06*0.5} * N(-d2) - S * N(-d1)\n\nFirst, calculate e^{-0.06*0.5}:\n\ne^{-0.03} \u2248 0.9704\n\nNow, calculate d1 and d2.\n\nd1 = [ln(S/50) + (0.06 + 0.2\u00b2/2)*0.5] / (0.2"
