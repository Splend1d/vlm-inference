                "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, Baghdad Company has some financial data from their recent CVP (Cost-Volume-Profit) analysis, and they're considering increasing their sales price by 10% without losing any customers. I need to find out what their new break-even point will be in terms of units and dollars after this price increase.\n\nFirst, let's understand what's given in the current CVP analysis:\n\n- Units sold: 1,450\n\n- Sales price per unit: \\$90\n\n- Variable cost per unit: \\$40\n\n- Contribution margin per unit: \\$50\n\n- Fixed costs: \\$20,650\n\n- Break-even (in units): 413\n\n- Break-even (in dollars): \\$37,170\n\n- Sales: \\$130,500\n\n- Variable costs: \\$58,000\n\n- Contribution margin: \\$72,500\n\n- Net income: \\$51,850\n\nNow, they're planning to increase the sales price by 10%, and according to the market survey, this won't affect the number of units sold. So, the number of units sold should remain the same, which is 1,450 units.\n\nLet me first calculate the new sales price per unit after a 10% increase.\n\nCurrent sales price per unit: \\$90\n\nIncrease of 10\\% on \\$90:\n\nIncrease amount = \\$90 * 10\\% = \\$9\n\nNew sales price per unit = \\$90 + \\$9 = \\$99\n\nSo, the new sales price per unit is \\$99.\n\nNow, I need to find the new contribution margin per unit. The contribution margin per unit is sales price per unit minus variable cost per unit.\n\nCurrent contribution margin per unit: \\$50\n\nCurrent sales price per unit: \\$90\n\nCurrent variable cost per unit: \\$40\n\nNew sales price per unit: \\$99\n\nAssuming variable costs remain the same, which they do according to the problem, the new contribution margin per unit would be:\n\nNew contribution margin per unit = \\$99 - \\$40 = \\$59\n\nNow, the break-even point in units is calculated as fixed costs divided by contribution margin per unit.\n\nCurrent break-even in units: fixed costs / current contribution margin per unit\n\nWhich is 413 units = \\$20,650 / \\$50\n\nWait, let me verify that:\n\n\\$20,650 / \\$50 = 413 units. Yes, that's correct.\n\nNow, with the new contribution margin per unit of \\$59, the new break-even point in units would be:\n\nNew break-even in units = fixed costs / new contribution margin per unit = \\$20,650 / \\$59\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n\\$20,650 \u00f7 \\$59 \u2248 350 units\n\nSo, the new break-even point in units is approximately 350 units.\n\nNow, for the break-even point in dollars, I need to multiply the break-even units by the new sales price per unit.\n\nNew break-even in dollars = new break-even in units * new sales price per unit \u2248 350 * \\$99 = \\$34,650\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. 350 units and \\$34,647.65\n\nB. 355 units and \\$35,647.65\n\nC. 350 units and \\$35,647.65\n\nD. 355 units and \\$34,647.65\n\nMy calculations suggest that the correct answer should be approximately 350 units and \\$34,650, which aligns closest with option A. However, there's a slight discrepancy in the dollar amount when compared to the exact calculation.\n\nLet me double-check my calculations to ensure accuracy.\n\nFirst, confirm the new sales price:\n\n\\$90 + 10\\% of \\$90 = \\$90 + \\$9 = \\$99. That's correct.\n\nNew contribution margin per unit:\n\n\\$99 - \\$40 = \\$59. Correct.\n\nFixed costs remain \\$20,650. Correct.\n\nBreak-even in units:\n\n\\$20,650 / \\$59 = let's calculate it more precisely.\n\n\\$20,650 \u00f7 \\$59:\n\n59 * 350 = 59 * 300 = 17,700\n\n59 * 50 = 2,950\n\nTotal 17,700 + 2,950 = 20,650\n\nSo,"
