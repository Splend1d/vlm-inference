                "text": "So I've got this problem here, and I need to solve for the missing account balance of Dividends. The problem provides a list of accounts with their balances, but one of them is missing, which is Dividends. My task is to figure out what Dividends should be based on the other account balances provided.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what Dividends represent in the context of a company's financial statements. Dividends are distributions of a company's earnings to its shareholders. They are subtracted from the net income to determine the retained earnings.\n\nLooking at the list of accounts provided:\n\n- Accounts payable \\(\\quad \\$ 9,000\\)\n\n- Accounts receivable \\(\\quad \\$ 16,032\\)\n\n- Cash \\(\\quad \\$ 20,450\\)\n\n- Common stock \\(\\quad \\$ 24,000\\)\n\n- Dividends \\(\\quad\\) ?\n\n- Equipment \\(\\quad \\$ 29,000\\)\n\n- Prepaid insurance \\(\\quad \\$ 9,444\\)\n\n- Land \\(\\quad \\$ 34,000\\)\n\n- Notes payable \\(\\quad \\$ 48,000\\)\n\n- Retained earnings \\(\\quad \\$ 31,315\\)\n\n- Insurance expense \\(\\quad \\$ 12,689\\)\n\n- Service revenue \\(\\quad \\$ 82,500\\)\n\n- Supplies \\(\\quad \\$ 9,700\\)\n\n- Salaries expense \\(\\quad \\$ 51,500\\)\n\nI notice that there are both asset accounts, liability accounts, equity accounts, revenue accounts, and expense accounts here. To find the missing Dividends balance, I think I need to use the relationship between these accounts, particularly focusing on the equity section since Dividends and Retained Earnings are part of owner's equity.\n\nLet me recall the basic accounting equation:\n\nAssets = Liabilities + Owner's Equity\n\nAnd within Owner's Equity, the relationship is:\n\nRetained Earnings = Net Income - Dividends\n\nSo, if I can find the Net Income, and I have the Retained Earnings, I can solve for Dividends.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the Net Income.\n\nNet Income = Revenue - Expenses\n\nFrom the list, Service Revenue is \\$82,500.\n\nExpenses include Insurance Expense (\\$12,689), Supplies Expense (\\$9,700), and Salaries Expense (\\$51,500).\n\nWait, Supplies is listed as \\$9,700. Is Supplies an expense or an asset? Hmm, it depends on the context. Normally, Supplies is considered an asset until it's used, at which point it becomes an expense. But in this list, it's under the accounts with balances, so perhaps it's already been expensed. If not, I might need to consider that.\n\nAlso, Equipment is listed as \\$29,000, and there's no mention of Depreciation Expense or Accumulated Depreciation. The problem mentions that equipment was recently purchased, so there is neither depreciation expense nor accumulated depreciation. That simplifies things; I don't have to account for depreciation expenses.\n\nSo, assuming Supplies Expense is \\$9,700, then:\n\nTotal Expenses = Insurance Expense + Supplies Expense + Salaries Expense\n\n= \\$12,689 + \\$9,700 + \\$51,500\n\n= \\$73,889\n\nThen, Net Income = Service Revenue - Total Expenses\n\n= \\$82,500 - \\$73,889\n\n= \\$8,611\n\nNow, using the retained earnings equation:\n\nRetained Earnings = Net Income - Dividends\n\nI can rearrange this to solve for Dividends:\n\nDividends = Net Income - Retained Earnings\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nDividends = \\$8,611 - \\$31,315\n\nWait, that would give me a negative number: \\$8,611 - \\$31,315 = -\\$22,704\n\nThat doesn't make sense because Dividends can't be negative. Maybe I'm missing something here.\n\nLet me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, total expenses:\n\nInsurance Expense: \\$12,689\n\nSupplies Expense: \\$9,700\n\nSalaries Expense: \\$51,500\n\nTotal expenses: \\$12,689 + \\$9,700 = \\$22,389 + \\$51,500 = \\$73,889\n\nService Revenue: \\$82,500\n\nNet Income: \\$82,500 - \\$73,889 = \\$"
