                "text": "So I've got this problem here about owner's equity for different companies. There's a table with some values filled in and some question marks where I need to find the missing numbers. The companies are labeled as Co.1, Co.2, and Co.3, and each has its own set of beginning and ending balances, net income, net loss, investments, and distributions. The formula at the top is:\n\nBeginning Balance + Net Income - Net Loss + Investments - Distributions = Ending Balance\n\nMy task is to calculate the missing values, particularly for Co.2.\n\nLet me start by looking at Co.1 to make sure I understand the formula correctly.\n\nFor Co.1:\n\nBeginning Balance: \\$163,800\n\nNet Income: \\$16,500\n\nNet Loss: \\$0\n\nInvestments: ?\n\nDistributions: \\$1,750\n\nEnding Balance: \\$254,150\n\nPlugging into the formula:\n\n\\$163,800 + \\$16,500 - \\$0 + ? - \\$1,750 = \\$254,150\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\$163,800 + \\$16,500 = \\$180,300\n\n\\$180,300 - \\$0 + ? - \\$1,750 = \\$254,150\n\nSo, \\$180,300 + ? - \\$1,750 = \\$254,150\n\nLet me rearrange to solve for Investments:\n\n? = \\$254,150 - \\$180,300 + \\$1,750\n\nCalculating that:\n\n\\$254,150 - \\$180,300 = \\$73,850\n\n\\$73,850 + \\$1,750 = \\$75,600\n\nSo, Investments for Co.1 are \\$75,600.\n\nBut since the question is about Co.2, I should move on to that.\n\nFor Co.2:\n\nBeginning Balance: \\$63,180\n\nNet Income: \\$0\n\nNet Loss: \\$12,000\n\nInvestments: \\$0\n\nDistributions: \\$51,180\n\nEnding Balance: ?\n\nPlugging into the formula:\n\n\\$63,180 + \\$0 - \\$12,000 + \\$0 - \\$51,180 = ?\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\$63,180 - \\$12,000 = \\$51,180\n\n\\$51,180 - \\$51,180 = \\$0\n\nSo, the Ending Balance for Co.2 is \\$0.\n\nBut the question seems to suggest that there's a missing value to calculate for Co.2, and it's one of the options provided: A. \\$1,620, B. \\$12,000, C. \\$51,180, D. \\$0.\n\nGiven that the Ending Balance is \\$0, and all the other values are known, it seems like the missing value might be the Ending Balance itself. But the question says \"Calculate the missing values of company 2,\" and it's multiple choice with options including \\$0, which is already given in the table as Distributions.\n\nWait, maybe I misread. Let me check the image again.\n\nIn the image, for Co.2, the Ending Balance has a question mark, and Distributions is \\$51,180. So, calculating as above, Ending Balance should be \\$0.\n\nBut the question says \"Calculate the missing values of company 2,\" and provides options A. \\$1,620, B. \\$12,000, C. \\$51,180, D. \\$0.\n\nGiven that, and my calculation shows Ending Balance is \\$0, perhaps the missing value is \\$0, which is option D.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different missing value being referred to.\n\nLet me look at Co.3 as well, just to see if there's any confusion.\n\nFor Co.3:\n\nBeginning Balance: \\$0\n\nNet Income: \\$0\n\nNet Loss: ?\n\nInvestments: \\$150,000\n\nDistributions: \\$0\n\nEnding Balance: \\$101,400\n\nPlugging into the formula:\n\n\\$0 + \\$0 - ? + \\$150,000 - \\$0 = \\$101,400\n\nSimplifying:\n\n- ? + \\$150,000 = \\$101,400\n\nSo, ? = \\$150,000 - \\$101,4"
