                "text": "So I've got this problem here about Hicks Products, which sells patio furniture. They have some cost data for the year ending December 31, 2017, and I need to figure out what their total revenue is. The options are A. $3,100,000, B. $2,616,000, C. $2,474,000, and D. $484,000.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what total revenue means. Revenue is the total amount of money a company earns from selling its products or services. So, in this case, it's the total sales revenue from selling patio furniture.\n\nLooking at the list provided:\n\n- Sales revenue: $3,100,000\n\n- Straight-line depreciation on office equipment: $90,000\n\n- Advertising and marketing expense: $625,000\n\n- Administrative salaries: $136,000\n\n- Cost of goods sold: $1,700,000\n\n- Rent on corporate headquarters: $65,000\n\nIt seems like these are all expenses except for the sales revenue. So, maybe the total revenue is just the sales revenue, which is $3,100,000. But let's think carefully.\n\nSometimes, companies have other sources of revenue, like interest income or sales of assets, but in this case, it seems like the only revenue is from sales.\n\nWait a minute, there's a line called \"sales revenue\" and another line that might be considered revenue, but I think \"sales revenue\" is the primary revenue source for Hicks Products.\n\nSo, option A. $3,100,000 seems straightforward. But let's consider if there's any other revenue that might not be listed here.\n\nFor example, if they sold any equipment or something else, that might be considered revenue, but the list doesn't mention that.\n\nAlso, interest income or other non-operating revenues aren't mentioned, so I think it's safe to assume that sales revenue is the only revenue source.\n\nBut let's look at the expenses to make sure.\n\nDepreciation on office equipment, advertising and marketing expense, administrative salaries, cost of goods sold, and rent on corporate headquarters\u2014are all expenses.\n\nSo, none of these seem to be revenue items.\n\nTherefore, the total revenue should be the sales revenue, which is $3,100,000.\n\nWait, but maybe there's more to it. Maybe I need to calculate net income or something else, but the question specifically asks for total revenue.\n\nI think the answer is A. $3,100,000.\n\nJust to double-check, let's see if there's any possibility of another revenue source in the given data.\n\nLooking back:\n\n- Sales revenue: $3,100,000\n\n- Straight-line depreciation on office equipment: $90,000\n\n- Advertising and marketing expense: $625,000\n\n- Administrative salaries: $136,000\n\n- Cost of goods sold: $1,700,000\n\n- Rent on corporate headquarters: $65,000\n\nNo, none of these seem to be additional revenue sources.\n\nTherefore, the total revenue is $3,100,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\ 3,100,000} \\]"
