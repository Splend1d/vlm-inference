                "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have Sanchez & Vukmin, LLP, an accounting firm near Chicago. Last year, they served 500 clients, with total fixed costs of \\$265,000 and total variable costs of \\$180,000. The question is asking for the total cost per 800 clients.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what fixed and variable costs are. Fixed costs are expenses that don't change with the number of clients, like rent or salaries of permanent staff. Variable costs change based on the number of clients, like the cost of paper and ink for printing tax forms.\n\nSo, last year, for 500 clients, the total costs were \\$265,000 (fixed) plus \\$180,000 (variable), which adds up to \\$445,000 in total costs.\n\nNow, the question is asking for the total cost per 800 clients. I need to find out what the total costs would be if the firm serves 800 clients.\n\nSince fixed costs don't change with the number of clients, the fixed costs would still be \\$265,000.\n\nThe variable costs, however, do change with the number of clients. Last year, for 500 clients, the variable costs were \\$180,000. So, to find the variable cost per client, I can divide the total variable costs by the number of clients:\n\nVariable cost per client = total variable costs / number of clients = \\$180,000 / 500 = \\$360 per client.\n\nNow, if the firm serves 800 clients, the total variable costs would be:\n\nTotal variable costs = variable cost per client * number of clients = \\$360 * 800 = \\$288,000.\n\nAdding the fixed costs:\n\nTotal costs = fixed costs + variable costs = \\$265,000 + \\$288,000 = \\$553,000.\n\nWait a minute, looking at the options:\n\nA. \\$712,000\n\nB. \\$632,000\n\nC. \\$288,000\n\nD. \\$424,000\n\nNone of these match my calculation of \\$553,000. Maybe I did something wrong.\n\nLet me double-check. Fixed costs remain \\$265,000 no matter how many clients they have. Variable costs are \\$360 per client, so for 800 clients, it should be \\$288,000. Adding them up gives \\$553,000. But that's not one of the options. Hmm.\n\nPerhaps there's another way to look at it. Maybe I need to consider the cost per client.\n\nLet me see. The total cost per client last year was \\$445,000 / 500 = \\$890 per client.\n\nIf I calculate the total cost for 800 clients at \\$890 per client, that would be \\$890 * 800 = \\$712,000, which is option A.\n\nBut wait, that doesn't account for the fixed and variable costs separately. If I use this approach, I'm assuming that the cost per client remains constant, but in reality, the fixed cost is spread over more clients, which should actually decrease the cost per client.\n\nSo, this can't be right. Maybe I need to recalculate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the variable cost per client changes with the number of clients. Maybe there's a different relationship.\n\nWait, maybe I should use the concept of average fixed cost and average variable cost.\n\nLet me recall:\n\nTotal cost \\((T C)=\\) fixed cost \\((F C)+\\) variable cost \\((V C)\\)\n\nAverage fixed cost \\((A F C)=F C / Q\\)\n\nAverage variable cost \\((A V C)=V C / Q\\)\n\nAverage total cost \\((A T C)=T C / Q=A F C+A V C\\)\n\nWhere \\(Q\\) is the quantity of clients.\n\nLast year, for 500 clients:\n\n\\(F C=\\$ 265,000\\)\n\n\\(V C=\\$ 180,000\\)\n\n\\(T C=F C+V C=\\$ 445,000\\)\n\n\\(A T C=T C / Q=\\$ 445,000 / 500=\\$ 890\\) per client\n\nNow, for 800 clients:\n\n\\(F C\\) remains \\$265,000\n\n\\(V C\\) is \\$360 per client * 80"
