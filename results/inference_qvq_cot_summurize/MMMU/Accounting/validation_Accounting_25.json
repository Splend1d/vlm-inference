                "text": "Let's see here. I've got this problem about two portfolios, X and Y, and I need to figure out if they're in equilibrium, if there's an arbitrage opportunity, or if they're underpriced or fairly priced. The risk-free rate is 8%, and I know their expected returns and betas. Portfolio X has an expected return of 16% with a beta of 1.00, and portfolio Y has an expected return of 12% with a beta of 0.25. Both are well-diversified portfolios.\n\nFirst, I should probably recall the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) because it relates expected returns to betas. The CAPM formula is:\n\n\\[ E(r_i) = r_f + \\beta_i (E(r_m) - r_f) \\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\( E(r_i) \\) is the expected return of portfolio i.\n\n- \\( r_f \\) is the risk-free rate.\n\n- \\( \\beta_i \\) is the beta of portfolio i.\n\n- \\( E(r_m) \\) is the expected return of the market.\n\nI need to find out if these portfolios are priced correctly according to CAPM. If they are, then they should be in equilibrium, and there should be no arbitrage opportunities.\n\nLet me start by solving for the expected return of the market using portfolio X's data.\n\nFor portfolio X:\n\n\\[ 16\\% = 8\\% + 1.00 \\times (E(r_m) - 8\\%) \\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[ 16\\% - 8\\% = 1.00 \\times (E(r_m) - 8\\%) \\]\n\n\\[ 8\\% = E(r_m) - 8\\% \\]\n\n\\[ E(r_m) = 16\\% \\]\n\nSo, the expected return of the market is 16%.\n\nNow, let's check portfolio Y using the same market return.\n\nFor portfolio Y:\n\n\\[ 12\\% = 8\\% + 0.25 \\times (16\\% - 8\\%) \\]\n\n\\[ 12\\% = 8\\% + 0.25 \\times 8\\% \\]\n\n\\[ 12\\% = 8\\% + 2\\% \\]\n\n\\[ 12\\% = 10\\% \\]\n\nWait, that doesn't match. According to CAPM, portfolio Y should have an expected return of 10%, but it actually has 12%. So, there's a discrepancy here.\n\nSince the actual expected return is higher than what CAPM predicts, it suggests that portfolio Y is underpriced. That is, for the risk it's taking (beta of 0.25), it's offering a higher return than it should according to the model.\n\nNow, since both portfolios are well-diversified, any differences from the CAPM-predicted returns should present arbitrage opportunities. Specifically, if a portfolio is underpriced, meaning it offers a higher return than predicted, investors should buy more of it to take advantage of the higher return.\n\nSimilarly, if a portfolio is overpriced, offering a lower return than predicted, investors should sell it short.\n\nIn this case, portfolio Y is underpriced, offering 12% when it should offer 10%. So, investors should buy more of portfolio Y, which would drive up its price and bring its return down to equilibrium.\n\nBut the question is asking what conclusion I would reach in this situation regarding both portfolios.\n\nPortfolio X is priced according to CAPM, since its expected return matches the model's prediction.\n\nPortfolio Y is underpriced, offering a higher return than predicted.\n\nTherefore, there's an arbitrage opportunity because investors can buy portfolio Y at a price that will yield a higher return than what the market risk premium would suggest.\n\nSo, among the given options:\n\nA. Are in equilibrium.\n\n- Not true for both; portfolio Y is not in equilibrium.\n\nB. Offer an arbitrage opportunity.\n\n- Yes, because portfolio Y is mispriced.\n\nC. Are both underpriced.\n\n- No, only portfolio Y is underpriced; portfolio X is fairly priced.\n\nD. Are both fairly priced.\n\n- No, only portfolio X is fairly priced; portfolio Y is underpriced.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. Offer an arbitrage opportunity.\n\nBut wait, the question says \"in this situation you would conclude that portfolios X and Y...\". Since only Y is underpriced, does that mean both offer an arbitrage opportunity? Or just Y?\n\nActually, in arbitrage terms, if one portfolio is mispriced, it can create opportunities involving both portfolios. For example, you could buy the underpriced portfolio and sell short the overpriced one, but in this case, portfolio X is correctly priced.\n\nSo, perhaps it's more accurate to say"
