                "text": "Let's dive into this problem. So, we have an all-equity firm considering four projects: W, X, Y, and Z. Each project has a beta and an internal rate of return (IRR). The T-bill rate is 3.5%, and the expected return on the market is 11%. We need to figure out which projects would be incorrectly accepted or rejected if the firm uses its overall cost of capital as a hurdle rate.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the overall cost of capital is and how it relates to each project's cost of capital. Since it's an all-equity firm, the cost of capital is essentially the cost of equity. The capital asset pricing model (CAPM) gives us a way to estimate the cost of equity for each project based on its beta.\n\nThe CAPM formula is:\n\n\\[ r = r_f + \\beta (r_m - r_f) \\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\( r \\) is the expected return or cost of capital for the project.\n\n- \\( r_f \\) is the risk-free rate (T-bill rate).\n\n- \\( \\beta \\) is the project's beta.\n\n- \\( r_m \\) is the expected return on the market.\n\nSo, for each project, I can calculate its specific cost of capital using its beta.\n\nGiven that the firm is considering using its overall cost of capital as a hurdle rate, I need to find out what that overall cost of capital is. However, we don't have direct information about the firm's overall beta or cost of capital. But since it's an all-equity firm, and we have betas for each project, perhaps the overall beta is the average of these project betas.\n\nLet's calculate the overall beta first.\n\nThe betas are:\n\n- W: 0.80\n\n- X: 0.95\n\n- Y: 1.15\n\n- Z: 1.45\n\nAssuming equal weights for each project, the overall beta would be the average:\n\n\\[ \\beta_{\\text{overall}} = \\frac{0.80 + 0.95 + 1.15 + 1.45}{4} = \\frac{4.35}{4} = 1.0875 \\]\n\nNow, using the CAPM formula to find the overall cost of capital:\n\n\\[ r_{\\text{overall}} = 0.035 + 1.0875 (0.11 - 0.035) = 0.035 + 1.0875 (0.075) = 0.035 + 0.0815625 = 0.1165625 \\] or 11.65625%\n\nSo, the firm's overall cost of capital is approximately 11.656%.\n\nNow, for each project, I'll calculate its specific cost of capital using its beta.\n\nProject W:\n\n\\[ r_W = 0.035 + 0.80 (0.11 - 0.035) = 0.035 + 0.80 (0.075) = 0.035 + 0.06 = 0.095 \\] or 9.5%\n\nProject X:\n\n\\[ r_X = 0.035 + 0.95 (0.11 - 0.035) = 0.035 + 0.95 (0.075) = 0.035 + 0.07125 = 0.10625 \\] or 10.625%\n\nProject Y:\n\n\\[ r_Y = 0.035 + 1.15 (0.11 - 0.035) = 0.035 + 1.15 (0.075) = 0.035 + 0.08625 = 0.12125 \\] or 12.125%\n\nProject Z:\n\n\\[ r_Z = 0.035 + 1.45 (0.11 - 0.035) = 0.035 + 1.45 (0.075) = 0.035 + 0.10875 = 0.14375 \\] or 14.375%\n\nNow, we have each project's specific cost of capital:\n\n- W: 9.5%\n\n- X: 10.625%\n\n- Y: 12.125%\n\n- Z: 14.375%\n\nThe firm"
