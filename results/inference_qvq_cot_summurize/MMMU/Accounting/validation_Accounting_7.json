                "text": "Let's dive into this problem. So, I'm a consultant for a manufacturing corporation that's thinking about taking on a project. The project has some after-tax cash flows, and there's a beta involved, which relates to the risk of the project. I need to find out the highest possible beta estimate for this project before its Net Present Value (NPV) turns negative.\n\nFirst, let's understand what NPV is. NPV is a method used in capital budgeting to assess the profitability of a project or investment. It's the difference between the present value of cash inflows and the present value of cash outflows, discounted at a certain rate.\n\nIn this case, the cash flows are given in millions of dollars. At year 0, there's an outflow of $40 million, and then from years 1 to 10, there's an inflow of $15 million each year.\n\nThe project's beta is given as 1.8, but the question is asking for the highest possible beta before NPV becomes negative. That means I need to find the beta at which NPV just turns zero.\n\nTo calculate NPV, I need a discount rate. The discount rate is determined using the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), which is:\n\nRequired Return (R) = Risk-Free Rate (Rf) + Beta * (Market Return (Rm) - Risk-Free Rate)\n\nGiven that Rf is 8% and E(rM) is 16%, I can plug these values into the formula.\n\nSo, R = 8% + 1.8 * (16% - 8%) = 8% + 1.8 * 8% = 8% + 14.4% = 22.4%\n\nNow, with a discount rate of 22.4%, I can calculate the NPV.\n\nBut wait, the question is asking for the highest possible beta before NPV becomes negative. That means I need to find the beta where NPV is zero.\n\nLet me first calculate the NPV with the given beta of 1.8.\n\nFirst, calculate the present value of the cash flows.\n\nYear 0: -40 million (outflow)\n\nYears 1-10: 15 million each year (inflow)\n\nSo, NPV = -40 + Sigma [15 / (1 + R)^t] from t=1 to 10\n\nWith R = 22.4%, or 0.224 in decimal form.\n\nLet me calculate the present value of the inflows.\n\nPV = 15 * [1 - (1 + 0.224)^-10] / 0.224\n\nFirst, calculate (1 + 0.224)^10\n\nThat's approximately 1.224^10\n\nCalculating that:\n\n1.224^10 = 8.806 (approximately)\n\nSo, PV = 15 * [1 - 1/8.806] / 0.224\n\n= 15 * [1 - 0.1135] / 0.224\n\n= 15 * 0.8865 / 0.224\n\n= 15 * 3.9576\n\n= 59.364 million\n\nNow, NPV = -40 + 59.364 = 19.364 million\n\nSo, with beta = 1.8, NPV is positive at 19.364 million.\n\nNow, I need to find the beta where NPV is zero.\n\nLet's set up the equation for NPV = 0.\n\nSo, -40 + 15 * [1 - (1 + R)^-10] / R = 0\n\nWhere R = 8% + Beta * (16% - 8%) = 8% + Beta * 8%\n\nLet me denote R = 8% + 8% * Beta\n\nSo, R = 0.08 + 0.08 * Beta\n\nNow, plug this R into the NPV equation.\n\n-40 + 15 * [1 - (1 + (0.08 + 0.08*Beta))^-10] / (0.08 + 0.08*Beta) = 0\n\nThis looks a bit complicated. Maybe I can solve for Beta algebraically, but it might be tricky because R is both in the exponent and outside.\n\nAlternatively, I can use trial and error to find the beta that makes NPV zero.\n\nLet me try plugging in different beta values and see when NPV crosses zero.\n\nStart with Beta = 1.8, which gave NPV = 19."
