                "text": "Let's see here. I've got this problem about job costing for a new company that's started production. There are two jobs: Job 1 and Job 2. Job 1 is completed, and Job 2 is still in production. I have some data from their job cost sheets, and I need to find the balance in finished goods inventory. The options are A. \\$10,208, B. \\$10,308, C. \\$10,408, and D. \\$10,508.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what finished goods inventory represents. Finished goods inventory includes the cost of completed products that haven't been sold yet. So, in a job-order costing system, like the one being used here, each job has its own cost sheet that tracks direct materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead.\n\nLooking at Job 1, it's completed, so its total cost should be included in finished goods inventory. Job 2 is still in production, so its costs should still be in work in process inventory, not finished goods.\n\nWait a minute, but the problem says Job 1 is completed, so its costs should be in finished goods inventory. But I need to make sure about Job 2. Since it's still in production, its costs shouldn't be included in finished goods inventory yet.\n\nSo, to find the balance in finished goods inventory, I should look at the total cost of Job 1.\n\nLooking at the image, for Job 1, the total cost is given as \\$10,308. That seems straightforward. But let's double-check to make sure I'm not missing anything.\n\nDirect materials for Job 1 are \\$375, direct labor is \\$5,313 for 231 hours, manufacturing overhead is \\$4,620, and the total cost is \\$10,308. That adds up: \\$375 + \\$5,313 + \\$4,620 = \\$10,308.\n\nFor Job 2, direct materials are \\$405, direct labor is \\$1,955 for 85 hours, manufacturing overhead is \\$1,700, and total cost is... wait, the total cost isn't provided for Job 2, but since it's still in production, its costs shouldn't be included in finished goods inventory anyway.\n\nSo, based on this, the finished goods inventory should only include Job 1's total cost, which is \\$10,308. That would make the answer B. \\$10,308.\n\nBut let's think again. Is there any possibility that Job 2's costs could be included in finished goods inventory? No, because it's still in production. It should be in work in process inventory.\n\nAlso, are there any other jobs? The problem says these are their first and only jobs so far, so only Job 1 is completed, and Job 2 is still in progress.\n\nTherefore, the balance in finished goods inventory should be the total cost of Job 1, which is \\$10,308.\n\nWait, but option A is \\$10,208, which is \\$100 less than \\$10,308. Maybe there's a mistake somewhere.\n\nLet me check the calculations again. Direct materials for Job 1 are \\$375, direct labor is \\$5,313, and manufacturing overhead is \\$4,620. Adding them up: \\$375 + \\$5,313 = \\$5,688; \\$5,688 + \\$4,620 = \\$10,308. Yes, that's correct.\n\nPerhaps the confusion comes from the fact that manufacturing overhead might not be entirely allocated yet, but the problem states that the total cost is \\$10,308 for Job 1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a beginning balance in finished goods inventory, but the problem doesn't mention that. It says the company just started production, so I assume there's no beginning inventory.\n\nTherefore, the balance in finished goods inventory should be \\$10,308, which corresponds to option B.\n\nI think the correct answer is B. \\$10,308.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
