                "text": "Let's dive into this problem. So, we're dealing with the Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT), which is a model that describes the relationship between expected returns and factors that influence those returns. Unlike the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), which uses only one factor (the market return), APT considers multiple factors that can affect security returns.\n\nFrom the problem, we have a table that shows two portfolios, A and B, each with their betas on two factors, F1 and F2, and their corresponding expected returns. We also have the risk-free rate, which is the yield on T-bills, at 6%. Our goal is to find the expected rate of return on a stock that is fairly priced according to this model.\n\nFirst, I need to recall how APT works. The APT model suggests that the expected return on a security can be expressed as:\n\n\\[ E(R_i) = r_f + \\beta_{i1}RP_1 + \\beta_{i2}RP_2 + \\dots + \\beta_{in}RP_n \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( E(R_i) \\) is the expected return on security i.\n\n- \\( r_f \\) is the risk-free rate.\n\n- \\( \\beta_{in} \\) is the sensitivity of the security to the nth factor.\n\n- \\( RP_n \\) is the risk premium for the nth factor.\n\nIn this case, we have two factors, so the equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[ E(R_i) = r_f + \\beta_{i1}RP_1 + \\beta_{i2}RP_2 \\]\n\nWe are given two portfolios, A and B, with their betas on F1 and F2, and their expected returns. We can set up two equations based on this data:\n\nFor Portfolio A:\n\n\\[ 31\\% = 6\\% + 1.5 \\times RP_1 + 2.0 \\times RP_2 \\]\n\nFor Portfolio B:\n\n\\[ 27\\% = 6\\% + 2.2 \\times RP_1 + (-0.2) \\times RP_2 \\]\n\nSo, we have a system of two equations with two unknowns, RP1 and RP2. We need to solve for these risk premiums.\n\nLet's write down the equations again for clarity:\n\n1. \\( 31\\% = 6\\% + 1.5RP_1 + 2.0RP_2 \\)\n\n2. \\( 27\\% = 6\\% + 2.2RP_1 - 0.2RP_2 \\ )\n\nFirst, I'll simplify both equations by subtracting the risk-free rate of 6% from both sides:\n\n1. \\( 25\\% = 1.5RP_1 + 2.0RP_2 \\)\n\n2. \\( 21\\% = 2.2RP_1 - 0.2RP_2 \\ )\n\nNow, I have:\n\n1. \\( 1.5RP_1 + 2.0RP_2 = 25\\% \\)\n\n2. \\( 2.2RP_1 - 0.2RP_2 = 21\\% \\)\n\nI can solve this system using either substitution or elimination. I think elimination might be easier here.\n\nLet's multiply the second equation by 10 to eliminate the decimal:\n\n\\[ 22RP_1 - 2RP_2 = 210\\% \\]\n\nNow, let's adjust the first equation to make the coefficients of RP2 the same in magnitude but opposite in sign. The first equation is:\n\n\\[ 1.5RP_1 + 2.0RP_2 = 25\\% \\]\n\nIf I multiply the first equation by 1 to make the coefficients of RP2 the same, but it's already different. Maybe I should multiply the first equation by 1 to keep it as is, and the second by 1 as well, but that doesn't help directly. Let's try to make the coefficients of RP2 equal in magnitude.\n\nFirst equation: \\( 1.5RP_1 + 2.0RP_2 = 25\\% \\)\n\nSecond equation: \\( 22RP_1 - 2RP_2 = 210\\% \\)\n\nWait, the first equation has RP2 with a coefficient of 2, and the second has RP2 with a coefficient of -2. So, if I add these two equations together, RP2 should cancel out.\n\nAdding:\n\n\\[ 1.5RP_1 + 22RP_1 + 2.0RP_2 - 2RP_2 = 25\\% + 210\\% \\]\n\n\\[ (1.5 + 22)RP_1 + (2 - 2)RP_2 = 23"
