                "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have three different jet ski models: Junior, Adult, and Expert. Each has its own sales price and variable cost per unit, and they're being rented out in a specific product mix of 5:4:1. There are total fixed costs of \\$114,750, and we need to calculate the sales price per composite unit. Okay, let's first understand what a composite unit is.\n\nA composite unit is a combined unit that represents the product mix proportions. So, in this case, the product mix is 5 Junior : 4 Adult : 1 Expert. That means for every 10 units rented, 5 are Junior, 4 are Adult, and 1 is Expert.\n\nFirst, I need to find out the total sales revenue and the total variable costs for this composite unit.\n\nLet's assume we sell 10 composite units, consisting of 5 Junior, 4 Adult, and 1 Expert.\n\nNow, from the table:\n\n- Junior: Sales Price = \\$50, Variable Cost = \\$15\n\n- Adult: Sales Price = \\$75, Variable Cost = \\$25\n\n- Expert: Sales Price = \\$110, Variable Cost = \\$60\n\nSo, for 5 Junior units:\n\nTotal sales revenue from Junior = 5 * \\$50 = \\$250\n\nTotal variable costs for Junior = 5 * \\$15 = \\$75\n\nFor 4 Adult units:\n\nTotal sales revenue from Adult = 4 * \\$75 = \\$300\n\nTotal variable costs for Adult = 4 * \\$25 = \\$100\n\nFor 1 Expert unit:\n\nTotal sales revenue from Expert = 1 * \\$110 = \\$110\n\nTotal variable costs for Expert = 1 * \\$60 = \\$60\n\nNow, the total sales revenue for 10 composite units is:\n\n\\$250 (Junior) + \\$300 (Adult) + \\$110 (Expert) = \\$660\n\nTotal variable costs for 10 composite units is:\n\n\\$75 (Junior) + \\$100 (Adult) + \\$60 (Expert) = \\$235\n\nThe contribution margin for 10 composite units is:\n\nTotal sales revenue - Total variable costs = \\$660 - \\$235 = \\$425\n\nNow, the total fixed costs are \\$114,750. The contribution margin covers the fixed costs and contributes to profit.\n\nBut we need to find the sales price per composite unit. Wait, but the question is asking for the sales price per composite unit, not the contribution margin per composite unit.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to think differently. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the composite unit's sales price is what we're supposed to find, given the product mix and fixed costs.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider the break-even point in terms of composite units.\n\nThe break-even point in units is total fixed costs divided by the contribution margin per unit.\n\nBut here, we need to find the sales price per composite unit, which is essentially the total sales revenue for one composite unit.\n\nFrom earlier calculations, for 10 composite units, the total sales revenue is \\$660. So, per composite unit, it would be \\$660 divided by 10, which is \\$66 per composite unit.\n\nBut looking back at the options, \\$660 is one of the options, but it seems too straightforward. Maybe I missed something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the composite unit is considered as one set of 10 units (5 Junior, 4 Adult, 1 Expert), and the sales price per composite unit is the total sales revenue for that set, which is \\$660.\n\nBut that seems too high compared to the individual prices. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nTotal sales revenue for 10 composite units:\n\n- 5 Junior: 5 * \\$50 = \\$250\n\n- 4 Adult: 4 * \\$75 = \\$300\n\n- 1 Expert: 1 * \\$110 = \\$110\n\nTotal: \\$250 + \\$300 + \\$110 = \\$660\n\nSo, per composite unit (10 units), the sales price is \\$660.\n\nBut the question is phrased as \"the sales price per composite unit,\" which might be per set of 10 units, making it \\$660, or perhaps per unit in the composite.\n\nWait, a composite unit is a bundle of products in their respective ratios, so for every 10 units, the sales price is \\$660.\n\nTherefore, the sales price per composite unit is \\$660.\n\nBut looking at the options, \\$660 is option A. So, maybe that's the"
