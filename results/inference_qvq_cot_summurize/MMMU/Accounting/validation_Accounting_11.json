                "text": "So I have this problem about options trading, specifically about a strangle strategy. I'm supposed to calculate the maximum possible loss per share for this strategy at expiration. Let me try to understand what's going on here.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what a strangle strategy is. From what I remember, a strangle involves buying a put option and a call option with different strike prices but the same expiration date. The idea is that the stock price might move a lot in either direction, and you want to profit from that volatility without knowing which way it's going to go.\n\nIn this case, the client owns no shares of TRT Materials, which is currently trading at $58 per share. The options available are a call option with a strike price of $60 and a put option with a strike price of $55, both expiring in 90 days. The call option costs $5, and the put option costs $4.\n\nSo, to set up the strangle, the client would buy one call option with a strike of $60 and one put option with a strike of $55. The total cost for this position would be the sum of the premiums paid for both options, which is $5 + $4 = $9 per share.\n\nNow, I need to figure out what happens at expiration. There are different scenarios depending on the stock price at that time.\n\nLet's consider the possible scenarios:\n\n1. **Stock price is above $60 at expiration:**\n\n   - The call option with a strike of $60 will be in the money. The client can exercise the call and buy the stock at $60, then sell it at the current market price, which is above $60.\n\n   - The put option with a strike of $55 will be out of the money and worthless.\n\n   - The profit from the call option is (stock price at expiration - $60) - $5 (premium paid for the call).\n\n   - The put option contributes nothing, so the overall profit is (stock price at expiration - $60 - $5) + ($4 lost on the put option).\n\n   - Wait, no. Since the put is not exercised, the $4 premium is a loss.\n\n   - So, total profit is (S - 60 - 5) - 4, where S is the stock price at expiration.\n\n   - Simplifying, profit = S - 69.\n\n2. **Stock price is between $55 and $60 at expiration:**\n\n   - The call option is out of the money and worthless.\n\n   - The put option is in the money if the stock price is below $55, but in this case, it's between $55 and $60.\n\n   - Wait, no. If the stock price is between $55 and $60, the put option is in the money.\n\n   - The profit from the put option is ($55 - stock price at expiration) - $4 (premium paid).\n\n   - The call option contributes nothing.\n\n   - So, total profit is ($55 - S - 4).\n\n   - Simplifying, profit = $51 - S.\n\n3. **Stock price is below $55 at expiration:**\n\n   - The call option is out of the money and worthless.\n\n   - The put option is in the money. The client can exercise the put and sell the stock at $55, which is above the market price.\n\n   - Profit from the put option is ($55 - stock price at expiration) - $4.\n\n   - The call option contributes nothing.\n\n   - So, total profit is $51 - S.\n\nWait, in the third scenario, if the stock price is below $55, the profit is $51 - S, which is similar to the second scenario. So, essentially, for stock prices between $55 and $60, and below $55, the profit is $51 - S.\n\nNow, I need to find the maximum possible loss per share. Loss occurs when the total profit is negative.\n\nLooking at the first scenario, if the stock price is above $60, the profit is S - 69. This would be positive if S > $69, and negative if S < $69.\n\nIn the second and third scenarios, the profit is $51 - S, which would be positive if S < $51, and negative if S > $51.\n\nSo, combining these, the profit is:\n\n- S - 69 if S > $60\n\n- $51 - S if $55 \u2264 S \u2264 $60\n\n- $51 - S if S < $55\n\nNow, to find the maximum loss, I need to find the lowest possible profit, which would be the most negative value.\n\nLooking at the first scenario, if S > $60, the profit is S -"
