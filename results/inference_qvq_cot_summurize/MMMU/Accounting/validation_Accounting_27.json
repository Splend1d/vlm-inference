                "text": "So I have this balance sheet for Harrison, Inc., and I need to calculate the debt-equity ratio based on book values. Let me make sure I understand what a debt-equity ratio is. It's a measure of financial leverage, showing how much debt a company has relative to its equity. So, basically, it's the total debt divided by the total shareholders' equity.\n\nLooking at the balance sheet, under the \"Total Debt and Equity\" column, I see that the total debt is $220,000,000, and the total shareholders' equity is $280,000,000. So, the debt-equity ratio should be total debt divided by total shareholders' equity. That would be $220,000,000 divided by $280,000,000.\n\nLet me do that calculation: 220 divided by 280. Well, 280 times 0.8 is 224, which is a bit higher than 220. So, maybe around 0.785 or something. Let me be more precise. If I divide 220 by 280 using decimal places, I get 0.785714286, and so on. So, rounded to three decimal places, it's approximately 0.786.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 0.820\n\nB. 0.693\n\nC. 0.786\n\nSo, option C seems to match my calculation.\n\nBut just to double-check, maybe I should verify if there's any other way to interpret the debt-equity ratio. Is there any chance that total debt might include something else, or that equity is calculated differently?\n\nLooking back at the balance sheet, under total debt, it's $220,000,000, and under total shareholders' equity, it's $280,000,000. So, it seems straightforward.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to see the components of equity and debt. Equity consists of common stock, capital surplus, and accumulated retained earnings, which add up to $280,000,000. Debt is just total debt, $220,000,000. No other liabilities are mentioned, so I think it's safe to assume that the debt-equity ratio is indeed 0.786.\n\nI don't think I'm missing anything here, but perhaps I should consider if the question is trying to trick me by including net fixed assets or something else. But no, the total assets are $500,000,000, which equals total debt and equity, so that checks out.\n\nAlright, I'm confident that the correct answer is C. 0.786.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
