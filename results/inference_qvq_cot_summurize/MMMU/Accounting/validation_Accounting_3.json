                "text": "Let's see here. I have this problem about mutually exclusive projects for Maxwell Software, Inc. There are two projects, A and B, and I need to decide which one to choose based on the NPV rule. The discount rate is 15%, and there's a table with cash flows for each project over three years, with year 0 being the initial investment.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the NPV for each project. The NPV formula is the sum of the present value of future cash flows minus the initial investment. Since the cash flows are at different times, I need to discount each cash flow back to the present using the discount rate of 15%.\n\nLet me write down the formula again to make sure I understand:\n\nNPV = \u2211 (cash flow_t / (1 + r)^t) - initial investment\n\nWhere r is the discount rate, and t is the time period.\n\nFor Project A:\n\nYear 0: -\\$20,000 (initial investment)\n\nYear 1: \\$13,200\n\nYear 2: \\$8,300\n\nYear 3: \\$3,200\n\nFor Project B:\n\nYear 0: -\\$24,000 (initial investment)\n\nYear 1: \\$14,100\n\nYear 2: \\$9,800\n\nYear 3: \\$7,600\n\nOkay, so I need to calculate the NPV for each project.\n\nLet's start with Project A.\n\nNPV_A = [13,200 / (1 + 0.15)^1] + [8,300 / (1 + 0.15)^2] + [3,200 / (1 + 0.15)^3] - 20,000\n\nI should calculate each term step by step.\n\nFirst, calculate (1 + 0.15)^1 = 1.15\n\nSo, 13,200 / 1.15 = let's see, 13,200 divided by 1.15.\n\n13,200 divided by 1 is 13,200, and divided by 0.15 is... well, maybe it's easier to use a calculator for this, but since I'm doing this manually, I'll try to calculate it.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as 13,200 * (1 / 1.15). Let's see, 1 / 1.15 is approximately 0.8696 (I think, but not sure). Anyway, I'll compute 13,200 / 1.15.\n\nLet me try this: 1.15 * 11,478.26... no, that doesn't sound right. Maybe I should look for a better way.\n\nActually, I recall that 1.15 * 11,478.26 = 13,200, so 13,200 / 1.15 = 11,478.26\n\nWait, let me check that. 1.15 * 11,478.26 = 1.00 * 11,478.26 = 11,478.26\n\n0.15 * 11,478.26 = let's see, 0.1 * 11,478.26 = 1,147.826\n\n0.05 * 11,478.26 = half of 0.1 is 573.913\n\nSo total 1,147.826 + 573.913 = 1,721.739\n\nAdd to 11,478.26, total is 13,200. Yes, correct.\n\nOkay, so the first term is 11,478.26\n\nNext, [8,300 / (1 + 0.15)^2]\n\nFirst, (1 + 0.15)^2 = 1.15 * 1.15 = 1.3225\n\nSo, 8,300 / 1.3225 = let's calculate that.\n\n8,300 / 1.3225\n\nFirst, 8,300 / 1 = 8,300\n\n8,300 / 0.3225 = let's see, 8,300 / 0.3225\n\n"
