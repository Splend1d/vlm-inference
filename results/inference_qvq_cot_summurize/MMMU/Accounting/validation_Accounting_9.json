                "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to find the December 31 cash balance for Forest Company based on the transactions provided. The starting point is the cash balance on December 1, which is \\$4,250. Then, there are various transactions during the month that affect this balance. I need to consider which transactions increase the cash balance and which decrease it.\n\nFirst, let's list out all the given transactions and see how each one impacts the cash balance:\n\n1. Cash sales: \\$3,250\n\n2. Payments for inventory: \\$1,760\n\n3. Investments by owners: \\$3,000\n\n4. Supplies used: \\$175\n\n5. Cash withdrawals: \\$260\n\n6. Inventory received: \\$2,500\n\n7. Wages paid: \\$2,390\n\nNow, I need to determine whether each of these transactions is an inflow or outflow of cash.\n\n- Cash sales: This is money coming into the company from sales made in cash. So, this is a cash inflow.\n\n- Payments for inventory: This is money paid to suppliers for inventory. So, this is a cash outflow.\n\n- Investments by owners: This is money coming into the company from the owners. So, this is a cash inflow.\n\n- Supplies used: This is the cost of supplies used during the period. If it's stated as \"supplies used,\" it might be an expense, but I need to confirm if this was a cash payment or just recognition of an expense. Assuming it's a cash payment for supplies, it would be a cash outflow.\n\n- Cash withdrawals: This is money taken out of the company by owners or employees. So, this is a cash outflow.\n\n- Inventory received: This is inventory received by the company. If it's received on credit, it doesn't affect cash immediately, but if it's paid in cash, it's a cash outflow. I need to clarify this.\n\n- Wages paid: This is money paid to employees for their work. So, this is a cash outflow.\n\nWait a minute, the transaction says \"inventory received\" for \\$2,500. I need to see if this is a purchase on credit or if it's a cash payment. The term \"received\" could imply that it's inventory bought on credit, which wouldn't affect the cash balance immediately. However, if it's a cash purchase, it would decrease the cash balance.\n\nSimilarly, \"payments for inventory\" is likely cash paid for inventory purchases, which is a cash outflow.\n\n\"Supplies used\" is probably an expense recognized for supplies consumed during the period. If it's a cash payment, it's a cash outflow; if it's on credit, it's not a cash transaction.\n\n\"Investments by owners\" is cash coming into the company from the owners, which is a cash inflow.\n\n\"Cash sales\" is clearly a cash inflow.\n\n\"Wages paid\" is a cash outflow.\n\n\"Cash withdrawals\" is also a cash outflow.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\nCash inflows:\n\n- Cash sales: \\$3,250\n\n- Investments by owners: \\$3,000\n\nTotal cash inflows: \\$3,250 + \\$3,000 = \\$6,250\n\nCash outflows:\n\n- Payments for inventory: \\$1,760\n\n- Supplies used (assuming cash payment): \\$175\n\n- Cash withdrawals: \\$260\n\n- Wages paid: \\$2,390\n\nTotal cash outflows: \\$1,760 + \\$175 + \\$260 + \\$2,390 = \\$4,585\n\nNow, the starting cash balance is \\$4,250.\n\nNet cash flow for the month: cash inflows - cash outflows = \\$6,250 - \\$4,585 = \\$1,665\n\nEnding cash balance: starting balance + net cash flow = \\$4,250 + \\$1,665 = \\$5,915\n\nWait, but this is not among the options provided. The options are:\n\nA. \\$6,000\n\nB. \\$6,150\n\nC. \\$6,090\n\nD. \\$6,060\n\nHmm, maybe I missed something. Let's double-check.\n\nFirst, confirm if \"inventory received\" is a cash payment or not. If it's inventory bought on credit, it doesn't affect cash immediately. If it's a cash purchase, it does decrease cash by \\$2,500.\n\nLooking back at the transactions:\n\n- Cash sales: \\$3,250 (inflow)\n\n- Payments for inventory: \\$1,760 (outflow)\n\n- Investments by owners: \\$3,000 ("
