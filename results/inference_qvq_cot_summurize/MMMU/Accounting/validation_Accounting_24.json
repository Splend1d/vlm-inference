                "text": "Let's dive into this problem. We have two stocks, A and B, and their respective index model regression estimates, R-squares, residual standard deviations, and standard deviations of excess returns. The risk-free rate is 6%, and the market's average return is 14%. We need to calculate the information ratio for each stock.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the information ratio is. I know that the information ratio is a measure of a portfolio's excess returns per unit of deviation from a benchmark. It's calculated as the active return divided by the tracking error. In this context, since we're dealing with excess returns, I think the active return would be the difference between the stock's excess return and the market's excess return.\n\nBut let's make sure I understand what's being asked. The problem mentions \"performance is measured using an index model regression on excess returns.\" So, likely, the index model is being used to decompose the stock's excess returns into a systematic component and a residual component.\n\nGiven the regression equations:\n\nFor Stock A: 1% + 1.2(r_M - r_f)\n\nFor Stock B: 2% + 0.8(r_M - r_f)\n\nWhere r_M is the market return and r_f is the risk-free rate.\n\nThe excess return for each stock can be expressed as:\n\nr_A - r_f = 1% + 1.2(r_M - r_f) + e_A\n\nr_B - r_f = 2% + 0.8(r_M - r_f) + e_B\n\nWhere e_A and e_B are the residuals with standard deviations \u03c3(e_A) = 10.3% and \u03c3(e_B) = 19.1%, respectively.\n\nThe standard deviation of excess returns is also provided: 21.6% for A and 24.9% for B.\n\nNow, the information ratio is typically calculated as:\n\nIR = (Portfolio Return - Benchmark Return) / Tracking Error\n\nBut in this case, since we're dealing with excess returns, perhaps the benchmark is the market excess return.\n\nWait, but the problem doesn't specify a benchmark. Maybe the benchmark is the market portfolio.\n\nAlternatively, in the context of the index model, the systematic component is the market factor, so perhaps the information ratio is related to how much excess return is generated per unit of residual risk.\n\nGiven that, maybe the information ratio is related to the alpha of the stock divided by the residual standard deviation.\n\nRecall that in the index model, the expected excess return can be decomposed into a systematic part and an idiosyncratic part.\n\nThe systematic part is the beta times the market risk premium, and the idiosyncratic part is the residual.\n\nIf the stock is outperforming or underperforming the market, that's captured by the alpha.\n\nSo, alpha is the intercept of the regression, which is the expected excess return when the market excess return is zero.\n\nWait, in the regression equations provided:\n\nr_A - r_f = 1% + 1.2(r_M - r_f) + e_A\n\nr_B - r_f = 2% + 0.8(r_M - r_f) + e_B\n\nThe intercepts are 1% for A and 2% for B.\n\nBut in the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), the expected excess return is:\n\nE(r_i - r_f) = beta_i * (r_M - r_f)\n\nWhere beta_i is the stock's beta.\n\nSo, for Stock A:\n\nE(r_A - r_f) = 1.2 * (r_M - r_f)\n\nBut in the regression, the intercept is 1%, which suggests that the actual excess return is 1% plus the systematic component plus the residual.\n\nIn CAPM, the expected excess return is only the beta times the market risk premium; any deviation from that is considered alpha.\n\nSo, alpha is the intercept of the regression.\n\nTherefore, alpha_A = 1%\n\nalpha_B = 2%\n\nNow, the information ratio is alpha divided by the tracking error.\n\nBut what is the tracking error in this context?\n\nIn the index model, the tracking error could be the residual standard deviation, \u03c3(e).\n\nSo, IR_A = alpha_A / \u03c3(e_A) = 1% / 10.3% \u2248 0.0971\n\nIR_B = alpha_B / \u03c3(e_B) = 2% / 19.1% \u2248 0.1047\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. (1) 0.0971 (2)0.01047\n\nB. (1) 0.1134 (2)0.01722\n\nC. (1) 0.1149 (2)0.01322\n\nMy calculations give IR_A \u2248 0.0971"
