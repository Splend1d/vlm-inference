                "text": "So I've got this question about downy mildew in grapevines. It's about the typical downy growth that appears on the bottom surface of the leaves when the plant is infected. But the picture shows the top surface of the leaf, and it has some yellowish spots. The question is asking what circumstances lead to that downy growth on the bottom, given that this is the top surface.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what downy mildew is. It's a fungal disease that affects grapevines, right? It causes these yellow or brown spots on the leaves, and on the underside, there's this downy growth. So, in the picture, the top surface has some discolored areas, which are probably the symptoms of the disease.\n\nNow, the options are:\n\nA. Low temperature; low light\n\nB. When free water has splashed up onto the underside of the leaf\n\nC. High temperature, high light\n\nD. High relative humidity\n\nE. I don't know and I don't want to guess\n\nI need to recall the conditions that favor the development of downy mildew.\n\nFrom what I remember, downy mildew thrives in moist environments. It needs free water for its spores to germinate and spread. So, option B mentions free water splashing up onto the underside of the leaf. That sounds plausible because the spores are usually spread through water droplets, like rain or irrigation water.\n\nAlso, high relative humidity is known to favor fungal growth, including downy mildew. So, option D might be relevant too.\n\nOption A suggests low temperature and low light. I think downy mildew is more common in warmer temperatures, not colder ones. So, maybe not A.\n\nOption C says high temperature and high light. While downy mildew can occur in warm temperatures, I don't think extremely high temperatures are ideal for fungal growth. Most fungi prefer moderate temperatures.\n\nWait, but I need to think carefully. Downy mildew is common in vineyards during wet periods, especially in spring and early summer when temperatures are mild to warm.\n\nSo, perhaps a combination of moderate temperatures and high humidity is ideal for downy mildew development.\n\nBut the question is specifically about the appearance of the downy growth on the bottom surface of the leaf, given that the top surface shows symptoms like the yellowish spots in the picture.\n\nI think the key factor is the presence of free water on the leaf surface. Downy mildew spores need water to germinate and infect the plant. So, when water splashes up onto the underside of the leaf, it provides the necessary environment for the spores to germinate and infect the leaf.\n\nTherefore, option B seems the most direct cause for the downy growth on the bottom surface.\n\nBut, high relative humidity (option D) can also contribute because it can lead to condensation on the leaf surfaces, providing the moisture needed for spore germination.\n\nHowever, the question is asking specifically about the circumstances that lead to the downy growth on the bottom surface, given that the top surface shows symptoms.\n\nMaybe the downy growth is more prominent on the bottom surface because that's where water splashes deposit the spores, and the bottom surface provides a suitable environment for them to grow.\n\nI should also consider that downy mildew affects both surfaces of the leaves, but the symptoms might differ. On the top surface, you get these yellowish spots, and on the bottom, the downy growth.\n\nSo, the presence of free water on the bottom surface, possibly from rain splash or irrigation, would facilitate the infection process.\n\nGiven that, option B seems the most accurate answer.\n\nBut let me think if there's any relationship between the top and bottom surfaces in terms of symptom expression.\n\nPerhaps the infection starts on the bottom surface and then manifests on the top surface as yellowish spots.\n\nSo, if free water splashes up onto the bottom surface, it allows the spores to germinate and infect the leaf tissue, and then the symptoms appear on the top surface as a result of that infection.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B: when free water has splashed up onto the underside of the leaf.\n\nI don't think it's A, C, or D directly causing the downy growth on the bottom surface. While high humidity might contribute to the overall environment, it's the presence of free water that's crucial for spore germination and infection.\n\nSo, I'll go with option B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
