                "text": "So I've got this image of a young ash tree with some corky outgrowths on its trunk. It's located by the roadside in Littondale, Yorkshire. I need to figure out what could be causing these outgrowths. The options are fungal disease, bacterial disease, genetic abnormality, insect feeding, or I could choose \"don't know or not sure\" if I'm uncertain.\n\nFirst, I should look closely at the tree. The trunk has several dark, raised areas that look like they're made of cork. These outgrowths are scattered along the trunk and seem to be more concentrated in certain spots. The tree itself has green leaves, and there are other trees and vegetation in the background, suggesting it's in a natural setting near a road.\n\nI need to consider each option one by one.\n\nStarting with fungal disease: Ash trees can be affected by several fungal diseases, the most well-known probably being ash dieback, caused by the fungus Hymenoscyphus fraxineus. However, ash dieback typically affects the crown of the tree, causing leaf loss and dieback of branches, rather than producing corky outgrowths on the trunk. So, maybe fungal disease isn't the direct cause here, or perhaps it's a different type of fungal infection that affects the trunk in this way.\n\nNext, bacterial disease: Bacteria can also cause diseases in trees, but I'm not as familiar with specific bacterial infections in ash trees. Some bacteria can cause galls or swellings on plants, but I'm not sure about corky outgrowths specifically. Maybe it's possible, but I need to do some research to confirm that.\n\nThen, genetic abnormality: This could be a possibility if the tree has a mutation that leads to abnormal growth patterns, such as corky outgrowths. However, genetic abnormalities are usually unique to individual trees and may not be common in a particular area. Since this tree is by the roadside, it might be exposed to environmental factors that could induce such abnormalities, but it's hard to say without more information.\n\nInsect feeding: Insects can certainly cause damage to trees, and some insects lay eggs or feed in ways that stimulate the tree to produce galls or other growths. For example, gall wasps can cause abnormal growths on oak trees. But again, I'm not sure if similar phenomena occur in ash trees, especially resulting in corky outgrowths.\n\nLastly, there's the option to choose \"don't know or not sure,\" which is always a possibility when facing unfamiliar situations. However, I'd like to make an educated guess based on the information available.\n\nLet me think differently. Perhaps these outgrowths are a response to some kind of stressor, like pollution from the roadside. Trees near roads can be affected by vehicle emissions, which might cause various types of stress responses, including abnormal growths.\n\nAlternatively, it could be a natural occurrence. Some tree species naturally develop bark that is rough or has outgrowths as part of their normal development. But since this is a young ash tree, and ash trees are generally known for their smooth bark when young, these outgrowths might indicate something unusual.\n\nWait a minute, maybe it's a sign of mechanical damage. Trees can develop calluses or bark ridges in response to injuries, such as those caused by lawnmowers or other equipment hitting the trunk. But in this case, the tree is by the roadside, so it's possible that it's been damaged by vehicles or road maintenance equipment.\n\nHowever, if it's a consistent pattern of outgrowths rather than random injuries, there might be another explanation.\n\nLet me consider the possibility of a disease again. Maybe it's not ash dieback but another fungal or bacterial disease that affects the bark and causes these outgrowths. I should look up common diseases of ash trees and see if any match this description.\n\nAfter a quick search, I find that ash trees can be affected by a disease called \"ash canker,\" which is caused by the fungus Chalara fraxinea. This disease can cause dark, sunken lesions on the bark, but I'm not sure if it leads to corky outgrowths.\n\nAnother possibility is \"hypoxylon canker,\" which is caused by a fungus and can affect various tree species, including ash. It typically causes dark, raised areas on the bark, which sound similar to the outgrowths in the image.\n\nHmm, that seems plausible. Hypoxylon canker is known to produce dark, corky areas on the bark, which match the description of the outgrowths seen in the image.\n\nBut let's consider bacterial diseases as well. Bacterial blights can affect ash trees, such as Pseudomonas syringae pv. fraxini, which can cause leaf spots and shoot blights, but I don't think they directly cause corky outgrowths on the trunk.\n\nInsect feeding seems unlikely to cause such outgrowths directly, as insects typically cause holes or galleries in the bark, not the formation of corky tissue.\n\nGenetic abnormalities could be a possibility, but they are generally rare and not something that would be commonly observed in a young tree by the roadside.\n\nGiven this information, it seems that a fungal disease, particularly hypoxylon canker, could be the most likely cause of the corky outgrowths observed on the ash tree.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should check if there are any other signs or symptoms that might support this diagnosis. For example, hypoxylon canker often starts at wounds or points of injury on the tree, which aligns with the idea that the tree might have been damaged by roadside activities.\n\nAdditionally, the disease can lead to decline and death of branches or even the entire tree over time. However, from the image, the tree appears relatively healthy with green leaves, so it might be in the early stages of the disease.\n\nAnother consideration is that multiple outgrowths are present along the trunk, which suggests that the disease has affected several areas, possibly due to repeated infections or a systemic issue.\n\nComparing this to the other options:\n\n- Bacterial disease: While possible, I couldn't find a specific bacterial disease of ash trees that causes corky outgrowths.\n\n- Genetic abnormality: Unlikely to be widespread or observed in a young tree in a roadside setting.\n\n- Insect feeding: Doesn't typically cause corky outgrowths; more likely to cause holes or galleries.\n\nTherefore, based on the visual evidence and the information I've gathered, I would lean towards a fungal disease, particularly hypoxylon canker, as the most probable cause of the corky outgrowths on the young ash tree.\n\nSo, to answer the question: What could be the reason for the corky outgrowths on a young ash tree by the roadside in Littondale, Yorkshire?\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. Fungal disease\n\nB. Bacterial disease\n\nC. Don't know or not sure\n\nD. Genetic abnormality\n\nE. Insect feeding\n\nMy choice is A. Fungal disease.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
