                    "text": "To determine the range in which the molecular weight of substance A4 falls, we need to analyze the given information step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Element Y**: Since A1 decomposes into A2 (with 31.96% fluorine) and fluorine, and A1 oxidizes xenon, it suggests that element Y is a strong oxidizing agent. Xenon is typically oxidized by strong oxidizers like fluorine or oxygen. Given that A1 decomposes into A2 and fluorine, it implies that Y is likely an element that forms stable fluorides.\n\n2. **Fluorination of Element Y**: A3 is obtained by fluorination of element Y with fluorine. This indicates that Y reacts with fluorine to form A3.\n\n3. **Formation of A5**: Adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot colorless concentrated solution of A4 yields A5. This suggests a reaction between Y and A4 to form A5.\n\n4. **Decomposition of A5 in Water**: A5 decomposes in water to form two substances. This indicates that A5 is unstable in aqueous conditions.\n\nGiven these clues, let's consider the possible elements for Y:\n- Elements that form stable fluorides and are strong oxidizers include chlorine (Cl), bromine (Br), iodine (I), and sulfur (S).\n\nSince A1 decomposes into A2 and fluorine, and A1 oxidizes xenon, Y is likely a halogen. Let's assume Y is chlorine (Cl) for simplicity, as it fits the criteria well.\n\nNow, let's look at the graph provided:\n- The graph shows the relationship between the molar mass of the compound and the mass of carbon in the compound.\n- We need to find the range for A4, which is related to the molar mass of the compound.\n\nAssuming Y is Cl (molar mass = 35.45 g/mol):\n- If A4 contains Cl, its molar mass would be influenced by the presence of Cl.\n\nFrom the graph, we can see the following points:\n- Point A: Molar mass \u2248 70 g/mol\n- Point D: Molar mass \u2248 150 g/mol\n- Point E: Molar mass \u2248 180 g/mol\n\nGiven the options:\nA. 160-180\nB. 110-130\nC. 220-240\nD. 140-160\n\nThe range that fits best based on the graph and our assumption about Y being Cl is:\n**D. 140-160**\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nD. 140-160"
