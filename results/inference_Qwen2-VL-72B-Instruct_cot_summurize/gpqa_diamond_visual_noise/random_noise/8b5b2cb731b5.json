After ozonolysis and reduction, this hydrogen atom would still be in a deshielded environment due to its proximity to the newly formed functional groups.\n\nThe coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom can be determined by considering the number of neighboring protons it interacts with. Typically, a hydrogen atom next to a carbonyl group will show a triplet if there are two equivalent neighboring protons.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. triplet"
