In this reaction, the diene (5-fluorocyclopenta-1,3-diene) reacts with the dienophile (maleic anhydride) to form a cyclohexene derivative.\n\nThe stereochemistry of the product depends on the orientation of the substituents during the reaction. The major product will be the one that forms with the least amount of steric hindrance and the most stable transition state.\n\nGiven the options:\n\nA. (3aR,4R,7S,7aS,8r)-8-fluoro-3a,4,7,7a-tetrahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\nB. (3aR,4S,7R,7aS,8s)-8-fluoro-3a,4,7,7a-tetrahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\nC.

(3aR,4R,7S,7aS,8s)-8-fluoro-3a,4,7,7a-tetrahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n\nThe major product will have the fluorine substituent in the position that minimizes steric hindrance and maximizes stability. Typically, the fluorine will end up in the less hindered position.\n\nBased on typical Diels-Alder reactions and the preference for the less hindered position, the major product is likely to be:\n\nC.
