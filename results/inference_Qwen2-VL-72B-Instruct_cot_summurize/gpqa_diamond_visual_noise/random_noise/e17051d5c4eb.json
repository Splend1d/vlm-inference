Substituents can be classified as either ortho-para directors or meta directors based on their electronic effects.\n\nHere are the substituents and their directing effects:\n1. \\(\\text{C}_6\\text{H}_5-\\text{CH}_3\\) (Toluene): Ortho-para director\n2. \\(\\text{C}_6\\text{H}_5-\\text{COOC}_2\\text{H}_5\\) (Ethyl benzoate): Meta director\n3. \\(\\text{C}_6\\text{H}_5-\\text{Cl}\\) (Chlorobenzene): Ortho-para director\n4. \\(\\text{C}_6\\text{H}_5-\\text{NO}_2\\) (Nitrobenzene): Meta director\n5. \\(\\text{C}_6\\text{H}_5-\\text{C}_2\\text{H}_5\\) (Ethylbenzene): Ortho-para director\n6. \\(\\text{C}_6\\text{H}_5-\\text{COOH}\\) (Benzoic acid): Meta director\n\nOrtho-para directors favor the formation of ortho and para isomers, while meta directors favor the formation of meta isomers. The yield of the para-isomer will be higher for ortho-para directors compared to meta directors.\n\nBased on this information, the order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer should be:\n\nMeta directors (lower yield of para-isomer) < Ortho-para directors (higher yield of para-isomer)\n\nSo, the correct order is:\n4 (Nitrobenzene) < 6 (Benzoic acid) < 2 (Ethyl benzoate) < 1 (Toluene) < 5 (Ethylbenzene) < 3 (Chlorobenzene)\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. 4<6<2<1<5<3"
