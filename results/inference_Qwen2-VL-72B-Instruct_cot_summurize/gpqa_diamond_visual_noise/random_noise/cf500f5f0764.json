The equilibrium temperature \\( T \\) is given by:\n\n\\[ T = \\left( \\frac{L}{16\\pi\\sigma r^2} \\right)^{1/4} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( L \\) is the luminosity of the star,\n- \\( \\sigma \\) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant,\n- \\( r \\) is the distance of the planet from the star.\n\nSince the planets are in orbital resonance and have the same albedo, we can assume that the luminosity \\( L \\) and the albedo are constant for all planets. Therefore, the equilibrium temperature depends only on the distance \\( r \\).\n\nThe orbital period \\( P \\) of a planet is related to its distance \\( r \\) from the star by Kepler's third law:\n\n\\[ P^2 \\propto r^3 \\]\n\nGiven the orbital periods in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5, we can denote the distances of the planets from the star as \\( r_1, r_2, r_3, r_4, \\) and \\( r_5 \\) respectively. Since the periods are proportional to the cube root of the distances, we have:\n\n\\[ r_1 : r_2 : r_3 : r_4 : r_5 = 1 : 2^{2/3} : 2.5^{2/3} : 3.5^{2/3} : 5^{2/3} \\]\n\nWe need to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2. Using the relationship \\( T \\propto r^{-1/2} \\):\n\n\\[ \\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \\left( \\frac{r_2}{r_4} \\right)^{1/2} \\]\n\nSubstituting the distances:\n\n\\[ \\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \\left( \\frac{2^{2/3}}{3.5^{2/3}} \\right)^{1/2} \\]\n\nSimplifying the expression:\n\n\\[ \\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \\left( \\frac{2^{2/3}}{3.5^{2/3}} \\right)^{1/2} = \\left( \\frac{2^{1/3}}{3.5^{1/3}} \\right) \\]\n\nCalculating the numerical values:\n\n\\[ \\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \\left( \\frac{\\sqrt[3]{2}}{\\sqrt[3]{3.5}} \\right) \\approx \\left( \\frac{1.26}{1.51} \\right) \\approx 0.83 \\]\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is approximately 0.83.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nB. ~0.83"
