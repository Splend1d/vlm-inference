However, it does not fit the pattern of two distinct methyl groups and the carbonyl carbon.\n\nGiven the spectral data, none of the options perfectly match all the details provided. However, the closest match considering the presence of two distinct methyl groups and the aromatic pattern is:\n\n**D. 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane**\n\nThis option has the necessary aromatic ring and methyl groups, although it does not account for the carbonyl carbon. The other options do not fit the spectral data as closely.\n\nTherefore, the most likely identification for Compound X is:\n\n**D. 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane**"
