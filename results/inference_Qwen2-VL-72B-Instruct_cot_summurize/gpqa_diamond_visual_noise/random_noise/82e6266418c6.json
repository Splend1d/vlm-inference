It ensures that the laws of physics are the same for all non-accelerating observers.\n\n2. **Poincare Symmetry**: This includes both Lorentz symmetry and translational symmetry. It is a more general symmetry that encompasses all the symmetries of spacetime.\n\n3. **CP Symmetry**: This symmetry involves the simultaneous reversal of charge (C) and parity (P). While it is a fundamental symmetry in many contexts, it is known to be violated in certain processes in the Standard Model.\n\n4. **CPT Symmetry**: This symmetry involves the simultaneous reversal of charge (C), parity (P), and time (T). It is a fundamental symmetry that is always respected in quantum field theory, including the SMEFT.\n\nGiven these considerations, the correct answer must include Lorentz Symmetry, Poincare symmetry, and CPT symmetry, but not necessarily CP symmetry since it can be violated.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. 1,2,4"
