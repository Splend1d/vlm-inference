While this might be true, it doesn't directly address the specifics of the catalyst and activator combinations needed.\n\nB. **Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive.**\n   - This statement implies that noble metals (such as platinum or palladium) can be used as catalysts, but their high cost makes them impractical for industrial applications. This could be relevant if noble metals were indeed effective but economically unfeasible.\n\nC. **Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step.**\n   - This statement indicates that aluminum-based activators are ineffective for the additional reaction step required to introduce regular branches into the polymer backbone. If true, this would rule out certain types of activators.\n\nD. **One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators.**\n   - This statement specifies that a group VIa transition metal catalyst (e.g., molybdenum or tungsten) can be used along with specific activators to achieve the desired branched polymer structure. This provides a clear and specific solution to the problem at hand.\n\nGiven the context and the need for a specific catalyst-activator combination to introduce regular branches in the polymer backbone, the most accurate and relevant statement is:\n\n**D. One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators.**\n\nThis statement directly addresses the requirement for a dual catalyst system and specifies the type of catalyst that can be used effectively."
