This addition can occur in two different ways, leading to two different products:\n\n1. Addition at the terminal carbon (C-3):\n```\n      O\n     / \\\n    C   C\n   / \\ / \\\n  H  H C   C\n       / \\ / \\\n      H  H Br\n```\n\nThis would give (4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene.\n\n2. Addition at the internal carbon (C-2):\n```\n      O\n     / \\\n    C   C\n   / \\ / \\\n  H  H C   C\n       / \\ / \\\n      H  Br C\n           / \\\n          H  H\n```\n\nThis would give (3-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC.
