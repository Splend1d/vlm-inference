It should be noted that with ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed, while with HIRES, stars brighter than 16 V mag can be observed. For the sake of simplicity, let's disregard the pointing limits of the telescopes (such as maximum and minimum elevations) as well as the altitudes of the telescopes.\n\nLinks:\nParanal Observatory: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paranal_Observatory\nW.

The total absorption in the V band is \\(3.1 \\times 0.4 = 1.24\\) mag. Therefore, the apparent V magnitude = 15.5 + 1.24 = 16.74 mag (brighter than 17 mag but not brighter than 16 mag)\n- **Star5**: Absolute V magnitude = 16.5 mag (brighter than 17 mag but not brighter than 16 mag)\n\nBased on the above analysis, only **Star1** and **Star3** have apparent V magnitudes that meet the criteria for both instruments.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB.
