Each chiral center can exist in two enantiomeric forms (R and S configurations), leading to an exponential increase in the number of possible stereoisomers as the number of chiral centers increases.\n\nLet's analyze the given compound:\n\n1. **Identify Chiral Centers:**\n   - The compound has three chiral centers:\n     - Carbon 6 (attached to Cl)\n     - Carbon 9 (attached to Et)\n     - Carbon 2 (attached to Me)\n\n2. **Calculate Stereoisomers:**\n   - Each chiral center can exist in two configurations (R or S).\n   - With three chiral centers, the total number of stereoisomers is \\(2^n\\), where \\(n\\) is the number of chiral centers.\n   - Therefore, the total number of stereoisomers is \\(2^3 = 8\\).\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nA. 8"
