It is not symmetric in this way.\n\nB. **Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**: This molecule has a complex structure with multiple rings. However, it does not exhibit C3h symmetry because it lacks the required threefold rotation axis and horizontal mirror plane.\n\nC. **Quinuclidine**: Quinuclidine is a bicyclic amine with a chair-like conformation. It does not have C3h symmetry because it lacks the required elements.\n\nD. **Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone**: This molecule has a symmetrical structure with a central benzene ring and three furan rings attached in a symmetrical manner. It has a threefold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane, making it the correct choice for C3h symmetry.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone"
