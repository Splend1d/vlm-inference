                    "text": "To determine by what factor the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1, we need to use Kepler's Third Law, which states that the square of the orbital period (T) of a planet is directly proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a) of its orbit. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:\n\n\\[ T^2 \\propto a^3 \\]\n\nGiven that the planets have circular orbits, the semi-major axis is equivalent to the radius of the orbit. The equilibrium temperature (Teq) of a planet is related to its distance from the star (a) and its albedo (A) by the following equation:\n\n\\[ Teq = \\left( \\frac{L}{16\\pi\\sigma a^2} \\right)^{1/4} \\]\n\nwhere L is the luminosity of the star and \u03c3 is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\nSince the albedo (A) is the same for all three planets, we can focus on the relationship between the equilibrium temperatures and the distances (or radii) of their orbits. The equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the distance from the star:\n\n\\[ Teq \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a}} \\]\n\nGiven the ratios of the equilibrium temperatures:\n- Between Planet1 and Planet2: \\( \\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} \\approx 1.4 \\)\n- Between Planet2 and Planet3: \\( \\frac{T_{eq2}}{T_{eq3}} \\approx 2.3 \\)\n\nWe can find the ratio of the distances (radii) of their orbits:\n- For Planet1 and Planet2: \\( \\frac{a_1}{a_2} \\approx \\left(\\frac{T_{eq2}}{T_{eq1}}\\right)^2 \\approx \\left(\\frac{1}{1.4}\\right)^2 \\approx 0.5 \\)\n- For Planet2 and Planet3: \\( \\frac{a_2}{a_3} \\approx \\left(\\frac{T_{eq3}}{T_{eq2}}\\right)^2 \\approx \\left(\\frac{1}{2.3}\\right)^2 \\approx 0.2 \\)\n\nNow, we need to find the ratio of the orbital periods. Using Kepler's Third Law:\n\\[ \\frac{T_1^2}{T_3^2} = \\left(\\frac{a_1}{a_3}\\right)^3 \\]\n\nFirst, we find the ratio of the distances from Planet1 to Planet3:\n\\[ \\frac{a_1}{a_3} = \\frac{a_1}{a_2} \\cdot \\frac{a_2}{a_3} \\approx 0.5 \\cdot 0.2 = 0.1 \\]\n\nThen, we calculate the ratio of the orbital periods:\n\\[ \\frac{T_1^2}{T_3^2} = (0.1)^3 = 0.001 \\]\n\nTaking the square root to find the ratio of the orbital periods:\n\\[ \\frac{T_1}{T_3} = \\sqrt{0.001} \\approx 0.0316 \\]\n\nTherefore, the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1 by a factor of:\n\\[ \\frac{T_3}{T_1} = \\frac{1}{0.0316} \\approx 31.6 \\]\n\nThe closest option to 31.6 is:\n\nC. ~ 33.4"
