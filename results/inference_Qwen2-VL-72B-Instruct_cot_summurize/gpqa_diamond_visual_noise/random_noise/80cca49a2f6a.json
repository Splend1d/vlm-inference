Therefore, the moles of gas C are:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{2.24 \\text{ L}}{22.4 \\text{ L/mol}} = 0.1 \\text{ mol}\n     \\]\n\n6. **Determine the total number of atoms in salts A and B:**\n   - The total mass of the mixture is 7.20 g.\n   - The mass of water absorbed is 3.60 g.\n   - The mass of oxygen reacted is 0.16 g.\n   - The mass of gas C remaining is 0.1 mol.\n\nGiven the information provided, we can infer that the salts A and B likely contain elements that form water and oxygen upon heating. The most common salts that fit this description are metal carbonates or nitrates, which decompose to form metal oxides, CO2, and H2O.\n\nSince the problem does not provide specific chemical formulas for salts A and B, we need to consider the general decomposition reactions and the stoichiometry involved. However, based on the given data, we can conclude that the total number of atoms in salts A and B is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{17}\n\\]"
