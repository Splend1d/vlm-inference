                    "text": "To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when the given solutions are mixed, we need to consider the reactions between the acids (HCl and H2SO4) and the base (Ba(OH)2). The neutralization reaction for each pair is as follows:\n\n1. HCl + Ba(OH)2 \u2192 BaCl2 + H2O\n2. H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 \u2192 BaSO4 + 2H2O\n\nFirst, let's determine the moles of each reactant:\n\n- Moles of HCl = 0.2 M \u00d7 0.5 L = 0.1 mol\n- Moles of H2SO4 = 0.3 M \u00d7 0.3 L = 0.09 mol\n- Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.5 M \u00d7 0.2 L = 0.1 mol\n\nNow, let's balance the equations and find out which reactants will be limiting:\n\nFor HCl + Ba(OH)2:\n- 2HCl + Ba(OH)2 \u2192 BaCl2 + 2H2O\n- Moles of HCl required = 2 \u00d7 0.1 mol = 0.2 mol\n- Moles of Ba(OH)2 required = 0.1 mol\n\nSince we only have 0.1 mol of Ba(OH)2, it is the limiting reagent for this reaction.\n\nFor H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2:\n- H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 \u2192 BaSO4 + 2H2O\n- Moles of H2SO4 required = 0.1 mol\n- Moles of Ba(OH)2 required = 0.1 mol\n\nAgain, Ba(OH)2 is the limiting reagent for this reaction as well.\n\nSince Ba(OH)2 is the limiting reagent in both reactions, we will use its moles to calculate the enthalpy of neutralization.\n\nThe enthalpy of neutralization for strong acid and strong base is typically around -55.8 kJ/mol of water produced.\n\nFor HCl + Ba(OH)2:\n- Moles of H2O produced = 2 \u00d7 0.1 mol = 0.2 mol\n- Enthalpy change = -55.8 kJ/mol \u00d7 0.2 mol = -11.16 kJ\n\nFor H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2:\n- Moles of H2O produced = 2 \u00d7 0.1 mol = 0.2 mol\n- Enthalpy change = -55.8 kJ/mol \u00d7 0.2 mol = -11.16 kJ\n\nTotal enthalpy change = -11.16 kJ + (-11.16 kJ) = -22.32 kJ\n\nConverting kJ to kcal (since 1 kcal = 4.184 kJ):\n- Total enthalpy change = -22.32 kJ \u00d7 (1 kcal / 4.184 kJ) \u2248 -5.33 kcal\n\nNone of the provided options match exactly with -5.33 kcal. However, the closest option is:\n\nA. -3.80 kcal\n\nSo, the correct answer is A. -3.80 kcal."
