KOH, Heat**: Heating with aqueous KOH will cause the diazonium ion to undergo a reaction known as the Sandmeyer reaction or related reactions, often resulting in the formation of an aromatic aldehyde or ketone.\n\nGiven the NMR data:\n- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H): This likely corresponds to an aldehyde proton.\n- 6.98 ppm (d, 2H), 6.51 ppm (d, 2H), 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H): These signals suggest aromatic protons.\n- 3.66 ppm (d, 2H): This signal could correspond to methylene protons adjacent to the aldehyde group.\n\nConsidering the molecular formula C8H9NO and the NMR data, the compound likely contains an aromatic ring with an aldehyde group and another aromatic ring attached through a chain.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n\nA. **3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal**: This has three aromatic rings and does not match the molecular formula C8H9NO.\nB. **4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal**: This has one aromatic ring and an aldehyde group, but it does not fit the NMR data well.\nC. **2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**: This has two aromatic rings and an aldehyde group, fitting the molecular formula and NMR data.\nD. **2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal**: This also has two aromatic rings and an aldehyde group, but it lacks the hydroxyl groups indicated by the NMR data.\n\nBased on the analysis, the final product that fits the molecular formula and NMR data is:\n\n**C. 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal**"
