The FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption peak at 3000 wavenumbers. Two other strong absorption peaks are observed at 1700 and 1650 wavenumbers. Several peaks were observed in the 1H NMR spectrum including peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens. The mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z = 45.

This is often seen with the loss of a water molecule (H\u2082O, m/z = 18) or a ketone group (C=O, m/z = 28). Given the presence of both a hydroxyl group and a carbonyl group, the loss of H\u2082O is plausible.\n\nGiven these observations, we can infer that the compound likely contains a hydroxyl group (-OH), a carbonyl group (C=O), and a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C). This suggests the presence of a carboxylic acid or an ester functionality.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\n\n- **C6H12O**: This formula does not account for the presence of a carbonyl group and a carbon-carbon double bond.\n- **C6H10O**: This formula also does not account for the presence of both a carbonyl group and a carbon-carbon double bond.\n- **C6H10O2**: This formula accounts for the presence of two oxygen atoms, which could be consistent with a carboxylic acid or an ester.\n- **C6H12O2**: This formula has too many hydrogen atoms to fit the observed spectroscopic data.\n\nBased on the analysis, the most plausible chemical formula for the unknown compound is:\n\n**A.
