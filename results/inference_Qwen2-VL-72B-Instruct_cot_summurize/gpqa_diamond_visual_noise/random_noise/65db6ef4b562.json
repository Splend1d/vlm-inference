Since the acid is strong, it will completely dissociate, and the concentration of H+ ions will be equal to the concentration of the acid added.\n\n\\[ [\\text{H}^+] = \\frac{0.002808 \\, \\text{mol}}{0.100 \\, \\text{L}} = 0.02808 \\, \\text{M} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{pH} = -\\log[\\text{H}^+] = -\\log(0.02808) \\approx 1.55 \\]\n\nNone of the given options match these calculations exactly, but the closest option based on the volume of acid required is:\n\nB. pH 2.04; 28.05 cm3\n\nHowever, the calculated pH is closer to 1.55, not 2.04. It seems there might be an error in the provided options or in the interpretation of the question. Based on the calculations, the correct answer should be around 28.08 cm3 for the volume of acid, but the pH value does not match any of the given options accurately."
