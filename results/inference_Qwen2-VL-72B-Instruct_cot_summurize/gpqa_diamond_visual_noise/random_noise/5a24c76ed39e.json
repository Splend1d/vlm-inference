                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the diffraction pattern produced by a polygonal aperture. When a monochromatic light passes through such an aperture, it creates a diffraction pattern with intensity maxima and minima. The angular distance between these maxima and minima depends on the geometry of the aperture and the wavelength of the light.\n\nFor a polygonal aperture with \\( N \\) sides, the diffraction pattern can be analyzed using the Fraunhofer diffraction formula. The condition for the first minimum in the diffraction pattern is given by:\n\n\\[ a \\sin(\\theta) = m \\lambda \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( a \\) is the length of the apothem,\n- \\( \\theta \\) is the angle from the central maximum,\n- \\( m \\) is the order of the minimum (for the first minimum, \\( m = 1 \\)),\n- \\( \\lambda \\) is the wavelength of the light.\n\nSince \\( N \\) is infinitely large, the polygon becomes a circle, and the apothem \\( a \\) becomes the radius of the circle. In this case, the condition for the first minimum simplifies to:\n\n\\[ a \\sin(\\theta) = \\lambda \\]\n\nGiven that \\( \\tan(\\theta) \\approx \\theta \\) for small angles, we can approximate \\( \\sin(\\theta) \\approx \\theta \\). Therefore, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ a \\theta = \\lambda \\]\n\nSolving for \\( \\theta \\):\n\n\\[ \\theta = \\frac{\\lambda}{a} \\]\n\nThis gives the angular distance to the first minimum. For the second minimum (\\( m = 2 \\)), the condition is:\n\n\\[ a \\sin(\\theta) = 2\\lambda \\]\n\nAgain, using the small angle approximation:\n\n\\[ a \\theta = 2\\lambda \\]\n\n\\[ \\theta = \\frac{2\\lambda}{a} \\]\n\nThe angular distance between the first two minima is the difference between these two angles:\n\n\\[ \\Delta \\theta = \\frac{2\\lambda}{a} - \\frac{\\lambda}{a} = \\frac{\\lambda}{a} \\]\n\nTherefore, the angular distance between the first two minima is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0.500 \\lambda / a} \\]\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nC. 0.500 \\lambda / a"
