Parallax is inversely proportional to distance, which can be expressed as:\n\n\\[ \\text{plx} = \\frac{k}{r} \\]\n\nwhere \\( k \\) is a constant.\n\nGiven that the number of stars varies with parallax as \\( 1/\\text{plx}^5 \\), we can substitute the expression for parallax in terms of distance:\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of stars} \\propto \\frac{1}{(\\frac{k}{r})^5} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Number of stars} \\propto \\frac{1}{\\frac{k^5}{r^5}} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Number of stars} \\propto \\frac{r^5}{k^5} \\]\n\nSince \\( k \\) is a constant, we can ignore it for the purpose of determining how the number of stars changes with distance.
