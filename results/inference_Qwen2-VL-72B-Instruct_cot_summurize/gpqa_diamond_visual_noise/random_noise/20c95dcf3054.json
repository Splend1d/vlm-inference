Since 1 nm = 10 Angstroms, the optical range is approximately from 4000 to 7000 Angstroms.\n\nThe formula for redshift \\( z \\) is given by:\n\\[ z = \\frac{\\lambda_{observed} - \\lambda_{rest}}{\\lambda_{rest}} \\]\n\nWe want the observed wavelength (\\( \\lambda_{observed} \\)) to be within the optical range, specifically at the lower end of the optical range, which is around 4000 Angstroms.\n\nGiven:\n- Rest wavelength \\( \\lambda_{rest} = 1216 \\) Angstroms\n- Observed wavelength \\( \\lambda_{observed} = 4000 \\) Angstroms\n\nPlugging these values into the redshift formula:\n\\[ z = \\frac{4000 - 1216}{1216} \\]\n\\[ z = \\frac{2784}{1216} \\]\n\\[ z \\approx 2.3 \\]\n\nTherefore, the lower limit on the redshift of these objects such that they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes is approximately 2.3.\n\nThe closest option to 2.3 is:\n\nB. 2.4"
