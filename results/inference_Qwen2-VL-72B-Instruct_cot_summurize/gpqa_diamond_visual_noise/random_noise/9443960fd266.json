In quantum field theory, each loop contributes a factor of \\(\\frac{1}{(4\\pi)^d}\\), where \\(d\\) is the dimensionality of spacetime. Here, \\(d=4\\), so each loop contributes \\(\\frac{1}{(4\\pi)^4}\\).\n\n3. **Power of Coupling Constants**:\n   - The presence of \\(\\alpha^3\\) and \\(g^2\\) indicates multiple interactions. Typically, each vertex in a Feynman diagram contributes a factor of the corresponding coupling constant.\n\nGiven these observations, let's consider the number of loops:\n\n- Each loop contributes a factor of \\(\\frac{1}{(4\\pi)^4}\\).\n- The expression contains \\(\\frac{1}{(4\\pi)^6}\\), which suggests there are two loops because \\(6 = 4 + 4\\).\n\nTherefore, the Feynman diagram likely contained 2 loops.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nC. 2"
