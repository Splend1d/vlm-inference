For \\( l_1 = 1 \\) and \\( l_2 = 1 \\), the possible values of \\( m \\) are:\n- \\( m = -2 \\)\n- \\( m = -1 \\)\n- \\( m = 0 \\)\n- \\( m = 1 \\)\n- \\( m = 2 \\)\n\nHowever, since we are given \\( m = -1 \\), we need to consider the specific combination that results in this \\( m \\) value.\n\nFor \\( m = -1 \\), the possible combinations of \\( m_1 \\) and \\( m_2 \\) are:\n- \\( m_1 = -1 \\) and \\( m_2 = 0 \\)\n- \\( m_1 = 0 \\) and \\( m_2 = -1 \\)\n\nIn both cases, only one of the electrons has \\( L_z = -\\hbar \\), not both. Therefore, it is impossible to get both \\( L_{1z} \\) and \\( L_{2z} \\) as \\(-\\hbar\\) simultaneously in the given state \\( |1, 1, 2, -1> \\).\n\nThus, the joint probability of getting the eigenvalues of both \\( L_{1z} \\) and \\( L_{2z} \\) as \\(-\\hbar\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{0}\n\\]"
