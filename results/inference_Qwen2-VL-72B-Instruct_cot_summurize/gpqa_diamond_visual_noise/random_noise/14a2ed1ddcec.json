                    "text": "To solve this problem, let's break down the information given step by step:\n\n1. **Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements**:\n   - This suggests that Substance X has at least two different isotopes of the same element.\n\n2. **Reacts violently with liquid Y releasing a gas W**:\n   - Gas W has molecules containing the same number of neutrons and protons.\n   - This implies that gas W could be a noble gas like helium (He), neon (Ne), or argon (Ar).\n\n3. **Precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B**:\n   - The melting point of B is very close to 277 K (which is approximately 4\u00b0C).\n   - This suggests that B could be water (H\u2082O), as its melting point is 0\u00b0C under standard conditions.\n\n4. **The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with Substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen**:\n   - This indicates that Substance X likely contains oxygen.\n\n5. **Substance X and its close analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry**:\n   - Common reagents in organic chemistry include compounds like sodium hydroxide (NaOH), potassium hydroxide (KOH), etc.\n\nGiven these clues, let's identify the elements involved:\n\n- **Gas W**: Likely a noble gas (He, Ne, Ar).\n- **B**: Likely water (H\u2082O).\n- **Substance X**: Likely contains oxygen and another element that can form a reagent in organic chemistry.\n\nConsidering the clues, Substance X could be a compound like hydrogen peroxide (H\u2082O\u2082) or a similar compound containing oxygen and hydrogen.\n\nNow, let's calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X:\n\n- **Lightest Element**: Hydrogen (H) with atomic mass \u2248 1 amu.\n- **Heaviest Element**: Oxygen (O) with atomic mass \u2248 16 amu.\n\nSumming the atomic masses:\n\\[ \\text{Cumulative Atomic Mass} = 1 + 16 = 17 \\]\n\nHowever, since we need to consider both isotopes of each element, let's look at the isotopes:\n\n- **Hydrogen Isotopes**: Protium (1 amu), Deuterium (2 amu), Tritium (3 amu).\n- **Oxygen Isotopes**: Oxygen-16 (16 amu), Oxygen-17 (17 amu), Oxygen-18 (18 amu).\n\nSumming the atomic masses of all isotopes:\n\\[ \\text{Cumulative Atomic Mass} = (1 + 2 + 3) + (16 + 17 + 18) = 6 + 51 = 57 \\]\n\nNone of the provided options match 57. Therefore, it seems there might be a misunderstanding in the interpretation or calculation. Let's re-evaluate the options based on the initial straightforward sum without considering isotopes:\n\nGiven the straightforward sum:\n\\[ \\text{Cumulative Atomic Mass} = 1 + 16 = 17 \\]\n\nThis value is not listed among the options either. Given the complexity and potential misinterpretation, let's re-examine the options directly:\n\nA. 31\nB. 35\nC. 29\nD. 25\n\nSince none of the calculations directly match any of the provided options, it appears there might be an error in the question or the interpretation. However, based on the direct sum of the atomic masses without considering isotopes, the closest option would be:\n\nD. 25\n\nThus, the final answer is:\nD. 25"
