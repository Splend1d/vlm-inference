The degeneracy arises from the fact that the energy levels can be split into contributions from each of the three orthogonal directions (x, y, z). The total number of quanta \\( n \\) can be distributed among these three dimensions in various ways.\n\nFor \\( n = 3 \\), the possible distributions are:\n1. \\( n_x = 3, n_y = 0, n_z = 0 \\)\n2. \\( n_x = 2, n_y = 1, n_z = 0 \\)\n3. \\( n_x = 2, n_y = 0, n_z = 1 \\)\n4. \\( n_x = 1, n_y = 2, n_z = 0 \\)\n5. \\( n_x = 1, n_y = 1, n_z = 1 \\)\n6. \\( n_x = 1, n_y = 0, n_z = 2 \\)\n7. \\( n_x = 0, n_y = 3, n_z = 0 \\)\n8. \\( n_x = 0, n_y = 2, n_z = 1 \\)\n9. \\( n_x = 0, n_y = 1, n_z = 2 \\)\n10. \\( n_x = 0, n_y = 0, n_z = 3 \\)\n\nThus, there are 10 different ways to distribute the quanta among the three dimensions, leading to 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nC.
