                    "text": "To identify the chemical formula of the unknown compound, let's analyze the information provided:\n\n1. **FTIR Spectrum**: Indicates the presence of an ester group.\n2. **1H NMR Spectrum**:\n   - Two signals for aromatic-H.\n   - Two signals for vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets).\n   - Two signals for \u2013CH3 groups.\n   - No signals for \u2013CH2 groups.\n\nGiven that there are two signals for aromatic-H, we can infer that there are two aromatic hydrogen atoms. Since it is a 6-membered aromatic ring, this suggests the presence of a benzene ring with two substituents.\n\nThe two signals for vinyl-H indicate the presence of a vinyl group (\u2013CH=CH\u2013). The doublet and doublet of quartets suggest the vinyl group is attached to the aromatic ring.\n\nThe two signals for \u2013CH3 groups indicate the presence of two methyl groups.\n\nSince there are no signals for \u2013CH2 groups, we can conclude that the compound has no saturated carbon chains.\n\nNow, let's count the total number of hydrogens and carbons:\n\n- **Aromatic Ring**: 6 carbons and 4 hydrogens (since two hydrogens are replaced by substituents).\n- **Vinyl Group**: 2 carbons and 2 hydrogens.\n- **Two Methyl Groups**: 2 carbons and 6 hydrogens.\n\nTotal carbons = 6 (aromatic) + 2 (vinyl) + 2 (methyl) = 10 carbons.\nTotal hydrogens = 4 (aromatic) + 2 (vinyl) + 6 (methyl) = 12 hydrogens.\n\nHowever, since the compound contains an ester group, we need to account for the oxygen atoms in the ester group. An ester group typically consists of a carbonyl (C=O) and an ether linkage (C-O-C).\n\nThus, the total number of oxygens = 2 (from the ester group).\n\nSo, the chemical formula should be C10H12O2. However, none of the given options match this formula directly. This discrepancy might be due to an oversight in the counting or interpretation of the NMR data.\n\nGiven the options provided:\nA. C12H12O2\nB. C11H12O2\nC. C12H14O2\nD. C11H14O2\n\nThe closest match to our calculated formula (C10H12O2) is option B: C11H12O2, which could potentially accommodate additional structural details not explicitly mentioned in the problem statement.\n\nTherefore, the most likely answer is:\nB. C11H12O2"
