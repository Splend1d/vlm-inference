Therefore, if the atom has not decayed in the first 50 minutes, the remaining probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is still based on the original decay rate.\n\nThe total time considered now is 200 minutes (50 minutes already passed + 150 minutes ahead).\n\nWe need to find the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes given that it did not decay in the first 50 minutes. This can be calculated using the conditional probability formula:\n\n\\[ P(\\text{decay in next 150 min} | \\text{no decay in first 50 min}) \\]\n\nSince the decay process is memoryless, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes remains the same as the probability of decay in any 150-minute interval. Thus, we need to calculate the probability of decay in 150 minutes.\n\nUsing the exponential decay model, the probability of decay in any time interval \\( t \\) is given by:\n\n\\[ P(\\text{decay in } t \\text{ min}) = 1 - e^{-\\lambda t} \\]\n\nwhere \\( \\lambda \\) is the decay constant. Given that the probability of decay in 100 minutes is 32%, we can solve for \\( \\lambda \\):\n\n\\[ 0.32 = 1 - e^{-\\lambda \\times 100} \\]\n\\[ e^{-\\lambda \\times 100} = 0.68 \\]\n\\[ -\\lambda \\times 100 = \\ln(0.68) \\]\n\\[ \\lambda = \\frac{\\ln(0.68)}{-100} \\approx 0.00397 \\]\n\nNow, we calculate the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes:\n\n\\[ P(\\text{decay in next 150 min}) = 1 - e^{-\\lambda \\times 150} \\]\n\\[ P(\\text{decay in next 150 min}) = 1 - e^{-0.00397 \\times 150} \\]\n\\[ P(\\text{decay in next 150 min}) = 1 - e^{-0.5955} \\]\n\\[ P(\\text{decay in next 150 min}) \\approx 1 - 0.55 \\]\n\\[ P(\\text{decay in next 150 min}) \\approx 0.45 \\]\n\nTherefore, the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes is approximately 45%.\n\nThe closest option is:\n\nC. 44%"
