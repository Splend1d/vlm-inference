When this branch stops, the production of certain types of neutrinos ceases, affecting the overall neutrino flux.\n\nGiven that the pp-III branch contributes significantly to the high-energy neutrino spectrum, stopping it would reduce the number of high-energy neutrinos. This means that the flux in higher energy bands would decrease more than in lower energy bands.\n\nSince the question asks for the ratio of the flux between two specific energy bands (700-800 KeV and 800-900 KeV), and considering that stopping the pp-III branch would disproportionately affect the higher energy band (800-900 KeV), the flux in the 800-900 KeV band would be significantly reduced compared to the 700-800 KeV band.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the flux (band 1) / flux (band 2) would be greater than 1, indicating that the flux in the 700-800 KeV band is higher than in the 800-900 KeV band.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nC. 10."
