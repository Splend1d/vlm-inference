Since the conductor is uncharged initially and a charge \\(+q\\) is placed inside the cavity, the conductor will redistribute its charges such that the net charge on the outer surface remains zero.\n\n2. **Induced Charges**: When the charge \\(+q\\) is placed inside the cavity, it induces equal and opposite charges on the inner surface of the cavity (\\(-q\\)) and an equal positive charge \\(+q\\) on the outer surface of the conductor. This ensures that the net charge on the conductor remains zero.\n\n3. **Electric Field Outside the Conductor**: The induced charge \\(+q\\) on the outer surface of the conductor acts as if it were concentrated at the center of the conductor. Therefore, the electric field outside the conductor due to this charge can be calculated using Coulomb's law.\n\nGiven:\n- Charge \\( q \\)\n- Distance \\( L \\) from the center of the spherical conductor\n\nThe electric field \\( E \\) at a distance \\( L \\) from the center of the conductor due to the charge \\( +q \\) is given by:\n\\[ E = \\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{L^2} \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{A.
