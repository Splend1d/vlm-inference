Optical isomerism occurs when a molecule has one or more chiral centers, leading to the formation of enantiomers.\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1. **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This compound does not appear to have any chiral centers. The biphenyl structure and the substituents do not introduce asymmetry.\n\n2. **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (lactate)**: This compound has a chiral center at the carbon atom bonded to the hydroxyl group and the carboxylate group. Therefore, it can exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n3. **benzophenone**: This compound does not have any chiral centers. It is a symmetric compound with no asymmetric carbon atoms.\n\n4. **dimethyl fumarate**: This compound does not have any chiral centers. Fumarate is a symmetric compound with no asymmetric carbon atoms.\n\nBased on this analysis, only compound 2 (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate) shows optical isomerism.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nC. 1 and 2"
