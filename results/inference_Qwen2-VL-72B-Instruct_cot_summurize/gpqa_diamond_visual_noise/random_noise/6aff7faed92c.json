The potential energy \\( U \\) can be found using the formula for the electrostatic potential energy between two charges:\n\n\\[ U = \\frac{k q_1 q_2}{r} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( k \\) is Coulomb's constant,\n- \\( q_1 \\) and \\( q_2 \\) are the charges,\n- \\( r \\) is the distance between the charges.\n\nIn this case, the charge \\( q \\) is placed at a distance \\( d \\) from the center of the sphere, and the sphere is grounded, which means it has an induced charge distribution that creates an electric field such that the net force on the charge \\( q \\) is zero. This implies that the induced charge on the sphere is equal in magnitude but opposite in sign to the charge \\( q \\).\n\nThe potential energy \\( U \\) due to the interaction between the charge \\( q \\) and the induced charge on the sphere can be calculated by considering the effective distance between the charge \\( q \\) and the center of the sphere, which is \\( d \\). However, since the sphere is grounded, the effective distance for the potential energy calculation should account for the radius \\( R \\) of the sphere.\n\nThe correct expression for the potential energy \\( U \\) is given by:\n\n\\[ U = -\\frac{1}{2} k q^2 \\frac{R}{d^2 - R^2} \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. \\( U = -\\frac{1}{2} k q^2 \\frac{R}{d^2 - R^2} \\)"
