A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm\n\nConsidering the typical chemical shifts:\n- Protons on methyl groups (CH3) usually appear around 1 ppm.\n- Protons on methylene groups (CH2) can appear around 1.5 ppm.\n- Protons on aromatic rings or other unsaturated systems can appear around 3.5 ppm.\n\nSince the cross-peak indicates spatial proximity, it is likely that the protons involved are on adjacent carbons. Given the symmetry and the nature of the reaction, the most plausible answer is:\n\n**C. A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm**\n\nThis suggests that the protons on a methyl group (6H singlet) are close to a proton on a methylene group (1H doublet), which is consistent with the structure formed after the Diels-Alder reaction."
