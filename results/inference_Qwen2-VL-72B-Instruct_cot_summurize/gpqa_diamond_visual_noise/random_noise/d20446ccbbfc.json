It is related to the collective behavior of spins in a magnetic material and is associated with a broken symmetry in magnetic systems.\n\nB. **Phonon**: A phonon is a quantum of lattice vibrational energy in a solid. It is related to the vibrations of atoms in a crystal lattice and is associated with a broken translational symmetry.\n\nC. **Pion**: A pion (or pi meson) is a subatomic particle that plays a crucial role in nuclear forces. In the context of spontaneous symmetry breaking, pions are the Goldstone bosons associated with the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics (QCD).\n\nD. **Skyrmion**: A skyrmion is a topological soliton in certain field theories. While it can be associated with various symmetries and their breaking, it is not directly linked to a spontaneously-broken symmetry in the same way as the other particles listed.\n\nGiven this analysis, the particle that is not directly associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry is:\n\n**D.
