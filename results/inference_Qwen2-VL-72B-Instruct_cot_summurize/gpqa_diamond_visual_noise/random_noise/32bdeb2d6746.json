This is a typical diazotization reaction followed by hydrolysis, which converts primary amines into ketones or aldehydes.\n\nGiven:\n- A + (NaNO2, HCl, H2O) --> 4-isopropylcyclohexane-1,2-dione\n- B + (NaNO2, HCl, H2O) --> 5-methylhexane-2,3-dione\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. A = 4-isopropylcyclohexan-1-one, B = 5-methylhexan-2-one\n   - This option suggests that both A and B are already ketones. However, the reaction described requires starting from an amine, not a ketone.\n\nB. A = 4-isopropylcyclohexan-1-one, B = 5-methylhexane-2,3-diol\n   - This option also suggests that A is already a ketone, which is incorrect. B is a diol, which does not fit the reaction scheme.\n\nC. A = 4-isopropyl-2-methoxycyclohexan-1-ol, 5-methylhexane-2,3-diol\n   - This option suggests that A is an alcohol and B is a diol. Neither fits the reaction scheme correctly.\n\nD. A = 4-isopropyl-2-methoxycyclohexan-1-ol, B = 5-methylhexan-2-one\n   - This option suggests that A is an alcohol and B is a ketone. Again, B should be an amine to fit the reaction scheme.\n\nNone of the options directly provide the correct starting materials as amines. However, considering the typical diazotization reaction, the starting materials should be primary amines. Therefore, the correct starting materials should be the corresponding amines of the final diketones.\n\nSince none of the provided options directly match the correct starting materials (primary amines), the best approach is to identify the correct structure based on the given products.\n\nThe correct starting materials should be:\n- A = 4-isopropylcyclohexane-1,2-diamine\n- B = 5-methylhexane-2,3-diamine\n\nHowever, since these structures are not listed in the options, the closest match would be:\n- A = 4-isopropyl-2-methoxycyclohexan-1-ol (which could potentially be converted to the corresponding amine)\n- B = 5-methylhexan-2-one (which does not fit the reaction scheme)\n\nGiven the options, the most appropriate choice is:\n\n**D. A = 4-isopropyl-2-methoxycyclohexan-1-ol, B = 5-methylhexan-2-one**\n\nThis choice is the closest approximation, even though it does not perfectly fit the reaction scheme described."
