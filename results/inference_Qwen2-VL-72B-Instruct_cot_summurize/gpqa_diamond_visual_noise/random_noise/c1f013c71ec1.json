The alkyl group of the organocuprate is introduced at the less hindered carbon of the epoxide ring.\n2. Inversion of configuration occurs at the carbon to which the nucleophile (Nu) is added.\n\nGiven the starting material (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane, we can see that it has an epoxide ring with two substituents on the ring carbons. The less hindered carbon will be the one with fewer substituents.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n\nA. (1R,2R,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\nB. (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\nC. (1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\nD. (1S,4R,5S)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol\n\nSince the reaction involves inversion of configuration at the carbon where the nucleophile is added, we need to look for the option that shows this inversion.\n\nOption B shows the correct stereochemistry with inversion at the carbon where the methyl group from Me2CuLi is added.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nB. (1R,2S,4R,5R)-1,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol"
