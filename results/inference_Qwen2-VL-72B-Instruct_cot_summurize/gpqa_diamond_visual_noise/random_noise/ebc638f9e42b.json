The speed of the spacecraft is given as \\(0.99999987 \\times c\\), where \\(c\\) is the speed of light.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the Lorentz factor (\\(\\gamma\\)) which describes the time dilation effect:\n\\[\n\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\left(\\frac{v}{c}\\right)^2}}\n\\]\nwhere \\(v = 0.99999987 \\times c\\).\n\nSubstituting the given speed:\n\\[\n\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.99999987)^2}} \\approx \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.99999974}} \\approx \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.00000026}} \\approx \\frac{1}{0.00051} \\approx 1960.78\n\\]\n\nThis means that time on the spacecraft is dilated by a factor of approximately 1960.78 compared to time measured by an observer at rest relative to the Large Magellanic Cloud.\n\nNext, we calculate the time it takes for the spacecraft to travel 163,000 light-years from the perspective of an observer at rest:\n\\[\nt_{observer} = \\frac{\\text{distance}}{\\text{speed}} = \\frac{163,000 \\text{ light-years}}{0.99999987 \\times c} \\approx \\frac{163,000}{0.99999987} \\approx 163,000 \\text{ years}\n\\]\n\nHowever, from the astronaut's perspective, the time experienced is:\n\\[\nt_{astronaut} = \\frac{t_{observer}}{\\gamma} = \\frac{163,000 \\text{ years}}{1960.78} \\approx 83.1 \\text{ years}\n\\]\n\nGiven the options provided, the closest answer is:\n\nD. 81 years"
