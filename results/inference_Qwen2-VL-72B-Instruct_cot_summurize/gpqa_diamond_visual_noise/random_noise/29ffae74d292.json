The ribonucleoprotein particle (RNP) mentions showing the nascent chain \"in\" and that it needs some sugar.\n2. The nascent chain mentions that it seems rough and needs to be on its way.\n\nFrom this, we can infer that the RNP is likely referring to the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER), which is responsible for adding sugars to proteins (glycosylation). The nascent chain is likely referring to a newly synthesized protein chain that has just been released from the ribosome and is now being processed by the RER.\n\nGiven these clues, the correct answer is:\n\nB. cytosol to the extracellular space\n\nThe nascent chain is moving from the cytosol (where it was synthesized by the ribosome) to the extracellular space after being processed by the RER."
