The parallax (plx) of a star is defined as the angle subtended by the Earth's orbit at the star. The distance \\( d \\) to the star can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[ d = \\frac{1}{\\text{plx}} \\]\n\nwhere \\( d \\) is in parsecs and plx is in arcseconds.\n\nThe volume of space within a certain parallax range increases with the cube of the distance because the volume of a sphere is proportional to the cube of its radius. Since parallax is inversely proportional to distance, the volume of space within a given parallax range is proportional to \\( \\frac{1}{\\text{plx}^3} \\).\n\nTherefore, the number of stars per unit range of parallax should decrease as \\( \\frac{1}{\\text{plx}^3} \\).\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nB. ~ 1/plx^3"
