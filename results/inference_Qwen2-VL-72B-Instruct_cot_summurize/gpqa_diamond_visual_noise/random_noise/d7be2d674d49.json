This indicates that the compound contains at least one chlorine atom.\n\n2. **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy:**\n   - Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm\\(^{-1}\\): This range is indicative of O-H stretching vibrations, suggesting the presence of a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n   - Strong sharp peak at 1720 cm\\(^{-1}\\): This peak is characteristic of a carbonyl group (C=O), such as a carboxylic acid or an aldehyde.\n\n3. **Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (1H NMR):**\n   - 11.0 ppm (s, 1H): This singlet at 11.0 ppm is typical of a carboxylic acid proton.\n   - 8.02 ppm (d, 2H): This doublet at 8.02 ppm suggests aromatic protons ortho to each other.\n   - 7.72 ppm (d, 2H): Another doublet at 7.72 ppm also suggests aromatic protons ortho to each other.\n\nGiven this information, let's evaluate the options:\n\nA. **4-chlorobenzoic acid:**\n   - Molecular formula: C7H5ClO2\n   - Molecular weight: 156.57 g/mol\n   - Contains a chlorine atom, a carboxylic acid group, and aromatic protons.\n   - Matches all the spectral data provided.\n\nB. **2-chlorobenzoic acid:**\n   - Molecular formula: C7H5ClO2\n   - Molecular weight: 156.57 g/mol\n   - Contains a chlorine atom, a carboxylic acid group, and aromatic protons.\n   - Matches all the spectral data provided.\n\nC. **3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde:**\n   - Molecular formula: C7H6ClO2\n   - Molecular weight: 157.57 g/mol\n   - Contains a chlorine atom, a hydroxyl group, and an aldehyde group.\n   - Does not match the molecular ion peak at \\( m/z = 156 \\).\n\nD. **Phenyl chloroformate:**\n   - Molecular formula: C8H5ClO2\n   - Molecular weight: 176.57 g/mol\n   - Does not match the molecular ion peak at \\( m/z = 156 \\).\n\nBased on the spectral data and the molecular ion peak at \\( m/z = 156 \\), the most reasonable structural suggestion for the unidentified compound is:\n\n**A. 4-chlorobenzoic acid**"
