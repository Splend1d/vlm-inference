                    "text": "To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Decolorization of Bromine Water**: This indicates that the substances in mixture X contain unsaturated bonds (double or triple bonds) because bromine reacts with unsaturated compounds to form saturated ones.\n\n2. **Disproportionation Reaction**: When mixture X is treated with platinum and heated, it forms mixture Y through a disproportionation reaction. Disproportionation typically involves the conversion of a single compound into two different compounds, often involving oxidation and reduction processes.\n\n3. **Hydrogenation**: Both mixtures X and Y, when hydrogenated in the presence of platinum under severe conditions, give rise to a single hydrocarbon Z. This suggests that Z is a fully saturated hydrocarbon (alkane).\n\n4. **Mass Fraction of Hydrogen in Z**: The mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is 14.28%. For a hydrocarbon, the general formula is \\( C_nH_{2n+2} \\). We can use the mass fraction to find the molecular formula of Z.\n\n   - Let's denote the molecular formula of Z as \\( C_nH_{2n+2} \\).\n   - The mass of carbon in Z = \\( n \\times 12 \\) g/mol.\n   - The mass of hydrogen in Z = \\( (2n + 2) \\times 1 \\) g/mol.\n   - The total mass of Z = \\( 12n + 2n + 2 \\) g/mol = \\( 14n + 2 \\) g/mol.\n   - The mass fraction of hydrogen = \\( \\frac{(2n + 2)}{14n + 2} \\times 100\\% \\).\n\n   Given that the mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%, we set up the equation:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{2n + 2}{14n + 2} \\times 100\\% = 14.28\\%\n   \\]\n   Simplifying,\n   \\[\n   \\frac{2n + 2}{14n + 2} = 0.1428\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   2n + 2 = 0.1428(14n + 2)\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   2n + 2 = 2n \\times 0.1428 + 2 \\times 0.1428\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   2n + 2 = 2.8016n + 0.2856\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   2 - 0.2856 = 2.8016n - 2n\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   1.7144 = 0.8016n\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   n = \\frac{1.7144}{0.8016} \\approx 2.14\n   \\]\n\nSince \\( n \\) must be an integer, we round \\( n \\) to the nearest whole number, which is 2. Therefore, the molecular formula of Z is \\( C_2H_6 \\), which is ethane.\n\n5. **Total Number of Hydrogen Atoms in Mixture X**: Since Z is ethane (\\( C_2H_6 \\)), and it is formed from the hydrogenation of mixture X, the original unsaturated compounds in mixture X must have had the same number of hydrogen atoms as ethane but in an unsaturated form. \n\nGiven that there are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of the compounds of mixture X, the likely compounds in mixture X could be ethene (\\( C_2H_4 \\)) and acetylene (\\( C_2H_2 \\)). Each molecule of ethene has 4 hydrogen atoms, and each molecule of acetylene has 2 hydrogen atoms.\n\nTherefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X is:\n\\[ 4 + 2 = 6 \\]\n\nHowever, since the question asks for the total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X, and considering the context of the problem, the correct interpretation should be based on the total hydrogen content in the unsaturated forms leading to ethane.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{12} \\]"
