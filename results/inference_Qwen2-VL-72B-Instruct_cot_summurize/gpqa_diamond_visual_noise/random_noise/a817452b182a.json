First you identify the virus by performing cDNA sequencing. You then develop a real-time PCR kit for quick and accurate diagnosis.**\n\nHere\u2019s why this option is the best choice:\n\n1. **Retroviruses**: Retroviruses contain RNA as their genetic material. To study these viruses, it is necessary to convert the RNA into cDNA (complementary DNA) through reverse transcription.\n\n2. **cDNA Sequencing**: By performing cDNA sequencing, you can obtain the genetic sequence of the retrovirus. This sequence information is crucial for designing specific primers and probes for the subsequent diagnostic test.\n\n3. **Real-Time PCR Kit**: Real-time PCR (qPCR) is highly sensitive and specific, making it ideal for detecting low levels of viral RNA. It allows for quantitative measurement of the viral load, which is important for monitoring the progression of the infection and the effectiveness of treatment.\n\n4. **Quick and Accurate Diagnosis**: Real-time PCR kits provide rapid results, typically within hours, and are highly accurate due to their specificity and sensitivity.\n\nOptions A, B, and D are less suitable for the following reasons:\n\n- **Option A**: Detecting IgG antibodies is useful for serological testing but not for the initial identification and quick detection of a viral infection, especially in the early stages when antibodies may not yet be present.\n  \n- **Option B**: While nested PCR can increase sensitivity, it is more complex and time-consuming compared to real-time PCR. Additionally, relying solely on patient symptoms for virus identification is not reliable or specific enough.\n\n- **Option D**: Performing DNA sequencing directly on retroviruses is not feasible since they do not contain DNA; they require conversion to cDNA first.\n\nTherefore, option C provides the most effective and efficient method for designing a molecular diagnostic kit for a retroviral infection."
