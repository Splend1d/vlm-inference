The continuous nature of the spectrum is likely to remain because there are still multiple degrees of freedom in the decay process involving the E particles.\n\nHowever, since M is massless and can carry away energy, the endpoint value Q for the E particles might decrease compared to the original decay where two V particles were emitted. This is because some of the available energy is now carried away by the single M particle.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**B. The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint decreases.**"
