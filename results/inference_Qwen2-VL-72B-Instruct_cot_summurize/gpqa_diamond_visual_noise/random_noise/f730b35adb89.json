A chiral center is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**\n   - This compound has a double bond with a Z configuration, but it does not have any chiral centers. Therefore, it will not exhibit optical activity.\n\n2. **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**\n   - This compound has specified stereochemistry (R and S), indicating the presence of chiral centers. Therefore, it will exhibit optical activity.\n\n3. **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n   - This compound has specified stereochemistry (R and S), indicating the presence of two chiral centers. Therefore, it will exhibit optical activity.\n\n4. **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**\n   - This compound also has specified stereochemistry (R and R), indicating the presence of two chiral centers. Therefore, it will exhibit optical activity.\n\n5. **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**\n   - This compound has specified stereochemistry (R), indicating the presence of a chiral center. Therefore, it will exhibit optical activity.\n\n6. **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**\n   - This compound has specified stereochemistry (s, s, s), indicating the presence of three chiral centers. Therefore, it will exhibit optical activity.\n\n7. **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**\n   - This compound does not have any chiral centers. Therefore, it will not exhibit optical activity.\n\nFrom the analysis, the compounds that will exhibit optical activity are:\n- (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione\n- (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n- (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid\n- (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol\n- (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol\n\nSo, there are 5 compounds that will exhibit optical activity.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nD. 5"
