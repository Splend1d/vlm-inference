The spin-1/2 particle will precess around the new magnetic field direction. The precession frequency \\(\\omega\\) is given by the Larmor frequency:\n\\[ \\omega = \\gamma B \\]\n\nSince the magnetic field is now along the +Y direction, the precession frequency remains the same as it would be if the field were along the +Z direction. Therefore, the oscillation frequency of the z-component of the particle's magnetic moment is simply:\n\\[ \\omega = \\gamma B \\]\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\nC. \\(\\gamma B\\)"
