Observations reveal that both systems exhibit eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively, for system_1 and system_2. These periods are calculated as the time between two consecutive primary eclipses. Further spectroscopic observations indicate that in system_1, the two stars display sinusoidal variations of radial velocities with amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. In system_2, the amplitudes of the RV sinusoidal variations are 15 km/s and 10 km/s. By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2? Consider the mass of a system to be the sum of the masses of its two stars.\n\nA. ~ 1.2\nB. ~ 0.4\nC. ~ 0.7\nD. ~ 0.6\n"

                    "text": "To determine by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2, we need to consider the relationship between the radial velocity (RV) amplitudes and the masses of the stars in each system. The RV amplitude is directly related to the mass of the companion star in a binary system. Specifically, the RV amplitude is proportional to the mass of the companion star divided by the total mass of the system.\n\nGiven:\n- System_1 has RV amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s.\n- System_2 has RV amplitudes of 15 km/s and 10 km/s.\n\nThe RV amplitude ratio for system_1 is:\n\\[ \\frac{10 \\text{ km/s}}{5 \\text{ km/s}} = 2 \\]\n\nThe RV amplitude ratio for system_2 is:\n\\[ \\frac{15 \\text{ km/s}}{10 \\text{ km/s}} = 1.5 \\]\n\nThe mass ratio of the two systems can be estimated using the RV amplitude ratios. Since the RV amplitude is proportional to the mass of the companion star divided by the total mass of the system, the mass ratio of system_1 to system_2 can be approximated by the inverse of the RV amplitude ratio:\n\n\\[ \\text{Mass ratio} = \\frac{\\text{RV amplitude ratio of system_2}}{\\text{RV amplitude ratio of system_1}} = \\frac{1.5}{2} = 0.75 \\]\n\nTherefore, system_1 is approximately 0.75 times as massive as system_2, which means system_2 is more massive than system_1 by a factor of about 1.33. However, since the question asks by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2, and considering the options provided, the closest match is:\n\nC. ~ 0.7\n\nSo, the correct answer is C. ~ 0.7."
