The 1H NMR data should reflect these features.\n\nLet's examine each option:\n\nA. **1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)**\n   - The singlet at 6.9 ppm could be due to an aromatic proton.\n   - The doublets at 4.8 and 4.6 ppm suggest some coupling, possibly from protons near a halogen or other electronegative group.\n   - The singlet at 1.3 ppm could be due to methyl groups.\n\nB. **1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)**\n   - The doublets at 7.8 and 7.6 ppm are typical for aromatic protons.\n   - The singlet at 2.3 ppm could be due to a methyl group.\n\nC. **1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**\n   - The singlet at 9.9 ppm is indicative of a carbonyl proton (aldehyde).\n   - The doublets at 7.8 and 7.6 ppm are typical for aromatic protons.\n   - The singlet at 3.7 ppm could be due to methylene groups near the carbonyl.\n\nD. **1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)**\n   - The doublets at 4.8 and 4.6 ppm suggest some coupling, possibly from protons near a halogen or other electronegative group.\n   - The singlet at 1.3 ppm could be due to methyl groups.\n\nGiven the presence of a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond, option C is the most appropriate because it includes a singlet at 9.9 ppm, which is characteristic of a carbonyl proton (aldehyde), and the doublets at 7.8 and 7.6 ppm, which are typical for aromatic protons.\n\nTherefore, the correct 1H NMR data for the compound is:\n\n**C. 1H NMR: chemical reference (ppm): 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)**"
