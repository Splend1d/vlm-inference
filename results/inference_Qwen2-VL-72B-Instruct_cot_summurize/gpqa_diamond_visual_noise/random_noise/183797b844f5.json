Therefore, (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one will be reduced to (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.\n- Since the starting material is chiral, the product will also be chiral.\n\n### Reaction II:\n- Pentane-2,4-dione is treated with excess NaBH4 (sodium borohydride) followed by an acidic workup.\n- NaBH4 reduces ketones to alcohols. Therefore, pentane-2,4-dione will be reduced to pentane-2,4-diol.\n- Since there are two carbonyl groups, reduction will yield a diol which can form two enantiomers if the reduction is not stereoselective. However, since excess NaBH4 is used, it is likely that both carbonyls are reduced simultaneously, leading to a single product.\n\n### Combined Products:\n- From Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (one chiral compound)\n- From Reaction II: Pentane-2,4-diol (one achiral compound)\n\n### Chiral HPLC:\n- Chiral HPLC separates enantiomers.\n- (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol is chiral and will give one peak.\n- Pentane-2,4-diol is achiral and will give one peak.\n- Total: 2 peaks\n\n### Normal-phase HPLC:\n- Normal-phase HPLC separates based on polarity and other physical properties.\n- Both compounds have different polarities and functionalities, so they will separate into two distinct peaks.\n- Total: 2 peaks\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. 3 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC"
