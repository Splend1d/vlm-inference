                    "text": "To identify the compound C9H11NO2 based on the given IR and 1H NMR data, let's analyze the spectral information step by step:\n\n### IR Spectroscopy:\n1. **Medium to strong intensity bands at 3420 cm\u207b\u00b9 and 3325 cm\u207b\u00b9**: These bands are indicative of an amide NH stretch, suggesting the presence of an amide group (-CONH-).\n2. **Strong band at 1720 cm\u207b\u00b9**: This is characteristic of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch, which is consistent with an amide or ester.\n\n### 1H NMR Spectroscopy:\n1. **1.20 ppm (t, 3H)**: This signal corresponds to a methyl group (CH\u2083) attached to a methylene group (CH\u2082), indicating an ethyl group (CH\u2083-CH\u2082-).\n2. **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)**: This broad singlet suggests the presence of an amide proton (NH) which is often broad due to hydrogen bonding.\n3. **4.5 ppm (q, 2H)**: This quartet is typical for a methylene group (CH\u2082) adjacent to a methyl group, confirming the presence of an ethyl group.\n4. **7.0 ppm (d, 2H)** and **8.0 ppm (d, 2H)**: These doublets suggest aromatic protons, indicating the presence of a benzene ring. The splitting pattern (doublets) indicates ortho coupling, suggesting a disubstituted benzene ring.\n\nGiven these observations, we can deduce that the compound contains an ethyl group, an amide group, and a disubstituted benzene ring. Let's match these features with the provided options:\n\nA. **Ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**: This compound has an ester group (COO-) instead of an amide group, so it does not fit the IR data showing an amide NH stretch.\n\nB. **3-Ethoxybenzamide**: This compound has an ethoxy group (OCH\u2082CH\u2083) and an amide group, but the NMR data does not show a signal for the ethoxy group (OCH\u2082CH\u2083), only for the ethyl group (CH\u2082CH\u2083).\n\nC. **N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide**: This compound has an ethoxy group (OCH\u2082CH\u2083) and an amide group, which fits the IR data. The NMR data shows signals for the ethyl group and aromatic protons, which aligns well with the given NMR data.\n\nD. **4-Aminophenyl propionate**: This compound has an ester group (COO-) and an amino group, which does not fit the IR data showing an amide NH stretch.\n\nBased on the analysis, the compound that matches the given IR and 1H NMR data is:\n\n**C. N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide**"
