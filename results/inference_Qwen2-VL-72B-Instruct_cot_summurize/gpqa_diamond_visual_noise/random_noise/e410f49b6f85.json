However, without the exact redshift value, we cannot directly calculate the comoving distance.\n\nSince the options provided are in gigaparsecs (Gpc), we can estimate the range based on typical redshifts observed for quasars. Quasars with significant redshifts (e.g., \\(z > 2\\)) typically have comoving distances in the range of several Gpc.\n\nGiven the options:\nA. 8 Gpc\nB. 9 Gpc\nC. 7 Gpc\nD. 6 Gpc\n\nWithout precise calculations, we can make an educated guess based on typical values for high-redshift quasars. A reasonable assumption would be around 7-8 Gpc.\n\nTherefore, the most likely answer is:\n\nC. 7 Gpc"
