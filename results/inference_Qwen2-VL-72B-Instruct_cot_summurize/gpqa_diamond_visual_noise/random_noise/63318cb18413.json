The bromo group will be on one ring, and the methoxy group will be on the other ring.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n\nA. **3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl**\n   - This has the bromo group at the 3-position and the methoxy group at the 4'-position.\n\nB. **4-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl**\n   - This has the bromo group at the 4-position and the methoxy group at the 4'-position.\n\nC. **3'-bromo-2-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl**\n   - This has the bromo group at the 3'-position and the methoxy group at the 2-position.\n\nD. **3-bromo-4'-fluoro-1,1'-biphenyl**\n   - This has the bromo group at the 3-position and the fluoro group at the 4'-position.\n\nBased on the reaction sequence and the expected coupling of the diazonium salt with anisole, the correct product should have the bromo group on one ring and the methoxy group on the other ring. \n\nThe correct answer is:\n**A. 3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl**"
