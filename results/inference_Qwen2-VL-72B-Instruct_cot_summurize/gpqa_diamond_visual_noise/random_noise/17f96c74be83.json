An sp3-hybridized electrophile needs to have a leaving group to proceed with the reaction. Substitution reactions have the following two types. One is SN1 and the other is the SN2 reaction. In contrast to the substitution reaction, the elimination reaction involves the removal of a pair or groups of atoms from a molecule. These are chemical reactions in which single carbon-carbon bonded organic compounds are converted to compounds containing double/triple bonds (unsaturated compounds).\nArrange the following nucleophiles more reactive to the poorest reactive in the aqueous solution.\n\n1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate\n2.

Generally, the more basic and less sterically hindered a nucleophile is, the more reactive it will be. Additionally, nucleophiles that are better solvated by water will be less reactive because they are stabilized by the solvent.\n\nLet's analyze each nucleophile:\n\n1. **4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate**: This is a carboxylate ion, which is a good nucleophile due to its negative charge but may be somewhat hindered by the cyclohexane ring.\n2. **Hydroxide (OH\u207b)**: This is a very strong base and a good nucleophile, but it is highly solvated in water, which reduces its reactivity.\n3. **Propionate**: Another carboxylate ion, similar to 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate, but without the steric hindrance of the cyclohexane ring.\n4. **Methanol (CH\u2083OH)**: A poor nucleophile in aqueous solution due to its high solvation and low basicity.\n5. **Ethanethiolate (HSCH\u2082CH\u2082\u207b)**: A thiolate ion, which is a stronger nucleophile than carboxylates due to the sulfur atom's higher polarizability and lower electronegativity compared to oxygen.\n\nBased on these considerations, the order of reactivity from most reactive to least reactive would be:\n\n1. **Ethanethiolate** (HSCH\u2082CH\u2082\u207b): Strong nucleophile due to sulfur's properties.\n2. **Hydroxide (OH\u207b)**: Strong nucleophile but highly solvated.\n3. **Propionate**: Good nucleophile, less hindered than 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate.\n4. **4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate**: Good nucleophile but somewhat hindered.\n5. **Methanol (CH\u2083OH)**: Poor nucleophile due to solvation and low basicity.\n\nTherefore, the correct order is:\n\nB. 5, 2, 3, 1 and 4"
