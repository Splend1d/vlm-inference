Here are the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the parent compound**: The parent compound is benzoic acid.\n2. **Locate the substituents**: We have a carboxylic acid (COOH), a carbaldehyde (CHO), a cyano group (CN), a hydroxyl group (OH), a dimethylamino group (N(CH3)2), and a methoxy group (OCH3).\n3. **Assign positions**: The substituents are positioned as follows:\n   - Carboxylic acid (COOH) is at position 1 (by default).\n   - Cyano group (CN) is meta to COOH.\n   - Carbaldehyde (CHO) is meta to COOH.\n   - Hydroxyl (OH) is ortho to COOH.\n   - Dimethylamino (N(CH3)2) is ortho to COOH.\n   - Methoxy (OCH3) is para to COOH.\n\nGiven these positions, let's assign the numbers:\n- COOH is at position 1.\n- CN is at position 3 (meta to COOH).\n- CHO is at position 5 (meta to COOH).\n- OH is at position 2 (ortho to COOH).\n- N(CH3)2 is at position 6 (ortho to COOH).\n- OCH3 is at position 4 (para to COOH).\n\nNow, we can write the IUPAC name by listing the substituents in alphabetical order followed by \"benzoic acid\":\n- 2-hydroxy (OH)\n- 3-cyano (CN)\n- 4-methoxy (OCH3)\n- 5-formyl (CHO)\n- 6-(dimethylamino) (N(CH3)2)\n\nPutting it all together, the correct IUPAC name is:\n\n**A. 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid**"
