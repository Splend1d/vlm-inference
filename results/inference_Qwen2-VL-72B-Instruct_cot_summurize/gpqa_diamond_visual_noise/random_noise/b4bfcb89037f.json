Let's analyze each step in the given options:\n\n1. **Addition of a nucleophile to the triple bond**:\n   - This is typically done using a strong base like NaNH2 followed by an electrophile such as methyl chloride or ethyl chloride.\n\n2. **Reduction of the triple bond to a double bond**:\n   - This can be achieved using hydrogen gas (H2) over a catalyst like Pd or Pd-calcium carbonate.\n\n3. **Oxidation of the double bond to an aldehyde**:\n   - This can be done using ozone (O3) followed by a reducing agent like dimethyl sulfide ((CH3)2S).\n\n4. **Hydrolysis of the acetal formed during the oxidation step**:\n   - This can be done using a base like Ba(OH)2 or acid like H2SO4 with HgSO4.\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\n\n- **Option A**: \n  1. NaNH2, methanol\n  2. Li/liq. NH3\n  3. O3/ (CH3)2S\n  4. NH4OH\n\n  - Step 1: NaNH2 with methanol does not add a methyl group.\n  - Step 2: Li/liq. NH3 reduces the triple bond to a double bond.\n  - Step 3: O3/ (CH3)2S oxidizes the double bond to an aldehyde.\n  - Step 4: NH4OH does not hydrolyze the acetal.\n\n- **Option B**: \n  1. NaNH2, methyl chloride\n  2. H2/Pd\n  3. Ba(OH)2\n  3. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O\n\n  - Step 1: NaNH2 with methyl chloride adds a methyl group.\n  - Step 2: H2/Pd reduces the triple bond to a double bond.\n  - Step 3: Ba(OH)2 hydrolyzes the acetal.\n  - Step 4: H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O oxidizes the double bond to an aldehyde.\n\n- **Option C**: \n  1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride\n  2. Li/liq. NH3\n  3. O3/ H2O\n  4. NH4OH\n\n  - Step 1: NaNH2 with ethyl chloride adds an ethyl group.\n  - Step 2: Li/liq. NH3 reduces the triple bond to a double bond.\n  - Step 3: O3/ H2O oxidizes the double bond to an aldehyde.\n  - Step 4: NH4OH does not hydrolyze the acetal.\n\n- **Option D**: \n  1. NaNH2, methyl chloride\n  2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate\n  3. O3/ (CH3)2S\n  4. Ba(OH)2\n\n  - Step 1: NaNH2 with methyl chloride adds a methyl group.\n  - Step 2: H2/Pd-calcium carbonate reduces the triple bond to a double bond.\n  - Step 3: O3/ (CH3)2S oxidizes the double bond to an aldehyde.\n  - Step 4: Ba(OH)2 hydrolyzes the acetal.\n\nThe correct sequence of reagents to synthesize 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane is:\n\n**Option D**: \n1.
