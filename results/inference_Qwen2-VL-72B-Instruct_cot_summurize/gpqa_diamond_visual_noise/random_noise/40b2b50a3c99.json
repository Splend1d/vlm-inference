Benzoquinone can exist in two tautomeric forms: ortho-benzoquinone and para-benzoquinone. Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does not exhibit tautomerism.\n\n2. **Optical Isomerism**: Optical isomerism occurs when a molecule has a chiral center, meaning it cannot be superimposed on its mirror image. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (also known as lactate) has a chiral center at the carbon bonded to the hydroxyl group, making it capable of showing optical isomerism. Dimethyl fumarate does not have a chiral center and therefore does not show optical isomerism.\n\nGiven this information:\n- The compound that does not show tautomerism is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.\n- The compound that shows optical isomerism is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate"
