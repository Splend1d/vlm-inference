This means that the carboxylic acid group will be converted into a methyl group.\n\nGiven this information, let's analyze the options:\n\nA. **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**: This does not fit the NMR data since it lacks the necessary aromatic protons and methyl groups.\n\nB. **2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid**: This contains a carboxylic acid group, which would not be present after the reaction with red phosphorus and HI.\n\nC. **1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene**: This fits well with the NMR data, as it has the correct number of aromatic protons and methyl groups.\n\nD. **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**: This also contains a carboxylic acid group, which would not be present after the reaction.\n\nBased on the analysis, the final product of the reaction is:\n\n**C. 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene**"
