Linear partial fraction of fractional approximation\nB. Stability analysis\nC. Existence of nonlocal boundary conditions\nD. Complex roots of fractional approximation\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Linear partial fraction of fractional approximation**: This involves decomposing a complex fraction into simpler fractions. While this might be useful in simplifying calculations, it does not directly address the conversion from sequential to parallel algorithms.\n\nB. **Stability analysis**: Stability analysis is crucial for ensuring that numerical solutions do not diverge or produce incorrect results. However, it is more about ensuring the correctness of the solution rather than facilitating parallelization.\n\nC. **Existence of nonlocal boundary conditions**: Nonlocal boundary conditions can complicate the solution process, but they do not inherently dictate whether an algorithm can be parallelized.\n\nD. **Complex roots of fractional approximation**: The presence of complex roots in the fractional approximation can lead to oscillatory behavior in the solution, which might require careful handling. However, this is again more about the stability and accuracy of the solution rather than parallelization.\n\nGiven the context of converting a sequential algorithm into a parallel one, the key factor would typically involve aspects that allow for the distribution of computational tasks across multiple processors. Among the options provided, none directly address this aspect. However, if we consider the broader context of parallel computing, the key factor often involves the decomposition of the problem into independent subproblems that can be solved concurrently.\n\nSince none of the provided options directly address the core issue of parallelization, the closest relevant concept might be related to the decomposition of the problem, which is not explicitly listed among the options. Therefore, based on the given choices, none of them perfectly fit the description of the key factor for converting a sequential algorithm into a parallel one.\n\nHowever, if we had to choose the most relevant option considering the context of numerical methods and parallel computing, it might be:\n\n**B. Stability analysis**\n\nThis is because ensuring stability is crucial for any numerical method, including those used in parallel computing. Stability ensures that the parallel algorithm produces correct and reliable results, which is essential for practical applications.\n\nSo, the best answer given the options is:\n\n**B.
