(Assuming the same composition, the radius will increase, but we need to find the exact value.)\n\nFor a planet with the same composition as Earth, the density would remain approximately the same, around \\(5.5 \\, \\text{g/cm}^3\\), because the composition and thus the material properties are unchanged.\n\n### Option d: A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth.\n- Mass = 0.5 Earth masses\n- Radius = ? (Again, assuming the same composition, the radius will decrease, but we need to find the exact value.)\n\nFor a planet with the same composition as Earth, the density would remain approximately the same, around \\(5.5 \\, \\text{g/cm}^3\\), because the composition and thus the material properties are unchanged.\n\nGiven the information provided, the highest density is explicitly stated in option b, which is \\(5.5 \\, \\text{g/cm}^3\\).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nB. b"
