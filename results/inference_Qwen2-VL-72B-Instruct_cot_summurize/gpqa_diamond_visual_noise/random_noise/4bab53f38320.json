However, 1,4-diethylbenzene does not match the aliphatic proton pattern.\n\nTherefore, the two compounds present in the mixture must be two of the tetramethylbenzenes. The only pair that fits this description is:\n\n**B. 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\n**B. 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**"
