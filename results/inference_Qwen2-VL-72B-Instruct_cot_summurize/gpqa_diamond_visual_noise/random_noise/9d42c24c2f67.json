The star has an effective temperature (Teff) of 6000K, and the spots exhibit a temperature difference of 1000K. As only one hemisphere is spotty, photometric time-series observations will reveal periodic variations in brightness due to rotational modulation. Interestingly, this situation can closely resemble the presence of an exoplanet. To produce the same amplitude signal in the star's light curve (if the star was not covered by spots!), what should be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet relative to the radius of the host star (i.e. Rpl/Rstar)?\n\nA. ~0.07\nB. ~0.32\nC. ~0.39\nD. ~0.11\n"

The amplitude due to the exoplanet can be expressed as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Amplitude}_{\\text{exoplanet}} = \\left( \\frac{R_{\\text{pl}}}{R_{\\text{star}}} \\right)^2 \\times T_{\\text{eff}} \\]\n\nWe want this to equal the amplitude due to the spots:\n\n\\[ \\left( \\frac{R_{\\text{pl}}}{R_{\\text{star}}} \\right)^2 \\times 6000 \\text{ K} = 100 \\text{ K} \\]\n\nSolving for \\( \\frac{R_{\\text{pl}}}{R_{\\text{star}}} \\):\n\n\\[ \\left( \\frac{R_{\\text{pl}}}{R_{\\text{star}}} \\right)^2 = \\frac{100 \\text{ K}}{6000 \\text{ K}} \\]\n\\[ \\left( \\frac{R_{\\text{pl}}}{R_{\\text{star}}} \\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{60} \\]\n\\[ \\frac{R_{\\text{pl}}}{R_{\\text{star}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{60}} \\approx 0.129 \\]\n\nTherefore, the radius of the hypothetical exoplanet relative to the radius of the host star is approximately 0.129.\n\nAmong the given options, the closest value is:\n\nD. ~0.11"
