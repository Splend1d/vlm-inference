It does not involve quantum mechanics or the concept of regularization.\n\n2. **Superstring Theory**: This is a theoretical framework in which the point-like particles of particle physics are replaced by one-dimensional objects called strings. String theory is designed to address issues like infinities that arise in quantum field theories at high energies, often through the use of regularization techniques.\n\n3. **Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD)**: This is the theory of the strong interaction between quarks and gluons, the fundamental particles that make up protons and neutrons. QCD does require regularization at high energies to handle divergences.\n\n4. **Quantum Electrodynamics (QED)**: This is the quantum field theory of electromagnetism, describing how light and matter interact. QED also requires regularization to deal with infinities that arise in calculations at high energies.\n\nGiven this information, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Classical Electrodynamics\n\nThis is because classical electrodynamics, being a classical theory, does not involve quantum mechanics and therefore does not require regularization at high energies."
