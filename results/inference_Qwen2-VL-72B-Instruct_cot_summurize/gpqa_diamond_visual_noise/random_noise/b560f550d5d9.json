The large coupling constant (J = 16.0 Hz) indicates a trans relationship between the protons on the double bond.\n   - 5.5 ppm (1H, dq): This signal corresponds to another proton in the vinyl group (CH=CH-). The dq multiplicity suggests it is coupled to two different types of protons.\n   - 2.1 ppm (3H, s): This signal corresponds to a methyl group (CH3) attached to a carbonyl group (acetate).\n   - 1.6 ppm (3H, d): This signal corresponds to a methyl group (CH3) attached to a carbon that is also bonded to the vinyl group.\n\n2. **Coupling Constants:**\n   - The large coupling constant (J = 16.0 Hz) between the protons on the double bond is characteristic of a trans configuration.\n\nBased on this analysis, the compound must be a trans-propenyl acetate because:\n- It has a trans double bond (large coupling constant).\n- It has a vinyl group with two distinct protons.\n- It has an acetate group (CH3COO-).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Trans-propenyl acetate"
