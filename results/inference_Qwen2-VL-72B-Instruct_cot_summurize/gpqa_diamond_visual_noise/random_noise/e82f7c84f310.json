The chemist combines the products of both reactions, and then runs the product mixture on both a standard (achiral) reverse-phase HPLC column and a chiral HPLC column.\n\nAssuming that the chromatographic resolution is as high as theoretically possible in both cases, what does the chemist observe in each of these chromatograms?\n\nA. 2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC\nB. 2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC\nC. 3 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC\nD. 4 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC\n"
