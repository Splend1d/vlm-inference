It seems there might be a misunderstanding or misinterpretation in the question or the options provided. Based on the calculations, the correct sequence of energies should be 1E, 4E, and 9E, but these values are not listed in the options.\n\nGiven the options provided, it appears there might be an error in the question or the options. The correct sequence based on the calculations is:\n\n- Ground state: 1E\n- First excited state: 4E\n- Second excited state: 9E\n\nNone of the provided options match this sequence exactly. Therefore, based on the calculations, the correct answer cannot be determined from the given options."
