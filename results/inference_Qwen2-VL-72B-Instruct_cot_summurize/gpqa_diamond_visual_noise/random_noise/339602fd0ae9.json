The 1H NMR spectrum of polyethylene would show a single peak for the methylene protons, not two singlets. This statement is incorrect.\n\nB. **F is used for the synthesis of dyes.**\n   - Compound F is terephthalic acid, which is indeed used in the synthesis of dyes. This statement is correct.\n\nC. **C is a flammable gas.**\n   - Compound C is ethylene (C2H4), which is a flammable gas. This statement is correct.\n\nD. **H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.**\n   - Compound H is benzoic acid, which does not give a yellow color with ferric chloride solution. This statement is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the incorrect statement is:\n\n**A. D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra.**"
