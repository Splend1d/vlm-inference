The star has a mass of 1.5 times that of the Sun, a radius 1.2 times that of the Sun, and an effective temperature (Teff) of 6300 K. Planet1 has a mass equivalent to 7 Earth masses and a radius 1.7 times that of Earth, while Planet2 has a mass equivalent to 5 Earth masses and a radius 1.3 times that of Earth. Interestingly, both planets are in circular orbits. Planet1 induces a periodic shift of up to 0.03 \u00c5 in the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 \u00c5, while the gravitational impact of Planet2 on the same line results in a periodic Doppler shift of up to 0.04 \u00c5. Assuming that both planets possess the same albedo, what is the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2?\n\nA. ~ 0.53\nB. ~ 0.98\nC. ~ 1.05\nD. ~ 1.30\n"

Therefore, the equilibrium temperature depends on the distance from the star (\\( D \\)) and the surface area of the planet (\\( A \\)).\n\nGiven:\n- Star's luminosity (\\( L \\)) is proportional to its radius squared and temperature to the fourth power.\n- Both planets are in circular orbits, so their distances from the star (\\( D_1 \\) and \\( D_2 \\)) can be determined from the periodic Doppler shifts.\n\nThe periodic Doppler shifts are related to the orbital velocities of the planets, which in turn are related to their orbital periods and distances from the star. However, without specific information about the orbital periods or distances, we cannot directly calculate the exact distances.\n\nInstead, we can use the fact that the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the distance from the star:\n\n\\[ T_{eq} \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{D}} \\]\n\nThus, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures of Planet1 and Planet2 is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{T_{eq1}}{T_{eq2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{D_2}{D_1}} \\]\n\nGiven the periodic Doppler shifts, we can infer that the larger shift corresponds to the closer planet (since the Doppler shift is proportional to the orbital velocity, which is higher for closer orbits). Therefore, Planet2 is closer to the star than Planet1.\n\nHowever, without the exact values of \\( D_1 \\) and \\( D_2 \\), we cannot compute the precise ratio. But since the question asks for the ratio of equilibrium temperatures and not the absolute values, and assuming the relationship holds, we look for the closest match among the options provided.\n\nGiven the options:\nA. ~ 0.53\nB. ~ 0.98\nC. ~ 1.05\nD. ~ 1.30\n\nWithout more specific data, we might lean towards an option that suggests a slight difference in temperature due to the small differences in their properties and distances. Option C (~ 1.05) seems reasonable as it implies a slight increase in temperature for Planet2 compared to Planet1.\n\nTherefore, the best estimate is:\nC. ~ 1.05"
