The 1H NMR spectrum of the crude compound appears consistent with the expected molecule, with the exception of two peaks that both correspond to the same alpha-proton. These two peaks have similar chemical shifts and roughly equal integrals (together they integrate to 1H - the expected integral); based on the coupling pattern, you can rule out spin-spin coupling as an explanation for the duplicate peaks. LC-MS analysis of the crude compound at elevated temperature shows two clearly defined peaks of equal intensities. Both peaks have the same mass spectrum, which is consistent with the expected molecule. What is the most likely explanation for these observations?\n\nA. The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers\nB. 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction\nC. The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers\nD.

                    "text": "To determine the most likely explanation for the observed phenomena in the 1H NMR spectrum and LC-MS analysis, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers**: Enantiomers are mirror images of each other and have identical physical properties except for their interaction with polarized light. They would have the same mass spectrum and similar chemical shifts in NMR, but since they are chiral, they could potentially show different retention times in LC-MS if a chiral stationary phase is used. However, the problem does not specify the use of a chiral stationary phase, so this might not be the primary explanation.\n\nB. **'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction**: This suggests a synthetic error where two molecules have coupled instead of one. This would result in a different mass spectrum, which contradicts the observation that both peaks have the same mass spectrum.\n\nC. **The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers**: Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other. They can have different physical properties, including different chemical shifts in NMR and different retention times in LC-MS. Since both peaks have the same mass spectrum but different retention times, this fits well with the observations.\n\nD. **The compound is contaminated with a precursor**: If the compound were contaminated with a precursor, we would expect to see a different mass spectrum for the contaminant compared to the expected molecule. However, both peaks have the same mass spectrum, ruling out contamination with a precursor.\n\nGiven the observations:\n- Two peaks with similar chemical shifts and equal integrals in NMR.\n- Two peaks with the same mass spectrum but different retention times in LC-MS.\n\nThe most likely explanation is:\n\n**C. The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers**."
