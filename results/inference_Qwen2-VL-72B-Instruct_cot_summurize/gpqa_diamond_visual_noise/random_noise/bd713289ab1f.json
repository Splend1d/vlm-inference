Acid F is a strong acid, and acid G is a weak acid.\n\n4. **Formation of Solvent H**:\n   - Gas D reacts with gas B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.\n\nGiven these reactions, let's identify the likely compounds involved:\n\n- **Solid A**: Likely a metal or metal oxide.\n- **Gas B**: Likely a halogen gas (e.g., Cl\u2082).\n- **Product C**: Likely a metal halide (e.g., FeCl\u2083).\n- **Gas D**: Likely a halogen gas (e.g., F\u2082).\n- **Product E**: Likely a highly reactive halogen compound (e.g., ClF\u2083).\n\nNow, let's consider the molecular symmetry groups:\n\n- **A. D\u221eh**: This group represents molecules with infinite rotational symmetry around an axis, such as linear molecules like CO\u2082.\n- **B. C2**: This group represents molecules with a single rotation axis of order 2, such as ethane.\n- **C. C2v**: This group represents molecules with a plane of symmetry and a rotation axis of order 2, such as water.\n- **D. D4h**: This group represents molecules with four-fold rotational symmetry and additional symmetry elements, such as square planar molecules like XeF\u2084.\n\nConsidering the properties of product E (extremely hazardous), it is likely a highly reactive halogen compound. Chlorine trifluoride (ClF\u2083) is known for its extreme reactivity and hazardous nature. The molecular structure of ClF\u2083 has a T-shaped geometry, which belongs to the C2v point group.\n\nTherefore, the molecular symmetry group of product E is:\n\n**C. C2v**"
