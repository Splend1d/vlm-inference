Therefore, the correct options are either A or C, depending on the stereochemistry.\n\nSince the question asks for the \"major outcome,\" and without specific information about the stereochemistry, we can conclude that the major product will be a dibromide compound.\n\nThus, the most likely correct answer is:\n\nA. (1R,2R)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol"
