The Mott-Gurney equation is derived under the assumption of a trap-free medium, where only one type of charge carrier (either electrons or holes) is present, there is no barrier to carrier injection, and diffusion currents are negligible.\n\nB. **The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a single-carrier device with a Schottky contact and negligible diffusion current.**\n   - A Schottky contact typically involves a barrier to carrier injection, which contradicts the assumption of no carrier injection barrier in the Mott-Gurney equation. Therefore, this statement is not correct.\n\nC. **The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a two-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible diffusion current.**\n   - The Mott-Gurney equation is specifically derived for single-carrier devices. Including two types of carriers would require a different approach and equations. Thus, this statement is incorrect.\n\nD. **The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible drift current.**\n   - An Ohmic contact implies no barrier to carrier injection, which aligns with the assumptions of the Mott-Gurney equation. However, the equation assumes negligible diffusion current, not drift current. Drift current is a fundamental component of the SCLC regime described by the Mott-Gurney equation. Therefore, this statement is also incorrect.\n\nGiven the analysis, the correct statement is:\n\n**A. The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current.**"
