The formula to convert absolute magnitude (M) to apparent magnitude (m) is:\n\n\\[ m = M + 5 \\log_{10}(d) - 5 \\]\n\nwhere \\( d \\) is the distance in parsecs.\n\nLet's calculate the apparent magnitude for each star:\n\n1. **Canopus**:\n   - Brightest star in the southern sky, apparent magnitude \u2248 -0.74\n\n2. **Polaris**:\n   - North Star, apparent magnitude \u2248 2.02\n\n3. **Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 10 pc distance from us**:\n   \\[ m = 15 + 5 \\log_{10}(10) - 5 = 15 + 5(1) - 5 = 15 \\]\n\n4. **Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 200 pc distance from us**:\n   \\[ m = 15 + 5 \\log_{10}(200) - 5 = 15 + 5(2.301) - 5 = 15 + 11.505 - 5 = 21.505 \\]\n\n5. **Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 5 pc distance from us**:\n   \\[ m = 15 + 5 \\log_{10}(5) - 5 = 15 + 5(0.699) - 5 = 15 + 3.495 - 5 = 13.495 \\]\n\n6. **Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 50 pc distance from us**:\n   \\[ m = 15 + 5 \\log_{10}(50) - 5 = 15 + 5(1.699) - 5 = 15 + 8.495 - 5 = 18.495 \\]\n\nNow, let's determine which stars are detectable based on their apparent magnitudes:\n\n- **Canopus**: Apparent magnitude \u2248 -0.74 (very bright, definitely detectable)\n- **Polaris**: Apparent magnitude \u2248 2.02 (bright, definitely detectable)\n- **Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 10 pc distance from us**: Apparent magnitude = 15 (detectable)\n- **Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 200 pc distance from us**: Apparent magnitude = 21.505 (not detectable)\n- **Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 5 pc distance from us**: Apparent magnitude = 13.495 (detectable)\n- **Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 50 pc distance from us**: Apparent magnitude = 18.495 (not detectable)\n\nSo, the detectable stars are:\n- Canopus\n- Polaris\n- Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 10 pc distance from us\n- Star with RA = 0 deg and DEC = 0 deg, Absolute V magnitude of 15 mag and located at 5 pc distance from us\n\nTherefore, the number of detectable stars is 4.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nA. 4"
