Increased Volume of the Solution:**\n     - Increasing the volume of the solution generally dilutes the reactants, which could slow down the reaction rate. However, the problem does not mention any change in volume.\n\n   - **B. Increased Pressure of the Solution:**\n     - The problem does not provide any information about changes in pressure. Therefore, it is unlikely that pressure is the cause of the observed effects.\n\n   - **C. Increased pH of the Solution:**\n     - The pH changed from 1 to 4, meaning the solution became less acidic. Since the reaction involves H+ ions, a decrease in acidity (increase in pH) would reduce the concentration of H+ ions, thereby slowing down the reaction rate.\n\n   - **D. Increased Temperature of the Solution:**\n     - The container got hot, indicating an increase in temperature. Generally, an increase in temperature speeds up reactions. However, the problem states that the reaction rate slowed down, which contradicts this option.\n\nGiven these points, the most plausible reason for the change in the rate of reaction is:\n\n**C. The increased pH of the solution.**"
