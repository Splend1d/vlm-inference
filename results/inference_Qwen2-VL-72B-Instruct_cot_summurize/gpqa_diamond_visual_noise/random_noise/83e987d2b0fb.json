The compounds they are working with are bonding to each other through non-covalent/van der Waals interactions.\n\nThis is because when compounds \"are on top of each other,\" it suggests that they are physically close and interacting with each other, which is characteristic of non-covalent or van der Waals interactions. These types of interactions can cause compounds to aggregate or clump together, leading to difficulties in separation or purification."
