                    "text": "To determine how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1, we need to use the information provided about the radial velocity (RV) shifts and the relationship between these shifts and the orbital periods of the planets.\n\nThe RV shift is related to the orbital velocity of the star due to the gravitational influence of the orbiting planet. The larger the RV shift, the faster the star is moving in response to the planet's gravity, which implies a shorter orbital period for the planet.\n\nGiven:\n- Planet #1 has an RV shift of 5 milliangstroms.\n- Planet #2 has an RV shift of 7 milliangstroms.\n\nSince both planets have similar masses and the stars have similar masses, the difference in RV shifts can be directly related to the difference in their orbital periods. The orbital period \\( P \\) of a planet is inversely proportional to the square root of its mass and directly proportional to the cube root of its semi-major axis \\( a \\). However, since the masses of the planets are similar and the stars' masses are also similar, we can simplify the comparison by focusing on the RV shifts.\n\nThe RV shift is proportional to the orbital velocity of the star, which in turn is inversely proportional to the orbital period of the planet. Therefore, if the RV shift of planet #2 is greater than that of planet #1, its orbital period must be shorter.\n\nLet's denote the orbital periods of planet #1 and planet #2 as \\( P_1 \\) and \\( P_2 \\), respectively. The ratio of their periods can be expressed as:\n\n\\[ \\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{RV shift of planet #1}}{\\text{RV shift of planet #2}} \\right)^{-\\frac{3}{2}} \\]\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\n\\[ \\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left( \\frac{5}{7} \\right)^{-\\frac{3}{2}} \\]\n\nCalculating this value:\n\n\\[ \\left( \\frac{5}{7} \\right)^{-\\frac{3}{2}} = \\left( \\frac{7}{5} \\right)^{\\frac{3}{2}} \\]\n\n\\[ \\left( \\frac{7}{5} \\right)^{\\frac{3}{2}} = \\left( \\frac{7}{5} \\right)^{1.5} \\]\n\n\\[ \\left( \\frac{7}{5} \\right)^{1.5} = \\left( \\frac{7}{5} \\right) \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{7}{5}} \\]\n\n\\[ \\approx 1.4 \\times 1.225 \\]\n\n\\[ \\approx 1.715 \\]\n\nTherefore, the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 1.715 times longer than that of planet #1.\n\nAmong the given options, the closest value is:\n\nA. ~ 1.96\n\nSo, the correct answer is A. ~ 1.96."
