                    "text": "To determine the angle between the directions of the two photons produced after the annihilation of an electron and a positron, we need to consider the conservation laws involved: conservation of energy and conservation of momentum.\n\nGiven:\n- Electron's Lorentz factor (\\(\\gamma_e\\)) = 4\n- Positron's Lorentz factor (\\(\\gamma_p\\)) = 2\n\nThe total energy before annihilation is given by the sum of the rest mass energies of the electron and positron plus their kinetic energies:\n\n\\[ E_{total} = m_e c^2 + m_p c^2 + K_e + K_p \\]\n\nwhere \\( m_e \\) and \\( m_p \\) are the masses of the electron and positron, respectively, and \\( K_e \\) and \\( K_p \\) are their kinetic energies.\n\nUsing the Lorentz factors:\n- For the electron: \\( K_e = (\\gamma_e - 1) m_e c^2 = (4 - 1) m_e c^2 = 3m_e c^2 \\)\n- For the positron: \\( K_p = (\\gamma_p - 1) m_p c^2 = (2 - 1) m_p c^2 = m_p c^2 \\)\n\nThus, the total energy before annihilation is:\n\\[ E_{total} = m_e c^2 + m_p c^2 + 3m_e c^2 + m_p c^2 = 5m_e c^2 + 2m_p c^2 \\]\n\nSince the electron and positron have the same mass \\( m_e = m_p \\):\n\\[ E_{total} = 5m_e c^2 + 2m_e c^2 = 7m_e c^2 \\]\n\nAfter annihilation, this energy is converted into the energy of the two photons:\n\\[ E_{photon} = \\frac{E_{total}}{2} = \\frac{7m_e c^2}{2} \\]\n\nEach photon has the same energy:\n\\[ E_{photon} = \\frac{7m_e c^2}{2} \\]\n\nNext, we consider the conservation of momentum. The initial momentum of the electron and positron must be conserved in the final state of the two photons. Since the electron and positron are moving in opposite directions along the horizontal axis, their momenta cancel out in the horizontal direction. Therefore, the net momentum in the horizontal direction is zero.\n\nThe photons must carry equal and opposite momenta to conserve momentum. Let \\( p \\) be the magnitude of the momentum of each photon. The momenta of the two photons can be represented as:\n\\[ \\mathbf{p}_1 = p \\hat{i} + q \\hat{j} \\]\n\\[ \\mathbf{p}_2 = -p \\hat{i} + q \\hat{j} \\]\n\nThe angle \\(\\theta\\) between the directions of the two photons can be found using the dot product:\n\\[ \\mathbf{p}_1 \\cdot \\mathbf{p}_2 = |\\mathbf{p}_1| |\\mathbf{p}_2| \\cos \\theta \\]\n\nSubstituting the expressions for \\(\\mathbf{p}_1\\) and \\(\\mathbf{p}_2\\):\n\\[ (p \\hat{i} + q \\hat{j}) \\cdot (-p \\hat{i} + q \\hat{j}) = p(-p) + q(q) \\]\n\\[ -p^2 + q^2 = p^2 \\cos \\theta \\]\n\nSince the magnitudes of the momenta are equal:\n\\[ p^2 + q^2 = E_{photon}^2 / c^2 \\]\n\nWe know that \\( E_{photon} = \\frac{7m_e c^2}{2} \\), so:\n\\[ p^2 + q^2 = \\left( \\frac{7m_e c^2}{2c} \\right)^2 = \\frac{49m_e^2 c^2}{4} \\]\n\nThus:\n\\[ -p^2 + q^2 = p^2 \\cos \\theta \\]\n\\[ \\frac{49m_e^2 c^2}{4} - p^2 = p^2 \\cos \\theta \\]\n\\[ \\frac{49m_e^2 c^2}{4} = p^2 (1 + \\cos \\theta) \\]\n\nSolving for \\(\\cos \\theta\\):\n\\[ 1 + \\cos \\theta = \\frac{49}{4} \\]\n\\[ \\cos \\theta = \\frac{49}{4} - 1 = \\frac{45}{4} \\]\n\nHowever, this result is not possible since \\(\\cos \\theta\\) cannot exceed 1. There seems to be a misunderstanding in the calculation. Let's re-evaluate the problem with a simpler approach considering the symmetry and conservation laws.\n\nGiven the symmetry and the fact that the photons move in opposite directions along the vertical axis, the angle between them should be such that they form a straight line. Thus, the angle between the directions of the two photons is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{180^\\circ} \\]"
