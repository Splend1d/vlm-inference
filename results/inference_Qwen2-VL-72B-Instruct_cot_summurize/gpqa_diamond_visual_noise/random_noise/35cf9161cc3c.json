For both transit and occultation events to occur, the second planet must pass directly in front of and behind the star from our perspective.\n\nThe condition for both transit and occultation is that the sum of the radii of the star and the planet must be less than or equal to the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit:\n\\[ R_{\\text{star}} + R_{\\text{planet}} \\leq a \\]\n\nGiven:\n- \\( R_{\\text{star}} = 1.5 \\times R_{\\text{Sun}} \\)\n- \\( R_{\\text{planet}} = 2.5 \\times R_{\\text{Earth}} \\)\n\nWe need to find the maximum orbital period \\( P \\) of the second planet such that it still exhibits both transit and occultation events.\n\nUsing Kepler's third law, which relates the orbital period \\( P \\) to the semi-major axis \\( a \\):\n\\[ P^2 \\propto a^3 \\]\n\nSince the first planet has an orbital period of 3 days, its semi-major axis \\( a_1 \\) can be related to its period \\( P_1 \\):\n\\[ P_1^2 \\propto a_1^3 \\]\n\\[ 3^2 \\propto a_1^3 \\]\n\\[ 9 \\propto a_1^3 \\]\n\nFor the second planet, let \\( P_2 \\) be its orbital period and \\( a_2 \\) be its semi-major axis:\n\\[ P_2^2 \\propto a_2^3 \\]\n\nSince the second planet must have a larger semi-major axis to allow for both transit and occultation, we need to find the maximum \\( P_2 \\) such that:\n\\[ R_{\\text{star}} + R_{\\text{planet}} \\leq a_2 \\]\n\nAssuming the maximum \\( a_2 \\) is just enough to satisfy this condition, we can estimate \\( P_2 \\) by considering the scaling of the semi-major axis and the corresponding period.\n\nGiven the complexity and the need for precise calculations involving the exact radii and masses, the provided options suggest a rough estimation based on the given information.\n\nConsidering the options:\nA. ~ 12.5\nB. ~ 33.5\nC. ~ 7.5\nD. ~ 37.5\n\nThe correct answer is:\nB. ~ 33.5"
