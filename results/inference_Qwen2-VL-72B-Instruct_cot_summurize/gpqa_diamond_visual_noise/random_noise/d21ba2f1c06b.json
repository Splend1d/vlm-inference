The possible ring sizes that can be formed are typically 5-membered (cyclopentane) and 6-membered (cyclohexane) rings due to strain considerations.\n\nLet's analyze the possible products:\n\n1. **Formation of a 5-membered ring:**\n   - The double bond can shift to form a cyclopentane ring in two different ways:\n     - By forming a bond between C2 and C5.\n     - By forming a bond between C1 and C4.\n\n2. **Formation of a 6-membered ring:**\n   - The double bond can shift to form a cyclohexane ring in one way:\n     - By forming a bond between C1 and C5.\n\nSince the starting material is racemic, each of these configurations will exist as a pair of enantiomers. Therefore, for each of the three configurations above, there will be two enantiomers.\n\nSo, the total number of possible products (excluding ethene) is:\n- 2 (enantiomers for the first 5-membered ring configuration)\n- 2 (enantiomers for the second 5-membered ring configuration)\n- 2 (enantiomers for the 6-membered ring configuration)\n\nAdding these together gives a total of 6 possible products.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nB. 6"
