The threshold energy is the minimum energy required for the reaction to occur.\n\nThe reaction \\(\\gamma\\gamma \\rightarrow e^+ e^-\\) requires the total energy of the two photons to be at least equal to the rest mass energy of an electron and a positron. The rest mass energy of an electron (or positron) is given by:\n\n\\[ E = m_e c^2 \\]\n\nwhere \\( m_e \\) is the mass of an electron and \\( c \\) is the speed of light. The mass of an electron is approximately \\( 511 \\text{ keV/c}^2 \\).\n\nTherefore, the rest mass energy of an electron is:\n\n\\[ E = 511 \\text{ keV} \\]\n\nSince the reaction involves creating both an electron and a positron, the total rest mass energy required is:\n\n\\[ 2 \\times 511 \\text{ keV} = 1022 \\text{ keV} \\]\n\nThis is the minimum energy required for the reaction to occur. However, since the CMB photons have an average energy of \\( 10^{-3} \\text{ eV} \\), which is much lower than the required energy, the gamma ray must provide most of the energy.\n\nFor the reaction to occur, the energy of the gamma ray must be significantly higher than the rest mass energy of the electron-positron pair. Typically, the threshold energy for such reactions is much higher due to the need for sufficient momentum transfer.\n\nGiven the options provided, the correct answer is:\n\nB. 3.9*1e5 GeV"
