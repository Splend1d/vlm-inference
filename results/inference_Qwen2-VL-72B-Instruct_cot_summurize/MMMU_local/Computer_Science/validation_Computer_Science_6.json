This indicates that the model is learning from the data.\n2. **Test Error**: The test error also decreases as the training set size increases but plateaus at a higher level than the training error. This suggests that the model is not generalizing well to new data.\n\nGiven these observations:\n- If the training error is low but the test error is significantly higher, this typically indicates **high variance**. The model is overfitting to the training data and not performing well on unseen data.\n- If both the training and test errors are high, this typically indicates **high bias**. The model is underfitting and not capturing the underlying structure of the data.\n\nIn the provided graph:\n- The training error is relatively low compared to the test error.\n- The gap between the training and test errors is significant, especially as the training set size increases.\n\nTherefore, the algorithm is likely suffering from **high variance**.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nB. High variance"
