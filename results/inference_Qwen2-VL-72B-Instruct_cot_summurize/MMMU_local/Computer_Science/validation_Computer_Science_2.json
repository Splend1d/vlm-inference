The process involves removing the root, then swapping the last node with the root, and finally percolating down to maintain the heap properties.\n\nAfter deleting 6, the last node (26) becomes the new root. Then, we need to percolate down to ensure the min-heap and leftist properties are maintained.\n\nThe resulting heap after deletion would look like this:\n\n```\n       26\n      /  \\\n     13   8\n    / \\  / \\\n  18  24 12 37\n     / \\\n    35  17\n```\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. 8 is NOT the root.\n   - After deletion, 26 is the root, so 8 is not the root. This statement is true.\n\nB. 12 is the right child of 8.\n   - In the new heap, 12 is indeed the right child of 8. This statement is true.\n\nC. 24 is the left child of 13.\n   - In the new heap, 24 is still the left child of 13. This statement is true.\n\nD. 35 is the right child of 24.\n   - In the new heap, 35 is still the left child of 24, not the right child. This statement is false.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. 35 is the right child of 24."
