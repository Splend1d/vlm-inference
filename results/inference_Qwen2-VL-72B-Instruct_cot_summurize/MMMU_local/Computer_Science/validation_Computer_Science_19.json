Sort all the edges in the graph in non-decreasing order of their weights.\n2. Start with an empty set of edges for the minimum spanning tree (MST).\n3. Add the next edge from the sorted list to the MST if it does not form a cycle with the edges already in the MST.\n\nLet's sort the edges by their weights:\n- (a-b) = 1\n- (d-f) = 2\n- (b-f) = 3\n- (d-c) = 4\n- (d-e) = 5\n- (c-e) = 6\n- (a-c) = 7\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\nA.
