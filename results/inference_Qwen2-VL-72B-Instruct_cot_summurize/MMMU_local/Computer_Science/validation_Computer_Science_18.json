Start at vertex V1.\n2. Visit an unvisited neighbor of the current vertex.\n3. Repeat step 2 until there are no more unvisited neighbors.\n4. Backtrack to the previous vertex and repeat steps 2 and 3.\n\nLet's apply this algorithm to the given adjacency list:\n\n1. Start at V1.\n   - V1 has neighbors V5 and V2.\n   - Choose V5 first (arbitrarily).\n\n2. Move to V5.\n   - V5 has neighbors V3 and V4.\n   - Choose V3 first (arbitrarily).\n\n3. Move to V3.\n   - V3 has no unvisited neighbors.\n   - Backtrack to V5.\n\n4. From V5, choose the next unvisited neighbor, which is V4.\n\n5. Move to V4.\n   - V4 has neighbors V7 and V6.\n   - Choose V7 first (arbitrarily).\n\n6. Move to V7.\n   - V7 has no unvisited neighbors.\n   - Backtrack to V4.\n\n7. From V4, choose the next unvisited neighbor, which is V6.\n\n8. Move to V6.\n   - V6 has no unvisited neighbors.\n   - Backtrack to V4.\n\n9. Since all neighbors of V4 have been visited, backtrack to V5.\n\n10. Since all neighbors of V5 have been visited, backtrack to V1.\n\n11. From V1, choose the next unvisited neighbor, which is V2.\n\n12. Move to V2.\n    - V2 has a neighbor V3.\n    - Choose V3.\n\n13. Move to V3.\n    - V3 has no unvisited neighbors.\n    - Backtrack to V2.\n\n14. Since all neighbors of V2 have been visited, backtrack to V1.\n\nSince all vertices have been visited, the traversal ends.\n\nThe resulting sequence is: V1, V5, V3, V4, V7, V6, V2\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC.
