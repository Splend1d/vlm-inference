Here, we will use Kruskal's algorithm for simplicity.\n\nFirst, we list all the edges in ascending order of their weights:\n\n1. Edge between nodes 1 and 3 with weight 1\n2. Edge between nodes 1 and 9 with weight 1\n3. Edge between nodes 1 and 15 with weight 1\n4. Edge between nodes 1 and 18 with weight 1\n5. Edge between nodes 3 and 13 with weight 3\n6. Edge between nodes 3 and 15 with weight 13\n7. Edge between nodes 3 and 18 with weight 8\n8. Edge between nodes 9 and 18 with weight 2\n\nNow, we add these edges to the MST one by one, ensuring that adding an edge does not form a cycle:\n\n1. Add edge (1, 3) with weight 1\n2. Add edge (1, 9) with weight 1\n3. Add edge (1, 15) with weight 1\n4. Add edge (1, 18) with weight 1\n5. Add edge (3, 13) with weight 3\n6. Add edge (9, 18) with weight 2\n\nAt this point, all nodes are connected, and we have formed the MST. The total weight of the MST is the sum of the weights of these edges:\n\n1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 2 = 9\n\nTherefore, the total weight of the minimum spanning tree is 9.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nD. 8"
