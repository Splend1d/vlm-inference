Additionally, the `Mgr_ssn` field in `DEPARTMENT` references the `Ssn` field in `EMPLOYEE`.\n\nFor a new department to be added, it must have a manager (`Mgr_ssn`). Since there are no employees in the database, there would be no valid `Ssn` values to reference for `Mgr_ssn`.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nB. No"
