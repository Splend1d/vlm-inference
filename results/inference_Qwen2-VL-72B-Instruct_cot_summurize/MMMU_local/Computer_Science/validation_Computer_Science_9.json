Each of the four links from the shared middle link to a client has a transmission capacity of RC = 60 Mbps. <image 1> What is the maximum achievable end-end throughput (in Mbps) for each of four client-to-server pairs, assuming that the middle link is fairly shared (divides its transmission rate equally)?
