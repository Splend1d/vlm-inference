From State 0, if the input is '0', it goes to State 3, which is a final state. So, the string '0' is accepted.\n2. From State 0, if the input is any digit from '1' to '9', it goes to State 1.\n   - From State 1, if the input is any digit from '0' to '9', it goes to State 2.\n   - From State 2, it can continue to accept any number of digits ('0-9') because of the loop transition.\n   - Therefore, any string starting with '1-9' followed by any number of digits ('0-9') is accepted.\n\nCombining these observations, the regular expression that matches the strings accepted by this FA is:\n\\[ ([1-9][0-9]*) | 0 \\]\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nC.
