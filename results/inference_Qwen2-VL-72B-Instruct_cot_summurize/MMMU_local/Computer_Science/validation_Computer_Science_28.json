This property makes it useful for feature selection because it effectively eliminates some features by setting their coefficients to zero.\n\nGiven the data distribution shown in the image, we can observe that:\n\n- The data points are clustered in such a way that one axis (let's say \\( x_1 \\)) separates the two classes more clearly than the other axis (\\( x_2 \\)).\n- The separation along \\( x_1 \\) is more distinct, suggesting that \\( x_1 \\) is a more important feature for classification.\n\nWhen applying L1 regularization, as \\( C \\) increases:\n1. The regularization term \\( C(|w_1| + |w_2|) \\) becomes more dominant.\n2. The model will try to minimize this term by driving some coefficients to zero.\n3. Since \\( x_1 \\) is more important for classification, the model will likely keep \\( w_1 \\) non-zero longer than \\( w_2 \\).\n\nTherefore, as \\( C \\) increases:\n- First, \\( w_2 \\) will become zero because it is less important for classification.\n- Then, if \\( C \\) continues to increase, \\( w_1 \\) might also become zero, but only after \\( w_2 \\) has already been driven to zero.\n\nSo, the correct option is:\n\nA. First, w2 becomes zero, and then w1 becomes zero"
