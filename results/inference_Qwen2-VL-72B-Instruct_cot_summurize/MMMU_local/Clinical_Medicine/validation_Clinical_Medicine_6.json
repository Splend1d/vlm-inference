Given the context of a cardiac arrest and subsequent resuscitation, the most likely cellular change occurring within the myocardium would be:\n\nB. Free radical injury\n\nDuring cardiac arrest, there is a significant reduction in blood flow to the heart, leading to ischemia (lack of oxygen). When blood flow is restored during resuscitation, reactive oxygen species (ROS) or free radicals are produced, which can cause damage to the myocardial cells. This process is known as reperfusion injury and is characterized by free radical production.\n\nApoptosis (programmed cell death) might also occur but is less immediate compared to free radical injury. Heterophagocytosis (the engulfing of foreign material by cells) and squamous metaplasia (a type of cell transformation) are not typically associated with the immediate aftermath of cardiac arrest and resuscitation."
