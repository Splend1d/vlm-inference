A girl infant is born at 32 weeks gestation and is markedly icteric. The microscopic appearance of the placenta is shown here. Laboratory studies show the baby has a Hct of 18%, and an exchange transfusion is performed. Her first pregnancy was uncomplicated and resulted in the birth of a normal girl at term. Which of the following immunologic mechanisms is most likely to produce these findings? <image 1> \n\nA. Anti-receptor antibody\nB. Immune complex formation\nC. Complement mediated cell destruction\nD. Delayed type hypersensitivity\nE. Loss of self tolerance\n"

This condition is typically caused by maternal antibodies against fetal red blood cells, leading to their destruction.\n\nGiven the clinical scenario and the histological appearance, the most likely immunologic mechanism involved is:\n\nC. Complement mediated cell destruction\n\nIn HDN, maternal antibodies (usually anti-Rh or anti-Kell) cross the placenta and bind to fetal red blood cells, activating the complement system, which leads to lysis of the red blood cells. This results in anemia, jaundice, and other complications in the fetus or newborn."
