The patient's symptoms and laboratory results (ST segment elevation on EKG and elevated cardiac troponin) also support the diagnosis of myocardial infarction.\n\nIn myocardial infarction, the most common type of tissue necrosis observed is coagulative necrosis. This type of necrosis occurs when there is an interruption of blood supply to the heart muscle, leading to cell death and the formation of a firm, coagulated mass.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Coagulative necrosis"
