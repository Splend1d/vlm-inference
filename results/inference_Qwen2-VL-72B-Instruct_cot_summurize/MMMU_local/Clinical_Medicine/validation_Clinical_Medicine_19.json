The presence of gallstones can lead to symptoms such as sharp abdominal pain, especially in the right upper quadrant, which is consistent with the patient's presentation.\n\nAmong the options provided, the most likely risk factor for gallstone formation is:\n\nE. Obesity\n\nObesity is a well-known risk factor for gallstone formation because it is associated with increased cholesterol levels in bile, which can lead to the formation of cholesterol gallstones. Other factors that increase the risk of gallstones include rapid weight loss, pregnancy, and certain medications.\n\nWhile hemolytic anemia (C) can also be a risk factor for gallstone formation due to increased bilirubin levels leading to pigment stones, obesity is more commonly associated with cholesterol gallstones, which appear to be present in the image."
