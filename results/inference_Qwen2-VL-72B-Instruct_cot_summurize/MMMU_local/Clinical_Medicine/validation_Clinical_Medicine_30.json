This condition is often caused by a blood clot that travels to the lungs from another part of the body, typically the legs.\n\nGiven the context and the options provided:\n\nA. Blunt chest trauma - While chest trauma can lead to lung injuries, it is not a typical risk factor for pulmonary embolism.\nB. Inhalation of inorganic dusts - This is more associated with conditions like silicosis or asbestosis, which do not directly lead to pulmonary embolism.\nC. Prolonged immobilization - This is a significant risk factor for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which can lead to pulmonary embolism.\nD. Bronchopneumonia - While pneumonia can be serious, it is not a direct risk factor for pulmonary embolism.\n\nTherefore, the most likely risk factor for the development of this woman's immediate cause of death is:\n\nC.
