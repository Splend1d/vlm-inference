Taste buds are primarily located on the papillae of the tongue, with different regions having different sensitivities to various tastes.\n\n- The tip of the tongue (region 1) is sensitive to sweet and salty tastes.\n- The sides of the tongue (regions 2 and 3) are sensitive to sour and bitter tastes.\n- The back of the tongue (region 4) is sensitive to bitter tastes.\n\nGiven this information, a loss of taste would be expected in regions where taste buds are concentrated. Since taste buds are distributed across the entire tongue, but more densely at the front and sides, the most significant loss of taste would likely be observed in regions 2, 3, and 4.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. 2, 3, and 4"
