                    "text": "To determine whether the pedigree in Figure 1 shows the pattern for the transmission of colorblindness, we need to understand the inheritance pattern of colorblindness. Colorblindness is typically an X-linked recessive trait. This means that:\n\n- Males (XY) only need one copy of the recessive allele on their single X chromosome to express the trait.\n- Females (XX) need two copies of the recessive allele (one on each X chromosome) to express the trait.\n\nNow, let's analyze the pedigree:\n\n1. Individual 2 is affected (male).\n2. Individual 1 is a carrier (female).\n3. Individual 3 is affected (male).\n4. Individual 4 is a carrier (female).\n5. Individual 5 is normal (female).\n6. Individual 6 is affected (male).\n7. Individual 7 is normal (male).\n8. Individual 8 is a carrier (female).\n9. Individual 9 is normal (male).\n\nGiven this information:\n- The pattern shows that males can be affected even if their mothers are carriers.\n- Females can be carriers without being affected.\n- Affected males pass the trait to all their daughters, who become carriers.\n\nThis pattern is consistent with X-linked recessive inheritance, which is characteristic of colorblindness.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\nA. True"
