The cell membrane is composed of a phospholipid bilayer, where the hydrophilic (water-loving) heads of the phospholipids face the aqueous environments inside and outside the cell, while the hydrophobic (water-fearing) tails face each other in the interior of the bilayer.\n\nIn the given image:\n- **A** represents the hydrophilic heads of the phospholipids.\n- **E** represents the hydrophobic tails of the phospholipids.\n- **B**, **C**, and **D** represent various proteins embedded in the membrane.\n\nThe hydrophobic region of the cell membrane is where the hydrophobic tails of the phospholipids are located.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nA.
