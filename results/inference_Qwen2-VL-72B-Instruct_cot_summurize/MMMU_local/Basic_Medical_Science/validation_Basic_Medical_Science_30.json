The middle cerebral artery is one of the main branches of the internal carotid artery and supplies a large portion of the lateral surface of the brain, including areas involved in speech.\n\nSince the majority of people are right-handed and have their dominant hemisphere on the left side of the brain, the left middle cerebral artery serves the areas involved in speech for most individuals.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Left middle cerebral artery."
