Physical examination reveals: Clear lung sounds; Erythematous, edematous nasal turbinates with clear discharge; Erythematous oropharynx without exudate. A rapid diagnostic immunoassay of nasal secretions reveals antigens from a segmented RNA virus.

The rapid diagnostic immunoassay revealing antigens from a segmented RNA virus further supports the diagnosis of influenza, as influenza viruses are segmented RNA viruses."
