Patients show motor abnormalities, personality changes, a gradual loss of higher brain functions, and eventually die. Below <image 1> is a family pedigree and an accompanying Southern blot that was obtained with genomic DNA that was probed with a DNA complementary to the gene for the Huntingtin protein. Based on the linked image above, which statement is most likely to be CORRECT?\n\nA. HD is an autosomal recessive disease\nB. The huntingtin gene is likely to be located on the X-chromosome\nC. A likely cause of HD is an unstable triplet repeat in the HD gene\nD. The pattern of bands in the blot is indicative of abnormal splicing of the HD mRNA\nE. In most individuals, the region of the HD gene detected by the DNA probe is distributed on six different restriction fragments\n"

                    "text": "To determine the correct statement about Huntington disease (HD) based on the given pedigree and Southern blot, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **HD is an autosomal recessive disease**\n   - The pedigree shows that the disease is passed from affected parents to their offspring, suggesting a dominant inheritance pattern rather than recessive.\n\nB. **The huntingtin gene is likely to be located on the X-chromosome**\n   - The pedigree does not show a pattern consistent with X-linked inheritance. Both males and females are affected equally, which is more typical of an autosomal trait.\n\nC. **A likely cause of HD is an unstable triplet repeat in the HD gene**\n   - Huntington disease is known to be caused by an expansion of a CAG triplet repeat in the huntingtin gene. This is consistent with the Southern blot showing multiple bands, which could indicate varying lengths of the repeat sequence.\n\nD. **The pattern of bands in the blot is indicative of abnormal splicing of the HD mRNA**\n   - The Southern blot typically detects variations in the length of the DNA fragment, not RNA splicing patterns. The multiple bands suggest variability in the length of the repeat sequence rather than splicing issues.\n\nE. **In most individuals, the region of the HD gene detected by the DNA probe is distributed on six different restriction fragments**\n   - The Southern blot shows multiple bands, indicating that the region detected by the probe is present on multiple restriction fragments. However, it does not necessarily mean there are exactly six fragments; the number can vary.\n\nBased on the analysis, the most likely correct statement is:\n\n**C. A likely cause of HD is an unstable triplet repeat in the HD gene**"
