However, the image shows a clear nucleus, so this option is incorrect.\n\nB. **It is a eukaryotic cell because it has a cell wall and a nucleus**:\n   - The image shows a well-defined nucleus, which is a characteristic of eukaryotic cells. Additionally, the presence of a cell wall is also visible, which is consistent with plant cells, a type of eukaryote. Therefore, this option is correct.\n\nC. **It is eukaryotic because it does not have a nucleus nor a cell membrane**:\n   - This option is incorrect because the image clearly shows a nucleus, and all cells have a cell membrane.\n\nD. **It is prokaryote because it has a cell wall**:\n   - While prokaryotes can have cell walls, the presence of a nucleus in the image indicates that this is not a prokaryote.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. It is a eukaryotic cell because it has a cell wall and a nucleus."
