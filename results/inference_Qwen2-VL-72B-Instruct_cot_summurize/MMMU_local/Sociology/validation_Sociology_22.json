The Cultural Universal Pyramid typically includes various aspects of human culture that are common across different societies.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Religion - This is a fundamental aspect of many cultures and is often included in cultural studies.\nB. Prohibition against incest - This is a universal taboo found in nearly all human societies.\nC. Family - This is a basic social unit present in all known human societies.\nD. Media - While media is an important part of modern cultures, it is not necessarily a universal aspect of all human societies throughout history.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nD.
