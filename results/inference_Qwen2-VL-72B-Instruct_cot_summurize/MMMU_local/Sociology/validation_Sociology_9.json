A sociologist who studies that movement by examining the interactions between members at Occupy camps would most likely use what theoretical approach?\n\nA. symbolic interactionism\nB. functionalism\nC. conflict theory\nD. ethnocentrism\n"

It examines the micro-level interactions and how individuals construct their reality through these interactions.\n\nB. **Functionalism**: This approach looks at how different parts of society work together to maintain stability and order. It focuses on the functions and dysfunctions of various social institutions.\n\nC. **Conflict Theory**: This approach emphasizes the role of power and inequality in society. It focuses on how conflicts arise from the struggle for resources and power among different groups.\n\nD. **Ethnocentrism**: This term refers to the belief in the inherent superiority of one's own culture or group over others. It is not a theoretical approach but rather a concept related to cultural bias.\n\nGiven that the Occupy Wall Street movement is centered around issues of economic disparity and the struggle against the power dynamics between different economic classes, the most appropriate theoretical approach for studying this movement would be:\n\n**C. Conflict Theory**\n\nThis approach aligns well with the movement's focus on power struggles and inequalities, making it the most suitable choice for analyzing the interactions within the Occupy camps."
