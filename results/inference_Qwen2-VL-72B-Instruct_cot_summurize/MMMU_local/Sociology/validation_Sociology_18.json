This book discusses the concept of double-consciousness, which is a term coined by W.E.B. Du Bois.\n\nW.E.B. Du Bois' concept of double-consciousness refers to the particular experience of African Americans where they are forced to see themselves through two lenses: their own self-perception and the perception of them by white society. This dual identity creates a sense of being divided between an American identity and an African American identity.\n\nGiven this context, the correct answer to your question is:\n\nD.
