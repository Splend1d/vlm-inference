A dual labor market typically refers to a situation where there are two distinct segments of the workforce: one segment with high-skilled, well-paid jobs and another segment with low-skilled, poorly paid jobs.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Job opportunities are increasing for highly skilled jobs.**\n   - This suggests that there is a growing demand for high-skilled workers, which is a characteristic of one segment of a dual labor market.\n\nB. **Job opportunities are decreasing for mid-level jobs.**\n   - This indicates that the middle ground of the labor market is shrinking, which can be seen as evidence of a dual labor market where jobs are polarizing into high- and low-skill categories.\n\nC. **Highly skilled jobs pay better than low-skill jobs.**\n   - This is generally true but does not specifically indicate a dual labor market structure. It simply states an obvious fact about wage differentials.\n\nD. **Women tend to make less than men do for the same job.**\n   - This points to gender wage disparity, which is a separate issue from the structure of the labor market itself.\n\nGiven the context of a dual labor market, the most direct evidence is provided by option B, which shows a decrease in mid-level job opportunities, indicating a polarization of the labor market into high- and low-skill segments.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nB. Job opportunities are decreasing for mid-level jobs."
