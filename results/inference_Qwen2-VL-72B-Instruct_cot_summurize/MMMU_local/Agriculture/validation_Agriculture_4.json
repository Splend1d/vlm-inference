Among the options provided:\n\n- **A. Mineral deficiency**: This would typically show symptoms in the leaves, such as discoloration or abnormal growth patterns, which are not evident here.\n- **B. Nematode attack**: Nematodes can cause poor root development and stunted growth, which aligns with the observed sparse roots.\n- **C. Don't know and don't want to guess**: This is not a helpful answer.\n- **D. There is no problem**: The sparse roots suggest there is an issue.\n- **E. Pot bound**: This occurs when roots fill the pot and become tangled, restricting growth. However, the roots do not appear overly dense or tangled.\n\nBased on the analysis, the most likely issue is:\n\n**B. Nematode attack**"
