Don't know or not sure - This is a default option when there is no clear evidence.\nB. Repeated root damage by tractors in adjacent field (abiotic) - This could be a factor if there is agricultural activity nearby.\nC. Fungal dieback ('ash dieback') - Ash dieback is a known disease that affects ash trees, causing them to wither and die.\nD. Air pollution damage - Air pollution can affect trees, but it usually causes more generalized symptoms rather than localized withering.\nE. Combination of fungal and abiotic dieback - This suggests multiple factors contributing to the tree's condition.\n\nGiven the context of the image and the options, the most likely cause is:\n\nC. Fungal dieback ('ash dieback')\n\nAsh dieback is a common issue affecting ash trees, and it typically causes the symptoms observed in the image."
