It can often be seen on the leaves of plants infested with these insects.\n\nD. **Gummosis-produced resin**: Gummosis is a disease that affects citrus trees, causing them to produce a gum-like substance. This resin is usually more noticeable on the bark and stems rather than the leaves.\n\nE. **Bacterial ooze**: Bacterial ooze is a slimy substance produced by some bacterial infections in plants. It is usually associated with diseases like fire blight and can appear on leaves, but it is less common than honey dew.\n\nGiven the appearance of the substance in the image, which looks like small droplets or a sticky film, the most likely answer is:\n\nC. Honey dew"
