The question asks whether a native willow produces more unusual growth and abundant branches from its trunk.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nA. Biotic\n\nThis is because the growth of a tree, including the production of branches, is influenced by biological factors such as genetics, environmental conditions, and the tree's natural growth patterns. These are all biotic factors."
