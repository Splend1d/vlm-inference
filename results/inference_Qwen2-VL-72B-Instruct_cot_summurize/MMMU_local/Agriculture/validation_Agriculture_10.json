Sclerotia: These are hardened masses of fungal mycelium that can survive adverse conditions and later produce spores.\n\nB. Cysts: These are structures produced by some nematodes (roundworms) that contain eggs or juveniles.\n\nC. Eggs: These could be eggs of various organisms, such as insects or nematodes.\n\nD. Galls: These are abnormal growths on plants caused by parasites like insects or fungi.\n\nGiven the context of the image and the fact that they are connected to the roots of the potato, the most likely answer is:\n\nB. Cysts\n\nThese yellow spheres are likely cysts produced by nematodes, which are common pests in potato roots."
