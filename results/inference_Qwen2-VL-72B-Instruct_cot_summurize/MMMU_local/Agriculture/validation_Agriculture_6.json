Macro-fauna: These are large soil organisms that are visible to the naked eye, such as earthworms and insects.\n\nB. Micro-fauna: These are small soil organisms that are not visible to the naked eye, such as nematodes and protozoa.\n\nC. Meso-fauna: These are medium-sized soil organisms that are visible to the naked eye but smaller than macro-fauna, such as mites and springtails.\n\nD. Micro-flora: These are microscopic plants or plant-like organisms, such as bacteria and fungi.\n\nThe organism in the image appears to be an earthworm, which is a type of macro-fauna.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nA.
