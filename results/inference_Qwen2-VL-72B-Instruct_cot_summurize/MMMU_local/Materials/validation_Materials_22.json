The forces at joint F are:\n   - Vertical force (800 lb) at F.\n   - Horizontal force (400 lb) at F.\n\n   Since the truss is symmetric, the vertical force will be equally distributed between members BF and CF. Therefore, each member will have a vertical force of 400 lb.\n\n   The horizontal force of 400 lb will be resisted by member BC.\n\n2. **Resolve Forces at Joint B:**\n\n   At joint B, the forces are:\n   - Horizontal force from AB (400 lb).\n   - Vertical force from BF (400 lb).\n   - Resultant force in BC.\n\n   Using trigonometry, we can resolve the forces:\n   - The angle between AB and BC is 30\u00b0.\n   - The angle between BF and BC is 60\u00b0.\n\n   The force in BC can be found using the law of cosines:\n   \\[\n   F_{BC} = \\sqrt{(400)^2 + (400)^2 - 2 \\times 400 \\times 400 \\cos(120\u00b0)}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   F_{BC} = \\sqrt{160000 + 160000 + 160000}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   F_{BC} = \\sqrt{480000}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   F_{BC} = 692.82 \\text{ lb}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the Cross-Sectional Area:**\n\n   Given the allowable normal stress (\\(\\sigma_{\\text{allow}} = 24 \\text{ ksi}\\)):\n   \\[\n   \\sigma = \\frac{F}{A}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   A = \\frac{F}{\\sigma}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   A = \\frac{692.82 \\text{ lb}}{24 \\text{ ksi}}\n   \\]\n   Convert ksi to psi (1 ksi = 1000 psi):\n   \\[\n   A = \\frac{692.82 \\text{ lb}}{24 \\times 1000 \\text{ psi}}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   A = \\frac{692.82}{24000}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   A = 0.02887 \\text{ in}^2\n   \\]\n\nThe closest option to this calculated value is:\n\nB. 0.0252 in^2"
