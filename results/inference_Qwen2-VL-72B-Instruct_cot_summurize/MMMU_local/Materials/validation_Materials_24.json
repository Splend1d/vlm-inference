The distances between the atoms are given as \\(a\\sqrt{2}\\) and \\(a\\sqrt{3}\\), which suggest that this is a face-centered cubic (FCC) lattice.\n\nIn an FCC lattice:\n- The {100} plane corresponds to a square arrangement of atoms.\n- The {110} plane corresponds to a rectangular arrangement with sides in the ratio \\(\\sqrt{2}:1\\).\n- The {111} plane corresponds to a hexagonal close-packed arrangement.\n\nGiven the distances \\(a\\sqrt{2}\\) and \\(a\\sqrt{3}\\), the {110} plane is the most likely candidate because it involves diagonal distances in a square lattice, which aligns with the distances shown in the image.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is:\n\nF.
