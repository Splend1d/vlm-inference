This means that the internal normal force (Na) must also be zero because the member is in equilibrium.\n\nThe shear force (Va) can be determined by considering the component of the force perpendicular to the section a-a. However, since the forces are applied along the centroidal axis and are equal and opposite, there is no net shear force acting on the member.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC.
