                    "text": "To determine which schematic correctly depicts the phenomenon of dispersion within the glass, we need to understand how different frequencies of light behave when they pass through a medium like borosilicate glass.\n\nDispersion occurs because different frequencies of light travel at different speeds through the medium. In general, higher frequency light (such as blue light) travels more slowly than lower frequency light (such as red light). This means that blue light will refract more than red light when passing from one medium to another.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. <image 1> shows green light and red light entering the glass. Green light has a shorter wavelength and higher frequency than red light. According to the principles of dispersion, green light should refract more than red light. However, in this image, both colors appear to refract equally, which is incorrect.\n\nB. <image 2> shows blue light and red light entering the glass. Blue light has a higher frequency than red light and should refract more. In this image, blue light does refract more than red light, which is consistent with the principle of dispersion.\n\nC. <image 3> shows green light and red light entering the glass. Similar to option A, green light should refract more than red light, but in this image, both colors appear to refract equally, which is incorrect.\n\nD. <image 4> shows green light and blue light entering the glass. Both colors are shown to refract equally, which is incorrect according to the principle of dispersion.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct depiction of dispersion is shown in option B.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nB. <image 2>"
