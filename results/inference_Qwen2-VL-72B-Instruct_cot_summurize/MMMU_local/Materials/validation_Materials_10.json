Generally, smaller grain sizes lead to higher yield strengths due to the Hall-Petch relationship, which states that the yield strength increases as the grain size decreases.\n\nLet's analyze the images:\n\n- **Image A** shows the largest grain size.\n- **Image B** shows a medium grain size.\n- **Image C** shows a smaller grain size than Image B but larger than Image D.\n- **Image D** shows the smallest grain size.\n\nGiven that smaller grain sizes result in higher yield strengths, the structure with the largest grain size will have the lowest yield stress.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. <image 1>"
