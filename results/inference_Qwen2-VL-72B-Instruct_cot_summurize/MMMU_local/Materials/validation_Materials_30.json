It seems there might be an error in the interpretation or calculation. Let's re-evaluate the problem considering the given options:\n\nGiven the options:\nA. 0.00443 mm/mm\nB. 0.00803 mm/mm\nC. 0.00543 mm/mm\nD. 0.00884 mm/mm\n\nSince the direct calculation does not match any of these, let's consider if there's another way to interpret the problem. The displacement of 5 mm is given horizontally, but the strain calculation should consider the actual deformation along the x-axis. Given the geometry and the displacement, the correct interpretation might involve the projection of the displacement onto the x-axis.\n\nHowever, based on the direct calculation and the given options, it appears there might be an error in the question or the options provided. Given the direct calculation, the closest option would be:\n\nC. 0.00543 mm/mm\n\nBut this is still not an exact match. Therefore, the most accurate answer based on the direct calculation is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{0.00625 \\text{ mm/mm}}\n\\]\n\nThis value is not listed among the provided options, indicating a potential discrepancy in the question or the options."
