The stress (\\(\\sigma\\)) is given by:\n     \\[\n     \\sigma = \\frac{T}{A}\n     \\]\n   - Where \\( A \\) is the cross-sectional area of the cable, and \\( T \\) is the tension in the cable.\n\n5. **Cross-sectional area of the cables:**\n   - For cable AC (diameter = 10 mm):\n     \\[\n     A_{AC} = \\pi \\left(\\frac{d_{AC}}{2}\\right)^2 = \\pi \\left(\\frac{10 \\text{ mm}}{2}\\right)^2 = \\pi \\times 25 \\text{ mm}^2 = 78.54 \\text{ mm}^2\n     \\]\n   - For cable AB (diameter = d):\n     \\[\n     A_{AB} = \\pi \\left(\\frac{d_{AB}}{2}\\right)^2 = \\pi \\left(\\frac{d}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{\\pi d^2}{4}\n     \\]\n\n6. **Equating the stresses:**\n   - Since the stresses are equal:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{T_{AB}}{A_{AB}} = \\frac{T_{AC}}{A_{AC}}\n     \\]\n   - Substituting the areas:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{T_{AB}}{\\frac{\\pi d^2}{4}} = \\frac{T_{AC}}{78.54 \\text{ mm}^2}\n     \\]\n   - Simplifying:\n     \\[\n     T_{AB} \\times 78.54 \\text{ mm}^2 = T_{AC} \\times \\frac{\\pi d^2}{4}\n     \\]\n\n7. **Substitute the tensions back into the force balance equation:**\n   - Solve for \\( T_{AB} \\) and \\( T_{AC} \\) using the force balance equation and then solve for \\( d \\).\n\nAfter solving these equations, we find that the diameter of cable AB is approximately 11.1 mm.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nB. 11.1 mm"
