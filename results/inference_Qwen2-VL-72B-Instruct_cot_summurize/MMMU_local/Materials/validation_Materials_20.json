The deformed length \\(L\\) of side AD (after deformation) is given by the distance between points A and D, which is 403 mm.\n\nThus, the change in length \\(\\Delta L\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta L = L - L_0 = 403 \\text{ mm} - 400 \\text{ mm} = 3 \\text{ mm}\n\\]\n\nNow, we can calculate the normal strain:\n\n\\[\n\\varepsilon = \\frac{\\Delta L}{L_0} = \\frac{3 \\text{ mm}}{400 \\text{ mm}} = 0.0075 \\text{ mm/mm}\n\\]\n\nHowever, none of the provided options match this value exactly. It seems there might be a misunderstanding or misinterpretation in the question or the options provided.
