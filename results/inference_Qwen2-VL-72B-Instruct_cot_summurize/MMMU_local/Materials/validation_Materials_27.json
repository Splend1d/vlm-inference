The shear force acts over the area where the wood is in contact with the metal, which is the side area of the wooden specimen:\n\\[ A_{shear} = 4 \\text{ in.} \\times 1 \\text{ in.} = 4 \\text{ in.}^2 \\]\n\nThe shear stress (\\(\\tau\\)) can be calculated as the force divided by the shear area:\n\\[ \\tau = \\frac{P}{A_{shear}} = \\frac{16000 \\text{ lb}}{4 \\text{ in.}^2} = 4000 \\text{ psi} \\]\n\nHowever, this calculation assumes that the entire force is transferred through the shear area, which is not correct. The correct approach is to recognize that the shear stress is distributed over the entire cross-sectional area of the wood, not just the side area.\n\nSince the force is uniformly distributed over the entire cross-sectional area of the wood, the shear stress should be considered over the entire area of the wood:\n\\[ A_{total} = 4 \\text{ in.} \\times 2 \\text{ in.} = 8 \\text{ in.}^2 \\]\n\nThus, the correct shear stress is:\n\\[ \\tau = \\frac{P}{A_{total}} = \\frac{16000 \\text{ lb}}{8 \\text{ in.}^2} = 2000 \\text{ psi} \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nA. 200 psi"
