The shear strain (\\(\\gamma\\)) is given by the ratio of the displacement (\\(\\delta\\)) to the height (h) of the block:\n\n\\[\n\\gamma = \\frac{\\delta}{h}\n\\]\n\nGiven:\n- Displacement (\\(\\delta\\)) = 2 mm = 0.002 m\n- Height (h) = 200 mm = 0.2 m\n\nSo,\n\\[\n\\gamma = \\frac{0.002}{0.2} = 0.01\n\\]\n\nThe shear stress (\\(\\tau\\)) is given by the ratio of the applied force (P) to the area (A) over which the force is applied. The area (A) is the product of the width (w) and the height (h):\n\n\\[\nA = w \\times h = 100 \\text{ mm} \\times 200 \\text{ mm} = 0.1 \\text{ m} \\times 0.2 \\text{ m} = 0.02 \\text{ m}^2\n\\]\n\nThe shear stress (\\(\\tau\\)) is:\n\\[\n\\tau = \\frac{P}{A} = \\frac{2 \\text{ kN}}{0.02 \\text{ m}^2} = \\frac{2000 \\text{ N}}{0.02 \\text{ m}^2} = 100000 \\text{ Pa} = 100 \\text{ kPa}\n\\]\n\nThe shear modulus (G) is related to the shear stress (\\(\\tau\\)) and the shear strain (\\(\\gamma\\)) by the equation:\n\n\\[\nG = \\frac{\\tau}{\\gamma}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the values we have:\n\\[\nG = \\frac{100 \\text{ kPa}}{0.01} = 10000 \\text{ kPa} = 10 \\text{ MPa}\n\\]\n\nHowever, this result does not match any of the provided options. It seems there might be an error in the calculation or the interpretation of the problem. Let's re-evaluate the steps:\n\n1. Shear strain (\\(\\gamma\\)) = 0.01\n2. Shear stress (\\(\\tau\\)) = 100 kPa\n3. Shear modulus (G) = \\(\\frac{\\tau}{\\gamma}\\)\n\nRe-calculating with the correct units:\n\\[\nG = \\frac{100 \\text{ kPa}}{0.01} = 10000 \\text{ kPa} = 10 \\text{ MPa}\n\\]\n\nIt appears there is a discrepancy in the provided options. Based on the calculations, the closest option would be:\n\nB. 5 MPa\n\nHowever, this is not an exact match. The correct calculation leads to 10 MPa, which is not listed among the options. There might be an error in the question or the options provided."
