Therefore, the distance from the neutral axis to point B is:\n   \\[\n   y = \\frac{h}{2} = \\frac{50 \\text{ mm}}{2} = 25 \\text{ mm}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the Bending Moment (M):**\n   The force \\( P \\) acts at a distance of 600 mm from the section \\( a-a \\). Therefore, the bending moment \\( M \\) is:\n   \\[\n   M = P \\times d = 3 \\text{ kN} \\times 600 \\text{ mm} = 3000 \\text{ N} \\times 600 \\text{ mm} = 1800000 \\text{ N-mm}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the Bending Stress (\\(\\sigma\\)):**\n   The bending stress formula is:\n   \\[\n   \\sigma = \\frac{My}{I}\n   \\]\n   Substituting the values:\n   \\[\n   \\sigma = \\frac{1800000 \\text{ N-mm} \\times 25 \\text{ mm}}{260416.67 \\text{ mm}^4} = \\frac{45000000}{260416.67} \\approx 172.8 \\text{ MPa}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the bending stress developed at point B of the cross-section at section \\( a-a \\) is approximately 172.8 MPa.\n\nNone of the provided options match this calculated value. It seems there might be an error in the question or the options provided. Based on the calculation, the correct answer should be around 172.8 MPa, but since this option is not listed, it's important to double-check the calculations and the given options."
