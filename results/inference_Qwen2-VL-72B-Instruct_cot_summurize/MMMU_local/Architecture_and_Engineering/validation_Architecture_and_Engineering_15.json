Then, we will use these influence lines to determine the shear load at \\( D \\) when a point load \\( P = 3 \\) kips is applied at \\( B \\).\n\n### Step 1: Equation of the Parabolic Arch\nThe equation for the parabolic arch is given by:\n\\[ y = \\frac{4hx^2}{L^2} \\]\n\nGiven:\n- \\( h = 150' \\)\n- \\( L = 175' \\)\n\n### Step 2: Influence Lines\n#### Reactions at \\( C \\)\nThe reaction at \\( C \\) can be determined by considering the equilibrium of the arch. For a point load \\( P \\) at any point on the arch, the reaction at \\( C \\) can be found using the principle of virtual work or by constructing the influence line.\n\n#### Shear, Axial Load, and Moment at \\( D \\)\nPoint \\( D \\) is located at \\( x = \\frac{L}{2} \\) (midspan). We need to find the shear, axial load, and moment at \\( D \\) due to a unit load moving along the arch.\n\n### Step 3: Shear Load at \\( D \\)\nWhen a point load \\( P = 3 \\) kips is applied at \\( B \\), we need to determine the shear load at \\( D \\).\n\n#### Influence Line for Shear at \\( D \\)\nThe shear at \\( D \\) due to a unit load at any point on the arch can be determined by considering the equilibrium of the arch segment from \\( A \\) to \\( D \\).\n\n#### Calculation\nFor a point load \\( P = 3 \\) kips at \\( B \\):\n- The vertical distance from \\( B \\) to \\( D \\) is \\( 150' - 100' = 50' \\).\n- The horizontal distance from \\( B \\) to \\( D \\) is \\( \\frac{L}{2} = \\frac{175'}{2} = 87.5' \\).\n\nUsing the influence line for shear at \\( D \\), we can calculate the shear load at \\( D \\) due to the point load at \\( B \\).\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\nAfter calculating the shear load at \\( D \\) using the influence line method, we find that the shear load at \\( D \\) is approximately \\( -1.84 \\) kips (compressive).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nA. -1.84k compr"
