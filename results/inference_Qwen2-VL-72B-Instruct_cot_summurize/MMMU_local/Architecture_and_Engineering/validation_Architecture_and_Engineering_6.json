If the overlap is 60%, then the non-overlapping part is 40% of the print size.\n   - The non-overlapping part of the print size is:\n     \\[\n     0.4 \\times 250 \\text{ mm} = 100 \\text{ mm}\n     \\]\n\n   - Since the scale of the photograph is \\( 1 \\text{ cm} = 75 \\text{ m} \\), convert the non-overlapping part to meters:\n     \\[\n     100 \\text{ mm} = 10 \\text{ cm} = 10 \\times 75 \\text{ m} = 750 \\text{ m}\n     \\]\n\n   - Therefore, the length of the air base is 750 m.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe correct answer is not listed among the options provided. However, based on the calculations:\n- The scale of the photographs is \\( 1 \\text{ cm} = 75 \\text{ m} \\).\n- The length of the air base is 750 m.\n\nGiven the options, none of them match the calculated values. It seems there might be an error in the provided options or in the interpretation of the problem statement."
