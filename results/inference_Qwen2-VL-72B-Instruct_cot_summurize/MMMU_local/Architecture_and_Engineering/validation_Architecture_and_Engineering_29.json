The tacheometric formula is given by:\n\n\\[ D = K \\cdot \\frac{f_1 + f_2}{m} \\]\n\\[ h = (K \\cdot \\frac{f_1 - f_2}{m}) + C \\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( D \\) is the horizontal distance between points P and Q.\n- \\( h \\) is the difference in elevation between points P and Q.\n- \\( K \\) is the multiplying constant (100 in this case).\n- \\( C \\) is the additive constant (0 in this case).\n- \\( f_1 \\) and \\( f_2 \\) are the staff readings at points P and Q, respectively.\n- \\( m \\) is the mean of the staff readings.\n\nFirst, calculate the mean of the staff readings at each point:\n\\[ m_P = \\frac{1.255 + 1.810 + 2.365}{3} = \\frac{5.430}{3} = 1.810 \\]\n\\[ m_Q = \\frac{1.300 + 2.120 + 2.940}{3} = \\frac{6.360}{3} = 2.120 \\]\n\nNext, calculate the horizontal distance \\( D \\):\n\\[ D = K \\cdot \\frac{f_1 + f_2}{m} = 100 \\cdot \\frac{1.810 + 2.120}{2} = 100 \\cdot \\frac{3.930}{2} = 100 \\cdot 1.965 = 196.5 \\text{ meters} \\]\n\nNow, calculate the difference in elevation \\( h \\):\n\\[ h = (K \\cdot \\frac{f_1 - f_2}{m}) + C = 100 \\cdot \\frac{1.810 - 2.120}{2} + 0 = 100 \\cdot \\frac{-0.310}{2} = 100 \\cdot (-0.155) = -15.5 \\text{ meters} \\]\n\nThe gradient is given by:\n\\[ \\text{Gradient} = \\frac{\\text{Elevation difference}}{\\text{Horizontal distance}} = \\frac{-15.5}{196.5} \\approx -0.0789 \\]\n\nTo express the gradient as \"1 in \\( x \\)\" where \\( x \\) is the horizontal distance corresponding to a 1 meter fall:\n\\[ x = \\frac{1}{\\text{Gradient}} = \\frac{1}{-0.0789} \\approx -12.67 \\]\n\nSince the gradient is negative, it indicates a fall. Therefore, the gradient is approximately 1 in 12.67 meters fall.\n\nHowever, none of the provided options match this calculation. It seems there might be an error in the interpretation or calculation. Given the options provided, the closest match would be:\n\nB. Gradient = 1 in 33.95 m fall\n\nBut based on the calculations, the correct answer should be around 1 in 12.67 meters fall. Please verify the problem statement or the options provided."
