Let's assume the reserve requirement ratio is \\( r \\).\n\nGiven the initial balance sheet:\n- Reserves: $493\n- Deposits: $2900\n\nThe required reserves before the new deposit are:\n\\[ \\text{Required Reserves} = r \\times \\text{Deposits} = r \\times 2900 \\]\n\nAfter the new deposit:\n- New Deposits: $2900 + 700 = $3600\n- New Required Reserves: \\( r \\times 3600 \\)\n\nThe excess reserves after the new deposit are:\n\\[ \\text{Excess Reserves} = \\text{New Reserves} - \\text{New Required Reserves} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Excess Reserves} = (493 + 700) - (r \\times 3600) \\]\n\\[ \\text{Excess Reserves} = 1193 - (r \\times 3600) \\]\n\nFor the minimum increase in the money supply, we assume the bank lends out all its excess reserves. The money multiplier \\( m \\) is given by:\n\\[ m = \\frac{1}{r} \\]\n\nThe maximum increase in the money supply due to lending out excess reserves is:\n\\[ \\Delta M = \\text{Excess Reserves} \\times m \\]\n\\[ \\Delta M = (1193 - (r \\times 3600)) \\times \\frac{1}{r} \\]\n\nHowever, since we are looking for the minimum increase, we consider the case where the bank does not lend out any excess reserves. In this scenario, the money supply increases only by the amount of the initial deposit.\n\nTherefore, the minimum amount by which the money supply will increase is:\n\\[ \\boxed{700} \\]\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nB. 700"
