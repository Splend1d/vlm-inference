The budget constraint line represents the trade-off between income and leisure time. The point where the budget constraint line intersects with an indifference curve indicates the optimal choice for the worker.\n\nIn this case:\n- Point 'a' is on the budget constraint line and corresponds to 24 hours of leisure time.\n- Point 'b' is on the same budget constraint line but at a different level of leisure time.\n\nSince point 'a' is on the budget constraint line and corresponds to 24 hours of leisure time, it suggests that the worker would choose to have 24 hours of leisure time.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nA. Leisure time is 24 hours."
