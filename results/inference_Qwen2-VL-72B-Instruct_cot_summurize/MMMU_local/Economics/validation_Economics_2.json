A price below that of 1.30 dollars would cause a situation of excess demand and hence a shortage.\n\nWhen the government sets a price cap below the equilibrium price (in this case, $1.30 per gallon), it creates a situation where the quantity demanded exceeds the quantity supplied at that price. This leads to a shortage, as consumers are willing to buy more gasoline at the lower price than producers are willing to sell."
