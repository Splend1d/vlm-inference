The consumption function is typically represented as:\n\n\\[ C = a + bY \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( C \\) is aggregate demand or consumption,\n- \\( a \\) is autonomous consumption (consumption when income \\( Y \\) is zero),\n- \\( b \\) is the marginal propensity to consume (the slope of the consumption function).\n\n1. **If \\( a \\) rises:**\n   - Autonomous consumption increases, which means that even at zero income, consumption will be higher. This will shift the entire consumption line upwards.\n\n2. **If \\( b \\) rises:**\n   - The marginal propensity to consume increases, meaning that for every unit increase in income, consumption increases by a larger amount. This will make the consumption line steeper.\n\nGiven these points, let's analyze the options:\n\nA. C shifts upwards.\n   - This is correct for an increase in \\( a \\), but it does not address the change in slope due to an increase in \\( b \\).\n\nB. (1)C shifts downwards. (2) C gets gentler.\n   - This is incorrect because an increase in \\( a \\) should shift the line upwards, not downwards, and an increase in \\( b \\) should make the line steeper, not gentler.\n\nC. (1)C gets steeper. (2) C gets gentler.\n   - This is incorrect because an increase in \\( a \\) does not affect the steepness of the line, and an increase in \\( b \\) should make the line steeper, not gentler.\n\nD. (1)C shifts downwards. (2) C gets steeper.\n   - This is incorrect because an increase in \\( a \\) should shift the line upwards, not downwards.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nA. C shifts upwards."
