The table shows the relationship between the price level and aggregate demand (AD) and aggregate supply (AS).\n\nThe equilibrium in an economy occurs where aggregate demand (AD) equals aggregate supply (AS). From the table:\n\n- At a price level of 80, AD = 850 and AS = 850.\n\nThis indicates that the economy is at equilibrium when the price level is 80. At this point, the quantity of goods and services demanded equals the quantity supplied.\n\nUnemployment is typically lower when an economy is at or near full employment, which is often associated with being at or near the equilibrium point on the aggregate demand and supply graph.\n\nGiven that the economy is at equilibrium at a price level of 80, it suggests that the economy is operating efficiently, and thus, the unemployment rate would likely be relatively low.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. the unemployment rate for this economy is low"
