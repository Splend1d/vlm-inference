Since our t-statistic (0.136) is much smaller than the critical value (-2), it does not fall into the rejection region.\n\nTherefore, the null hypothesis that the coefficient associated with a level C3 branch is equal to that of a C4 branch cannot be rejected at the 5% significance level.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nB. The null cannot be rejected at the 5% significance level."
