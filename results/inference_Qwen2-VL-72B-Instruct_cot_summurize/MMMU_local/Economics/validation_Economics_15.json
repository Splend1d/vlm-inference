This shift indicates an increase in the quantity of goods and services supplied at each price level.\n\nStructural unemployment is typically caused by long-term factors such as skill mismatches, technological changes, or institutional rigidities. A positive aggregate supply shock generally leads to lower prices and higher output levels, which can improve employment conditions.\n\nGiven the shift from SRAS1 to SRAS2:\n- The economy moves along the Aggregate Demand (AD) curve to a point with a lower price level and higher real GDP.\n- This increase in real GDP suggests that more goods and services are being produced, which typically leads to an increase in employment.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Structural unemployment decreased."
