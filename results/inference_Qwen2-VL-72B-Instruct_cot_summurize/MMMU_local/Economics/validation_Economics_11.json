The graph shows the average cost (AC) curve, which is downward sloping as quantity (Q) increases. This indicates that there are economies of scale, meaning that the average cost decreases as production increases.\n\nGiven this information, let's evaluate the options:\n\nA. **There are decreasing returns to scale well beyond the size of the market.**\n   - Decreasing returns to scale would imply that the average cost increases as production increases, which contradicts the downward-sloping AC curve in the graph. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\nB. **There are increasing returns to scale well beyond the size of the market.**\n   - Increasing returns to scale mean that the average cost decreases as production increases, which is consistent with the downward-sloping AC curve in the graph. This suggests that a single firm can produce at a lower average cost than multiple smaller firms, leading to a natural monopoly.\n\nC. **There are constant returns to scale well beyond the size of the market.**\n   - Constant returns to scale would imply that the average cost remains constant as production increases, which is not depicted by the downward-sloping AC curve in the graph. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n**B. There are increasing returns to scale well beyond the size of the market.**"
