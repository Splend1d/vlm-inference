The required reserves increase by \\( r \\times 700 \\).\n\n3. **Excess Reserves**: The excess reserves increase by \\( 700 - (r \\times 700) = 700(1 - r) \\).\n\n4. **Lending**: With the increased excess reserves, the bank can lend out \\( 700(1 - r) \\).\n\n5. **Money Multiplier**: The money multiplier is given by \\( \\frac{1}{r} \\). The total change in the money supply due to the initial deposit is calculated using the money multiplier formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total Change in Money Supply} = \\text{Initial Deposit} \\times \\text{Money Multiplier} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Total Change in Money Supply} = 700 \\times \\frac{1}{r} \\]\n\nGiven that the options provided do not directly match this calculation, we need to find the correct value based on the options provided.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n\n- A. $4118\n- B. $3418\n- C. $700\n- D. $5118\n\nSince the question does not provide the reserve requirement ratio \\( r \\), we cannot directly calculate the exact value. However, we can infer that the correct answer should be significantly larger than the initial deposit of $700 because the money multiplier effect amplifies the initial deposit.\n\nAmong the options, $5118 is the largest value and seems most plausible given the money multiplier effect.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. $5118"
