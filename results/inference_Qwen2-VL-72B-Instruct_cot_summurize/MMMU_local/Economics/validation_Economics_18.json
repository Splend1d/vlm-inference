Shifts in LRAS are typically caused by changes in the quantity or quality of inputs such as labor, capital, and technology.\n\nGiven the options:\n\nA. Increase in capital.\nB. Decrease in labor.\nC. Decrease in human capital.\n\nAn increase in capital (option A) would likely lead to an increase in the economy's productive capacity, shifting the LRAS curve to the right. This is because more capital allows for greater production at each price level.\n\nDecreases in labor (option B) or human capital (option C) would reduce the economy's productive capacity, shifting the LRAS curve to the left.\n\nSince the LRAS curve shifts from LRAS1 to LRAS2, which is to the right, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Increase in capital."
