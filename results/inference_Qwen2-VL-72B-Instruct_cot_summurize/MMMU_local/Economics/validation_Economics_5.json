                    "text": "To determine how an economy can return to long-run equilibrium after facing a boom, we need to analyze the graph and understand the roles of the Long-Run Aggregate Supply (LRAS), Short-Run Aggregate Supply (SRAS), and Aggregate Demand (AD) curves.\n\n1. **Understanding the Boom**: A boom in the economy typically means that the economy is producing above its potential output level. In the graph, this would be represented by a point where the economy is operating beyond the LRAS curve.\n\n2. **Role of Wages**: Wages play a crucial role in adjusting the economy back to long-run equilibrium. If wages are flexible, they can adjust to bring the economy back to its potential output level.\n\n3. **Adjustment Process**:\n   - **If Wages Rise**: If wages rise during a boom, the cost of production increases, which shifts the SRAS curve upward. This leads to higher prices and lower real output, eventually bringing the economy back to the LRAS curve.\n   - **If Wages Fall**: If wages fall, the cost of production decreases, which shifts the SRAS curve downward. However, this scenario is less likely during a boom because firms are typically willing to pay higher wages to meet increased demand.\n\nGiven the context of a boom and flexible wages, the correct adjustment mechanism is for wages to rise. This will shift the SRAS curve upward, leading to higher prices and lower real output, thus bringing the economy back to its long-run equilibrium.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Wages will rise."
