In the given table, the equilibrium occurs at a price of $6, where both the quantity demanded and quantity supplied are 81 pizzas.\n\n2. **Above Equilibrium Price**: If the actual price is above the equilibrium price (e.g., $7 or higher), the quantity supplied will be greater than the quantity demanded. This situation is known as an excess supply or surplus.\n\n3. **Excess Supply**: When there is excess supply, sellers will find it difficult to sell all their products at the current price. To clear the surplus, sellers will likely lower their prices to attract more buyers. This reduction in price will move the market back toward the equilibrium price.\n\nTherefore, if the actual price in this market were above the equilibrium price, excess supply would drive the market toward the equilibrium.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nA. excess supply"
