Curve 1 is vertical, indicating a natural rate of unemployment, while Curve 2 is downward sloping, representing the short-run Phillips curve where there is a trade-off between inflation and unemployment.\n\nIf the economy starts at point B on Curve 2, and the money supply growth rate increases, this typically leads to higher inflation in the short run. However, in the long run, the economy adjusts to the new level of money supply, and the unemployment rate returns to its natural rate (the vertical line at 6% in this case).\n\nGiven this, if the economy starts at point B and the money supply growth rate increases, in the long run, the economy will move along Curve 1 to a point with the same natural rate of unemployment but potentially higher inflation. This would be point D on Curve 1.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. moves to D."
