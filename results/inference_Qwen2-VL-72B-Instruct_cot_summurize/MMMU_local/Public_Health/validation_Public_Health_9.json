This is represented by the cell where both electronic colposcopy and TCT are negative for non-cervical lesions, which is 245.\n- False Positives (FP): These are the patients without cervical lesions who tested positive on electronic colposcopy. This is represented by the cell where electronic colposcopy is positive but TCT is negative for non-cervical lesions, which is 10.\n\nNow, we can calculate the specificity:\n\n\\[ \\text{Specificity} = \\frac{245}{245 + 10} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Specificity} = \\frac{245}{255} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Specificity} = 0.9607843137 \\]\n\nRounded to two decimal places, the specificity is approximately 0.96.\n\nHowever, this value is not listed among the options provided. It seems there might be an error in the interpretation or calculation based on the given options. Let's re-evaluate the options provided:\n\nA. 0.93\nB. 0.98\nC. 0.75\nD. 0.49\n\nGiven the calculation, the closest match to our calculated specificity (0.96) is option B (0.98).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. 0.98"
