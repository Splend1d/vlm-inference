Medical institutions were the main source of reported adverse reactions.**\n- From the data, medical institutions have 90,000 items out of a total of 120,000 reports. This means medical institutions account for \\( \\frac{90,000}{120,000} = 75\\% \\) of the reports.\n- Therefore, this statement is correct.\n\n**B. Chemical drugs caused the highest rate of adverse drug reactions in the province.**\n- Chemical drugs have 90,000 items out of a total of 120,000 reports. This means chemical drugs account for \\( \\frac{90,000}{120,000} = 75\\% \\) of the reports.\n- Therefore, this statement is correct.\n\n**C. Adverse reactions caused by Biological products need not be a concern.**\n- Biological products have 2,000 items out of a total of 120,000 reports. This means biological products account for \\( \\frac{2,000}{120,000} = 1.67\\% \\) of the reports.\n- While the percentage is low, it does not necessarily mean they need not be a concern. The absolute number (2,000) could still be significant depending on the context.\n- Therefore, this statement cannot be definitively concluded as correct based solely on the given data.\n\n**D. The province has a low incidence of serious adverse reactions.**\n- There are 9,000 serious adverse reaction reports out of a total of 120,000 reports. This means the incidence of serious adverse reactions is \\( \\frac{9,000}{120,000} = 7.5\\% \\).\n- Whether this is considered \"low\" depends on the context and comparison with other regions or standards. Without additional context, we cannot definitively conclude this statement as correct.\n- Therefore, this statement cannot be definitively concluded as correct based solely on the given data.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe correct statements based on the given data are:\n- A. Medical institutions were the main source of reported adverse reactions.\n- B. Chemical drugs caused the highest rate of adverse drug reactions in the province."
