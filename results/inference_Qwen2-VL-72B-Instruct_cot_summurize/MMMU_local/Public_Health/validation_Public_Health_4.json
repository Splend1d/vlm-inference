Ectoparasites are organisms that live on the surface of their host, rather than inside it.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Some viruses - Viruses typically infect cells and replicate inside them, so they are not considered ectoparasites.\n\nB. Some bacteria - Bacteria can be pathogens but are generally not classified as parasites unless they have a specific parasitic relationship with their host. Most bacteria do not fit the definition of ectoparasites.\n\nC. Some protozoa - Protozoa can be parasites, but they are usually endoparasites, living inside the host's body.\n\nD. Some insects - Insects such as ticks, fleas, and lice are classic examples of ectoparasites because they live on the surface of their hosts.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Some insects"
