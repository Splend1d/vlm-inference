Therefore, we need to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of the parallel test based on the given data.\n\nFirst, let's define the terms:\n- True Positive (TP): Cases where both tests are positive and the patient has cervical lesions.\n- False Negative (FN): Cases where both tests are negative but the patient has cervical lesions.\n- False Positive (FP): Cases where at least one test is positive but the patient does not have cervical lesions.\n- True Negative (TN): Cases where both tests are negative and the patient does not have cervical lesions.\n\nFrom the table:\n- TP = 70 (both tests positive and patient has cervical lesions)\n- FN = 15 (both tests negative but patient has cervical lesions)\n- FP = 10 + 220 + 25 = 255 (at least one test positive but patient does not have cervical lesions)\n- TN = 245 (both tests negative and patient does not have cervical lesions)\n\nNow, we can calculate the sensitivity and specificity of the parallel test:\n- Sensitivity = TP / (TP + FN) = 70 / (70 + 15) = 70 / 85 \u2248 0.8235\n- Specificity = TN / (TN + FP) = 245 / (245 + 255) = 245 / 500 = 0.49\n\nThe positive likelihood ratio (+LR) is calculated as:\n+LR = Sensitivity / (1 - Specificity) = 0.8235 / (1 - 0.49) = 0.8235 / 0.51 \u2248 1.61\n\nNone of the provided options match this exact value. However, the closest option is:\n\nA. 1.76\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. 1.76."
