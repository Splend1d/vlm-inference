To investigate whether this association also exists in the Chinese population, the University of Oxford (UK), in collaboration with Professor Li Liming's group at the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (CAMS), recruited 512,891 adults aged 30-79 years from 10 different regions of China (including five cities and five villages) between June 2004 and July 2008, to investigate the association between the use of fresh fruits and major cardiovascular diseases in the Chinese population. The study investigated the relationship between fresh fruit use and major cardiovascular diseases in the Chinese population. Five frequency criteria were set for the main exposure factor \"fruit intake\": \"never eat fruit\", \"once a month\", \"1-3 times a week\", \"4-6 times a week\", \"every day \", which were filled in by the respondents themselves.The primary cardiovascular disease death was used as the outcome event in this study. Survival and health status of all subjects were regularly reported to the disease surveillance system of the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and their data were checked against the health insurance records of the investigated subjects' localities and confirmed by the street or village committees. Coding was based on the 10th edition of the International Classification of Diseases.After 3.2 million person-years of follow-up, a total of 451,665 subjects completed the follow-up after excluding lost and ineligible subjects. Those who consumed fresh fruit daily were found to have a mean reduction in systolic blood pressure of about 4 mmHg, a reduction in blood glucose of about 0.5 mmol/L, a 40% reduction in the risk of cardiovascular death, and a 34%, 25%, and 36% reduction in the risk of major coronary heart disease events, ischemic strokes, and cerebral hemorrhages, respectively, when compared with those who consumed very little fresh fruit. Their fruit intake and cardiovascular disease profiles were shown in the table below.<image 1>What indicators were appropriate for describing the risk of morbidity in various groups of the population?\n\nA. point prevalence and period prevalence\nB. mortality rate and case fatality rate\nC. cumulative incidence and incidence density\nD.

This suggests that the study is likely longitudinal, tracking the incidence of CVD over time among different groups.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Point prevalence and period prevalence**: These measures describe the proportion of a population that has a condition at a specific point in time or over a defined period. They are not suitable for describing the risk of developing a new condition over time.\n\nB. **Mortality rate and case fatality rate**: Mortality rate describes the number of deaths in a population over a certain period, while case fatality rate is the proportion of deaths among individuals diagnosed with a specific disease. These are useful for understanding death rates but do not directly measure the incidence of new cases.\n\nC. **Cumulative incidence and incidence density**: Cumulative incidence measures the probability of developing a condition over a specified period, while incidence density (or incidence rate) measures the rate at which new cases occur in a population over time. These are appropriate for describing the risk of morbidity in various groups, as they focus on the development of new cases.\n\nD. **PYLL (Potential Years of Life Lost) and DALY (Disability-Adjusted Life Years)**: These are measures of the burden of disease, combining years of life lost due to premature mortality and years lived with disability. While informative, they are not direct measures of morbidity risk.\n\nGiven the context of the study and the data provided, the most appropriate indicators for describing the risk of morbidity in various groups of the population are:\n\n**C. Cumulative incidence and incidence density**\n\nThese measures directly relate to the incidence of new cases of CVD across different levels of fruit intake, making them the most suitable choice for this scenario."
