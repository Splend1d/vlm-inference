It seems there might have been a misunderstanding in the interpretation of the question or the data. Given the options provided, let's re-evaluate the choices:\n\n- Option A: 0.24%\n- Option B: 0.40%\n- Option C: 0.32%\n- Option D: 0.44%\n\nSince the calculated incidence rate of approximately 0.79% does not match any of the options, it suggests a potential error in the interpretation or the provided data. However, based on the closest match among the given options, the most reasonable choice would be:\n\n**Option B: 0.40%**\n\nThis is the closest value to our calculated incidence rate, considering the possible rounding or approximation errors in the provided options."
