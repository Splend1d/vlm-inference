Let's analyze the options:\n\nA. **Independent samples t-test**: This test is used to compare the means of two independent groups. It is not suitable for comparing proportions.\n\nB. **Fisher's Exact test**: This test is used to determine the significance of the association between two categorical variables, especially when sample sizes are small. It is appropriate for comparing proportions in a 2x2 contingency table.\n\nC. **Kappa**: This measure is used to assess the agreement between two raters beyond what would be expected by chance. It is not suitable for comparing proportions between groups.\n\nD. **McNemar's test**: This test is used for paired nominal data to determine whether the row and column marginal frequencies are equal. It is not suitable for comparing independent groups.\n\nGiven the nature of the data in the table, which involves comparing proportions of infections between two independent groups (Hospital A and Hospital B), the most appropriate test is:\n\n**B. Fisher's Exact test**\n\nThis test is particularly suitable because it can handle small sample sizes and is used for categorical data, making it the best choice for this scenario."
