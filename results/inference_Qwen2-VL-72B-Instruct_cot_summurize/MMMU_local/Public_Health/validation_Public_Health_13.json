The higher the percentage, the more likely it is that the food caused the illness.\n\nLet's calculate the percentage for each food:\n\n1. **Cold chicken**:\n   - Number of people who ate cold chicken: 86\n   - Number of people who got sick after eating cold chicken: 34\n   - Percentage of people who got sick: (34 / 86) * 100 \u2248 39.53%\n\n2. **Potato salad**:\n   - Number of people who ate potato salad: 54\n   - Number of people who got sick after eating potato salad: 38\n   - Percentage of people who got sick: (38 / 54) * 100 \u2248 70.37%\n\n3. **Egg sandwiches**:\n   - Number of people who ate egg sandwiches: 76\n   - Number of people who got sick after eating egg sandwiches: 40\n   - Percentage of people who got sick: (40 / 76) * 100 \u2248 52.63%\n\n4. **Fruit pie and cream**:\n   - Number of people who ate fruit pie and cream: 32\n   - Number of people who got sick after eating fruit pie and cream: 12\n   - Percentage of people who got sick: (12 / 32) * 100 \u2248 37.50%\n\n5. **Cheese**:\n   - Number of people who ate cheese: 48\n   - Number of people who got sick after eating cheese: 12\n   - Percentage of people who got sick: (12 / 48) * 100 = 25%\n\nBased on these calculations, the highest percentage of people who got sick after eating a particular food is for potato salad (70.37%). Therefore, the most likely cause of the outbreak of food poisoning is:\n\n**B. Potato salad**"
