It does not specifically emphasize feeling, intuition, imagination, and the supernatural.\n\nB. **Romanticism**: This movement emphasizes emotion, individualism, and admiration for the beauty of nature. It often includes elements of imagination and the supernatural.\n\nC. **Realism**: This movement focuses on depicting things as they are, without idealization or exaggeration. It does not typically emphasize the supernatural or strong emotions.\n\nD. **Transcendentalism**: This philosophical movement emphasizes the spiritual over the material world and the importance of intuition and personal insight. However, it is more focused on philosophy and less on art movements that value the supernatural in visual arts.\n\nGiven these descriptions, the group that most aligns with valuing feeling, intuition, imagination, and the supernatural is:\n\nB. Romanticism"
