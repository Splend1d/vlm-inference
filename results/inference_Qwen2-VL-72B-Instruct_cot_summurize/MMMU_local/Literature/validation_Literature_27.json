In literature or visual arts, it can refer to the juxtaposition of contrasting elements.\n- **Printmaking**: This is a process for creating art images by printing from a surface that has been prepared with ink or another medium.\n\nGiven the context of the question, which refers to \"Rosie's Walk,\" a children's book where the illustrations often tell a different story than the text, the term that best fits this description is:\n\n**C. Counterpoint**\n\nThis term accurately describes the juxtaposition of contrasting elements (text and illustration) telling different stories."
