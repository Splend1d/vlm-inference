The Mississippi River and Abraham Lincoln are mentioned.\n- This does not seem relevant to the scene depicted in the image or the story \"Thank You, Ma'am.\"\n\nB. The writer compares a lost dream to a dried up raisin.\n- This is a quote from Langston Hughes' poem \"Dream Deferred,\" but it is not directly related to the story \"Thank You, Ma'am.\"\n\nC. The writer uses images from nature in the cold dessert.\n- This does not seem relevant to the scene or the story.\n\nD. The would-be-thief was motivated by blue suede shoes.\n- In \"Thank You, Ma'am,\" the boy attempts to steal the woman's purse because he wants money to buy blue suede shoes.\n\nBased on this analysis, the best option that relates to the story \"Thank You, Ma'am\" is:\n\nD. The would-be-thief was motivated by blue suede shoes."
