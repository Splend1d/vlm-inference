Legends - Legends are traditional stories that are believed to have a historical basis but are not necessarily true. They often involve heroic deeds and are passed down through generations.\n\nB. Fractured Folktales - Fractured Folktales are a type of storytelling where traditional folktales are retold with a modern or humorous twist, often involving anachronistic elements or a different perspective on the original story.\n\nC. Humorous Tale - A humorous tale is simply a story intended to be funny, but it does not necessarily involve retelling a traditional folktale.\n\nD. Retold Tale - A retold tale is a story that has been rewritten or reimagined, but this term is more general and does not specifically imply a contemporary twist or a new perspective.\n\nGiven the context of works like 'There's a Wolf at the Door' and 'The Adventures of the Dish and the Spoon', which involve traditional stories told from a new or humorous perspective, the most appropriate term is:\n\nB.
