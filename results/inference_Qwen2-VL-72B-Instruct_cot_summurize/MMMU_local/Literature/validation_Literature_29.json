This typically corresponds to the \"falling action\" in a plot diagram.\n\nHere is the breakdown of the plot elements:\n\n- **Exposition**: The introduction of characters, setting, and basic situation.\n- **Rising Action**: The development of the conflict and tension.\n- **Climax**: The peak of the story where the conflict reaches its highest point.\n- **Falling Action**: The events that follow the climax, leading to the resolution.\n\nGiven that the arrow points downward after the peak (climax), it indicates the \"falling action.\"\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. falling action"
