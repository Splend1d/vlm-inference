The critical path determines the minimum time required to complete the project.\n\nFirst, let's list the activities and their immediate predecessors:\n\n- A (no predecessor)\n- B (no predecessor)\n- C (no predecessor)\n- D (predecessor A)\n- E (predecessor B)\n- F (predecessor C)\n- G (predecessors D and E)\n\nNext, we calculate the earliest start time (EST) and earliest finish time (EFT) for each activity:\n\n1. Activity A:\n   - EST = 0 (since it has no predecessor)\n   - EFT = EST + Normal Time = 0 + 3 = 3 weeks\n\n2. Activity B:\n   - EST = 0 (since it has no predecessor)\n   - EFT = EST + Normal Time = 0 + 2 = 2 weeks\n\n3. Activity C:\n   - EST = 0 (since it has no predecessor)\n   - EFT = EST + Normal Time = 0 + 1 = 1 week\n\n4. Activity D:\n   - EST = EFT of A = 3 weeks\n   - EFT = EST + Normal Time = 3 + 7 = 10 weeks\n\n5. Activity E:\n   - EST = EFT of B = 2 weeks\n   - EFT = EST + Normal Time = 2 + 6 = 8 weeks\n\n6. Activity F:\n   - EST = EFT of C = 1 week\n   - EFT = EST + Normal Time = 1 + 2 = 3 weeks\n\n7. Activity G:\n   - EST = Maximum of EFT of D and E = Max(10, 8) = 10 weeks\n   - EFT = EST + Normal Time = 10 + 4 = 14 weeks\n\nThe critical path is the sequence of activities that takes the longest time. In this case, the critical path is A \u2192 D \u2192 G, which takes 14 weeks.\n\nTherefore, the project completion date is 14 weeks.\n\nNone of the provided options (A, B, C, D) directly state the project completion date as 14 weeks. However, the correct answer based on the calculations is:\n\nThe project completion date is 14 weeks."
