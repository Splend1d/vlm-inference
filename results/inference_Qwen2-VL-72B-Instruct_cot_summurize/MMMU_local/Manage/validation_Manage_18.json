The left side of the image shows soldiers in a muddy, chaotic battlefield, labeled \"THE PITY OF WAR.\"\n2. The right side shows a military officer holding a map with a planned strategy, labeled \"DESIGNED STRATEGY.\"\n3. The officer is saying, \"AND THROUGH THE HOLE WE SHALL RIDE TO GLORY,\" which suggests an unrealistic or overly optimistic plan.\n4. The map and the actual battlefield conditions are vastly different.\n\nGiven this analysis, the mismatch being illustrated is between the abstract planning (the designed strategy) and the harsh realities of the actual battlefield conditions.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. A catastrophic mismatch between abstract thinking and actual terrain"
