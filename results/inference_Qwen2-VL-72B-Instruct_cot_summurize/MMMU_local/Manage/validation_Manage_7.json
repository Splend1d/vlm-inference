This is a direct result of sustaining innovation.\n\nB. **This product has ongoing sales value**: Innovation can indeed maintain or increase the sales value of a product over time, especially if it continues to meet or exceed customer expectations.\n\nC. **Customers are overserved**: This occurs when the product exceeds the needs and desires of the customers, often leading to a situation where the product becomes too complex or expensive for the average customer. This is a common outcome of sustaining innovation.\n\nD. **Customers receive additional value**: While innovation can add value to a product, it does not necessarily mean that customers will perceive or receive this additional value. In fact, if the innovation leads to overserving, customers might not find the added features valuable.\n\nGiven this analysis, the option that is not a guaranteed result of innovation adding more functions is:\n\n**D. Customers receive additional value**\n\nThis is because the added functions may not always be perceived as valuable by the customers, especially if they lead to overserving."
