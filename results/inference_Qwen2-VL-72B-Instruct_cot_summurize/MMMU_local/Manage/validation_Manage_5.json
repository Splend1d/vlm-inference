The text explains that many divergent ideas end up not leading anywhere.\n\nGiven this context, the question asks what critics might complain about regarding this process. Let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. **No need to diverge** - This option suggests that critics believe there is no necessity for the initial phase of generating many ideas. However, the image and explanation emphasize the importance of divergence before convergence.\n\nB. **Disagreement is wasteful and self-indulgent** - This option implies that critics view the process of generating many ideas (many of which may not lead anywhere) as wasteful and self-indulgent. This aligns with the idea that many divergent ideas end up not leading anywhere, which could be seen as a waste of time and resources.\n\nC. **Convergence proceeds too slowly** - This option suggests that critics believe the process of narrowing down ideas takes too long. However, the image and explanation focus more on the initial phase of divergence rather than the speed of convergence.\n\nD. **The process of divergence-convergence is of little significance** - This option implies that critics find the entire process unimportant. However, the image and explanation highlight the importance of both divergence and convergence in the creative process.\n\nBased on the analysis, the most appropriate answer is:\n\nB. Disagreement is wasteful and self-indulgent"
