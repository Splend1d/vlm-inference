However, the question might be asking for an aspect that is not explicitly covered by any of the roles.\n\nUpon closer inspection, option A (\"Manage human resources operations and infrastructure\") is the most specific and technical, focusing on the operational side of HR. The other options (B, C, and D) are more strategic and encompass broader responsibilities.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Manage human resources operations and infrastructure"
