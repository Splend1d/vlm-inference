Stakeholder theory emphasizes the importance of considering the interests and needs of all stakeholders, not just shareholders.\n\nCritics of stakeholder theory often argue that it can lead to:\n\n- **Vague** responsibilities and decision-making processes.\n- **Elusive** benefits, as it can be difficult to measure the impact on all stakeholders.\n- **Multidimensional** challenges, as balancing the interests of multiple stakeholders can be complex.\n\nHowever, the term \"extra\" does not fit into this context. It does not describe a common criticism of stakeholder theory related to the benefits to stakeholders.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. extra"
