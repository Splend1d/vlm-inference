                    "text": "Email #1: E-mail from Marketing Manager to Research Staff: With ABC Oil currently the most profitable corporation in the country, followed closely by XYZ Oil, how valid is the image of the United States as dependent on foreign oil? What proportion of American energy needs can be met through domestic production? How do current production levels compare with previous years? What do we know about trends in demand? And if we must import, how much of that need can be answered by Canada? Positioning the company as an American energy company would be the most positive stance but only if we can support it by showing that our product comes from if not U.S. wells at least North American sources. E-mail #2: E-mail from Researcher #1 to Marketing Manager: Domestic production is healthy, but while it may be true that U.S.-based companies now produce more than the United States imports, we certainly don't produce as much as we consume, as you can see in the following graph. <image 1> E-mail #3: E-mail from Researcher #2 to Marketing Manager: ABC Oil's headquarters may be in Texas, but it sources crude from 21 countries, including both relatively stable nations like Kazakhstan and nations with periodic violent crises like Chad. XYZ Oil's practices are similar. We're a global society now, and an \"American\" company just means where the company pays taxes, not necessarily where it produces. The United States consumes more than 18 million barrels of crude per day, but our local fields produce less than half that. The difference has to come from fields somewhere else, no matter what company owns them. This isn't local farming where you eat what's grown close to home. We may be able to focus attention on our ties to American plants and American workers, but the product is an international mix. Consider the following statement. Does the information in the three sources support the inference as stated? Statement: The idea of \"American\" oil companies is archaic because major oil companies are now operating in global industries.\n\nA. Yes\nB. No\n"

                    "text": "To determine whether the information in the three sources supports the inference that the idea of \"American\" oil companies is archaic because major oil companies are now operating in global industries, let's analyze each source:\n\n1. **E-mail #1 (Marketing Manager to Research Staff):**\n   - The manager asks about the validity of the image of the United States being dependent on foreign oil.\n   - Questions about the proportion of American energy needs met through domestic production and trends in demand.\n   - The manager suggests that positioning the company as an American energy company would be positive if supported by data showing that the product comes from U.S. or North American sources.\n\n2. **E-mail #2 (Researcher #1 to Marketing Manager):**\n   - Provides a graph showing U.S. oil production and consumption over time.\n   - Indicates that domestic production is healthy but does not meet consumption needs.\n   - Shows that the United States consumes more than 18 million barrels of crude per day, while domestic production is less than half that amount.\n\n3. **E-mail #3 (Researcher #2 to Marketing Manager):**\n   - States that ABC Oil sources crude from 21 countries, including both stable and crisis-prone nations.\n   - Emphasizes that the United States consumes more than 18 million barrels of crude per day, but local fields produce less than half that amount.\n   - Argues that the concept of an \"American\" company is outdated because the product is an international mix, regardless of where the company pays taxes.\n\n**Analysis:**\n- The graph in E-mail #2 clearly shows that U.S. oil production is significantly lower than consumption, indicating a reliance on foreign oil.\n- E-mail #3 provides specific examples of how major oil companies operate globally, sourcing crude from multiple countries.\n- Both researchers highlight the discrepancy between domestic production and consumption, reinforcing the need for imported oil.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe information provided supports the inference that the idea of \"American\" oil companies is archaic because major oil companies are now operating in global industries. The data shows that U.S. companies source oil from various countries, and domestic production alone cannot meet the country's energy needs.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\nA. Yes"
