The candidates we supported were defeated in more than two-thirds of the races we followed. The result is a harder battle to get policies that benefit our interests through the legislature, but it's also a budget issue. We can't continue throwing money at races we can't win, no matter how agreeable the candidate's stand on our issues may be. The fact that they share our viewpoints doesn't help if they can't get elected. How can we determine where it makes sense to invest? E-mail #2: E-mail from Legislative Consultant to Vice President of E.A.S.Y. Manufacturing and Staff Researcher: The demographic breakdown of elections where we supported the unsuccessful candidate can tell us a great deal. We've won only in one demographic, and our margin there is smaller than the margins by which we lost the others. <image 1> E-mail #3: E-mail from Staff Researcher to Vice President of E.A.S.Y. Manufacturing and Legislative Consultant: The demographic groups in which we lost are on track to become a majority of the U.S. electorate this century, and they vote. Right now, they make up 37% of the overall population and 28% of voters in the last election. By midcentury, we can expect the Hispanic population to rise from 17% to about 29% of the U.S. population, and Asian-Americans, now about 5%, will be about 9%. Our one successful demographic is the one whose share is declining. Now 63% of the population, non-Hispanic whites will be less than half of the population by 2050. Consider the following statement. Does the information in the three sources support the inference as stated? Statement: The legislative consultant will actively lobby Asian-American legislators, because the candidates that E.A.S.Y. Manufacturing supported were more successful with Asian-Americans than with other minority groups.\n\nA. Yes\nB. No\n"

                    "text": "To determine whether the information in the three sources supports the inference that the legislative consultant will actively lobby Asian-American legislators, let's analyze the data and context provided:\n\n1. **E-mail #1**:\n   - The Vice President of E.A.S.Y. Manufacturing expresses concern about the defeat of their supported candidates in more than two-thirds of the races.\n   - There is a need to determine where it makes sense to invest resources.\n\n2. **E-mail #2**:\n   - The Legislative Consultant provides a demographic breakdown showing that E.A.S.Y. Manufacturing-supported candidates were successful only in one demographic group.\n   - The chart indicates that the success was among white voters, while the opponents had higher support from African-American, Hispanic, and other (e.g., Asian, Pacific Islander) voters.\n\n3. **E-mail #3**:\n   - The Staff Researcher highlights demographic trends:\n     - Non-Hispanic whites currently make up 63% of the population but are declining.\n     - Hispanics are expected to increase from 17% to about 29% of the population by mid-century.\n     - Asian-Americans are expected to increase from 5% to about 9% of the population by mid-century.\n     - Overall, minority populations are growing and becoming a larger share of the electorate.\n\n### Analysis:\n- The chart shows that E.A.S.Y. Manufacturing-supported candidates were more successful with white voters (60%) compared to other demographics.\n- The opponents had significantly higher support from African-American (90%), Hispanic (70%), and other (e.g., Asian, Pacific Islander) voters (70%).\n\n### Inference:\nThe statement suggests that the legislative consultant will actively lobby Asian-American legislators because the candidates that E.A.S.Y. Manufacturing supported were more successful with Asian-Americans than with other minority groups. However, the chart clearly shows that E.A.S.Y. Manufacturing-supported candidates were not more successful with Asian-Americans; they were more successful with white voters.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, the inference is not supported.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe correct answer is:\nB. No"
