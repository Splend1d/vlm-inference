The central figure in the painting is a young girl, presumably a princess.\n3. Surrounding the princess are several figures, including two women seated on the left and another woman standing behind them.\n\nGiven these observations, the title \"Las Meninas\" most likely refers to the attendants to the princess in the foreground.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nB. the attendants to the princess in the foreground"
