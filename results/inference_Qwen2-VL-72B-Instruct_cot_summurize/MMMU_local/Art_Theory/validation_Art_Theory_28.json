This pose and the treatment of the drapery are typical of Hellenistic or Roman sculptures.\n3. **Material and Finish**: The statue appears to be made of bronze, which was commonly used in Roman sculptures.\n\nGiven these observations, the most likely period for this work is:\n\nB. Imperial Roman\n\nThe style, form, and material all align well with the characteristics of Imperial Roman art."
