However, the question is about the use of stone in prehistoric structures like Stonehenge.\n\nStonehenge, a prehistoric monument in England, is known for its large standing stones arranged in a ring. These stones were not held together by mortar or concrete but rather by a sophisticated system of interlocking stones, known as mortise and tenon joints. This method allowed the stones to be stacked and supported without the need for additional binding materials.\n\nGiven this information, the correct answer is:\n\nA. employed a mortise and tenon system for supporting lintels"
