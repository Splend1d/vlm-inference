The painting features a classical architectural setting with columns and an arch.\n2. The use of perspective and the clear delineation of architectural elements suggest a focus on realism and proportion.\n\nGiven these observations, the architectural style resembles that of Filippo Brunelleschi, who was known for his pioneering work in linear perspective and classical architecture during the early Renaissance period.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Brunelleschi"
