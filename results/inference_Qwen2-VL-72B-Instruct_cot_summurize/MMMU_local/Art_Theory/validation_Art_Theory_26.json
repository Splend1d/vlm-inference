The seat and backrest appear to be solid and smooth, which is characteristic of materials like wood or plastic.\n3. The frame is made of straight, rigid pieces that could be metal or wood.\n\nGiven these observations, the most likely materials are:\n- Cast iron (A) is typically heavier and less common for this type of furniture.\n- Plastic (B) can have a smooth surface but is usually not used for the structural frame.\n- Steel (C) is strong and can be used for frames, but it is less common for the seat and backrest.\n- Plywood (D) is a common material for furniture and can be painted or finished to look smooth and solid.\n\nConsidering the smooth surfaces and the overall structure, the most plausible answer is:\n\nD. plywood"
