The second image is a floor plan of the same building, indicating various architectural features such as the nave, aisles, and apse.\n\nGiven the historical and architectural context, the building appears to be a significant religious structure, likely a church or cathedral. The use of mosaics is common in such buildings, especially in Byzantine architecture, which often features extensive use of mosaics for decorative purposes.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. mosaics"
