This painting has had a significant influence on various works of art, particularly those that depict revolutionary themes and scenes of struggle.\n\nGiven the options:\n\nA. Rude's La Marseillaise - This sculpture, also known as \"La R\u00e9volution,\" was created by Fran\u00e7ois Rude and is part of the Arc de Triomphe in Paris. It depicts a group of people marching forward, similar to the revolutionary theme in Delacroix's painting.\n\nB. Goya's Third of May - This painting by Francisco Goya depicts the execution of rebels during the Spanish uprising against Napoleon's forces. While it shares a theme of revolution and conflict, it does not directly mirror the composition or style of Delacroix's work.\n\nC. Picasso's Guernica - This famous painting by Pablo Picasso depicts the bombing of the Basque town of Guernica during the Spanish Civil War. It is an anti-war piece and does not directly reflect the revolutionary theme of Delacroix's painting.\n\nD. Johns's Three Flags - This painting by Jasper Johns is an abstract work featuring three flags, which does not share the revolutionary theme or composition of Delacroix's painting.\n\nThe work most directly influenced by \"Liberty Leading the People\" would be:\n\nA. Rude's La Marseillaise"
