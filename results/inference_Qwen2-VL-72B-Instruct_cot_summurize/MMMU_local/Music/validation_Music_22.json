The time signature is 4/4, but this does not directly affect the chord analysis.\n3. The chord is in third inversion, as indicated by the lowest note being the seventh degree of the scale.\n\nNow, let's look at the chord itself:\n- The lowest note is B (the seventh degree of the G major scale).\n- The next note up is D (the ninth degree, or the second degree if considering the cycle of fifths).\n- The next note is F# (the fourth degree).\n- The top note is A (the sixth degree).\n\nThis chord structure (B-D-F#-A) corresponds to a dominant seventh chord in G major. In third inversion, the root (G) is at the top, and the seventh degree (B) is at the bottom.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Dominant seventh in second inversion"
