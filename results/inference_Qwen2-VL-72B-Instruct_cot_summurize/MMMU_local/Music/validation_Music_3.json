The top note is an E (on the third line from the top).\n\nNow, let's count the number of half steps between G and E:\n- From G to A is 1 half step.\n- From A to B is 1 half step.\n- From B to C is 1 half step.\n- From C to D is 1 half step.\n- From D to E is 1 half step.\n\nSo, there are 5 half steps between G and E.\n\nThe interval between G and E is a minor third because it consists of 3 whole steps (or 5 half steps).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nB. major"
