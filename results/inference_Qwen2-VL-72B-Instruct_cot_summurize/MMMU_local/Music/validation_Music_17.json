The second clef is the bass clef.\n3. The third clef is the alto clef.\n4. The fourth clef is the tenor clef.\n\nThe notes on the staff are as follows:\n- The first note is a flat (b).\n- The second note is an open note (no accidental).\n- The third note is a flat (b).\n- The fourth note is a flat (b).\n- The fifth note is an open note (no accidental).\n- The sixth note is an open note (no accidental).\n- The seventh note is a flat (b).\n\nThis pattern of notes corresponds to a minor scale, specifically the natural minor scale. The natural minor scale typically starts on the note A and follows the pattern of whole steps and half steps: W H W W H W W.\n\nGiven this information, the correct clef that forms a minor scale is the second clef, which is the bass clef.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nB. second clef"
