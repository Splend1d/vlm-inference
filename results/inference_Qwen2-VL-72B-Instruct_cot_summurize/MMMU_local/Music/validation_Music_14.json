However, if we consider the context of the question, it seems to be asking for the interval within an octave.\n\nGiven the options:\n- A. compound minor 3rd\n- B. compound major 3rd\n- C. compound minor 6th\n- D. compound major 6th\n\nThe correct answer is:\n- A. compound minor 3rd\n\nSo, the correct box to select is:\nA. box 1"
