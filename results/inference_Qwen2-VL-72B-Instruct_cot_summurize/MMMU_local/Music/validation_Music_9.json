Its structure is: Root (1), Major Third (3), Perfect Fifth (5), and Minor Seventh (b7).\n\nIn the first inversion, the notes are arranged as follows:\n- The root is now in the bass (lowest note).\n- The third becomes the new lowest note in the upper part.\n- The fifth is above the third.\n- The minor seventh is at the top.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. This chord has a root in the bass, followed by a third, a fifth, and a minor seventh. It is in root position, not first inversion.\n\nB. This chord has a third in the bass, followed by a root, a fifth, and a minor seventh. It is in first inversion.\n\nC. This chord has a fifth in the bass, followed by a third, a root, and a minor seventh. It is in second inversion.\n\nD. This chord has a minor seventh in the bass, followed by a fifth, a root, and a third. It is in third inversion.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B."
