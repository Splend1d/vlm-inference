One dotted quarter note = 1.5 beats\n2. Two dotted quarter notes = 3 beats\n3. Three dotted quarter notes = 4.5 beats\n\nHowever, since we only need to express one beat, we can use two dotted quarter notes (3 beats) and subtract one beat by adding a regular quarter note (1 beat). This gives us:\n\n\\[ 3 \\text{ beats} - 1 \\text{ beat} = 2 \\text{ beats} \\]\n\nSo, we need two dotted quarter notes and one regular quarter note to express the value of one beat.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nD. <image 5>"
