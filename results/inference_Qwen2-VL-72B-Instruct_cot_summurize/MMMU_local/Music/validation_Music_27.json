The melody starts in the key of A minor (or C major).\n2. At the first occurrence of an enharmonic modulation, the note B\u266d is used instead of A\u266f. This happens at the beginning of the second measure.\n3. Another enharmonic modulation occurs later in the melody, but it is not immediately clear without further analysis.\n\nUpon closer inspection:\n- The first enharmonic modulation is from B\u266d to A\u266f.\n- There is no clear indication of another enharmonic modulation within the given melody.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. 1"
