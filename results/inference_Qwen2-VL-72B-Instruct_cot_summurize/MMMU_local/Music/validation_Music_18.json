The first note is an open G (G above middle C).\n3. The second note is an F with a sharp symbol (#), indicating F#.\n\nNow, let's consider each option:\n\nA. **#F major scale**: This scale starts on F#. The notes in this scale are F#, G#, A#, B, C#, D#, and E#. The given notes (G and F#) fit within this scale.\n\nB. **c melodic minor scale**: This scale starts on C. The ascending form includes C, D, E, F, G, A, and B. The descending form includes C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, and Bb. Neither of these forms include both G and F#.\n\nC. **b harmonic minor scale**: This scale starts on B. The notes in this scale are B, C, D, E, F#, G, and A#. While it includes F#, it does not include G.\n\nD. **E melodic major scale**: This scale starts on E. The ascending form includes E, F#, G#, A#, B, C#, and D#. The descending form includes E, F#, G#, A, B, C, and D. Neither of these forms include both G and F#.\n\nGiven the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nA. #F major scale"
