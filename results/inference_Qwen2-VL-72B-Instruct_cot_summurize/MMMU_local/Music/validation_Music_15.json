The clef is a C clef, which is placed on the third line from the bottom. This indicates that the third line is the note G.\n\nGiven this information:\n- The note in question is located one space below the third line (which is G).\n\nSince the spaces in a staff are named as follows: FACE (from bottom to top), the space below G is F.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD.
