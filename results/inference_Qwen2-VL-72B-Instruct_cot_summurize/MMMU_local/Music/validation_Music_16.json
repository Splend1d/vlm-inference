Both have compound dotted durations.\n\nB. <image 2> - This is a whole rest followed by a dotted quarter rest. The whole rest does not have a compound dotted duration, but the dotted quarter rest does.\n\nC. <image 3> - This is a dotted eighth rest followed by a dotted sixteenth rest. Both have compound dotted durations.\n\nD. <image 4> - This is an eighth rest followed by a sixteenth rest. Neither of these rests has a compound dotted duration.\n\nTherefore, the rest that does not have a compound dotted duration is:\n\nD. <image 4>"
