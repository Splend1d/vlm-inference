The angle of the inclined plane is 50\u00b0. The relationship between \\( H \\) and \\( h \\) can be derived from the geometry of the system:\n\\[ H = h + 2 \\sin(50\u00b0) \\]\n\nThe density of water at 20\u00b0C is approximately \\( \\rho = 1000 \\text{ kg/m}^3 \\).\n\nSubstituting the values into the force equation:\n\\[ 25 = 1000 \\times 9.81 \\times 0.0012566 \\times (h + 2 \\sin(50\u00b0)) \\]\n\nSolving for \\( h \\):\n\\[ 25 = 12.3457 \\times (h + 2 \\sin(50\u00b0)) \\]\n\\[ \\frac{25}{12.3457} = h + 2 \\sin(50\u00b0) \\]\n\\[ 2.025 = h + 2 \\times 0.766 \\]\n\\[ 2.025 = h + 1.532 \\]\n\\[ h = 2.025 - 1.532 \\]\n\\[ h = 0.493 \\text{ m} \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is not listed among the options provided.
