The pressure difference across the mercury manometer can be calculated using the height of the mercury column and the density of mercury.\n\nGiven:\n- Height of the mercury column, \\( h = 12 \\text{ cm} = 0.12 \\text{ m} \\)\n- Density of mercury, \\( \\rho_{\\text{Hg}} = 13600 \\text{ kg/m}^3 \\)\n\nThe pressure difference (\\( \\Delta P \\)) due to the mercury column can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[ \\Delta P = \\rho_{\\text{Hg}} \\cdot g \\cdot h \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( g \\) is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately \\( 9.81 \\text{ m/s}^2 \\))\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\n\\[ \\Delta P = 13600 \\text{ kg/m}^3 \\cdot 9.81 \\text{ m/s}^2 \\cdot 0.12 \\text{ m} \\]\n\\[ \\Delta P = 13600 \\cdot 9.81 \\cdot 0.12 \\]\n\\[ \\Delta P = 16070.4 \\text{ Pa} \\]\n\nTherefore, the pressure difference between points (1) and (2) in the pipe is approximately 16070.4 Pa.\n\nNone of the provided options match this exact value, but the closest option is:\n\nC. 26100 Pa\n\nHowever, based on the calculation, the correct answer should be closer to 16070.4 Pa, which is not listed among the options.
