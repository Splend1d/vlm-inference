Therefore, if work is done on or by the gas, the temperature will change.\n   - Since the volume increases from state 1 to state 2, the gas does work against the surroundings, which means \\(\\Delta U\\) is negative.\n   - Thus, the temperature decreases (\\(\\Delta T < 0\\)).\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct statement about the change in temperature and heat transferred during 1-2 is:\n\nB. \\(\\Delta T < 0\\), \\(Q = 0\\)"
