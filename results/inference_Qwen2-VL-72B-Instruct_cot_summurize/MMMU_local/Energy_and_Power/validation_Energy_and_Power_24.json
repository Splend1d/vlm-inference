The steam is supplied to the first effect and condensate is removed from it.\n\nThe capacity of an evaporator is typically determined by the amount of water that can be evaporated in each effect. In a forward feed system, the capacity of the entire system is often considered as the sum of the capacities of each individual effect.\n\nGiven the options:\nA. E1 + E2 + E3\nB. E3\nC. E1\nD. E1 + E2\n\nThe correct answer is:\nA. E1 + E2 + E3\n\nThis is because the total capacity of the forward feed evaporator is the sum of the capacities of all three effects (E1, E2, and E3)."
