Since the water and gasoline are open to the atmosphere and at the same elevation, the pressure at the bottom of each column must be equal.\n\nThe specific gravity (SG) of the third liquid is given as 1.60. The density of water is approximately \\( 1000 \\text{ kg/m}^3 \\), and the density of gasoline is approximately \\( 700 \\text{ kg/m}^3 \\).\n\nLet's denote:\n- \\( \\rho_w \\) as the density of water,\n- \\( \\rho_g \\) as the density of gasoline,\n- \\( \\rho_l \\) as the density of the third liquid,\n- \\( g \\) as the acceleration due to gravity (approximately \\( 9.81 \\text{ m/s}^2 \\)),\n- \\( h \\) as the height of the third liquid.\n\nThe pressure at the bottom of the water column is:\n\\[ P_w = \\rho_w \\cdot g \\cdot 1.5 \\]\n\nThe pressure at the bottom of the gasoline column is:\n\\[ P_g = \\rho_g \\cdot g \\cdot (1.5 + h) \\]\n\nSince the pressures at the bottom of both columns must be equal:\n\\[ P_w = P_g \\]\n\\[ \\rho_w \\cdot g \\cdot 1.5 = \\rho_g \\cdot g \\cdot (1.5 + h) \\]\n\nSubstituting the densities:\n\\[ 1000 \\cdot 9.81 \\cdot 1.5 = 700 \\cdot 9.81 \\cdot (1.5 + h) \\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\\[ 14715 = 6867 \\cdot (1.5 + h) \\]\n\nDividing both sides by 6867:\n\\[ 2.14 = 1.5 + h \\]\n\nSolving for \\( h \\):\n\\[ h = 2.14 - 1.5 \\]\n\\[ h = 0.64 \\text{ m} \\]\n\nTherefore, the height \\( h \\) in the third liquid is 0.64 meters.
