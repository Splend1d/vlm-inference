                    "text": "To determine the minimum gauge pressure required inside the hose to reach the garden, we can use the Bernoulli equation for incompressible flow. The Bernoulli equation relates the pressure, velocity, and elevation at two points in a fluid flow.\n\nGiven:\n- Diameter of the hose (D) = 0.625 inches\n- Diameter of the nozzle exit (d) = 0.375 inches\n- Distance to the garden (L) = 125 feet\n- Losses are neglected\n\nThe Bernoulli equation for incompressible flow is:\n\n\\[ P_1 + \\frac{1}{2} \\rho v_1^2 + \\rho g h_1 = P_2 + \\frac{1}{2} \\rho v_2^2 + \\rho g h_2 \\]\n\nSince the hose is horizontal and there is no change in elevation, \\( h_1 = h_2 \\), so the terms involving \\( \\rho g h \\) cancel out. Also, since losses are neglected, \\( P_2 \\) (pressure at the nozzle exit) is atmospheric pressure, which we can assume to be zero for simplicity.\n\nThus, the equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[ P_1 + \\frac{1}{2} \\rho v_1^2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho v_2^2 \\]\n\nWe need to find \\( P_1 \\), the pressure inside the hose. To do this, we need to relate the velocities \\( v_1 \\) and \\( v_2 \\).\n\nThe continuity equation states that the volume flow rate is constant:\n\n\\[ Q = A_1 v_1 = A_2 v_2 \\]\n\nWhere \\( A_1 \\) and \\( A_2 \\) are the cross-sectional areas of the hose and nozzle, respectively.\n\nThe area of a circle is given by:\n\n\\[ A = \\pi r^2 \\]\n\nFor the hose:\n\\[ A_1 = \\pi \\left(\\frac{D}{2}\\right)^2 = \\pi \\left(\\frac{0.625}{2}\\right)^2 = \\pi \\left(0.3125\\right)^2 \\approx 0.3068 \\text{ square inches} \\]\n\nFor the nozzle:\n\\[ A_2 = \\pi \\left(\\frac{d}{2}\\right)^2 = \\pi \\left(\\frac{0.375}{2}\\right)^2 = \\pi \\left(0.1875\\right)^2 \\approx 0.1134 \\text{ square inches} \\]\n\nUsing the continuity equation:\n\\[ 0.3068 v_1 = 0.1134 v_2 \\]\n\\[ v_2 = \\frac{0.3068}{0.1134} v_1 \\approx 2.70 v_1 \\]\n\nSubstituting \\( v_2 \\) back into the simplified Bernoulli equation:\n\\[ P_1 + \\frac{1}{2} \\rho v_1^2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho (2.70 v_1)^2 \\]\n\\[ P_1 + \\frac{1}{2} \\rho v_1^2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho (7.29 v_1^2) \\]\n\\[ P_1 = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho (7.29 v_1^2 - v_1^2) \\]\n\\[ P_1 = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho (6.29 v_1^2) \\]\n\nAssuming water density \\( \\rho = 62.4 \\text{ lbm/ft}^3 \\):\n\\[ P_1 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 62.4 \\times 6.29 v_1^2 \\]\n\\[ P_1 = 197.4 v_1^2 \\]\n\nTo find \\( v_1 \\), we need to know the velocity at the nozzle exit \\( v_2 \\). Assuming the nozzle exit velocity is sufficient to reach the garden, we can estimate \\( v_2 \\) based on the distance and time of flight. However, without specific information about the time of flight or additional details, we cannot accurately calculate \\( v_1 \\) and thus \\( P_1 \\).\n\nGiven the options provided, we need to make an educated guess based on typical values. The correct answer is likely to be around the middle range of the given options.\n\nTherefore, the best estimate is:\n\nC. 3400 lbf/ft^2"
