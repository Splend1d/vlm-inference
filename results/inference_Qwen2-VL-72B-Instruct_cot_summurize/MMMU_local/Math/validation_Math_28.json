A Cayley diagram (or Cayley graph) is a way to represent the structure of a group by showing how the elements of the group interact under the group operation.\n\nIn a Cayley diagram:\n- Nodes represent elements of the group.\n- Directed edges (arrows) represent the action of group elements on other elements.\n\nThe given image shows a directed graph with nodes and directed edges. However, for it to be a Cayley diagram, it must satisfy certain properties:\n1. The graph should be connected.\n2. The arrows should represent the action of group elements in a consistent manner.\n\nLet's analyze the given image:\n- There are four nodes.\n- There are directed edges connecting the nodes.\n- The edges are colored differently (red and blue), which might represent different group elements or operations.\n\nHowever, without additional context or information about the group and its operations, we cannot definitively conclude that this is a Cayley diagram. The image does not provide enough information to verify that it satisfies the properties of a Cayley diagram.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\nB. No"
