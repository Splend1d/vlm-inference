Let's analyze each graph step by step:\n\n### Graph 1\n- Vertices: \\(a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h\\)\n- Edges: Each vertex is connected to every other vertex except itself.\n- This is a complete graph with 8 vertices, denoted as \\(K_8\\).\n\n### Graph 2\n- Vertices: \\(a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h\\)\n- Edges: The graph has a structure where each vertex is connected to every other vertex in a specific pattern that forms a complete bipartite graph \\(K_{4,4}\\).\n- This means there are two sets of 4 vertices, and every vertex in one set is connected to every vertex in the other set.\n\n### Graph 3\n- Vertices: \\(a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h\\)\n- Edges: The graph has a structure where it is a combination of a square and additional connections forming a specific pattern.\n- This graph does not form a complete graph or a complete bipartite graph.\n\nNow, let's compare the graphs:\n\n1. **Graph 1** is a complete graph \\(K_8\\).\n2. **Graph 2** is a complete bipartite graph \\(K_{4,4}\\).\n3. **Graph 3** has a different structure that does not match either \\(K_8\\) or \\(K_{4,4}\\).\n\nSince Graph 1, Graph 2, and Graph 3 have distinctly different structures, they are not isomorphic to each other.\n\nTherefore, all three graphs are not isomorphic to each other.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nC.
