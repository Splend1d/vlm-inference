This indicates an amplitude of 1.\n2. **Period**: The graph repeats itself every $\\pi$ units along the x-axis. This means the period is $\\pi$.\n\nGiven these observations:\n- The amplitude of both sine and cosine functions is 1, so this doesn't help us distinguish between them.\n- The period of the standard sine and cosine functions is $2\\pi$. To have a period of $\\pi$, we need to adjust the frequency by using a coefficient of 2 inside the trigonometric function.\n\nNow, let's consider the starting point of the graph:\n- The graph starts at its maximum value (1) when $x = 0$. This is characteristic of the cosine function, which starts at its maximum value at $x = 0$.\n\nTherefore, the correct equation that matches these characteristics is:\n\n$$ y = \\cos(2\\pi x) $$\n\nSo, the correct option is:\n\nA. $y = \\cos(2\\pi x)$"
