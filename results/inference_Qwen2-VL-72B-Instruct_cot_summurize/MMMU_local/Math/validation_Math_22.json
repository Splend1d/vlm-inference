                    "text": "Given that $OP = 11$ and $P$ is the midpoint of $\\overline{BD}$, we know that $BP = PD = 2 \\cdot OP = 22$. Since $\\overline{AD} \\perp \\overline{BD}$, triangle $ABD$ is a right triangle with $\\angle ADB = 90^\\circ$.\n\nLet's denote $AD = x$ and $BD = 22 + 22 = 44$. We need to find the length of $AD$.\n\nSince $ABCD$ is an isosceles trapezoid (because $BC = CD = 43$), we know that $AB = CD = 43$. The diagonals of an isosceles trapezoid bisect each other, so $AO = OC$ and $BO = OD$.\n\nNow, consider triangle $ABD$. By the Pythagorean theorem, we have:\n\\[x^2 + 44^2 = AB^2\\]\n\\[x^2 + 1936 = 43^2\\]\n\\[x^2 + 1936 = 1849\\]\n\\[x^2 = 1849 - 1936\\]\n\\[x^2 = -87\\]\n\nThis result doesn't make sense because the length of a side cannot be negative or imaginary. It seems there was a misunderstanding in the interpretation of the given information or the application of the Pythagorean theorem. Let's correct this:\n\nThe correct approach should involve recognizing that $O$ is the midpoint of both diagonals due to the properties of an isosceles trapezoid. Therefore, $AO = OC$ and $BO = OD$. However, the key point here is that $OP = 11$ and $P$ being the midpoint of $BD$ implies that $BD = 2 \\cdot OP = 22$ (not 44 as initially stated).\n\nGiven that $AD \\perp BD$, we can use the Pythagorean theorem in triangle $ABD$ correctly as follows:\n\\[x^2 + 22^2 = 43^2\\]\n\\[x^2 + 484 = 1849\\]\n\\[x^2 = 1849 - 484\\]\n\\[x^2 = 1365\\]\n\\[x = \\sqrt{1365}\\]\n\nTo simplify $\\sqrt{1365}$, we factor 1365 into its prime factors:\n\\[1365 = 3 \\times 5 \\times 7 \\times 13\\]\n\nTherefore, $x = \\sqrt{1365} = \\sqrt{3 \\times 5 \\times 7 \\times 13} = \\sqrt{3 \\times 5 \\times 7 \\times 13}$.\n\nThus, $m = 1$ and $n = 3 \\times 5 \\times 7 \\times 13 = 1365$.\n\nFinally, $m + n = 1 + 1365 = 1366$.\n\nIt seems there was a miscalculation in the final step. The correct answer should be based on the simplified form of $\\sqrt{1365}$, which is not directly provided in the options. Let's re-evaluate the simplification:\n\n\\[x = \\sqrt{1365} = \\sqrt{3 \\times 5 \\times 7 \\times 13}\\]\n\nSince $1365$ is already in its simplest radical form (as it cannot be further simplified into a product of squares), we have $m = 1$ and $n = 1365$.\n\nTherefore, $m + n = 1 + 1365 = 1366$.\n\nHowever, this does not match any of the provided options, indicating a misunderstanding in the interpretation of the question or the calculation process. Given the complexity and the specific nature of the problem, it's crucial to ensure all steps are accurately followed. The correct approach should lead to one of the provided options, but based on the current interpretation and calculations, none of the options directly match the derived solution. This discrepancy suggests a need for a reevaluation of the problem statement or the provided options for accuracy."
