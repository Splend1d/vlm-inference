It starts at the root node and explores all the neighboring nodes before moving to the next level of nodes.\n\nLet's analyze the diagrams:\n\n- **Diagram (a)**: The process starts with a single node (Step 1), then expands to its neighbors (Step 2), and continues to explore the next level of nodes (Step 3). This pattern suggests a depth-first search rather than a breadth-first search.\n  \n- **Diagram (b)**: The process starts with a single node (Step 1), then explores all its immediate neighbors (Step 2), and continues to explore the next level of nodes (Step 3, Step 4, Step 5). This pattern is consistent with a breadth-first search, as it explores all nodes at the current level before moving to the next level.\n\nTherefore, the diagram that illustrates the construction of a breadth-first spanning tree is:\n\nB. b"
