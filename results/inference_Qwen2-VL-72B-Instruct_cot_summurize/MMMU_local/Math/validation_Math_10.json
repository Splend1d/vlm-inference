A regular graph is one in which every vertex has the same degree (the number of edges connected to it).\n\nLet's analyze the degrees of each vertex in the given graph:\n\n- Vertex \\(a\\) has degree 4.\n- Vertex \\(b\\) has degree 4.\n- Vertex \\(c\\) has degree 4.\n- Vertex \\(d\\) has degree 4.\n- Vertex \\(e\\) has degree 3.\n- Vertex \\(f\\) has degree 3.\n- Vertex \\(h\\) has degree 2.\n\nSince not all vertices have the same degree, the graph is not regular.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. not all vertices have the same degree"
