Here, we will use Kruskal's algorithm for simplicity.\n\nKruskal's algorithm involves sorting all the edges in non-decreasing order of their weights and then adding the edges to the MST in that order, as long as adding an edge does not form a cycle.\n\nLet's sort the edges by their weights:\n\n1. (2, 5) - weight 2\n2. (7, 8) - weight 3\n3. (6, 7) - weight 4\n4. (5, 6) - weight 4\n5. (3, 5) - weight 6\n6. (1, 2) - weight 6\n7. (4, 5) - weight 7\n8. (5, 7) - weight 8\n9. (3, 4) - weight 11\n10. (1, 3) - weight 14\n11. (4, 6) - weight 15\n12. (2, 3) - weight 16\n13. (1, 4) - weight 18\n14. (6, 8) - weight 10\n15. (4, 8) - weight 9\n16. (1, 5) - weight 17\n\nNow, we add these edges one by one to the MST while ensuring no cycles are formed:\n\n1. Add (2, 5)\n2. Add (7, 8)\n3. Add (6, 7)\n4. Add (5, 6)\n5. Add (3, 5)\n6. Add (1, 2)\n7. Add (4, 5)\n8. Add (5, 7)\n\nAt this point, we have included 8 edges, which is enough to form a spanning tree since there are 8 vertices. The edges (3, 4), (1, 3), (4, 6), (2, 3), (1, 4), (6, 8), (4, 8), and (1, 5) would create cycles if added, so they are not included.\n\nThe minimum spanning tree includes the following edges:\n- (2, 5)\n- (7, 8)\n- (6, 7)\n- (5, 6)\n- (3, 5)\n- (1, 2)\n- (4, 5)\n- (5, 7)\n\nComparing this with the options provided:\n\nA. Graph G1 with vertices v1 to v8 and arcs including (v1, v3), (v2, v3) and so on.\nB. Graph G2 with vertices v1 to v8 and arcs including (v2, v5) and (v4, v8).\nC. Graph G1 with vertices v1 to v8 and arcs excluding (v2, v5) and (v4, v8).\nD. Graph G2 with vertices v1 to v8 and no arc connecting A1 and A3.\n\nOption B correctly lists the edges (v2, v5) and (v4, v8) which are part of the minimum spanning tree.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nB. Graph G2 with vertices v1 to v8 and arcs including (v2, v5) and (v4, v8)."
