This single attendant can supervise all four rooms because they can see into all adjacent rooms from this central position.\n\n### Gallery (b)\n- There are six rooms arranged in a rectangle.\n- Each room is connected to its adjacent rooms through doorways.\n\nWe need to place attendants in such a way that they can supervise all rooms. One possible arrangement is:\n- Place one attendant at the doorway between the top-left and middle-left rooms.\n- Place another attendant at the doorway between the bottom-middle and bottom-right rooms.\n\nThese two attendants can supervise all six rooms because they cover all the doorways and can see into all adjacent rooms.\n\nTherefore, the smallest number of attendants required for each gallery is:\n- Gallery (a): 1 attendant\n- Gallery (b): 2 attendants\n\nThe correct answer is:\nA. (a) 1, (b) 2"
