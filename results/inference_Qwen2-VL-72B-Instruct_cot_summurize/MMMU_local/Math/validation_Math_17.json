Thus,\n\\[ d_r = 2 \\sin(\\theta/2) \\]\n\nThe distance walked, $d_w$, is the arc length from R to Q. Since $\\angle ROQ = 2\\theta$, the arc length is:\n\\[ d_w = r \\cdot 2\\theta = 2\\theta \\]\n\nThe total time taken, $T$, is the sum of the time spent rowing and the time spent walking:\n\\[ T = \\frac{d_r}{v_r} + \\frac{d_w}{v_w} \\]\nSubstituting the expressions for $d_r$, $d_w$, $v_r$, and $v_w$:\n\\[ T = \\frac{2 \\sin(\\theta/2)}{1.5} + \\frac{2\\theta}{3} \\]\n\\[ T = \\frac{4}{3} \\sin(\\theta/2) + \\frac{2\\theta}{3} \\]\n\nTo minimize $T$, we take the derivative of $T$ with respect to $\\theta$ and set it to zero:\n\\[ \\frac{dT}{d\\theta} = \\frac{4}{3} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} \\cos(\\theta/2) + \\frac{2}{3} = 0 \\]\n\\[ \\frac{2}{3} \\cos(\\theta/2) + \\frac{2}{3} = 0 \\]\n\\[ \\cos(\\theta/2) = -1 \\]\nSince $\\cos(\\theta/2) = -1$ implies $\\theta/2 = \\pi$, but $\\theta$ must be between $0$ and $\\pi/2$, there is no solution within the given range.\n\nHowever, considering the physical constraints and the fact that the man wants to minimize time, the optimal strategy is to row directly to Q, which means $\\theta = \\pi/2$. This minimizes the rowing distance and maximizes the walking distance, which is faster.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nA. $\\theta = \\pi/2$"
