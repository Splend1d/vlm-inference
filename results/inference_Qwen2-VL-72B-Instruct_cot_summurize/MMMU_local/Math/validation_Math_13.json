                    "text": "To find the area of quadrilateral \\(ABCD\\), we can divide it into two triangles, \\(ABC\\) and \\(ADC\\), and calculate their areas separately.\n\nFirst, let's consider triangle \\(ABC\\). Since the hexagon and octagon share a common side \\(AB\\), and both are regular polygons, we know that \\(AB = BC = CD = 4\\).\n\nThe angle at \\(B\\) in triangle \\(ABC\\) is \\(120^\\circ\\) because it is an interior angle of a regular hexagon. The angles at \\(A\\) and \\(C\\) are each \\(90^\\circ\\) because they are formed by the intersection of sides of the hexagon and octagon, which are perpendicular to each other due to the symmetry of the shapes.\n\nThus, triangle \\(ABC\\) is a right-angled triangle with one angle being \\(120^\\circ - 90^\\circ = 30^\\circ\\). Using trigonometry, we can find the height from \\(B\\) to \\(AC\\), which will help us find the area of triangle \\(ABC\\).\n\nLet \\(h\\) be the height from \\(B\\) to \\(AC\\). In right-angled triangle \\(ABE\\) (where \\(E\\) is the foot of the perpendicular from \\(B\\) to \\(AC\\)), we have:\n\\[ \\sin(30^\\circ) = \\frac{h}{4} \\]\n\\[ h = 4 \\cdot \\sin(30^\\circ) = 4 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = 2 \\]\n\nSo, the area of triangle \\(ABC\\) is:\n\\[ \\text{Area}_{ABC} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot AB \\cdot h = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 4 \\cdot 2 = 4 \\]\n\nNow, let's consider triangle \\(ADC\\). This triangle is also a right-angled triangle with one angle being \\(90^\\circ\\) and the other being \\(45^\\circ\\) (since it's part of a regular octagon, and the interior angles of a regular octagon are \\(135^\\circ\\), making the remaining angle \\(180^\\circ - 135^\\circ = 45^\\circ\\)).\n\nUsing trigonometry again, we can find the height from \\(D\\) to \\(AC\\), which will help us find the area of triangle \\(ADC\\).\n\nLet \\(h'\\) be the height from \\(D\\) to \\(AC\\). In right-angled triangle \\(ADE\\) (where \\(E\\) is the foot of the perpendicular from \\(D\\) to \\(AC\\)), we have:\n\\[ \\sin(45^\\circ) = \\frac{h'}{4} \\]\n\\[ h' = 4 \\cdot \\sin(45^\\circ) = 4 \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} = 2\\sqrt{2} \\]\n\nSo, the area of triangle \\(ADC\\) is:\n\\[ \\text{Area}_{ADC} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot AD \\cdot h' = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 4 \\cdot 2\\sqrt{2} = 4\\sqrt{2} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total area of quadrilateral \\(ABCD\\) is:\n\\[ \\text{Area}_{ABCD} = \\text{Area}_{ABC} + \\text{Area}_{ADC} = 4 + 4\\sqrt{2} \\]\n\nThis matches option C: \\(16 + 16\\sqrt{2} - 16\\sqrt{3}\\), but there seems to be a misunderstanding in the calculation or the interpretation of the options. The correct calculation leads to \\(4 + 4\\sqrt{2}\\), which does not directly match any of the provided options. It appears there might have been an error in interpreting the options or in the calculation process. Given the steps taken, the correct answer based on the calculations should be \\(4 + 4\\sqrt{2}\\), which is not listed among the provided options."
