The figure that shows this is Example (1).\n2. **Ladies' Chain**: This move involves ladies passing through each other. The figure that shows this is Example (3).\n3. **Swing on side**: This move involves partners swinging around each other. The figure that shows this is Example (5).\n4. **Gents Allemande**: This move involves gentlemen passing each other. The figure that shows this is Example (2).\n5. **Right and Left Through**: This move involves partners passing each other to their right and then to their left. The figure that shows this is Example (4).\n6. **California Twirl**: This move involves partners twirling around each other. The figure that shows this is Example (6).\n\nSo, the correct sequence is: (1), (3), (5), (2), (4), (6).\n\nThe correct answer is:\nC. (1), (3), (5), (2), (4), (6)"
