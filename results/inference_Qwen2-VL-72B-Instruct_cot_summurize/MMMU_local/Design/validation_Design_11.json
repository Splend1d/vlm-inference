This icon is often interpreted as a representation of the Christian doctrine of the Trinity.\n\nGiven this context, the correct answer to your question would be:\n\nB. aligning the Old Testament and the New Testament through typology\n\nThis is because the icon uses the story of Abraham's hospitality to the three angels (an event described in the Old Testament) as a typological representation of the Holy Trinity (a concept central to the New Testament)."
