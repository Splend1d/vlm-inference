The image shows a kitchen layout with a \"work triangle\" indicated by blue dashed lines connecting the stove, sink, and refrigerator. The term \"work triangle\" refers to the area in a kitchen where the primary tasks of food preparation, cooking, and cleaning take place. The goal is to minimize the distance between these three areas to increase efficiency.\n\nThe question asks about what should not cross through the basic work triangle. Given the options:\n\nA. Appliance - This doesn't make sense because appliances are part of the work triangle.\nB. Traffic - This makes sense because traffic patterns (indicated by the blue dashed line on the right side of the image) should not interfere with the work triangle to maintain efficiency.\nC. Cabinet - Cabinets are typically part of the kitchen structure and would not be moved through the work triangle.\nD. Utensil - Utensils are used within the work triangle, so they wouldn't cross through it either.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Traffic"
