The use of gold leaf and the halo around the figures suggest a Byzantine influence.\n2. The flat, two-dimensional style and the specific iconography are typical of Byzantine art.\n3. The clothing and iconography also align with the styles commonly seen in Byzantine art.\n\nGiven these observations, the most likely time period for this artwork is the tenth or eleventh century C.E., which falls within the Byzantine era.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nC. tenth or eleventh century C.E."
