The painting depicts multiple individuals sitting at tables, each engaged in different activities.\n2. The style is characterized by flat, bold colors and simplified forms, which is reminiscent of modernist art.\n3. The use of vertical lines and the overall composition suggest a focus on social commentary or everyday life.\n\nGiven these characteristics, the painting aligns well with the style of Jacob Lawrence, who is known for his depictions of African American life and social issues through a series of narrative paintings.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Jacob Lawrence"
