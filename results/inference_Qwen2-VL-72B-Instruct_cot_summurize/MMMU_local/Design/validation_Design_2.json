This aligns with the use of scientific theories about color and optic function.\n\nB. **to bring Classical structure to the Impressionists' approach to painting**\n   - While Seurat's work does have a structured approach, this option does not specifically address the technique of Divisionism.\n\nC. **to use color to generate a strong emotional response from the viewer**\n   - While color can evoke emotions, this option does not directly relate to the technical aspect of Divisionism.\n\nD. **to produce an idiosyncratic style characterized by the use of small dots of color**\n   - This describes Pointillism, a related technique but not the primary goal behind Divisionism.\n\nGiven the context and the specific technique of Divisionism, the most accurate answer is:\n\n**A. to enliven paintings through the use of scientific theories about color and optic function**"
