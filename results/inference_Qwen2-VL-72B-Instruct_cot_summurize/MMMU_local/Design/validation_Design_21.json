Monochromatic Color Scheme - This involves using different shades of the same color, which is not the case here.\nB. Complementary Color Scheme - This involves using colors opposite each other on the color wheel, which is not applicable here.\nC. Analogous Color Scheme - This involves using colors next to each other on the color wheel, which is not applicable here.\nD. Accented Neutral Color Scheme - This involves using neutral colors with one accent color, which matches the description of the outfit in the image.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nD. Accented Neutral Color Scheme"
