The use of over one million small tiles allows for a high level of detail and realism.\n\nOption A suggests depicting a disorganized scene that overwhelms the viewer. While the scene is complex, it is not necessarily disorganized or overwhelming.\n\nOption B suggests modeling the anatomy of the figures naturalistically. The mosaic does show detailed and realistic figures, which aligns with the use of many small tiles to achieve fine details.\n\nOption C suggests modifying and transporting the composition easily. While mosaics can be transported, the primary advantage of using many small tiles is not ease of modification or transportation but rather the ability to create detailed and realistic images.\n\nOption D suggests reducing the figures into abstract forms. This is not consistent with the detailed and realistic depiction in the mosaic.\n\nGiven this analysis, the most appropriate answer is:\n\nB. model the anatomy of the figures naturalistically"
