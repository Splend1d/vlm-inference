The center distance between piles is typically specified to ensure adequate soil support and to prevent interference between the piles.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nA. 4D\n\nThis is based on common engineering practices where the center-to-center distance (D) between piles is often specified to be at least 4 times the diameter of the pile to ensure proper load distribution and to avoid soil disturbance between adjacent piles."
