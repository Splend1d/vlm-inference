Since the beam is in equilibrium, the sum of the moments about any point must be zero.\n\nLet's choose point A as our reference point for calculating the moment. The moment equation about point A is:\n\n\\[ \\sum M_A = 0 \\]\n\nThe moment due to \\( T_H \\) about point A is:\n\\[ T_H \\times AH \\]\n\nThe moment due to \\( T_G \\) about point A is:\n\\[ T_G \\times AG \\]\n\nThe moment due to \\( Q \\) about point A is:\n\\[ Q \\times AO \\]\n\nSince the beam is in equilibrium, these moments must balance each other out. Therefore, we have:\n\n\\[ T_H \\times AH + T_G \\times AG - Q \\times AO = 0 \\]\n\nHowever, we are asked to find the bending moment \\( M_{DA} \\). The bending moment at point D is simply the moment due to the external forces acting on the beam up to point D.\n\nFrom the diagram, it appears that the only force acting between points A and D is \\( T_H \\). Therefore, the bending moment \\( M_{DA} \\) is:\n\n\\[ M_{DA} = T_H \\times AD \\]\n\nGiven the options provided, we need to match this expression with one of the given values. Without specific numerical values for \\( T_H \\) and \\( AD \\), we cannot directly calculate the exact value. However, based on the options, we can infer that the correct answer should be consistent with the general form of the bending moment calculation.\n\nGiven the options:\nA. 12\nB. 15\nC. 18\nD. 24\n\nWithout additional information, we cannot definitively determine the exact value. However, if we assume that the problem is designed to test understanding of basic principles rather than specific numerical calculations, the correct answer might be inferred from the context or the typical range of such problems.\n\nGiven the typical range of bending moments in such problems, the most reasonable choice would be:\n\nC. 18"
