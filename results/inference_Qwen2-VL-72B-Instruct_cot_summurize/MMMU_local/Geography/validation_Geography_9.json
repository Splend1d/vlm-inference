This graph does not match Kenya's demographic profile.\n\nB. **Kiribati**: Kiribati is a small island nation with a relatively small population. The age structure and gender distribution in the graph could be consistent with Kiribati's demographics.\n\nC. **Kuwait**: Kuwait has a significant expatriate population, which might skew the age and gender distribution. Additionally, Kuwait's population is larger than what this graph suggests.\n\nD. **Kyrgyzstan**: Kyrgyzstan has a larger population and a different age structure, with a more pronounced youthful population due to higher birth rates. This graph does not match Kyrgyzstan's demographic profile.\n\nBased on the analysis, the most likely country represented by this population graph is:\n\nB. Kiribati"
