The natural water content is given by:\n\n\\[ w = \\frac{V_w}{V_s} \\times 100\\% \\]\n\nwhere \\(V_w\\) is the volume of water and \\(V_s\\) is the volume of solids.\n\nThe pore ratio \\(e\\) is defined as:\n\n\\[ e = \\frac{V_v}{V_s} \\]\n\nwhere \\(V_v\\) is the volume of voids (or pores).\n\nFor a fully saturated soil, the volume of voids is equal to the volume of water (\\(V_v = V_w\\)). Therefore, we can relate the natural water content to the pore ratio as follows:\n\n\\[ w = \\frac{V_w}{V_s} \\times 100\\% \\]\n\\[ e = \\frac{V_v}{V_s} = \\frac{V_w}{V_s} \\]\n\nGiven that the natural water content \\(w = 60\\%\\), we can express this as:\n\n\\[ 60\\% = \\frac{V_w}{V_s} \\times 100\\% \\]\n\\[ \\frac{V_w}{V_s} = 0.6 \\]\n\nSince \\(e = \\frac{V_w}{V_s}\\), we have:\n\n\\[ e = 0.6 \\]\n\nTherefore, the natural pore ratio is closest to 0.6, which is not listed in the options provided. However, if we consider the closest option to 0.6, it would be:\n\nA. 1.0\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nA. 1.0"
