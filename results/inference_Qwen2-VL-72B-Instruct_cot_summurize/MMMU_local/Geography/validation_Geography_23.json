It does not typically produce significant torsional deformation due to its symmetry.\n\n2. **Channel steel (Option B)**:\n   - Channel steel has an open section, which can lead to torsional deformation under certain loading conditions. However, it is more prone to bending than torsion.\n\n3. **I-beam (Option C)**:\n   - An I-beam is designed to resist bending efficiently due to its high moment of inertia. It is less likely to undergo significant torsional deformation under typical loading conditions.\n\n4. **Equilateral angle steel (Option D)**:\n   - Equilateral angle steel has an open section with two legs at right angles. When a force is applied at an angle, it can cause both bending and torsion due to the asymmetry and the way the force is distributed across the section.\n\nGiven the analysis, the cross-section that is most likely to produce the combined deformation of oblique bending and torsion is:\n\n**D.
