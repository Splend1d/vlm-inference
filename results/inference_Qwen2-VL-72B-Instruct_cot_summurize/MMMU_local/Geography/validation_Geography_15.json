Siltstone is formed from compacted and cemented silt-sized particles.\n\nB. Shale is Clay, breaking easily into flat flakes and plates.\n- This is correct. Shale is a fine-grained, clastic sedimentary rock that breaks into thin layers or flakes when split.\n\nC. Chert is Silica, a microcrystalline form of quartz.\n- This is correct. Chert is indeed a microcrystalline form of quartz.\n\nD. None\n- This option suggests that all the previous statements are correct.\n\nGiven that all the statements A, B, and C are correct, the correct answer is:\n\nD. None"
