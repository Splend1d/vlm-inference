Standard penetration test\n\nThe standard penetration test (SPT) is commonly used to evaluate the properties of soils and fills, including their density and uniformity. It involves driving a split spoon sampler into the ground using a standardized hammer and counting the number of blows required to drive the sampler a specified distance. This provides valuable information about the compactness and uniformity of the material."
