                    "text": "To determine the pore water pressure at point G, we need to understand the concept of equipotential lines and how they relate to the hydraulic gradient.\n\nGiven:\n- The storage height of the dam is 16 meters.\n- The interval of the water head gradient equipotential lines is evenly divided into \\( m = 22 \\) lines.\n- Point G is located on the 20th equipotential line, 11.5 meters above the ground level.\n\nThe total head difference between the top of the dam and the bottom is 16 meters. Since there are 22 equipotential lines, each equipotential line represents an equal head difference.\n\nFirst, calculate the head difference per equipotential line:\n\\[ \\text{Head difference per line} = \\frac{\\text{Total head difference}}{\\text{Number of lines}} = \\frac{16 \\text{ meters}}{22} \\approx 0.727 \\text{ meters} \\]\n\nPoint G is on the 20th equipotential line. Therefore, the head difference from the bottom to point G is:\n\\[ \\text{Head difference to point G} = 20 \\times 0.727 \\approx 14.54 \\text{ meters} \\]\n\nSince point G is 11.5 meters above the ground level, the effective head difference contributing to the pore water pressure at point G is:\n\\[ \\text{Effective head difference} = 14.54 - 11.5 = 3.04 \\text{ meters} \\]\n\nConvert this head difference to pressure using the hydrostatic pressure formula:\n\\[ P = \\rho g h \\]\nwhere:\n- \\( \\rho \\) is the density of water (approximately 1000 kg/m\u00b3),\n- \\( g \\) is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.81 m/s\u00b2),\n- \\( h \\) is the effective head difference (3.04 meters).\n\n\\[ P = 1000 \\times 9.81 \\times 3.04 \\approx 29841.6 \\text{ Pa} \\]\n\nConverting Pa to kPa:\n\\[ P \\approx 29.84 \\text{ kPa} \\]\n\nThe closest option to 29.84 kPa is:\n\nA. 30 kPa"
