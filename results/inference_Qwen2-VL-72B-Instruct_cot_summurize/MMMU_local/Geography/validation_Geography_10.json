For a cross-section, it is typically calculated about the centroidal axes (x and y).\n\n2. **Polar Moment of Inertia \\(J\\)**: This is a measure of an object's resistance to torsional deformation. It is defined as \\(J = I_x + I_y\\), where \\(I_x\\) and \\(I_y\\) are the moments of inertia about the x and y axes, respectively.\n\nGiven the sections:\n- Section (a): A circle with a rectangular hole.\n- Section (b): A square with a circular hole.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Section (a):\n- The moment of inertia \\(I_a\\) will be less than that of a solid circle because the rectangular hole reduces the material.\n- The polar moment of inertia \\(J_a\\) will also be less than that of a solid circle for the same reason.\n\n#### Section (b):\n- The moment of inertia \\(I_b\\) will be less than that of a solid square because the circular hole reduces the material.\n- The polar moment of inertia \\(J_b\\) will also be less than that of a solid square for the same reason.\n\n### Comparison:\n- For both sections, the presence of holes reduces the moments of inertia compared to their solid counterparts.\n- Therefore, the polar moments of inertia \\(J_a\\) and \\(J_b\\) will be less than the moments of inertia \\(I_a\\) and \\(I_b\\), respectively.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n**B. \\( J_a > I_a; J_b > I_b \\)**\n\nSo, the correct choice is B."
