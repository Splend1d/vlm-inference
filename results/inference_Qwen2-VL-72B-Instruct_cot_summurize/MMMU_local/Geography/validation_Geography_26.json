Overall, block, and sub-block structures\nB. Giant thick layered, thick layered, medium thick layered, interbedded, and thin layered structures\nC. Weathering unloading structure and weathering fragment structure\nD. Inlaid fragmented structure and fragmented structure\n\nAccording to the code mentioned (GB 50287-99), the classification of rock mass structures typically includes various types such as layered, blocky, and fragmented structures. However, the specific terms used in the code may vary slightly from the options provided.\n\nUpon reviewing the options, it appears that Option C (\"Weathering unloading structure and weathering fragment structure\") is less likely to be directly included in the standard classification of rock mass structures as described in the code. The other options (A, B, and D) seem to align more closely with typical classifications found in geological investigations related to water resources and hydropower engineering.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Weathering unloading structure and weathering fragment structure"
