The depth of penetration (in millimeters) can be used to classify the soil according to its consistency.\n\nHere are the general classifications based on the depth of penetration:\n\n- **Hard Plastic**: Typically less than 5 mm\n- **Plastic**: Typically between 5 and 10 mm\n- **Soft Plastic**: Typically between 10 and 20 mm\n- **Flow Molding**: Typically more than 20 mm\n\nGiven that the depth of penetration is 6 mm, the soil falls into the \"Plastic\" category.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB.
