Common geological hazards include:\n\n- **Land subsidence**: The sinking or settling of land.\n- **Ground collapse**: The sudden failure of the ground surface.\n- **Ground fissures**: Cracks in the ground that can form during earthquakes or other geological events.\n- **Earthquake**: A seismic event caused by the movement of tectonic plates.\n\nGiven these definitions, all options except for one are typically considered geological hazards:\n\nA. Land subsidence - This is a geological hazard.\nB. Ground collapse - This is a geological hazard.\nC. Ground fissures - This is a geological hazard.\nD. Earthquake - This is a geological hazard.\n\nHowever, the question asks which option is **not** included in the hazard assessment of geological hazards. Since all the listed options are indeed geological hazards, it seems there might be a misunderstanding in the question's intent or a misinterpretation of the options.\n\nIf we consider the context and typical classifications, all listed options (A, B, C, and D) are indeed geological hazards. Therefore, based on the provided information, none of the options should be excluded from a geological hazard assessment.\n\nHowever, if we strictly follow the question's format and assume there might be an error in the question itself, then the correct answer would be:\n\nNone of the above (A, B, C, or D) is not included in the hazard assessment of geological hazards."
