Since the 2A current source is pushing 2A into the node and 1A is going through the middle branch, the remaining current must go through the left branch.\n     - Therefore, \\( I_1 = 2A - 1A = 1A \\).\n\n6. **Current \\( I_2 \\):**\n   - \\( I_2 \\) is the current through the right branch. The 1.5A current source is pushing 1.5A through this branch.\n     - Therefore, \\( I_2 = 1.5A \\).\n\nSo, the currents \\( I_1 \\) and \\( I_2 \\) are respectively 1A and 1.5A.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nD. 1A, and 1.5A"
