The graph shows different categories of species (Mammals, Birds, Reptiles, Amphibians, Fishes, Plants) and their percentages in three different danger levels represented by yellow, blue, and orange.\n\n1. **Yellow**: This color represents the highest percentage for most categories, indicating the least severe danger level.\n2. **Blue**: This color represents a moderate percentage, indicating a more severe danger level than yellow but less severe than orange.\n3. **Orange**: This color represents the smallest percentage for most categories, indicating the most severe danger level.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct order from least severe to most severe danger is:\n\n- Yellow: Vulnerable\n- Blue: Endangered\n- Orange: Critical\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA.
