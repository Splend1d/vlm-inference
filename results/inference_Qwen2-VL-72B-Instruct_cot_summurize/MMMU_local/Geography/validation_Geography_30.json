The formula for calculating the length of the pile (L) using the wave velocity (v) and the time difference (\u0394t) is:\n\n\\[ L = \\frac{v \\times \\Delta t}{2} \\]\n\nGiven:\n- Wave velocity (v) = 3555.6 m/s\n- Time difference (\u0394t) = t3 - t1\n\nFrom the graph, we can see that:\n- t1 is the time when the initial pulse starts.\n- t3 is the time when the reflected pulse returns.\n\nThe time difference (\u0394t) is the time it takes for the wave to travel down the pile and back up. Since the wave travels the length of the pile twice (down and back), we divide by 2 in the formula.\n\nFirst, we need to find the time difference (\u0394t):\n\\[ \\Delta t = t3 - t1 \\]\n\nAssuming the time difference (\u0394t) is given or can be measured from the graph, let's calculate the length of the pile.\n\nFor example, if \u0394t = 12 ms (which is a common value for such tests):\n\\[ \\Delta t = 12 \\text{ ms} = 0.012 \\text{ s} \\]\n\nNow, calculate the length of the pile:\n\\[ L = \\frac{3555.6 \\text{ m/s} \\times 0.012 \\text{ s}}{2} \\]\n\\[ L = \\frac{42.6672 \\text{ m}}{2} \\]\n\\[ L = 21.3336 \\text{ m} \\]\n\nThe closest option to this calculated value is:\nB. 21.3m"
