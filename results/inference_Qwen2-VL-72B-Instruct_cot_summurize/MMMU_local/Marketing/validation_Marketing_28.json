However, the visual inspection suggests that the third quartiles might be different due to the different shapes and distributions of the data.\n\nTherefore, the statement \"We cannot determine if any of the third quartiles for both graphs is different\" is:\n\n**B. False.**\n\nThe visual inspection alone does not provide enough information to conclusively determine the third quartiles, but it does suggest that they might be different based on the shape and distribution of the data."
