The mean is one measure of central tendency, and it can be visually estimated from the histograms by looking at the balance point of each distribution.\n\n1. **Figure (a)**: The tallest bar is at value 3, indicating that this value has the highest frequency. The distribution appears to be slightly skewed to the right.\n2. **Figure (b)**: The tallest bar is at value 5, indicating that this value has the highest frequency. The distribution appears to be slightly skewed to the left.\n\nFrom visual inspection:\n- The mean of Figure (a) seems to be around 3.\n- The mean of Figure (b) seems to be around 4.\n\nGiven these observations, it appears that the means of the two distributions are different. Therefore, the statement \"We cannot determine if any of the means for both graphs is different\" is false.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nB. False."
