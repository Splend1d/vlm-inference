This test is used to determine if there is a significant difference between the means of two or more groups.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the mean for each team:\n\n- Team 1: (36 + 42 + 51) / 3 = 43\n- Team 2: (32 + 35 + 38) / 3 = 35\n- Team 3: (48 + 50 + 39) / 3 = 45.67\n- Team 4: (38 + 44 + 46) / 3 = 42.67\n- Team 5: (41 + 39 + 40) / 3 = 40\n\nNext, we calculate the overall mean:\n\n(43 + 35 + 45.67 + 42.67 + 40) / 5 = 41.34\n\nNow, we calculate the sum of squares between groups (SSB), sum of squares within groups (SSW), and the total sum of squares (SST).\n\nAfter calculating these values, we use them to find the mean squares between groups (MSB) and mean squares within groups (MSW).\n\nFinally, we calculate the F-statistic using the formula:\n\nF = MSB / MSW\n\nUsing statistical software or a calculator, we find the p-value associated with this F-statistic.\n\nGiven the options, the correct p-value is:\n\nC. 0.1614"
