We will use a paired t-test since we are comparing the same individuals' cholesterol levels before and after the diet.\n\n### Step 1: State the null and alternative hypotheses\n\n- Null hypothesis (H0): There is no significant difference in cholesterol levels before and after the diet.\n- Alternative hypothesis (H1): There is a significant difference in cholesterol levels before and after the diet.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the differences\n\nFirst, calculate the differences between the ending and starting cholesterol levels for each individual:\n\n| Starting Cholesterol | Ending Cholesterol | Difference |\n|----------------------|--------------------|------------|\n| 140                  | 140                | 0          |\n| 220                  | 230                | 10         |\n| 110                  | 120                | 10         |\n| 240                  | 220                | -20        |\n| 200                  | 190                | -10        |\n| 180                  | 150                | -30        |\n| 190                  | 200                | 10         |\n| 360                  | 300                | -60        |\n| 280                  | 300                | 20         |\n| 260                  | 240                | -20        |\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the mean and standard deviation of the differences\n\nMean difference (\\(\\bar{d}\\)):\n\\[\n\\bar{d} = \\frac{\\sum d}{n} = \\frac{0 + 10 + 10 - 20 - 10 - 30 + 10 - 60 + 20 - 20}{10} = \\frac{-100}{10} = -10\n\\]\n\nStandard deviation of the differences (s):\n\\[\ns = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum (d - \\bar{d})^2}{n-1}}\n\\]\nCalculate each squared difference:\n- \\( (0 - (-10))^2 = 100 \\)\n- \\( (10 - (-10))^2 = 400 \\)\n- \\( (10 - (-10))^2 = 400 \\)\n- \\( (-20 - (-10))^2 = 100 \\)\n- \\( (-10 - (-10))^2 = 0 \\)\n- \\( (-30 - (-10))^2 = 400 \\)\n- \\( (10 - (-10))^2 = 400 \\)\n- \\( (-60 - (-10))^2 = 2500 \\)\n- \\( (20 - (-10))^2 = 900 \\)\n- \\( (-20 - (-10))^2 = 100 \\)\n\nSum of squared differences:\n\\[\n\\sum (d - \\bar{d})^2 = 100 + 400 + 400 + 100 + 0 + 400 + 400 + 2500 + 900 + 100 = 5200\n\\]\n\nStandard deviation:\n\\[\ns = \\sqrt{\\frac{5200}{9}} = \\sqrt{577.78} \\approx 24.04\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the t-statistic\n\n\\[\nt = \\frac{\\bar{d}}{s/\\sqrt{n}} = \\frac{-10}{24.04/\\sqrt{10}} = \\frac{-10}{7.61} \\approx -1.31\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Determine the critical t-value\n\nFor a two-tailed test with a significance level of 0.05 and 9 degrees of freedom (n-1), the critical t-value is approximately \u00b12.262.\n\n### Step 6: Compare the t-statistic to the critical t-value\n\nThe calculated t-statistic (-1.31) is less than the critical t-value (\u00b12.262).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSince the calculated t-statistic does not exceed the critical t-value, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. Therefore, there is insufficient evidence to conclude that the medication lowered cholesterol levels after 12 weeks.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nA. there is insufficient evidence to conclude that the medication lowered cholesterol levels after 12 weeks"
