Cash: $20,450\n2. Accounts Receivable: $16,032\n3. Prepaid Insurance: $9,444\n4. Equipment: $29,000\n5. Land: $34,000\n\nTotal Assets = $20,450 + $16,032 + $9,444 + $29,000 + $34,000 = $109,926\n\n**Total Liabilities and Equity:**\n1. Accounts Payable: $9,000\n2. Notes Payable: $48,000\n3. Common Stock: $24,000\n4. Retained Earnings: $31,315\n\nTotal Liabilities and Equity = $9,000 + $48,000 + $24,000 + $31,315 = $112,315\n\nSince the total assets must equal the total liabilities and equity, we can set up the equation:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total Assets} = \\text{Total Liabilities and Equity} \\]\n\n\\[ 109,926 = 112,315 - \\text{Dividends} \\]\n\nSolving for Dividends:\n\n\\[ \\text{Dividends} = 112,315 - 109,926 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Dividends} = 2,389 \\]\n\nHowever, none of the provided options match this calculation. It seems there might be an error in the interpretation or calculation. Given the options provided, the closest match would be:\n\nC. $12,000\n\nBut based on the calculations, the correct answer should be $2,389, which is not listed among the options. Therefore, there might be an error in the question or the provided options."
