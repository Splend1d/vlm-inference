However, since the variable manufacturing overhead is already given per unit ($2), it does not need to be recalculated for different levels of production.\n\nTherefore, the total per unit manufacturing overhead costs when 30,000 units are produced are:\n- Fixed manufacturing overhead per unit = $6\n- Variable manufacturing overhead per unit = $2\n\nTotal per unit manufacturing overhead costs = $6 + $2 = $8\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nC. $8"
