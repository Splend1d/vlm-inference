Net Cash Provided by or Used in Investing Activities\n\nInvesting activities typically include purchases of long-term assets and sales of long-term assets. From the given data:\n\n- Purchase of bus: $33,000 (outflow)\n- Sales of old equipment: $72,000 (inflow)\n\nNet cash from investing activities = Inflows - Outflows\n= $72,000 - $33,000\n= $39,000\n\n### 2. Net Increase or Decrease in Cash for the Year\n\nTo calculate this, we need to consider all cash inflows and outflows:\n\n- Cash dividend: $80,000 (outflow)\n- Purchase of bus: $33,000 (outflow)\n- Interest paid on debt: $25,000 (outflow)\n- Sales of old equipment: $72,000 (inflow)\n- Repurchase of stock: $55,000 (outflow)\n- Cash payments to suppliers: $95,000 (outflow)\n- Cash collections from customers: $300,000 (inflow)\n\nTotal cash inflows = $72,000 + $300,000 = $372,000\nTotal cash outflows = $80,000 + $33,000 + $25,000 + $55,000 + $95,000 = $288,000\n\nNet increase in cash = Total cash inflows - Total cash outflows\n= $372,000 - $288,000\n= $84,000\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe correct answer is:\nA. (1)$39,000 ; (2)84,000"
