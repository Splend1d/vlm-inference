Since the variable manufacturing overhead is given as $2 per unit, it will remain $2 per unit regardless of the number of units produced.\n\nTherefore, the total per unit manufacturing overhead costs when 15,000 units are produced are:\n- Fixed manufacturing overhead per unit = $6\n- Variable manufacturing overhead per unit = $2\n\nTotal per unit manufacturing overhead costs = $6 + $2 = $8\n\nHowever, this option is not listed in the choices provided. It seems there might be a misunderstanding in the question or the options provided. Based on the calculation, the correct answer should be $8, but since this option is not available, none of the provided options (A, B, C, D) match the calculated value."
