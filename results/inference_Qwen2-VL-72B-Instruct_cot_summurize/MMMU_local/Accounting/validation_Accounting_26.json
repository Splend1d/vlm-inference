Calculate the new contribution margin per unit.\n3. Use the new contribution margin per unit to find the new break-even point in units.\n4. Calculate the new break-even point in dollars.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the new sales price per unit\n\nThe current sales price per unit is $90. A 10% increase would be:\n\\[ \\text{New sales price} = \\$90 + (\\$90 \\times 0.10) = \\$90 + \\$9 = \\$99 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the new contribution margin per unit\n\nThe variable cost per unit remains the same at $40. The new contribution margin per unit is:\n\\[ \\text{New contribution margin per unit} = \\text{New sales price per unit} - \\text{Variable cost per unit} \\]\n\\[ \\text{New contribution margin per unit} = \\$99 - \\$40 = \\$59 \\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the new break-even point in units\n\nThe fixed costs remain the same at $20,650. The new break-even point in units is calculated as:\n\\[ \\text{Break-even point in units} = \\frac{\\text{Fixed costs}}{\\text{Contribution margin per unit}} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Break-even point in units} = \\frac{\\$20,650}{\\$59} \\approx 350 \\text{ units} \\]\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the new break-even point in dollars\n\nThe new break-even point in dollars is calculated as:\n\\[ \\text{Break-even point in dollars} = \\text{Break-even point in units} \\times \\text{New sales price per unit} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Break-even point in dollars} = 350 \\times \\$99 = \\$34,650 \\]\n\nTherefore, the new break-even point is approximately 350 units and $34,650.\n\nThe closest answer is:\nA. 350 units and $34,647.65"
