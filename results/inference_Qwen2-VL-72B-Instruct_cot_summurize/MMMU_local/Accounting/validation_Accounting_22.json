The formula is:\n\n\\[ Z = 1.2X_1 + 1.4X_2 + 3.3X_3 + 0.6X_4 + 1.0X_5 \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( X_1 = \\frac{\\text{Working Capital}}{\\text{Total Assets}} \\)\n- \\( X_2 = \\frac{\\text{Retained Earnings}}{\\text{Total Assets}} \\)\n- \\( X_3 = \\frac{\\text{Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT)}}{\\text{Total Assets}} \\)\n- \\( X_4 = \\frac{\\text{Market Value of Equity}}{\\text{Total Liabilities}} \\)\n- \\( X_5 = \\frac{\\text{Sales}}{\\text{Total Assets}} \\)\n\nHowever, we don't have all the necessary data to calculate \\( X_4 \\) and \\( X_5 \\). We only have the following data:\n\n- Total assets: $73,000\n- EBIT: $7,900\n- Net working capital: $4,200\n- Book value of equity: $18,000\n- Accumulated retained earnings: $16,000\n- Total liabilities: $64,000\n\nLet's calculate \\( X_1 \\), \\( X_2 \\), and \\( X_3 \\):\n\n1. \\( X_1 = \\frac{\\text{Net Working Capital}}{\\text{Total Assets}} = \\frac{4,200}{73,000} \\approx 0.0575 \\)\n2. \\( X_2 = \\frac{\\text{Accumulated Retained Earnings}}{\\text{Total Assets}} = \\frac{16,000}{73,000} \\approx 0.2192 \\)\n3. \\( X_3 = \\frac{\\text{EBIT}}{\\text{Total Assets}} = \\frac{7,900}{73,000} \\approx 0.1082 \\)\n\nNow, let's plug these values into the Z-score formula:\n\n\\[ Z = 1.2(0.0575) + 1.4(0.2192) + 3.3(0.1082) \\]\n\\[ Z = 0.0690 + 0.3069 + 0.3569 \\]\n\\[ Z = 0.7328 \\]\n\nSince we don't have the values for \\( X_4 \\) and \\( X_5 \\), we cannot complete the full calculation of the Z-score.
