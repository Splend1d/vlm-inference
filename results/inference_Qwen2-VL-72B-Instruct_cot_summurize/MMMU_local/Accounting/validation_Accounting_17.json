Physical count of supplies inventory remaining at end of period: $2,150\n   - The original supplies balance was $5,000. After adjusting for the physical count, the new balance should be $2,150.\n   - Adjustment: $5,000 - $2,150 = $2,850 (decrease in supplies)\n\n2. Taxes payable at end of period: $3,850\n   - This is an additional liability that needs to be added to the accounts payable.\n\nNow, let's calculate the adjusted total:\n\n- Accounts payable: $10,075 + $3,850 = $13,925\n- Accounts receivable: $15,500 (no change)\n- Cash: $64,575 (no change)\n- Common stock: $31,000 (no change)\n- Fees earned revenue: $82,000 (no change)\n- Operating expense: $38,000 (no change)\n- Supplies: $5,000 - $2,850 = $2,150\n\nFinally, sum up all the adjusted balances:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total} = \\$13,925 + \\$15,500 + \\$64,575 + \\$31,000 + \\$82,000 + \\$38,000 + \\$2,150 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Total} = \\$252,150 \\]\n\nHowever, this total includes both assets and liabilities. To find the net balance, we subtract the total liabilities from the total assets:\n\n- Total assets: $15,500 + $64,575 + $31,000 + $82,000 + $2,150 = $195,225\n- Total liabilities: $13,925\n\n\\[ \\text{Net balance} = \\$195,225 - \\$13,925 = \\$181,300 \\]\n\nNone of the provided options match this calculation. It seems there might be an error in the interpretation or calculation. Given the options provided, none of them directly match the calculated net balance. Therefore, based on the given data and adjustments, the correct answer cannot be determined from the provided options."
