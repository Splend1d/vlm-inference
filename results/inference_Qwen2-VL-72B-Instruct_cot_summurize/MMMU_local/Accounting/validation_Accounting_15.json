We can calculate the slope of the line of best fit to estimate the relationship.\n\nUsing the formula for the slope (m) of a line:\n\\[ m = \\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x} \\]\n\nWe can choose two points to calculate the slope. For example, using January and March:\n- January: (12,000, $7,760)\n- March: (1,000, $6,000)\n\n\\[ m = \\frac{7760 - 6000}{12000 - 1000} = \\frac{1760}{11000} = 0.16 \\]\n\nSo, for every additional invoice processed, the overtime wages increase by approximately $0.16.\n\nNow, we can use this slope to predict the overtime wages for 6,500 invoices. We need to find the base wage and then add the incremental cost for 6,500 invoices.\n\nLet's assume the base wage is the minimum wage paid in March when only 1,000 invoices were processed:\n\\[ \\text{Base Wage} = \\$6,000 \\]\n\nFor 6,500 invoices:\n\\[ \\text{Incremental Cost} = 6500 \\times 0.16 = \\$1,040 \\]\n\nAdding the incremental cost to the base wage:\n\\[ \\text{Overtime Wages} = \\$6,000 + \\$1,040 = \\$7,040 \\]\n\nHowever, this value is not listed in the options. It seems there might be an error in the calculation or interpretation. Let's re-evaluate the data and the approach.\n\nUpon closer inspection, it appears that the relationship might not be perfectly linear, and the slope calculated might not accurately represent the entire dataset. Given the options provided, we should look for a value close to our initial calculation but within the range of the given options.\n\nThe closest option to our calculated value (\\$7,040) is:\n\nC. $5,040\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. $5,040"
