The price of a put option increases as the underlying stock price decreases because the put option gives the holder the right to sell the stock at a fixed price (the strike price), which becomes more valuable if the stock price falls.\n\nGiven the parameters for both options:\n- Both options have the same time to expiration (\\( T = 0.5 \\) years), strike price (\\( X = 50 \\)), and volatility (\\( \\sigma = 0.2 \\)).\n- The only difference is the price of the options: Option A is priced at $10, and Option B is priced at $12.\n\nSince the put option price is directly related to the underlying stock price, the put option with the higher price (Option B) must be written on the stock with the lower price. This is because a lower stock price makes the put option more valuable.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. B"
