Cash sales: $3,250 (increase in cash)\n2. Payments for inventory: $1,760 (decrease in cash)\n3. Investments by owners: $3,000 (increase in cash)\n4. Supplies used: $175 (decrease in cash)\n5. Cash withdrawals: $260 (decrease in cash)\n6. Inventory received: $2,500 (no impact on cash as it's an exchange of assets)\n7. Wages paid: $2,390 (decrease in cash)\n\nLet's calculate the net change in cash:\n\nNet increase in cash = Cash sales + Investments by owners - Payments for inventory - Supplies used - Cash withdrawals - Wages paid\n\nNet increase in cash = $3,250 + $3,000 - $1,760 - $175 - $260 - $2,390\n\nNow, let's do the math:\n\nNet increase in cash = $3,250 + $3,000 - $1,760 - $175 - $260 - $2,390\nNet increase in cash = $6,250 - $4,585\nNet increase in cash = $1,665\n\nNow, we add this net increase to the initial cash balance on December 1:\n\nDecember 31 cash balance = Initial cash balance + Net increase in cash\nDecember 31 cash balance = $4,250 + $1,665\nDecember 31 cash balance = $5,915\n\nNone of the provided options match this calculation. It seems there might be an error in the question or the options provided. Based on the calculations, the correct answer should be $5,915, but since this option is not available, we cannot select any of the given options."
