A common approach is to use the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), but since we don't have all the necessary inputs (e.g., risk-free rate, beta, market return), we will assume a reasonable required return for simplicity. Let's assume a required return of 10%.\n\nUsing the DDM formula:\n\\[ \\text{Intrinsic Value} = \\frac{0.80}{0.10 - 0.06} = \\frac{0.80}{0.04} = \\$20 \\]\n\nThis matches the current stock price of Denham, which suggests our assumptions are reasonable.\n\nNext, we calculate the total value of Denham:\n\\[ \\text{Total Value of Denham} = \\text{Stock Price} \\times \\text{Number of Shares} = \\$20 \\times 600,000 = \\$12,000,000 \\]\n\nNow, we need to determine how many shares of Corton would be required to match this value. The stock price of Corton is $90.\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of Corton Shares Required} = \\frac{\\text{Total Value of Denham}}{\\text{Stock Price of Corton}} = \\frac{12,000,000}{90} = 133,333.33 \\]\n\nSince we can't issue fractional shares, we round to the nearest whole number, which is 133,334 shares.\n\nTherefore, the cost of the merger through a stock offer, when the expected growth rate is not changed by the merger, is approximately 133,334 shares of Corton.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nB. the cost of merger through stocks offer is $4,000,000"
