It seems there might be an error in the calculation or the interpretation of the given data. Let's recheck the steps and ensure the correct approach is used.\n\nGiven the complexity and potential for error in manual calculations, it's important to verify the steps carefully. If the calculation is correct, then none of the provided options match the calculated value.
