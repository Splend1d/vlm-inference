This means the object is likely symmetrical about its vertical axis.\n\nNow, let's analyze the options for the left view:\n\n- **Option A:** Shows a square hole, which does not match the circular hole seen in the top view.\n- **Option B:** Shows a circular hole, which matches the circular hole seen in the top view.\n- **Option C:** Shows a square hole, which does not match the circular hole seen in the top view.\n- **Option D:** Shows a square hole, which does not match the circular hole seen in the top view.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct left view is the one that shows a circular hole, which matches the circular hole seen in the top view.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB.
