This is correct for a left-hand thread.\n- **Option C**: The thread is labeled with two lines and an arrow pointing outward. This is incorrect because it should be a single line for a right-hand thread or two lines with an arrow pointing inward for a left-hand thread.\n- **Option D**: The thread is labeled with a single line and an arrow pointing inward.
