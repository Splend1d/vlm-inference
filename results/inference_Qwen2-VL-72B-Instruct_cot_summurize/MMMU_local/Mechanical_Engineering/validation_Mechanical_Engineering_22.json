This means:\n\\[ F_p + F_a \\geq F_a \\]\n\nSince \\( F_a \\) varies from 0 to 8000 lb, the maximum value of \\( F_a \\) is 8000 lb. Therefore, the minimum preload \\( F_p \\) should be:\n\\[ F_p \\geq 8000 \\text{ lb} \\]\n\n(b) Minimum force in the plates for the fluctuating load when the preload is 8500 lb:\n\nWhen the preload \\( F_p \\) is 8500 lb and the applied load \\( F_a \\) is at its maximum (8000 lb), the total force on the bolt is:\n\\[ F_{total} = F_p + F_a = 8500 \\text{ lb} + 8000 \\text{ lb} = 16500 \\text{ lb} \\]\n\nThe force distribution between the bolt and the clamped plates depends on their relative stiffnesses. The ratio of the forces in the bolt and the plates is given by the inverse of their stiffnesses:\n\\[ \\frac{F_b}{F_c} = \\frac{k_c}{k_b} = 6 \\]\n\nLet \\( F_b \\) be the force in the bolt and \\( F_c \\) be the force in the plates. Then:\n\\[ F_b + F_c = F_{total} \\]\n\\[ F_b = 6F_c \\]\n\nSubstituting \\( F_b = 6F_c \\) into the total force equation:\n\\[ 6F_c + F_c = 16500 \\text{ lb} \\]\n\\[ 7F_c = 16500 \\text{ lb} \\]\n\\[ F_c = \\frac{16500 \\text{ lb}}{7} \\approx 2357.14 \\text{ lb} \\]\n\nTherefore, the minimum force in the plates is approximately 2357.14 lb.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\nB. 6857lb,1643lb"
