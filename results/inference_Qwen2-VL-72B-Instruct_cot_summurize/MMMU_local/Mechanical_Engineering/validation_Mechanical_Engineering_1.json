The object has a cylindrical shape with a hole on one side.\n2. The A-A section line is a vertical line passing through the center of the cylinder and the hole.\n\nWhen the object is cut along the A-A line:\n- The front half of the cylinder will be visible.\n- The hole will be visible as a circular opening.\n\nNow, let's examine each option:\n\nA. This option shows a solid cylinder without any hole.\nB. This option shows a cylinder with a hole, but the hole is not aligned correctly with the A-A section line.\nC. This option shows a cylinder with a hole that is correctly aligned with the A-A section line.\nD. This option shows a solid cylinder without any hole.\n\nThe correct section view should show the cylinder with the hole correctly aligned with the A-A section line.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC.
