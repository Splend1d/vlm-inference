The top section is smaller and to the right, the middle section is larger and to the left, and the bottom section is in the middle.\n2. **Option (b)**: This option shows a view with two distinct sections. The top section is on the left, and the bottom section is on the right.\n3. **Option (c)**: This option shows a view with two distinct sections. The top section is on the left, and the bottom section is in the middle.\n4. **Option (d)**: This option shows a view with two distinct sections. The top section is on the left, and the bottom section is on the right.\n\nGiven the original image, the left view should show the following:\n- The top section is on the left.\n- The bottom section is on the right.\n\nComparing this with the options, **Option (d)** matches the description of the left view.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD.
