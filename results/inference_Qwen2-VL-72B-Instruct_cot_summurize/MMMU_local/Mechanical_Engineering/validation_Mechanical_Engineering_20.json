It seems there might have been an error in the interpretation or calculation. Let's re-evaluate the load increase based on the correct understanding:\n\nFor point a:\n- Current stress = 200 MPa\n- Required stress = 400 MPa\n- Load increase factor = 400 MPa / 200 MPa = 2\n\nSo, the correct test load at which the frame will experience initial yielding is:\n4 kN * 2 = 8 kN\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\nD. 8kN"
