The front view (b) shows a rectangle with two vertical slots.\n4. The front view (c) shows a rectangle with two curved slots.\n5. The front view (d) shows a rectangle with two vertical slots that are not aligned with the center.\n\nWhen viewed from the left, the object should show the circular hole and the vertical lines passing through it, as seen in the top view.\n\n- Option A shows a circle with two vertical lines passing through it, which matches the top view.\n- Option B does not match the top view.\n- Option C does not match the top view.\n- Option D does not match the top view.\n\nTherefore, the correct left view is:\n\nA.
