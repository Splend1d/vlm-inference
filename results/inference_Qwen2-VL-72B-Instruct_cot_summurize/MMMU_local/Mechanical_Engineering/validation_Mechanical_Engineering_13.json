The front view shows a symmetrical object with two circular features on either side.\n2. The left view should show these circular features as well, but from the side.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\n- Option (a): Shows two circular features on either side, which matches the front view.\n- Option (b): Shows two circular features on either side, similar to (a).\n- Option (c): Shows two circular features on either side, similar to (a) and (b).\n- Option (d): Shows two circular features on either side, similar to (a), (b), and (c).\n\nAll options (a), (b), (c), and (d) appear to be correct based on the front view provided. However, since the question asks for the correct left view, and all options seem to match, it is likely that there might be an error in the question or the options provided.\n\nGiven the information and the options, the correct answer would be:\n\nD.
