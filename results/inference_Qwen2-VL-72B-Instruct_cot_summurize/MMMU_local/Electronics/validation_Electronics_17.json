The initial conditions at \\( t = 0 \\) are important because they determine the initial current through the inductor.\n\n1. **Initial Conditions:**\n   - At \\( t = 0 \\), the switch is closed, and the circuit is in steady state.\n   - The voltage across the inductor is zero because there is no change in current.\n   - The current through the inductor just before \\( t = 0 \\) is determined by the voltage divider rule:\n     \\[\n     I_0 = \\frac{100V}{30\u03a9 + 20\u03a9 + 4\u03a9} = \\frac{100V}{54\u03a9} = \\frac{100}{54} A \\approx 1.85A\n     \\]\n\n2. **After \\( t = 0 \\):**\n   - The circuit becomes source-free, and the inductor will discharge through the resistors.\n   - The equivalent resistance seen by the inductor is the parallel combination of the three resistors:\n     \\[\n     R_{eq} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{30\u03a9} + \\frac{1}{20\u03a9} + \\frac{1}{4\u03a9}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{30} + \\frac{1}{20} + \\frac{1}{4}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{2 + 3 + 15}{60}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{20}{60}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{3}} = 3\u03a9\n     \\]\n\n3. **Time Constant:**\n   - The time constant (\\( \\tau \\)) of the RL circuit is given by:\n     \\[\n     \\tau = \\frac{L}{R_{eq}} = \\frac{5H}{3\u03a9} = \\frac{5}{3} s \\approx 1.67s\n     \\]\n\n4. **Voltage Across the Inductor:**\n   - The voltage across the inductor decays exponentially with time:\n     \\[\n     v(t) = V_0 e^{-\\frac{t}{\\tau}}\n     \\]\n   - The initial voltage across the inductor is zero, but the current through it is \\( I_0 \\). The voltage across the inductor can be found using Ohm's law:\n     \\[\n     V_0 = I_0 R_{eq} = 1.85A \\times 3\u03a9 = 5.55V\n     \\]\n\n5. **Expression for \\( v(t) \\):**\n   - Substituting the values into the exponential decay formula:\n     \\[\n     v(t) = 5.55 e^{-\\frac{t}{1.67}}\n     \\]\n\nComparing this with the given options, the closest match is:\n\nA. \\( 10e^{-0.8t} V \\)\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nA. \\( 10e^{-0.8t} V \\)"
