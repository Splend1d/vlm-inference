The pedigree shows that individuals with the disease are shaded.\n\n2. **Determine the mode of inheritance**: Since the pedigree is completely penetrant, any individual with the disease must have at least one copy of the disease allele (A).\n\n3. **Analyze Individual 9**:\n   - Individual 9 is not shaded, indicating they do not have the disease.\n   - Individual 9 has two parents: Individual 3 (shaded) and Individual 4 (not shaded).\n   - Individual 3 has the disease, so they must be heterozygous (Aa) because if they were homozygous recessive (aa), they would not have the disease.\n   - Individual 4 does not have the disease, so they must be either AA or Aa.\n\n4. **Inheritance from parents**:\n   - Since Individual 3 is Aa, they can pass on either A or a to their offspring.\n   - Since Individual 4 is either AA or Aa, they can pass on either A or a to their offspring.\n\n5. **Possible genotypes for Individual 9**:\n   - If Individual 4 is AA, Individual 9 could be AA or Aa.\n   - If Individual 4 is Aa, Individual 9 could also be AA or Aa.\n\nSince Individual 9 does not have the disease, they cannot be aa. Therefore, the possible genotypes for Individual 9 are AA or Aa.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nC. Aa or AA"
