This image shows a disaccharide with a structure that does not match maltose.\nB. This image shows a disaccharide with a structure that does not match maltose.\nC. This image shows a disaccharide with a structure that matches maltose, as it has two glucose units linked by an \u03b1(1\u21924) glycosidic bond.\nD. This image shows a disaccharide with a structure that does not match maltose.\nE. This image shows a disaccharide with a structure that does not match maltose.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. <image 3>"
