In SDS-PAGE, proteins are separated based on their size. The negatively charged SDS binds to the proteins, giving them a uniform negative charge and allowing them to migrate through the gel under the influence of an electric field.\n\nIn SDS-PAGE:\n- The cathode is where the negatively charged proteins start, typically at the top of the gel.\n- The anode is where the positively charged end is, typically at the bottom of the gel.\n\nGiven this information, the anode is located at the bottom of the gel, which corresponds to letter B.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nB.
