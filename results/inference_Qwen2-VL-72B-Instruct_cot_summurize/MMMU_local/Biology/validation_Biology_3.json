This process is driven by the concentration gradient of glucose and does not require energy.\n\nIf the pH outside the cell decreases, it means that the extracellular environment becomes more acidic. Changes in pH can affect the structure and function of proteins, including transport proteins. A decrease in pH could potentially alter the conformation of the transport protein, making it less effective at transporting glucose.\n\nGiven this information, the correct answer would be:\n\nB. decrease\n\nA decrease in pH outside the cell could lead to a decrease in the amount of amino acids (or glucose, as shown in the image) transported into the cell due to potential changes in the transport protein's function."
