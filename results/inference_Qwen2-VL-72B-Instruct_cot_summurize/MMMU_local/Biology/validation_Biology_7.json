The ribosome consists of two subunits: a large subunit and a small subunit.\n\n- The large ribosomal subunit is typically depicted as the larger of the two subunits in diagrams.\n- In the given image, the large ribosomal subunit is the larger structure that contains the A, P, and E sites for tRNA binding.\n\nLooking at the options:\n- Arrow A points to a small structure, not the large subunit.\n- Arrow B points to a small structure, not the large subunit.\n- Arrow C points to a small structure, not the large subunit.\n- Arrow D points to a small structure, not the large subunit.\n- Arrow E points to a small structure, not the large subunit.\n- Arrow F points to a small structure, not the large subunit.\n- Arrow G points to a small structure, not the large subunit.\n- Arrow H points to a small structure, not the large subunit.\n- Arrow I points to the larger structure, which is the large ribosomal subunit.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nI.
