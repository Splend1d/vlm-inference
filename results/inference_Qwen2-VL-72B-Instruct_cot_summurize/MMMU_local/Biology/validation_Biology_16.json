Ionic bonds typically form between metals (which tend to lose electrons) and nonmetals (which tend to gain electrons).\n\n- Group 1 elements (alkali metals) are highly reactive metals that readily lose their outermost electron.\n- Group 17 elements (halogens) are highly reactive nonmetals that readily gain an electron.\n\nGiven this information, the combination of a Group 1 element and a Group 17 element will form a strong ionic bond because the metal will donate its electron to the nonmetal.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Group 1 and Group 17"
