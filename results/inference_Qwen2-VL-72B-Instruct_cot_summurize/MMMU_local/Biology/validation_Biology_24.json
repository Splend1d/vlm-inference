Fluorescent microscopy involves the use of fluorescent dyes or proteins that emit light when excited by specific wavelengths of light. This results in images with bright, colorful spots or patterns.\n\nLet's analyze each image:\n\nA. The first image shows cells with distinct cell walls and nuclei, stained in shades of purple and pink. This is typical of staining techniques used in light microscopy but does not show the bright, colorful spots characteristic of fluorescent microscopy.\n\nB. The second image shows a detailed view of cellular structures with some color enhancement. The colors are more muted and do not exhibit the bright, glowing spots typical of fluorescent microscopy.\n\nC. The third image shows a pattern of bright, colorful spots on a dark background. This is indicative of fluorescent microscopy, where fluorescent markers highlight specific structures or molecules.\n\nTherefore, the image produced by fluorescent microscopy is:\n\nC. <image 3>"
