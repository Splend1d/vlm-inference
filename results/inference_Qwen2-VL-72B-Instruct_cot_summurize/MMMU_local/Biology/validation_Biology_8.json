Flight Path A: the crow has a wider view of his surroundings to assure that another bird will not steal the whelk\nB. Flight Path A: the crow is maximizing the height to drop the whelk\nC. Flight Path A: the crow is adding force to the downward movement to the whelk by flying higher\nD. Flight Path B: the crow can see where the whelk lands\nE.

This path allows the whelk to fall from a greater height, which increases the impact force when it hits the ground. The increased force is more likely to break the whelk shell, making it easier for the crow to access the soft body inside.\n\nFlight Path B involves the crow flying lower and then dropping the whelk. While this path might allow the crow to see where the whelk lands, it does not provide the same level of impact force as Flight Path A due to the lower height.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most efficient and effective flight path for the crow to break the whelk shell would be:\n\n**C. Flight Path A: the crow is adding force to the downward movement to the whelk by flying higher**\n\nThis option best supports the answer because it directly addresses the need for increased impact force to break the whelk shell."
