However, the mahogany/red heterozygote is mahogany if male and red if female. Here is a pedigree for an Ayrshire family that is of great interest to Farmer MacDonald. (In the pedigree, open circles and squares indicate the mahogany phenotype; filled indicate red.) Although Elmer has long ago become a huge pile of Big Macs, Farmer MacDonald has frozen a good supply of Elmer's semen and has used it to artificially inseminate Elmira.

However, since her offspring include red calves, she must be heterozygous (Mm).\n\n2. **Offspring Genotypes:**\n   - **Elinor and Earnest:** Both are red, indicating they inherited the recessive allele from both parents. Therefore, Elinor and Earnest are both mm.\n   - **Elmira:** Since Elmira is mahogany and her parents are Mm, she could be either MM or Mm. However, since she is mahogany, she must be at least heterozygous (Mm).\n\n3. **Probability Calculation:**\n   - **Elmer's Genotype:** Mm\n   - **Elmira's Genotype:** Mm (since she is mahogany and her parents are Mm)\n\nWhen Elmer (Mm) and Elmira (Mm) mate:\n- The possible genotypes of their offspring are:\n  - MM (mahogany)\n  - Mm (mahogany in males, red in females)\n  - mm (red)\n\nThe Punnett square for this mating would look like this:\n\n|   | M  | m  |\n|---|----|----|\n| M | MM | Mm |\n| m | Mm | mm |\n\nFrom the Punnett square:\n- There is a 1/4 chance of getting MM (mahogany)\n- There is a 1/2 chance of getting Mm (mahogany in males, red in females)\n- There is a 1/4 chance of getting mm (red)\n\nSince we are interested in the probability of a mahogany female calf (which can only occur if the genotype is Mm), we consider the Mm genotype:\n- The probability of getting Mm is 1/2.\n\nTherefore, the probability that Elmira will produce a mahogany female calf is:\n\n**A. 1/2**"
