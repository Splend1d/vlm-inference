There is a lack of dense vegetation, which is typical of higher altitudes or colder regions.\n3. The lower areas have some grassy land, but it is sparse and not lush.\n\nGiven these observations, the most likely biome is:\n\nB. tundra\n\nThe tundra biome is characterized by cold temperatures, short growing seasons, and sparse vegetation, which matches the features seen in the image."
