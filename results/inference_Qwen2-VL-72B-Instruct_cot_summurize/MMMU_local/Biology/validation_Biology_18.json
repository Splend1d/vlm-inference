Note: As shown in <image 1>, the dephosphorylated pRB protein is active in G1 phase. pRB binds to the transcription factor E2F and prevents E2F mediated G1->S transition. The Cyclin D-Cdk4 complex produced during G1, phosphorylates and thereby inactivates pRB. This allows the cell to enter S phase. The p16 protein inhibits the Cyclin D-Cdk4 complex. In which process are the proteins encoded by the target genes of E2F most likely to function? \n\nA. DNA replication\nB. RNA stabilization\nC. Splicing\nD. Transcription\nE. Translation\n"

It activates the transcription of genes necessary for DNA replication and progression into the S phase.\n\n2. **Target Genes of E2F**: The proteins encoded by the target genes of E2F are involved in processes that facilitate DNA replication and the transition from G1 to S phase.\n\nGiven this information, the proteins encoded by the target genes of E2F are most likely to function in:\n\nA. **DNA replication**\n\nThis is because E2F activates genes that are essential for DNA replication, which is the primary event that occurs during the S phase of the cell cycle."
