The Great Wall is known for its defensive purposes, primarily to protect against invasions from nomadic tribes.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. **Defensive walls were successful in preventing borderland nomads from conquering the Han dynasty.**\n   - This statement is not entirely accurate because while the Great Wall did serve as a defense, it did not completely prevent invasions.\n\nB. **The Han government built fortifications to protect the Silk Road.**\n   - While the Great Wall did provide some protection along trade routes, this was not its primary purpose.\n\nC. **Monumental architecture served both a religious and a military purpose in the Qin and Han dynasties.**\n   - There is no evidence in the image or historical context that suggests the Great Wall had a religious purpose.\n\nD. **Fortifications were built to project military power and defend against invasions.**\n   - This is the most accurate statement. The Great Wall was primarily constructed as a defensive structure to protect against invasions and project military power.\n\nTherefore, the historian would most likely use the image as support for option D: **Fortifications were built to project military power and defend against invasions.**"
