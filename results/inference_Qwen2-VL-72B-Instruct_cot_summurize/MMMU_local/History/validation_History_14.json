The map shows the territorial claims of Spanish, Portuguese, British, and French empires in the Americas during a historical period.\n\nA. Joint-stock companies developed in order to monopolize all trade in the region.\n- This statement is not directly supported by the map, which focuses on territorial claims rather than specific economic structures like joint-stock companies.\n\nB. Colonists exported manufactured goods to Europe.\n- This statement is incorrect because colonists typically exported raw materials from the colonies to Europe, where they were processed into manufactured goods.\n\nC. Mercantilist policies were used to expand European economies.\n- This statement is accurate. Mercantilism was a dominant economic policy during the time when these empires were expanding, aiming to increase national wealth and power through government regulation of all aspects of the economy, including trade and manufacturing.\n\nD. Trans-Atlantic trade increased as trade networks in the Indian Ocean basin declined.\n- While trans-Atlantic trade did increase, the map does not provide information about the decline of trade networks in the Indian Ocean basin.\n\nGiven this analysis, the best answer is:\n\nC. Mercantilist policies were used to expand European economies."
