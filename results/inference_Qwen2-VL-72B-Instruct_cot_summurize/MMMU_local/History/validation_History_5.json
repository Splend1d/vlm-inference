Eastern European countries were under Soviet control during the Cold War, which prevented them from joining Western organizations like the EU.\n- **Resistance to the West by fascist governments in those countries**: While some Eastern European countries had authoritarian regimes, this was not the primary reason for their delayed admission to the EU.\n- **The greater effect on those countries of the Great Depression and world wars**: While these events did impact Eastern European countries, they were not the main reason for their delayed admission to the EU.\n\nGiven these considerations, the best explanation for why countries of Eastern Europe were admitted later than other European Union members is:\n\nB. Control of those countries by the Soviet Union until the end of the Cold War"
