British ships did not sail along the west coast of Africa during this period.\nB. British ships did not sail the Atlantic Ocean during this period.\nC. British ships did not sail the Pacific Ocean during this period.\nD. British ships did not sail in the Indian Ocean during this period.\n"

British ships did not sail along the west coast of Africa during this period.**\n   - The map clearly shows several lines along the west coast of Africa, indicating that British ships did indeed sail along this route.\n\n   **B. British ships did not sail the Atlantic Ocean during this period.**\n   - The map shows numerous lines crossing the Atlantic Ocean, especially between Europe and North America, indicating that British ships did sail the Atlantic.\n\n   **C. British ships did not sail the Pacific Ocean during this period.**\n   - The map does not show any lines in the Pacific Ocean, suggesting that British ships did not sail extensively in this region during the specified period.\n\n   **D. British ships did not sail in the Indian Ocean during this period.**\n   - The map shows several lines in the Indian Ocean, particularly around India and the eastern coast of Africa, indicating that British ships did sail in the Indian Ocean.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct conclusion is:\n\n**C. British ships did not sail the Pacific Ocean during this period.**"
