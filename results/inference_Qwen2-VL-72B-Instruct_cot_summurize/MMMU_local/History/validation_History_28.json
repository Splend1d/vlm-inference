The text below the image states that Murasaki wrote this work in the 11th century C.E.\n\nGiven this information, we can infer that during the period of 600-1450 C.E., Murasaki Shikibu was able to make significant contributions to literature, which suggests that women in Japan had some level of influence and agency in society, despite the broader context of patriarchy.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. **Women in Japan exercised influence on society, despite the persistence of patriarchy elsewhere.**\n   - This option aligns well with the fact that Murasaki Shikibu was able to write and publish a significant literary work, indicating that women could exert influence in certain areas of society.\n\nB. **Women in Japan of all classes had equal opportunities like men.**\n   - There is no evidence in the image or text to support that women of all classes had equal opportunities as men. This statement is too broad and not supported by historical context.\n\nC. **Japanese society was highly patriarchal, much like Chinese society.**\n   - While Japanese society was indeed patriarchal, the presence of a notable female author like Murasaki Shikibu suggests that there were exceptions where women could achieve prominence.\n\nD. **Chinese views of women influenced Japanese gender roles.**\n   - There is no direct evidence in the image or text to suggest that Chinese views specifically influenced Japanese gender roles.\n\nBased on the analysis, the most accurate answer is:\n\n**A. Women in Japan exercised influence on society, despite the persistence of patriarchy elsewhere.**"
