It depicts an octopus with tentacles reaching out to various parts of the world, symbolizing British imperial expansion and influence.\n\nGiven this context, the question asks which country among the options did not have significant imperial ambitions or territorial control comparable to Britain's prior to 1890.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Netherlands**: The Netherlands had a significant colonial empire, including territories in Asia and Africa.\nB. **France**: France had a large colonial empire, including colonies in Africa, Asia, and the Americas.\nC. **Belgium**: Belgium had limited colonial possessions prior to 1890, primarily focusing on the Congo Free State after 1885.\nD. **Germany**: Germany began its colonial empire later, with significant acquisitions starting in the late 19th century.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Belgium"
