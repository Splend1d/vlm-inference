This suggests a strong sense of nationalism and patriotism.\n\nNow, let's consider each option in relation to Marx's views on communism:\n\nA. **The Soviet Union saw communism as developing most effectively within a single country, while Marx envisioned it as an international movement.**\n   - This option highlights a contrast between the Soviet Union's focus on national defense and Marx's broader vision of an international communist movement. The poster's emphasis on defending the motherland aligns with this interpretation.\n\nB. **The Soviet Union saw communism as primarily a militaristic philosophy, while Marx argued for a peaceful approach.**\n   - While the poster does depict soldiers, it does not necessarily imply that the Soviet Union viewed communism as primarily militaristic. Marx did not explicitly argue for a peaceful approach; he envisioned a proletarian revolution.\n\nC. **The Soviet Union saw communism as being fully realized by 1917, while Marx predicted the proletariat revolt to occur much later.**\n   - The poster does not provide information about the timeline of communism's realization. It focuses on the present call to defend the nation.\n\nD. **The Soviet Union saw communism as a theoretical concept, while Marx attempted to implement a communist society.**\n   - This option is incorrect because both the Soviet Union and Marx were involved in implementing communist societies.\n\nGiven the analysis, the best answer is:\n\n**A. The Soviet Union saw communism as developing most effectively within a single country, while Marx envisioned it as an international movement.**"
