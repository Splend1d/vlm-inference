This relocation is famously known as the Trail of Tears.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **The Trail of Tears**: This is directly related to the forced relocation depicted on the map.\n\nB. **King Philip's War**: This was a conflict between English colonists and several Native American tribes in New England during the late 17th century. It involved warfare and territorial disputes but not large-scale forced relocation.\n\nC. **Creek War of 1836**: This was a conflict involving the Creek Nation and other tribes in the Southeastern United States. While it involved displacement and conflict, it is not primarily about large-scale forced relocation.\n\nD. **The Battle of Little Big Horn**: This was a significant battle during the Great Sioux War of 1876, involving the Lakota, Northern Cheyenne, and Arapaho tribes against the United States Army. It was a military engagement rather than a forced relocation.\n\nGiven this analysis, the event that is least similar to the forced relocation depicted in the map is:\n\n**D. The Battle of Little Big Horn**"
