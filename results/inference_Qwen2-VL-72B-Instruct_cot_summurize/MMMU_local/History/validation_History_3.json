The Maroons were groups of escaped slaves who formed independent communities in the Caribbean and South America. The historical development that contributed most to the formation of Maroon societies was:\n\nA. The Atlantic slave trade\n\nThe Atlantic slave trade brought millions of Africans to the Americas as enslaved people. Many of these individuals managed to escape their captors and formed communities in remote areas, often in the mountains or dense forests, where they could live freely and resist re-enslavement. These communities became known as Maroon societies."
