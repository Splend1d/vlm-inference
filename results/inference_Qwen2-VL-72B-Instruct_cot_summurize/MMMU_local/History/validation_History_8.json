This supports the idea that Portugal was interested in exploring these regions.\n\nB. **Vasco de Gama was the first European to embark on intercontinental travel by sea**\n   - While the map does show a route that could be associated with Vasco de Gama's voyage, it does not explicitly state that he was the first to do so. Therefore, this cannot be conclusively determined from the map alone.\n\nC. **European nations began to look outward for economic opportunities**\n   - The map indicates a voyage that likely had economic motivations, as it reaches India, known for its trade opportunities. However, the map itself does not provide direct evidence of economic intentions.\n\nD. **European began mass migrations to distant lands in the early sixteenth century**\n   - The map does not indicate any mass migration; it only shows a single voyage route.\n\nBased on the analysis, the most directly supported conclusion by the map is:\n\n**A. Portugal was primarily interested in exploration of the African and Asian coasts**"
