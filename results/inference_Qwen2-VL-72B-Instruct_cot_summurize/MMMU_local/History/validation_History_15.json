The Maroons were escaped slaves who formed independent communities and resisted re-enslavement.\n\n2. **Image 2**: This map shows the major Cossack hosts of the former Russian Empire. Cossacks were semi-autonomous groups that often lived on the periphery of the Russian Empire and were known for their military prowess and resistance to central authority.\n\nGiven this information, the best context that encompasses both images is:\n\n**D. Societies existing on the periphery of large states**\n\nBoth the Maroons in Jamaica and the Cossacks in Russia were groups that existed on the periphery of larger empires (the British Empire and the Russian Empire, respectively) and had a history of resistance and autonomy."
