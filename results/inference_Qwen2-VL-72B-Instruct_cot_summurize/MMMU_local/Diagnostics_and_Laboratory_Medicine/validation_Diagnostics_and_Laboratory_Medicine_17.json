The left section appears to have more pronounced grooves and a more defined structure, while the right section has a more diffuse appearance with less distinct grooves.\n\n2. **Diagnosis Considerations**:\n   - **Parkinson's Disease**: Typically characterized by degeneration of the substantia nigra, which might not be as apparent in a gross examination.\n   - **Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP)**: Often shows atrophy of the midbrain and pons, which can be observed in gross brain sections.\n\nGiven the visible atrophy and structural changes in the brain sections, the most likely diagnosis is:\n\nC. Either of the above\n\nBoth Parkinson's Disease and Progressive Supranuclear Palsy can present with atrophic changes in the brain, making it difficult to distinguish between them solely based on this gross examination."
