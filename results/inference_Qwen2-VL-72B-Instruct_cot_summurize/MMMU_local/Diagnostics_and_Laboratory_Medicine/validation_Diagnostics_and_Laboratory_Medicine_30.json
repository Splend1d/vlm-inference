Metaplastic changes in the choroid plexus might be seen as well.\n\n3. **Subacute Embolic Infarcts Associated with Glycogen (PAS-Positive) Storage Disease**:\n   - This would involve embolic infarcts and additional features related to glycogen storage disease, which might include specific staining characteristics (e.g., PAS-positive material).\n\n4. **Metastatic Carcinoma with Secondary Infarcts**:\n   - Metastatic carcinoma would show malignant cells within the brain tissue, often with necrosis and hemorrhage, and secondary infarcts might be present due to tumor-induced vascular compromise.\n\nGiven the appearance of the image, which shows a relatively uniform area of tissue with some areas of lighter staining and possible cavitation or gliosis, the most fitting description is:\n\n**B. Remote cerebral infarcts with metaplastic choroid plexus**\n\nThis choice aligns with the chronic changes that can be observed in remote infarcts, including possible metaplastic changes in the choroid plexus."
