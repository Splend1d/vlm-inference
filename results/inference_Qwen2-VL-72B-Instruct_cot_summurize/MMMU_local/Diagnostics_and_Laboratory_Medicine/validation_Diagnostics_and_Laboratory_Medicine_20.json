Given the clinical context of a 45-year-old Mexican rancher with a 3-month history of cognitive problems, the most likely etiology of this process is:\n\nA. Cysticercosis\n\nCysticercosis is a parasitic infection caused by the larvae of the pork tapeworm Taenia solium. It is common in areas where pigs and humans live in close proximity, such as rural Mexico. The cysts can form in various parts of the body, including the brain, leading to neurological symptoms like cognitive problems."
