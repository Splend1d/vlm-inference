The absence of pigment does not necessarily indicate that the tissue is a metastatic carcinoma. Metastatic carcinomas can originate from various primary sites and may or may not contain pigment depending on their origin and characteristics.\n\nTherefore, the absence of pigment alone is not sufficient evidence to conclude that the tissue is a metastatic carcinoma. Other factors such as cellular morphology, tissue architecture, and additional staining techniques would be necessary for a definitive diagnosis.\n\nGiven this information, the correct answer is:\n\nB. False"
