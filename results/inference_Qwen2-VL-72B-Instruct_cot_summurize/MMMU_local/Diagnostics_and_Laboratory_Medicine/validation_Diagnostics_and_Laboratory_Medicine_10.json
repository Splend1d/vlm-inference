These lesions are characterized by clusters of inflammatory cells, which can be indicative of various infectious or inflammatory processes.\n\nGiven the clinical context of a 25-year-old immigrant with fever and a several-month history of cord problems, the differential diagnosis includes infections that can cause granulomatous inflammation in the CNS. Let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Trypanosomiasis**: This is caused by the parasite *Trypanosoma*, which can affect the CNS but typically does not present with granulomatous lesions.\n\nB. **Amebic encephalitis**: This is usually caused by free-living amoebae such as *Naegleria fowleri* and typically presents with acute meningoencephalitis rather than chronic granulomatous lesions.\n\nC. **Cerebral malaria**: While malaria can affect the brain, it typically does not present with granulomatous lesions.\n\nD. **Tuberculous meningitis**: This is caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis and can present with granulomatous lesions in the CNS. It is a common cause of chronic meningitis and can lead to neurological symptoms over months.\n\nE. **Aspergillosis**: This fungal infection can affect the CNS but is less common and typically presents acutely rather than chronically.\n\nConsidering the chronic nature of the symptoms and the presence of granulomatous lesions, the most likely etiology is:\n\n**D. Tuberculous meningitis**\n\nThis condition is consistent with the patient's presentation and the histological findings."
