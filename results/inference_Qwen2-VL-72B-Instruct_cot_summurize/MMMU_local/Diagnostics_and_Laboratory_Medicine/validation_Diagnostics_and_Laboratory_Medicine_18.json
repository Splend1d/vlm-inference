The brain on the left is labeled \"normal,\" and the brain on the right appears to have larger ventricles and thinner cortex compared to the normal brain.\n\nGiven these observations:\n\n- **Option A: Cortical atrophy consistent with Alzheimer's Disease** - This is likely correct because Alzheimer's disease is characterized by cortical atrophy and enlargement of the ventricles.\n- **Option B: Caudate atrophy consistent with Huntington's Disease** - While Huntington's disease can cause atrophy, it typically affects the caudate nucleus more prominently than the entire cortex.\n- **Option C: Normal variation of ventricular size** - This is unlikely because the differences are significant enough to suggest pathology rather than normal variation.\n- **Option D: None of the above** - This is incorrect because there is a clear difference that suggests a pathological condition.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. cortical atrophy consistent with Alzheimer's Disease"
