Given the clinical presentation of a 2-year-old boy with occipital headaches, vomiting, and the location of the mass, the most likely diagnosis is:\n\nE. Medulloblastoma\n\nMedulloblastomas are common pediatric brain tumors that typically arise in the cerebellum and can present with symptoms such as headaches and vomiting due to increased intracranial pressure. The age of the patient and the location of the tumor on the MRI are consistent with this diagnosis."
