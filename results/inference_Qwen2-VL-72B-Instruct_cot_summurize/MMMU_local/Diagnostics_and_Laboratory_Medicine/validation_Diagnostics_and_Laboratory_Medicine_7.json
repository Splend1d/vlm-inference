This is very unlikely to have resulted from venous occlusion.\n\nExplanation:\nThe image appears to be a histological section of brain tissue, showing areas of gliosis and possible cavitation, which can be indicative of a remote injury such as an infarct or contusion. Venous occlusion can indeed lead to infarcts, so it is not correct to say that this is very unlikely to have resulted from venous occlusion. The other statements are generally accurate based on the appearance of the tissue in the image."
