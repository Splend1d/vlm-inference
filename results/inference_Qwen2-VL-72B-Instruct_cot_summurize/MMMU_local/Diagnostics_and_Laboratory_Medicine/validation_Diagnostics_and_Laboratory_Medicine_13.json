These inclusions are typically stained with antibodies against ubiquitin and alpha-synuclein.\n\n- **Ubiquitin** is a small protein that is involved in the tagging of proteins for degradation. It is often found in abnormal protein aggregates.\n- **Alpha-synuclein** is a protein that is associated with Lewy bodies, which are hallmark features of Parkinson's disease and other related disorders.\n\nGiven these points, the correct answer is:\n\nD. both B and C"
