Given the patient's history of liver cirrhosis and the appearance of the lesion on the post-enhancement arterial phase, the most likely diagnosis is:\n\nB. Liver cancer\n\nLiver cancer, particularly hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), is a common complication of chronic liver disease such as cirrhosis. The enhancement pattern seen in the arterial phase is characteristic of HCC, which typically shows early arterial enhancement followed by washout in the portal venous or delayed phases."
