The vertical component of the tension force in each string can be found using trigonometry. Specifically, the vertical component of the tension force \\( T \\) is given by:\n\n\\[ T_{\\text{vertical}} = T \\sin(\\theta) \\]\n\nSince there are two strings, the total upward pull from both strings is:\n\n\\[ 2 \\times T_{\\text{vertical}} = 2 \\times T \\sin(\\theta) \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. 2T sin \\( \\theta \\)"
