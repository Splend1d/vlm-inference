Snell's Law states that:\n\n\\[ n_1 \\sin(\\theta_1) = n_2 \\sin(\\theta_2) \\]\n\nwhere \\( n_1 \\) and \\( n_2 \\) are the refractive indices of the two media, and \\( \\theta_1 \\) and \\( \\theta_2 \\) are the angles of incidence and refraction, respectively.\n\nThe speed of light in a medium is inversely proportional to the refractive index of that medium:\n\n\\[ v = \\frac{c}{n} \\]\n\nwhere \\( c \\) is the speed of light in vacuum and \\( n \\) is the refractive index of the medium.\n\nFrom the diagram, we can see that the light beam bends towards the normal when it goes from medium 1 to medium 2, and then bends away from the normal when it goes from medium 2 to medium 3. This indicates that:\n\n- The refractive index of medium 2 (\\( n_2 \\)) is greater than that of medium 1 (\\( n_1 \\)).\n- The refractive index of medium 3 (\\( n_3 \\)) is less than that of medium 2 (\\( n_2 \\)).\n\nTherefore, the refractive indices are ordered as:\n\n\\[ n_1 < n_2 > n_3 \\]\n\nSince the speed of light is inversely proportional to the refractive index, the speeds of light in the respective media will be ordered as:\n\n\\[ v_1 > v_2 < v_3 \\]\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\nC. \\( v_1 > v_3 < v_2 \\)"
