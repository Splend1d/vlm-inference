A voltmeter reads zero when there is no potential difference between the two points it is connected to.\n\nGiven that each resistor has the same resistance, the voltage drop across each resistor will be equal because the current through each resistor is the same (assuming a series circuit).\n\nLet's analyze the circuit:\n\n- The circuit consists of three resistors in series on the top path (W-U-P) and three resistors in series on the bottom path (T-S-Q).\n- Since the resistors have the same resistance and the current is the same through all resistors, the voltage drop across each resistor is equal.\n\nNow, let's consider the points:\n\n- Between Q and U: These points are not directly connected by a wire, so there would be a voltage difference.\n- Between P and T: These points are at opposite ends of the circuit, so there would be a voltage difference.\n- Between Q and W: These points are not directly connected by a wire, so there would be a voltage difference.\n- Between S and U: These points are connected by a wire (through the middle resistor), so there would be no voltage difference.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD.
