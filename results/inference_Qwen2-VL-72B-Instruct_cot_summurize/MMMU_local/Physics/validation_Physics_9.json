The torque due to a force is given by the product of the force and the perpendicular distance from the pivot point to the line of action of the force.\n\nIn this scenario, the rod is being held in place by the rope and the wall. The forces acting on the rod include:\n- The weight of the rod, which acts at its center of mass (point 3).\n- The force exerted by the rope.\n- The normal force exerted by the wall.\n\nTo solve for the force exerted by the rope, we need to choose a pivot point that simplifies the calculation. The best choice is point 4, where the rope is attached to the rod. This is because the force exerted by the rope will have zero torque about point 4, eliminating one variable from the torque equation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. 4"
