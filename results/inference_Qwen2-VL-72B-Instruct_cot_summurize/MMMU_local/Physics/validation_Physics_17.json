Therefore, the power \\( P \\) is directly proportional to the square of the current \\( I \\).\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. This graph shows a curve where \\( P \\) increases as \\( I \\) increases, but it does not follow a linear relationship. It resembles a quadratic relationship, which matches \\( P = I^2 R \\).\n\nB. This graph shows a linear decrease, which does not match the quadratic relationship.\n\nC. This graph shows a linear increase, which also does not match the quadratic relationship.\n\nD. This graph shows a hyperbolic decrease, which does not match the quadratic relationship.\n\nTherefore, the correct graph is:\n\nA. A"
