The torque produced by this perpendicular force is:\n\\[ \\tau = F \\cdot d \\]\n\nSince we want this new torque to be equal to the original torque, we set the two expressions for torque equal to each other:\n\\[ F \\cdot L \\cdot \\sin(\\theta) = F \\cdot d \\]\n\nSolving for \\( d \\), we get:\n\\[ d = L \\cdot \\sin(\\theta) \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. \\( L \\sin(\\theta) \\)"
