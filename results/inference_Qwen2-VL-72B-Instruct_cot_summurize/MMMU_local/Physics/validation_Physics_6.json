According to Newton's third law, the trailer simultaneously exerts an equal and opposite force back on the tractor.\n\nTherefore, the force that the trailer applies on the tractor is equal to the force of the tractor on the trailer.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nC. equal to the force of the tractor on the trailer."
