Curl your fingers in the direction of the magnetic field produced by this current. The magnetic field will be circulating counterclockwise around the left wire when viewed from above.\n3. **Determine the force on the right-hand wire**: Place your right hand so that your fingers point in the direction of the magnetic field at the location of the right-hand wire. Your thumb will then point in the direction of the force on the right-hand wire due to the magnetic field of the left-hand wire.\n\nSince both currents are in the same direction, the magnetic fields they produce will cause an attractive force between the wires. Therefore, the force on the right-hand wire due to the current in the left-hand wire will be towards the left.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nB. to the left"
