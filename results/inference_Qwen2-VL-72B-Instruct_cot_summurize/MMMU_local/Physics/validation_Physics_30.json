The distance between two consecutive nodes or antinodes is half a wavelength (\\(\\lambda/2\\)).\n\nGiven:\n- The total length of the string is 6 meters.\n- There are three loops, which means there are four segments of \\(\\lambda/2\\) each.\n\nThe total length of the string can be expressed as:\n\\[ 6 \\text{ m} = 4 \\times \\frac{\\lambda}{2} \\]\n\nSolving for \\(\\lambda\\):\n\\[ 6 \\text{ m} = 2\\lambda \\]\n\\[ \\lambda = \\frac{6 \\text{ m}}{2} \\]\n\\[ \\lambda = 3 \\text{ m} \\]\n\nHowever, this calculation seems to have an error because it doesn't match any of the provided options. Let's re-evaluate the number of wavelengths in the given pattern:\n\nThe pattern shows three full wavelengths within the 6 meters. Therefore, each wavelength (\\(\\lambda\\)) should be:\n\\[ \\lambda = \\frac{6 \\text{ m}}{3} \\]\n\\[ \\lambda = 2 \\text{ m} \\]\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\nD. 2 m"
