Since the magnetic field is decreasing, the induced current will create a magnetic field that opposes this decrease. Therefore, the induced current will flow in a direction that creates a magnetic field pointing out of the page.\n\nUsing the right-hand rule for the direction of the induced current, if you curl your fingers in the direction of the induced current, your thumb should point in the direction of the induced magnetic field. For a magnetic field pointing out of the page, the induced current must flow counterclockwise.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe magnitude of the current is 5 A, and the direction of the current is counterclockwise.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. 5 A, counterclockwise"
