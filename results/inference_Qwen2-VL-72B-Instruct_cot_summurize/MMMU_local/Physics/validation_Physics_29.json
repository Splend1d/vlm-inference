                    "text": "To determine the resistance \\( R \\) when the ammeter reads zero, we need to understand that for the ammeter to read zero, there must be no current flowing through it. This implies that the potential difference across the ammeter must be zero.\n\nThe circuit consists of two branches connected in parallel:\n\n1. The branch with resistors 1 \u03a9 and 2 \u03a9.\n2. The branch with resistors 3 \u03a9 and \\( R \\).\n\nFor the ammeter to read zero, the voltage drop across both branches must be equal. Let's calculate the equivalent resistance of each branch:\n\n1. **Branch with 1 \u03a9 and 2 \u03a9:**\n   - These resistors are in series, so their equivalent resistance is:\n     \\[\n     R_{eq1} = 1 \\, \\Omega + 2 \\, \\Omega = 3 \\, \\Omega\n     \\]\n\n2. **Branch with 3 \u03a9 and \\( R \\):**\n   - These resistors are also in series, so their equivalent resistance is:\n     \\[\n     R_{eq2} = 3 \\, \\Omega + R\n     \\]\n\nSince the voltage drops across both branches must be equal, the equivalent resistances of the branches must also be equal. Therefore, we set \\( R_{eq1} \\) equal to \\( R_{eq2} \\):\n\n\\[\n3 \\, \\Omega = 3 \\, \\Omega + R\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( R \\):\n\n\\[\nR = 0 \\, \\Omega\n\\]\n\nHowever, this result doesn't match any of the given options. It seems there might have been an oversight in the interpretation or calculation. Let's re-evaluate the condition for the ammeter to read zero more carefully.\n\nGiven that the ammeter reads zero, the current through the ammeter must be zero. This means the potential difference across the ammeter must be zero. For this to happen, the voltage drops across the two branches must be equal. \n\nLet's consider the voltage divider rule for each branch:\n\n1. **Branch with 1 \u03a9 and 2 \u03a9:**\n   - The total resistance is \\( 3 \\, \\Omega \\).\n   - The voltage drop across this branch is proportional to its resistance.\n\n2. **Branch with 3 \u03a9 and \\( R \\):**\n   - The total resistance is \\( 3 \\, \\Omega + R \\).\n   - The voltage drop across this branch is proportional to its resistance.\n\nFor the voltage drops to be equal, the resistances must be equal:\n\n\\[\n3 \\, \\Omega = 3 \\, \\Omega + R\n\\]\n\nThis equation still results in \\( R = 0 \\), which does not match the given options. Given the context and the options provided, let's reconsider the setup and ensure the correct interpretation:\n\nIf the ammeter reads zero, the effective resistance seen by the source should be the same on both sides of the ammeter. Thus, the equivalent resistance of the two branches must be equal:\n\n\\[\n3 \\, \\Omega = 3 \\, \\Omega + R\n\\]\n\nThis equation still leads to \\( R = 0 \\).
