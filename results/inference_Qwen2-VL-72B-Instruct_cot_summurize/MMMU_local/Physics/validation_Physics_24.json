Therefore, the mass number of the unknown particle must be \\( 7 - 6 = 1 \\).\n\n2. **Atomic Numbers**: The atomic number on the left side is 3 (from Li), and on the right side is also 3 (from Li). Therefore, the atomic number of the unknown particle must be \\( 3 - 3 = 0 \\).\n\nGiven these values, the unknown particle has a mass number of 1 and an atomic number of 0. This matches the characteristics of a neutron.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nC. a neutron"
