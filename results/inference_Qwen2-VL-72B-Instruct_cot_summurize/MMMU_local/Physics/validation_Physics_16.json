This means the particle's displacement is along the diameter of the circle from P to Q.\n\n2. **Direction of Displacement**: Since Q is to the left of P, the displacement vector points from P to Q, which is leftward.\n\n3. **Average Velocity**: Average velocity is defined as the displacement divided by the time taken. Since the displacement is leftward, the average velocity will also be leftward.\n\nTherefore, the direction of the average velocity during this time interval is leftward.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nB. leftward"
