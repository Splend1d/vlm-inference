                    "text": "To determine when the object passes through its initial position, we need to look at the area under the velocity-time graph. The area under the curve represents the displacement of the object.\n\nFrom \\(t = 0\\) to \\(t = 1\\) second, the velocity is negative, indicating that the object is moving in the negative direction. The area under the curve during this time is a triangle with a base of 1 second and a height of -2 m/s. The area of this triangle is:\n\\[ \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 1 \\times (-2) = -1 \\text{ meter} \\]\n\nThis means the object has moved 1 meter in the negative direction from its initial position.\n\nFrom \\(t = 1\\) to \\(t = 4\\) seconds, the velocity is positive, indicating that the object is moving in the positive direction. The area under the curve during this time is a combination of a triangle and a trapezoid. \n\nFor the triangle (from \\(t = 1\\) to \\(t = 2\\)):\n\\[ \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 1 \\times 2 = 1 \\text{ meter} \\]\n\nFor the trapezoid (from \\(t = 2\\) to \\(t = 4\\)):\n\\[ \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times (2 + 1) \\times 2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 3 \\times 2 = 3 \\text{ meters} \\]\n\nAdding these areas together gives the total displacement from \\(t = 1\\) to \\(t = 4\\):\n\\[ 1 + 3 = 4 \\text{ meters} \\]\n\nSince the object moved 1 meter in the negative direction initially, it needs to move 1 meter in the positive direction to return to its initial position. This occurs within the first second of the positive velocity phase, which is between \\(t = 1\\) and \\(t = 2\\) seconds.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nB. Between 1 and 2 s"
