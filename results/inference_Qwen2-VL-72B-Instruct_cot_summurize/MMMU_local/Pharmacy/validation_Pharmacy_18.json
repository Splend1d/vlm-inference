This process is typically saturable, meaning that as the dose increases, the rate of absorption will eventually reach a maximum and cannot increase further due to the limited capacity of the transport mechanism.\n\nLet's analyze each graph:\n\n1. **Graph 1**: This graph shows a decrease in the AUC/Dose ratio as the dose increases. This suggests that the absorption becomes less efficient at higher doses, which is not typical for active transport.\n\n2. **Graph 2**: This graph shows a constant AUC/Dose ratio regardless of the dose. This indicates linear kinetics, where the absorption rate is proportional to the dose. This is not consistent with the saturable nature of active transport.\n\n3. **Graph 3**: This graph shows an increase in the AUC/Dose ratio as the dose increases, which is indicative of saturation kinetics. Initially, the absorption rate increases with the dose, but eventually, it reaches a plateau where further increases in dose do not lead to proportional increases in absorption.\n\nGiven these analyses, the correct representation of transdermal absorption by active transport is:\n\n**C.
