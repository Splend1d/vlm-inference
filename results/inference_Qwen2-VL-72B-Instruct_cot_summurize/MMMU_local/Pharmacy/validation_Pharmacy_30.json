Construct a conversion factor that has the units calories per gram.\nThe label states that there are 15 calories from fat per serving and 2 grams of fat per serving. To find the conversion factor (calories per gram), we divide the calories from fat by the grams of fat:\n\\[ \\text{Conversion factor} = \\frac{15 \\text{ calories}}{2 \\text{ g}} = 7.5 \\text{ calories/g} \\]\n\n### b. Calculate the mass in kilograms for 20 servings of the food.\nEach serving size is 30 grams. For 20 servings:\n\\[ \\text{Mass} = 20 \\text{ servings} \\times 30 \\text{ g/serving} = 600 \\text{ g} \\]\nTo convert grams to kilograms:\n\\[ 600 \\text{ g} = 0.6 \\text{ kg} \\]\n\n### c. Calculate the mass of protein in micrograms for one serving of the food.\nEach serving contains 2 grams of protein. To convert grams to micrograms:\n\\[ 2 \\text{ g} = 2 \\times 10^6 \\mu\\text{g} = 2 \\times 10^6 \\mu\\text{g} \\]\n\n### d. What is the correct number of significant figures for the answer in item a?\nThe conversion factor is calculated as 7.5 calories/g, which has two significant figures.\n\n### Summary of Answers:\n- Conversion factor: 7.5 calories/g\n- Mass for 20 servings: 0.6 kg\n- Mass of protein in micrograms for one serving: \\(2 \\times 10^6 \\mu\\text{g}\\)\n- Significant figures for item a: 2\n\nThe correct choice that matches these answers is:\nD. 7.5 Calories/g; 0.6 kg; \\(2 \\times 10^6 \\mu\\text{g}\\); 2"
