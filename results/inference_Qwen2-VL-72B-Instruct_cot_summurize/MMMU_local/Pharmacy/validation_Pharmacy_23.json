The rules classify cyclizations into different categories based on the number of atoms involved in the ring formation and the type of orbital overlap (\u03c3 or \u03c0) involved in the reaction.\n\nIn the given reaction:\n- A six-membered ring is being formed.\n- The reaction involves an amine (NH) and an alkene (C=C) group.\n- The amine is donating its lone pair to the alkene, forming a new C-N bond.\n\nAccording to Baldwin's rules:\n- 6-exo-trig: This refers to the formation of a six-membered ring where the nucleophile attacks from the exo side (away from the ring) and the reaction involves a trigonal (sp\u00b2) carbon atom.\n- 6-endo-trig: This refers to the formation of a six-membered ring where the nucleophile attacks from the endo side (towards the ring) and the reaction involves a trigonal (sp\u00b2) carbon atom.\n\nIn this case, the amine is attacking the alkene from the exo side to form a six-membered ring. Therefore, the correct classification according to Baldwin's rules is 6-exo-trig.\n\nThus, the correct statement is:\n\nB. The cyclisation is defined as 6-exo-trig and is allowed by Baldwin's rules"
