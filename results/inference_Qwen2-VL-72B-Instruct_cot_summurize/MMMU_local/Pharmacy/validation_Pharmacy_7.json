The slope is constant because the line is straight.\n\n- **Graph (B)**: This graph shows a horizontal line. The slope of a horizontal line is 0, which is also a constant value.\n\n- **Graph (C)**: This graph shows a curve that decreases as it moves from left to right. The slope changes along the curve, so it does not have a constant slope.\n\nTherefore, the graphs with a constant slope are Graphs (A) and (B).\n\nThe correct answer is:\nA. a,b"
