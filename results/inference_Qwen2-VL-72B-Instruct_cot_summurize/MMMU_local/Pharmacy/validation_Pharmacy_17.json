The tricyclic system is connected to cyclic peptides.\n\nGiven these features, we can compare the structure to the options provided:\n\nA. **Doxorubicin**: This is an anthracycline antibiotic used in chemotherapy. It does not have a tricyclic system with an amide group and cyclic peptides.\n\nB. **Dactinomycin**: This is an antibiotic used in chemotherapy. It has a tricyclic system and is known for its amide linkage and cyclic peptides, which matches the structure in the image.\n\nC. **Mitoxantrone**: This is an anthracenedione used in chemotherapy. It does not have a tricyclic system with an amide group and cyclic peptides.\n\nD. **Bleomycin**: This is a glycopeptide antibiotic used in chemotherapy. It does not have a tricyclic system with an amide group and cyclic peptides.\n\nBased on the analysis, the structure in the image most closely matches the description of Dactinomycin.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nB.
