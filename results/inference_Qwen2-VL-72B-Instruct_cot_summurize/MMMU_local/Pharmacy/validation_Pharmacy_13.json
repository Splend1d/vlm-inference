Quaternary structure refers to the arrangement of multiple polypeptide chains (subunits) in a multi-subunit protein.\n\nIn the figure provided:\n\n1. **Regions A, B, and C**: These labels suggest that the protein is divided into distinct regions or domains.\n2. **Dashed Line**: This line separates the protein into these three regions, indicating that the protein might be composed of multiple subunits or domains.\n\nHowever, the image does not provide clear evidence of multiple polypeptide chains interacting with each other to form a multi-subunit protein. The structure shown appears to be a single polypeptide chain folded into its tertiary structure.\n\nTherefore, based on the information available in the figure, it is more likely that the protein does not have quaternary structure.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nB. False"
