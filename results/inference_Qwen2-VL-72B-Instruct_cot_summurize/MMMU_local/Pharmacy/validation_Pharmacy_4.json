Sample 4: (8 g oxygen, 20 g iron)\n\nLet's calculate the ratio of the mass of iron to the mass of oxygen for each sample:\n\n1. Sample 1: \\( \\frac{5 \\text{ g iron}}{2 \\text{ g oxygen}} = 2.5 \\)\n2. Sample 2: \\( \\frac{10 \\text{ g iron}}{4 \\text{ g oxygen}} = 2.5 \\)\n3. Sample 3: \\( \\frac{15 \\text{ g iron}}{6 \\text{ g oxygen}} = 2.5 \\)\n4. Sample 4: \\( \\frac{20 \\text{ g iron}}{8 \\text{ g oxygen}} = 2.5 \\)\n\nSince the ratio of the mass of iron to the mass of oxygen is constant (2.5) for all four samples, it indicates that all four samples are the same compound.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nA.
