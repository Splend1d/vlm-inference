Significant figures include all digits that are known plus the first uncertain digit.\n   - In 31.8 mL, there are three digits: 3, 1, and 8.\n\n2. **Digit with Uncertainty**: The last digit in a measurement is typically considered to be the uncertain digit because it is an estimate.\n   - In 31.8 mL, the digit 8 is the uncertain digit.\n\nGiven these points:\n- There are 3 significant figures.\n- The uncertain digit is 8.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. 3,8"
