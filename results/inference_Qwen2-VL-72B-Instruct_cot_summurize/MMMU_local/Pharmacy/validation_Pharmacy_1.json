According to the balanced equation, 3 moles of \\( O_2 \\) react with 4 moles of \\( NH_3 \\) to produce 2 moles of \\( N_2 \\) and 6 moles of \\( H_2O \\).\n\nSince we have 3.0 moles of \\( O_2 \\), they will completely react with 4.0 moles of \\( NH_3 \\) (since the ratio is 3:4). Therefore, no \\( NH_3 \\) will be left over.\n\nThe reaction will produce:\n- 2 moles of \\( N_2 \\) (since the ratio is 3:2 for \\( O_2 \\) to \\( N_2 \\))\n- 6 moles of \\( H_2O \\) (since the ratio is 3:6 for \\( O_2 \\) to \\( H_2O \\))\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nC. 4.0 mol of NH3, 2.0 mol of N2, 6.0 mol of H2O"
