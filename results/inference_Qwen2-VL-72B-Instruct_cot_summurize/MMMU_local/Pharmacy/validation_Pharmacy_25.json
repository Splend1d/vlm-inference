Both types of cells will still appear blueish-purple or violet.\n3. **Alcohol-Acetone (Decolorizer)**: This step removes the crystal violet from Gram-negative cells, leaving them colorless. Gram-positive cells retain the blueish-purple or violet color.\n4. **Safranin (Counterstain)**: Safranin stains the Gram-negative cells pink or red, while Gram-positive cells remain blueish-purple or violet.\n\nNow, let's fill in the table:\n\n- **Gram-Positive Cells**:\n  - a. Blueish-purple or violet (after Crystal Violet)\n  - b. Blueish-purple or violet (after Iodine)\n  - c. Blueish-purple or violet (after Alcohol-Acetone)\n  - d. Blueish-purple or violet (after Safranin)\n\n- **Gram-Negative Cells**:\n  - e. Blueish-purple or violet (after Crystal Violet)\n  - f. Blueish-purple or violet (after Iodine)\n  - g. Colorless (after Alcohol-Acetone)\n  - h. Pink or red (after Safranin)\n\nThe correct sequence for Gram-positive cells is:\n- Primary stain (Crystal Violet)\n- Mordant (Iodine)\n- Decolorizer (Alcohol-Acetone)\n- Counterstain (Safranin)\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Blueish-purple or violet (primary stain), Blueish-purple or violet (mordant), Blueish-purple or violet (decolorizer), Blueish-purple or violet (counterstain)"
