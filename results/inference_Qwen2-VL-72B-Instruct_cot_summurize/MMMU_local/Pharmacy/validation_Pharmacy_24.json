Fluoroquinolones are known for their ability to inhibit bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, which are enzymes crucial for DNA replication, transcription, and repair. By inhibiting these enzymes, fluoroquinolones prevent the bacterial cell from replicating its DNA, leading to cell death.\n\nGiven this information, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Topoisomerase poison"
