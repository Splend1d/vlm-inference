Therefore, at this point, the solution contains:\n\n- Sodium ions ($Na^+$) from the original sodium oxalate.\n- Chloride ions ($Cl^-$) from the hydrochloric acid.\n- Hydrogen oxalate ions ($HC_2O_4^-$) formed by the reaction.\n\nThus, the predominant species in solution at point E are $Na^+$, $Cl^-$, and $HC_2O_4^-$.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nB. $Na^+$, $Cl^-$, and $HC_2O_4^-$"
