The melting/freezing equilibrium occurs at the boundary between the solid and liquid phases.\n\nIn the given phase diagram:\n- Point 7 is at the intersection of the two curves, which typically represents the triple point where all three phases (solid, liquid, and gas) coexist.\n- Points 6 and 8 are on the curve that separates the liquid and solid phases, indicating the melting/freezing equilibrium.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. 6 and 7"
