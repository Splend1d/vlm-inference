The basic strength order given is:\n\\[ \\text{Ph-NH-Ph} < \\text{Ph-NH}_2 < \\text{cyclohexylamine} \\]\nThis order is correct because the basicity increases as the electron-donating ability of the substituent increases. Phenyl groups are electron-withdrawing, while cyclohexyl is electron-donating.\n\nB. The basic strength order given is:\n\\[ \\text{Pyrole} < \\text{Pyridine} < \\text{Piperidine} \\]\nThis order is also correct. Pyrrole is the least basic due to its aromaticity and resonance stabilization. Pyridine is more basic than pyrrole but less basic than piperidine, which is a saturated ring and does not have resonance stabilization.\n\nC. The basic strength order given is:\n\\[ \\text{Pyrole} > \\text{Pyrrolidine} > \\text{Imidazole} \\]\nThis order is incorrect. Pyrrole is less basic than pyrrolidine because of its aromaticity and resonance stabilization. Imidazole is more basic than pyrrole but less basic than pyrrolidine.\n\nD. The basic strength order given is:\n\\[ \\text{p-nitroaniline} < \\text{Aniline} < \\text{p-toluidine} \\]\nThis order is correct. The nitro group is electron-withdrawing, making p-nitroaniline the least basic. Aniline has no substituent, and p-toluidine has an electron-donating methyl group, making it the most basic.\n\nTherefore, the incorrect set regarding basic strength is:\n\nC. <image 3>"
