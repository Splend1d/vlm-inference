The most stable conformation of cyclohexane is the chair conformation, where axial and equatorial positions play a crucial role in determining stability.\n\n- **Axial** substituents are more sterically hindered and less stable compared to **equatorial** substituents.\n- The hydroxyl (OH) group is bulkier than the methoxy (OMe) group, so it prefers to be in an equatorial position for maximum stability.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. In this structure, the OH group is axial and the OMe group is equatorial. This is not the most stable because the bulky OH group is in an axial position.\n\nB. In this structure, both the OH and OMe groups are axial. This is highly unstable due to the steric hindrance between the two axial substituents.\n\nC. In this structure, the OMe group is axial and the OH group is equatorial. This is also not the most stable because the OMe group is in an axial position.\n\nD. In this structure, both the OH and OMe groups are equatorial. This is the most stable conformation because both substituents are in the less hindered equatorial positions.\n\nTherefore, the most stable isomer is:\n\nD. <image 4>"
