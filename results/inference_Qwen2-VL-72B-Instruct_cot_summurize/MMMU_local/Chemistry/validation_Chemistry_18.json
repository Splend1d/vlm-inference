Five different samples of $CaCO_3$(s) of known mass react with an excess of 2.0 M $HCl$(aq) in identical sealed, rigid reaction vessels. The pressure of the gas produced is measured with a pressure gauge attached to the reaction vessel. Since the reaction is exothermic, the reaction system is cooled to its original temperature before the pressure is recorded. The experimental data are used to create the calibration line below. <image 1> The experiment is repeated with an eggshell sample, and the experimental data are recorded in the table below. <image 2> Which of the following modifications will increase the rate of the reaction the most? \n\nA.

                    "text": "To determine which modification will increase the rate of the reaction the most, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Using 2.0 M $CH_3COOH$(aq) instead of 2.0 M $HCl$(aq)**:\n   - Acetic acid ($CH_3COOH$) is a weaker acid than hydrochloric acid ($HCl$). Weaker acids generally react more slowly with bases or other substances compared to stronger acids. Therefore, using acetic acid would likely decrease the reaction rate.\n\nB. **Cooling the $HCl$(aq) to a lower temperature than it was in the original experiment**:\n   - Lowering the temperature generally decreases the reaction rate because it reduces the kinetic energy of the molecules, leading to fewer effective collisions between reactant particles.\n\nC. **Reducing the volume of the reaction vessel**:\n   - Reducing the volume of the reaction vessel increases the concentration of the reactants (assuming the amount of reactants remains constant). Higher concentrations lead to more frequent collisions between reactant particles, thus increasing the reaction rate.\n\nD. **Using eggshells that are more finely powdered than those used in the original experiment**:\n   - Finely powdered eggshells have a larger surface area compared to coarser eggshells. A larger surface area allows for more contact points between the eggshell and the acid, thereby increasing the reaction rate.\n\nAmong these options, reducing the volume of the reaction vessel (Option C) and using eggshells that are more finely powdered (Option D) both increase the reaction rate. However, reducing the volume of the reaction vessel directly increases the concentration of reactants, which has a more immediate and significant impact on the reaction rate compared to increasing the surface area of the eggshells.\n\nTherefore, the modification that will increase the rate of the reaction the most is:\n\n**C.
