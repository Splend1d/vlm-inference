                    "text": "To determine the dipole moments of the given compounds, we need to consider the contributions of the functional groups and their orientation in the molecules.\n\n1. **Compound A:**\n   - It contains a nitro group (\\( \\text{NO}_2 \\)) which is highly polar.\n   - The dimethylamino group (\\( \\text{NMe}_2 \\)) is also polar but less so compared to the nitro group.\n   - The nitro group is directly attached to the benzene ring, which can cause significant polarization due to its electron-withdrawing nature.\n   - The dimethylamino group is para to the nitro group, which means it is on the opposite side of the ring. This arrangement can lead to a net dipole moment because the polar effects of the two groups do not cancel each other out.\n\n2. **Compound B:**\n   - Similar to compound A, it contains a nitro group and a dimethylamino group.\n   - However, compound B has additional methyl groups around the benzene ring, which can affect the overall polarity.\n   - The presence of these methyl groups can shield the polar effects of the nitro and dimethylamino groups, reducing the net dipole moment.\n\nGiven this analysis, the dipole moment of compound A is likely to be higher than that of compound B because the additional methyl groups in compound B reduce the overall polarity.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nA. (A) = 6.87D, (B) = 4.11D"
