There are three such chiral centers in this molecule.\n\nFor each chiral center, there are two possible configurations (R or S). Therefore, the total number of stereoisomers can be calculated as \\(2^n\\), where \\(n\\) is the number of chiral centers.\n\nIn this case, \\(n = 3\\), so the total number of stereoisomers is \\(2^3 = 8\\).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. 8"
