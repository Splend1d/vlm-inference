The two hydroxyl groups (OH) are on opposite sides of the central carbon atoms, creating a mirror image that is superimposable.\n\nNow, let's analyze the Newman projections:\n\n- **P**: This projection shows the molecule with one methyl group (Me) in front and one behind, with the hydroxyl groups (OH) on opposite sides. This matches the structure of meso-2,3-butanediol.\n- **Q**: This projection also shows the molecule with one methyl group (Me) in front and one behind, but the hydroxyl groups (OH) are on the same side. This does not match the structure of meso-2,3-butanediol.\n- **R**: This projection shows the molecule with one methyl group (Me) in front and one behind, with the hydroxyl groups (OH) on opposite sides. This matches the structure of meso-2,3-butanediol.\n- **S**: This projection shows the molecule with one methyl group (Me) in front and one behind, but the hydroxyl groups (OH) are on the same side. This does not match the structure of meso-2,3-butanediol.\n\nTherefore, the correct Newman projections of meso-2,3-butanediol are P and R.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nB. P, R"
