The given compound has one chiral center (the carbon atom bonded to H, Br, Me, and OH).\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. This structure is identical to the given compound, so it cannot be the enantiomer.\n\nB. This structure is the mirror image of the given compound, with the OH group on the opposite side of the chiral center. Therefore, it is the enantiomer.\n\nC. This structure is not the mirror image of the given compound, so it cannot be the enantiomer.\n\nD. This structure is also not the mirror image of the given compound, so it cannot be the enantiomer.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B."
