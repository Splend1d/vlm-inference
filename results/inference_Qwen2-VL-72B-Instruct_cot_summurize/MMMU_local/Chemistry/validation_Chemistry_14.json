This is a chiral center.\n2. **Carbon with an OH group on the bottom left ring**: This carbon has an OH group, a hydrogen atom, and two other groups from the ring. This is another chiral center.\n3. **Carbon between the two rings with an O bridge**: This carbon has an oxygen bridge, a hydrogen atom, and two other groups from the rings. This is a chiral center.\n4. **Carbon next to the nitrogen with a methyl group**: This carbon has a methyl group, a hydrogen atom, and two other groups from the rings. This is a chiral center.\n5. **Carbon next to the nitrogen without a methyl group**: This carbon has a hydrogen atom, a nitrogen atom, and two other groups from the rings. This is a chiral center.\n\nSo, there are 5 chiral centers in morphine.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nB. 5"
