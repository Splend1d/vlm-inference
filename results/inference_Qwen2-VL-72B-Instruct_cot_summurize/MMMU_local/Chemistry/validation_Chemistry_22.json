The lines represent the boundaries between these phases. The point where all three lines meet is the triple point, where all three phases coexist.\n\n- Point (A) is on the line that separates the solid and gas phases.\n- Point (B) is in the region where the solid and liquid phases coexist.\n- Point (C) is in the region where the liquid and gas phases coexist.\n- Point (D) is on the line that separates the liquid and gas phases.\n- Point (E) is in the region where only the gas phase exists.\n\nThe region where only the solid phase exists is below the line that separates the solid and liquid phases and to the left of the line that separates the solid and gas phases. This region is not explicitly marked with a point in the given options, but it would be to the left and below point (B).\n\nGiven the options, the closest point to this region is:\n\nB. (B)\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. (B)."
