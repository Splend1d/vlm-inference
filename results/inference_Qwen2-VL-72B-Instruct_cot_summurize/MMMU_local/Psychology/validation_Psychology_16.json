                    "text": "Researchers studying vision use various methods to investigate human perceptual experience. Research on spectral sensitivity of the rod receptors (scattered throughout the retina) and cone visual receptors (mainly concentrated in the fovea area of the retina) highlights the relationship between perception and physiology. Signal detection methods have been used to measure the differences in how perception adjusts to low-light environments. Participant responses can be plotted based on sensitivity versus length of time in the dark. The dark adaptation curve can be plotted showing how rods and cones differ in their sensitivity to light over time. The following graph shows a plot of three calculated dark adaptation curves. <image 1> Which of the following statements is true?\n\nA. Rods are responsible for color vision, which explains color sensitivity under low-light conditions.\nB. Cones are responsible for color vision, which explains greater color sensitivity under low-light conditions.\nC. Rods do not respond preferentially to wavelengths in the light spectrum, which explains why colors are not detectable in low-light conditions.\nD. Both rods and cones respond to specific colors in the light spectrum; loss of color vision in dark conditions is the result of fewer photons of light.\n"

                    "text": "To determine which statement is true, let's analyze the graph and the information provided about rods and cones.\n\n1. **Rods and Cones Functions:**\n   - **Rods:** Responsible for vision in low-light conditions (night vision). They do not respond to color.\n   - **Cones:** Responsible for color vision and high-acuity vision in bright light conditions.\n\n2. **Graph Analysis:**\n   - The graph shows two main curves: one for rods (dashed line) and one for cones (solid line).\n   - The rod curve reaches maximum sensitivity at lower light levels compared to the cone curve.\n   - The cone curve shows higher sensitivity at higher light levels.\n\nGiven this information, let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. **Rods are responsible for color vision, which explains color sensitivity under low-light conditions.**\n   - This statement is incorrect because rods are not responsible for color vision. Cones are responsible for color vision.\n\nB. **Cones are responsible for color vision, which explains greater color sensitivity under low-light conditions.**\n   - This statement is incorrect because cones are not sensitive under low-light conditions. They require more light to function effectively.\n\nC. **Rods do not respond preferentially to wavelengths in the light spectrum, which explains why colors are not detectable in low-light conditions.**\n   - This statement is correct. Rods do not respond to specific wavelengths (colors), which is why we cannot see colors in low-light conditions.\n\nD. **Both rods and cones respond to specific colors in the light spectrum; loss of color vision in dark conditions is the result of fewer photons of light.**\n   - This statement is partially correct but misleading. While it is true that both rods and cones respond to light, only cones respond to specific colors. The loss of color vision in dark conditions is primarily due to the dominance of rods, which do not perceive color.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is:\n\n**C. Rods do not respond preferentially to wavelengths in the light spectrum, which explains why colors are not detectable in low-light conditions.**"
