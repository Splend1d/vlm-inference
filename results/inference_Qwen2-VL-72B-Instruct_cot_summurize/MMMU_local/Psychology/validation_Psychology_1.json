This graph shows a bell-shaped curve, where performance increases with arousal up to a point and then decreases. This is consistent with the Yerkes-Dodson Law.\n\nB. This graph shows a U-shaped curve, which does not match the typical relationship between performance and arousal.\n\nC. This graph shows a flat line, indicating no relationship between performance and arousal.\n\nD. This graph shows a straight line with a positive slope, indicating that performance increases linearly with arousal, which does not match the Yerkes-Dodson Law.\n\nE. This graph shows a straight line with a negative slope, indicating that performance decreases linearly with arousal, which also does not match the Yerkes-Dodson Law.\n\nTherefore, the best depiction of the relation between performance and arousal is:\n\nA. <image 1>"
