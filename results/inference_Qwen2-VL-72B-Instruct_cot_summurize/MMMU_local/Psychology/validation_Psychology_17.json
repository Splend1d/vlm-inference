This law suggests that performance increases with physiological or mental arousal, but only up to a point. After that point, further increases in arousal lead to decreased performance.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. <image 1> shows a curve where performance increases with arousal up to a peak and then decreases. This matches the Yerkes-Dodson Law.\n\nB. <image 2> shows a curve where performance increases rapidly at first and then plateaus. This does not match the Yerkes-Dodson Law.\n\nC. <image 3> shows a straight line where performance increases linearly with arousal. This does not match the Yerkes-Dodson Law.\n\nD. <image 4> shows a U-shaped curve where performance is low at both low and high arousal levels. This does not match the Yerkes-Dodson Law.\n\nE. <image 5> shows a straight line where performance decreases linearly with arousal. This does not match the Yerkes-Dodson Law.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. <image 1>"
