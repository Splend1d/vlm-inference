All groups were given the same set of questions in an exam, but the exam began with a brief introductory statement that differed for each group, establishing differing expectations for student performance, as follows: Group A: The introduction stated that most students are expected to pass the exam. Group B: The introduction stated that most students are expected to fail the exam. Group C: The introduction included statistics that showed female students performing worse than male students on similar exams. Group D: The introduction contained no information on expected performance. The results of the experiment are given in the bar graph below: <image 1> What phenomenon best explains the performance differences between Groups A and B?\n\nA. Social facilitation\nB.

This suggests that the expectations set by the introductory statements influenced the students' performance.\n\nNow, let's consider each option:\n\nA. **Social facilitation**: This refers to the improvement or impairment of performance in the presence of others. It does not directly relate to the expectations set by the introductory statements.\n\nB. **Group polarization**: This is when group discussions lead to more extreme positions. It does not apply here since the groups did not engage in discussions.\n\nC. **Self-serving bias**: This is the tendency to attribute success to personal factors and failure to external factors. It does not explain the difference in performance due to the introductory statements.\n\nD. **Unstable attribution**: This involves attributing behavior to temporary or situational causes. It does not directly explain the performance differences based on the introductory statements.\n\nE. **The Pygmalion effect**: This is the phenomenon where higher expectations lead to an increase in performance. In this case, the higher expectations set by the introductory statement for Group A likely led to better performance, while the lower expectations for Group B led to poorer performance.\n\nGiven the context and the results, the phenomenon that best explains the performance differences between Groups A and B is:\n\n**E.
