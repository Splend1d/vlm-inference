This law suggests that performance increases with physiological or mental arousal, but only up to a point. After that point, further increases in arousal lead to decreased performance.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. The graph shows a U-shaped curve, indicating that performance is low at both very low and very high levels of arousal, with a peak in the middle. This does not match the Yerkes-Dodson Law.\n\nB. The graph shows a straight line with a negative slope, indicating that performance decreases as arousal increases. This does not match the Yerkes-Dodson Law.\n\nC. The graph shows a V-shaped curve, similar to option A, indicating low performance at both ends and a peak in the middle. This does not match the Yerkes-Dodson Law.\n\nD. The graph shows a straight line with a positive slope, indicating that performance increases as arousal increases. This does not match the Yerkes-Dodson Law.\n\nE. The graph shows an inverted U-shaped curve, indicating that performance increases with arousal up to a point and then decreases. This matches the Yerkes-Dodson Law.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is E."
