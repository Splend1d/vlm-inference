At the end of the dual-task presentation, the students were tested both for their memory of the passage and their memory of the photographs. To establish a baseline for this dual-task condition, the same students also were tested for their memory when each of the component tasks was presented alone. The following graph shows the results. <image 1> In a study of the effectiveness of divided attention, it is most important that the experimental design include\n\nA. a counterbalance of the order in which participants are tested in the baseline and dual-task conditions\nB. a consistent order in which participants are tested in the baseline and dual-task conditions\nC. an equal number of men and women as participants\nD. verification that participants believe themselves capable of dividing attention\n"

This means that if some participants perform better or worse simply because they started with one task before the other, these effects would be evenly distributed across all participants.\n\nB. **A consistent order in which participants are tested in the baseline and dual-task conditions**\n   - A consistent order might introduce bias if the order itself affects performance. For example, if participants always start with the baseline condition first, they might perform differently in the dual-task condition due to fatigue or practice effects.\n\nC. **An equal number of men and women as participants**\n   - While having an equal number of men and women can help ensure that gender does not confound the results, it is not the most critical factor in controlling for the primary variable of interest (divided attention).\n\nD. **Verification that participants believe themselves capable of dividing attention**\n   - Participants' beliefs about their own capabilities could influence their performance, but this is less critical than ensuring that the experimental design controls for order effects.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most important aspect of the experimental design is to control for order effects, which can be achieved through counterbalancing.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n**A. A counterbalance of the order in which participants are tested in the baseline and dual-task conditions**"
