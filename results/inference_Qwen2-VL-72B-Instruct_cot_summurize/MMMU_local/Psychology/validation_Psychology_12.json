                    "text": "One of the central questions in language is of linguistic determinism. Language is an important component of one's ability to comprehend numbers and quantities. Counting takes many forms depending on culture. Researchers have not yet found a language that does not represent numbers. Some cultures use body parts to count or forms of recursion using a small numerical base. Gumulgal South Sea Islanders count utilizing a recursive binary system. The Piraha are a monolingual population (< 200 population) that have rejected assimilation with the Brazilian culture. A predominantly hunter-gatherer population, the Piraha live in villages of between 10 and 20 people on the banks of the Maici River in Brazil's Lowland Amazonia region. The Piraha counting system consists of what is termed the \"one-two-many\" system. Quantities beyond two are described as many, in this system of counting. A researcher visited the Piraha tribe to test the impact of counting systems on the ability to estimate quantity. Members of the Piraha tribe were given a visual counting task to test the impact of numerical systems on visual estimation. Each tribe member was allowed to inspect a group of nuts for a few seconds. The nuts were placed in an opaque can, so the quantity could not be viewed. For each trial, a nut was removed from the can, and the tribe member was asked to tell the researcher if the can still contained nuts. Tribe members who were able to estimate the quantity of nuts in the can would be able to tell when there were none left. Figure 1 shows the proportion of correct responses averaged for each target number of nuts over all trials. Figure 1: Results for the Piraha tribe members' trials averaged for each target number (n = 63). For each trial, each tribe member estimated the number of nuts left in the can (target). The proportion of correct responses is shown (the first and last nut were excluded). <image 1> Which theory would support the viewpoint: the Piraha have not needed a counting system that uses numbers beyond two and when a better numbering system is necessary, their language will create it?\n\nA.

It does not directly address the relationship between language and thought or the creation of new language structures based on necessity.\n\nB. **Vygotsky** - Lev Vygotsky's theory emphasizes the role of social interaction in the development of cognition. While it discusses how language and thought interact, it does not specifically address the creation of new language structures based on necessity.\n\nC. **Whorfian Hypothesis** - This hypothesis suggests that the structure of a language affects its speakers' cognition and world view. It implies that language shapes thought, but it does not necessarily predict that language will evolve to meet new needs.\n\nD. **Weak Linguistic Determinism** - This theory posits that while language influences thought, it does not completely determine it. It suggests that language can adapt and change in response to new needs or circumstances.\n\nGiven the context of the question, the viewpoint that the Piraha will develop a better numbering system when necessary aligns with the idea that language can adapt to meet new requirements. This concept is best supported by **Weak Linguistic Determinism**, which acknowledges that language can evolve in response to changing needs.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD.
