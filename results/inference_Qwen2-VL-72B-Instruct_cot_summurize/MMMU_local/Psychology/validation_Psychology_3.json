The graph shows that the percentage of words recalled is highest at the beginning (Primacy) and at the end (Recency), with a lower recall rate in the middle (Intermediate).\n\nThis pattern is characteristic of the serial position effect, which states that items at the beginning and end of a list are more likely to be remembered than those in the middle.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nE.
