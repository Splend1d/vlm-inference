The blue region is located at the lower part of the brainstem.\n2. The brainstem consists of several parts: the midbrain, pons, and medulla oblongata.\n\nGiven the position of the blue region, it is situated below the pons and above the spinal cord. This places it in the medulla oblongata.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. medulla oblongata"
