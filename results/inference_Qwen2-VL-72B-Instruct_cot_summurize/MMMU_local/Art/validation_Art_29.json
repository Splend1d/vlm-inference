The painting depicts a figure in religious attire, likely a high-ranking church official.\n2. The use of light and shadow, as well as the detailed rendering of the fabric and facial features, suggests a Baroque style.\n3. The overall composition and the realistic portrayal of the figure are indicative of a masterful technique.\n\nGiven these observations, the most likely artist is:\n\nB. Diego Velazquez\n\nDiego Vel\u00e1zquez was a prominent Spanish painter known for his works during the Baroque period, and this painting fits well with his style and subject matter."
