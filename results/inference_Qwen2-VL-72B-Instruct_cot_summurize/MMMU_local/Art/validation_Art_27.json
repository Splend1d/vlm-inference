She sat for several prominent artists, including Francis Bacon and Lucian Freud.\n\nGiven the options:\nA. Maggi Hambling\nB. Elisabeth Frink\nC. Barbara Hepworth\nD. Georgia O'Keeffe\n\nMaggi Hambling is known for her portraits and has been associated with the London art scene, making her a likely candidate. Elisabeth Frink and Barbara Hepworth were sculptors, and Georgia O'Keeffe was an American painter known for her abstract works, which are less likely to be associated with Moraes's portrait sittings.\n\nTherefore, the most likely answer is:\n\nA. Maggi Hambling"
