While it features water spirits, it does not prominently feature mermaids.\n\nB. **The Little Mermaid by Hans Christian Andersen (1836)** - This famous fairy tale features a mermaid who falls in love with a human prince and seeks to become human herself. It is well-known for its mermaid theme.\n\nC. **Around the World in 80 Days by Jules Verne (1873)** - This adventure novel does not feature mermaids or any significant aquatic mythical creatures.\n\nD. **Moby-Dick by Herman Melville (1851)** - This novel is about a man named Ishmael and his voyage on the whaling ship Pequod in pursuit of the white whale Moby Dick. It does not feature mermaids.\n\nGiven that Evelyn De Morgan often used literary sources to inspire her artworks, and considering the prominence of mermaids in the story, the most likely inspiration for her painting is:\n\n**B. The Little Mermaid by Hans Christian Andersen (1836)**"
