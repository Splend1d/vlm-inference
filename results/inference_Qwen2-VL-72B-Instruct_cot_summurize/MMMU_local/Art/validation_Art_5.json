The subject is a woman sitting outdoors, which is a common theme in impressionist art.\n3. The use of light and the way the figure is depicted suggest a connection to the Impressionist movement.\n\nGiven these observations, the artist most likely associated with this style and subject matter is Pierre-Auguste Renoir, who was a prominent figure in the Impressionist movement.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. PIERRE-AUGUSTE RENOIR"
