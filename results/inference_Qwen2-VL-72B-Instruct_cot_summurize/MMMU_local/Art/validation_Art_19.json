The figures are the main subjects, and the space around them is relatively empty, creating a sense of negative space.\n\n2. **Photo 2**: This image displays cylindrical light fixtures with a pattern of holes. The focus is on the light fixtures themselves, and there isn't much empty space around them.\n\n3. **Photo 3**: This image shows two large, cylindrical structures made of bricks. The structures are the main focus, and the surrounding sky provides some negative space, but it is not as pronounced as in Photo 1.\n\nBased on this analysis, the image that features a strong use of negative space is:\n\nA.
