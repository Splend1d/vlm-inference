The confidence level indicates the probability that the interval contains the true population parameter.\n\nIn this scenario, we have calculated a 90% confidence interval for the average cost of running for a congressional seat based on a sample of 50 politicians. The confidence interval is given as $117,500 to $132,500.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it implies that 90% of individual politicians fall within this range, which is not what a confidence interval represents. A confidence interval pertains to the mean, not individual observations.\n\nOption B is incorrect because it suggests that 90% of the means from different samples would fall within this range, which is not accurate. It should be about the confidence in the single sample mean representing the population mean.\n\nOption C is incorrect because it incorrectly states that we are 90% confident that politicians spend within this range individually, rather than focusing on the mean spending.\n\nOption D correctly states that we are 90% confident that the true mean cost of running for a congressional seat falls within the interval of $117,500 to $132,500. This aligns with the proper interpretation of a confidence interval for a mean."
