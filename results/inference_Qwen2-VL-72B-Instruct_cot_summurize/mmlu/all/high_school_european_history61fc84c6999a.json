I had the culprit burned, explaining that the cause was his having killed that Indian and eaten him[,] which was prohibited by Your Majesty, and by me in Your Royal name. I further made the chief understand that all the people . . . must abstain from this custom. . . . I came . . . to protect their lives as well as their property, and to teach them that they were to adore but one God[,] . . . that they must turn from their idols, and the rites they had practiced until then, for these were lies and deceptions which the devil . . . had invented. . . . I, likewise, had come to teach them that Your Majesty, by the will of Divine Providence, rules the universe, and that they also must submit themselves to the imperial yoke, and do all that we who are Your Majesty's ministers here might order them.\n\u2014Hernan Cortez, Fifth Letter to Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, 1521\nWhich of the following superior technologies was most crucial to the Europeans' success in the New World?\n\nA.

Weapons like cannon and war horses\n\nThe passage describes Hernan Cortez's actions in the New World, including punishing an Indian for cannibalism and attempting to convert the indigenous people to Christianity and allegiance to the Spanish crown. The reference to burning the culprit and the emphasis on teaching the Indians about the \"one God\" and submitting to Spanish rule suggest that military force and weapons were crucial to the Europeans' success in the New World. While new sailing technologies and ships were important for reaching the New World, and better educational systems may have contributed to the Europeans' success, the passage specifically highlights the use of weapons and military force to establish control over the indigenous populations."
