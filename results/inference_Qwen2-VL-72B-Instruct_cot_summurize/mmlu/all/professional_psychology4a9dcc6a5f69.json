This is thought to be due to the fact that women are generally more focused on building and maintaining relationships, and asking questions is a way to show interest in the other person and keep the conversation going. Additionally, women may be more likely to use questions as a way to seek information or clarification, whereas men may be more likely to assert their own opinions or ideas. It's important to note that these are general trends and individual behavior can vary widely based on many factors."
