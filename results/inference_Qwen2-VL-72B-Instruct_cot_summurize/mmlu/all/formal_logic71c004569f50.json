O \u2228 P (O or P)\n\nWe will create a truth table with columns for O, P, ~O, ~O \u2283 P, and O \u2228 P.\n\n| O | P | ~O | ~O \u2283 P | O \u2228 P |\n|---|---|----|--------|------|\n| T | T | F  |   T    |  T   |\n| T | F | F  |   T    |  T   |\n| F | T | T  |   T    |  T   |\n| F | F | T  |   F    |  F   |\n\nNow, let's analyze the truth table:\n\n- For the pair (~O \u2283 P) and (O \u2228 P):\n  - When O is True and P is True: Both (~O \u2283 P) and (O \u2228 P) are True.\n  - When O is True and P is False: Both (~O \u2283 P) and (O \u2228 P) are True.\n  - When O is False and P is True: Both (~O \u2283 P) and (O \u2228 P) are True.\n  - When O is False and P is False: (~O \u2283 P) is False and (O \u2228 P) is False.\n\nSince the truth values of (~O \u2283 P) and (O \u2228 P) match in all rows except one (where both are False), these two propositions are not logically equivalent.\n\nNext, let's check if they are contradictory:\n- Contradictory propositions would have opposite truth values in every row. However, there are rows where both (~O \u2283 P) and (O \u2228 P) are True, so they are not contradictory either.\n\nFinally, let's determine if they are consistent or inconsistent:\n- Consistent propositions can be true simultaneously under at least one set of truth values. Since there are rows where both (~O \u2283 P) and (O \u2228 P) are True, they are consistent.\n- Inconsistent propositions cannot be true simultaneously under any set of truth values. Since there are rows where both (~O \u2283 P) and (O \u2228 P) are True, they are not inconsistent.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Neither logically equivalent nor contradictory, but consistent"
