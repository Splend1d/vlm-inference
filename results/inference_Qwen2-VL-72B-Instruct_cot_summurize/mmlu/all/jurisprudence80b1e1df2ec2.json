                    "text": "In a strict product liability tort action, the plaintiff (in this case, Bill) does not need to prove that the defendant (Ajax) was negligent or had knowledge of the defect. Instead, the focus is on the product itself and whether it was defective when it left the manufacturer's control.\n\nGiven this context, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Ajax is a merchant selling Sipep.**\n   - This is generally true in most strict product liability cases, as the seller needs to be identified. However, proving that Ajax is a merchant selling Sipep is more about establishing the chain of distribution rather than a direct requirement for strict liability.\n\nB. **Ajax knew or should have known of the defective condition.**\n   - This is not required in strict product liability. The key point is that the product was defective at the time it left the manufacturer's control, not whether the seller knew about it.\n\nC. **Ajax had prior notice of other similar problems with Sipep products.**\n   - This is also not necessary for strict product liability. The focus is on the specific product and its defectiveness, not on previous incidents involving similar products.\n\nD. **Ajax actually placed the dead insects into the can.**\n   - This is not required either. In strict product liability, the seller is liable if the product was defective when it left their control, regardless of who caused the defect.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**A. Ajax is a merchant selling Sipep.**\n\nThis establishes the relationship between the seller and the product, which is a fundamental aspect of any product liability claim."
