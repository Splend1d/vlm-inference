The spectra of some meteorites are similar to the spectra of asteroids in the asteroid belt.\n\nScientists use various methods to determine the origin of meteorites, but one of the most compelling pieces of evidence comes from spectral analysis. By comparing the light emitted or reflected by meteorites with that of asteroids, scientists have found similarities that suggest many meteorites originate from the asteroid belt. This method allows them to match the composition of meteorites with specific types of asteroids, providing strong evidence for their asteroidal origins.\n\nWhile collisions in the asteroid belt (option C) are indeed a significant factor in how meteoroids are ejected into space and eventually reach Earth, it is the spectral similarity that provides direct evidence linking meteorites to specific asteroids. Options A and D are not accurate because not all meteorites contain bubbles of gas, and while the asteroid belt is a major source of meteorites, it is not the only possible source; some meteorites may also originate from other bodies like Mars or the Moon."
