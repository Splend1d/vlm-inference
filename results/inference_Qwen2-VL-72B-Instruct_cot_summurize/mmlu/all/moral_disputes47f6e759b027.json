In the original scenario, the violinist is connected to your kidneys without your consent, and you are faced with the decision of whether to allow the connection to continue, which would save the violinist's life but might harm you.\n\nIn the modified version where the violinist only needs to use your kidneys for one hour to survive, Thomson's view is that:\n\nA. you have no obligation to let the violinist use your kidneys for that hour.\n\nThis aligns with her broader argument that even if it would be morally commendable to help someone in need, there is no moral obligation to do so if it involves using your body in a way that you did not consent to. The key point here is that the violinist does not have a right to use your kidneys, even for a short period, without your consent."
