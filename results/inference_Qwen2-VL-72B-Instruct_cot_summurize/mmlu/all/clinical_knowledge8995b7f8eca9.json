These patients are more likely to get urinary tract infections if their blood sugar is unstable.\n\nDiabetes can weaken the immune system, making it harder for the body to fight off infections. High blood sugar levels can also create an environment that promotes bacterial growth, increasing the risk of urinary tract infections (UTIs). Therefore, it is crucial to manage blood sugar levels effectively to reduce the likelihood of developing UTIs and other complications associated with diabetes."
