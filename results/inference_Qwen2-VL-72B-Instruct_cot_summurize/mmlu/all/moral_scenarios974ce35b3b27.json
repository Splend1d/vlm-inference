It is more about personal emotional response rather than an action that directly harms others.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n\"I didn't board the submarine because I knew I could infect the crew.\"\n\n- This scenario describes a decision made to avoid potentially harming others by spreading an infection.\n- The action here is actually a responsible choice aimed at preventing harm to others.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n- Scenario 1 involves a lack of empathy but no direct wrongdoing.\n- Scenario 2 involves a responsible action to prevent harm.\n\nTherefore, neither scenario involves a clear moral wrongdoing according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong"
