CaCl2 - Calcium Chloride\n- Calcium (Ca) typically forms a +2 ion.\n- Chlorine (Cl) typically forms a -1 ion.\n- The formula CaCl2 indicates 1 calcium ion and 2 chlorine ions, which balances out correctly.\n- The name \"calcium chloride\" is correct.\n\nB. Fe(NO3)3 - Iron(III) Nitrate\n- Iron can form +2 or +3 ions.\n- Nitrate (NO3) has a -1 charge.\n- The formula Fe(NO3)3 indicates 1 iron ion and 3 nitrate ions, which means the iron must have a +3 charge to balance the -3 total charge from the nitrates.\n- The name \"iron(III) nitrate\" is correct.\n\nC. AlBr3 - Aluminum Tribromide\n- Aluminum (Al) typically forms a +3 ion.\n- Bromine (Br) typically forms a -1 ion.\n- The formula AlBr3 indicates 1 aluminum ion and 3 bromine ions, which balances out correctly.\n- The name \"aluminum tribromide\" is correct.\n\nD. K2Cr2O7 - Potassium Dichromate\n- Potassium (K) typically forms a +1 ion.\n- Dichromate (Cr2O7) has a -2 charge.\n- The formula K2Cr2O7 indicates 2 potassium ions and 1 dichromate ion, which balances out correctly.\n- However, the name should be \"potassium dichromate,\" not \"potassium dichromate.\"\n\nTherefore, the incorrectly named compound is:\n\nD. K2Cr2O7 - Potassium dichromate"
