An undercover police officer knocked on the woman's door and told her that he was willing to pay for usable credit cards. When the woman asked if he was a police officer, the officer replied, \"No,\" giving her a false name and saying, \"You can call Harvey \u0080\u0094he'll vouch for me.\" The woman admitted him to her house. After she left the room to call Harvey, the officer lifted some papers off a desk and underneath discovered three credit cards bearing different names. He seized the cards, and when the woman returned, he arrested her. The woman has moved to suppress the evidence seized on the ground that her Fourth Amendment rights were violated. Should the court grant the motion to suppress?\n\nA. No, because it was immediately apparent that the cards were stolen.\nB. No, because the woman assumed the risk that the officer would seize items in plain sight.\nC. Yes, because the woman's rights were violated when the officer lifted the papers.\nD. Yes, because the woman's rights were violated when the officer obtained entry by deceit.\n"

                    "text": "To determine whether the court should grant the motion to suppress the evidence seized, we need to analyze the situation based on the principles of the Fourth Amendment, which protects individuals against unreasonable searches and seizures.\n\n1. **Entry into the House:**\n   - The officer gained entry by lying about his identity and purpose. This raises questions about the voluntariness of the woman's consent to enter her home. Consent obtained through deceit may not be considered voluntary under the law.\n\n2. **Search and Seizure:**\n   - Once inside, the officer lifted papers off a desk and found the credit cards. This action goes beyond what is typically considered a search in plain view. The officer actively manipulated the environment to discover the evidence.\n\nGiven these points:\n\n- **Option A:** \"No, because it was immediately apparent that the cards were stolen.\"\n  - This option suggests that the plain view doctrine applies. However, the plain view doctrine requires that the officer must have had a lawful right to be in the position from which the evidence was observed. Here, the officer's entry was arguably unlawful due to deceit.\n\n- **Option B:** \"No, because the woman assumed the risk that the officer would seize items in plain sight.\"\n  - This option implies that the woman should have known the risks of leaving incriminating evidence in plain sight. However, this does not address the legality of the officer's entry or the subsequent search.\n\n- **Option C:** \"Yes, because the woman's rights were violated when the officer lifted the papers.\"\n  - This option correctly identifies that the officer's act of lifting papers off the desk to find the credit cards constitutes an active search that likely violates the Fourth Amendment.\n\n- **Option D:** \"Yes, because the woman's rights were violated when the officer obtained entry by deceit.\"\n  - This option also correctly identifies that the officer's deceitful entry into the home could be seen as a violation of the woman's Fourth Amendment rights.\n\nConsidering both the deceitful entry and the subsequent active search, the most comprehensive answer is:\n\n**Final Answer: D. Yes, because the woman's rights were violated when the officer obtained entry by deceit.**\n\nThis option addresses both the initial deceitful entry and the subsequent search, which together form a strong basis for granting the motion to suppress the evidence."
