She does not use condoms or other contraception. The mother is concerned about her behavior. The patient's parents separated 3 months ago. She had been an honor student and excelled in sports and leadership positions at school before the separation. Since the separation, however, she has become sullen, defiant, and rebellious. She has begun smoking cigarettes, disobeying her curfew, and being truant from school. This patient is most likely using which of the following defense mechanisms?\n\nA. Acting out\nB. Displacement\nC. Projection\nD. Reaction formation\n"

Acting out\n\nThe patient's behavior\u2014engaging in risky sexual activity, smoking cigarettes, disobeying her curfew, and being truant from school\u2014suggests that she is using the defense mechanism of acting out. Acting out involves expressing unconscious conflicts or unacceptable impulses through behavior rather than through verbal expression or introspection. In this case, the patient's actions may be a way for her to cope with the emotional distress caused by her parents' separation."
