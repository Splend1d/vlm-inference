A dissolution of hierarchical modes of authority into collaborative team-based decision protocols\n\nThe concept of McDonaldization, as described by sociologist George Ritzer, refers to the process by which the principles of the fast-food industry are applied to various sectors of society. This includes aspects such as efficiency, calculability (cost/benefit analysis), predictability (sameness across diverse markets), and control through bureaucracy. The dissolution of hierarchical modes of authority into collaborative team-based decision protocols does not align with the typical characteristics of McDonaldization, which often emphasizes rigid hierarchies and standardized procedures."
