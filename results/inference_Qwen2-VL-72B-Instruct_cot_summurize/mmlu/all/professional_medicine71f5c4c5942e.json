The greenish discharge described in the patient's presentation is consistent with this condition. While breast cancer can also present with nipple discharge, it is typically bloody or serous rather than greenish. Fibrocystic disease is a benign condition that can cause lumps and pain but is less likely to cause nipple discharge. Pituitary adenomas can cause hormonal changes that may affect breast function, but they are not typically associated with nipple discharge."
