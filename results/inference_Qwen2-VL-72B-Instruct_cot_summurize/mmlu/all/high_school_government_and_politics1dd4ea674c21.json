The importance of the issue to a particular individual or group\n\nSalience refers to the perceived importance or relevance of an issue to individuals or groups. It indicates how much attention and priority a particular issue holds for them. While media coverage, public opinion shifts, and the number of people affected can influence salience, they do not directly define it. Salience is fundamentally about the subjective importance of an issue to those who are concerned with it."
