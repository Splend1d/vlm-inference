It provides educational and recreational experiences for children.\n- There is no inherent harm or wrongdoing in this action unless there are specific circumstances not mentioned here (e.g., mistreatment of animals at the zoo).\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n\"When Karen was resting, I threw water on her.\"\n- Throwing water on someone without their consent, especially when they are resting, can be seen as an act of disrespect and potentially harmful.\n- This action could cause discomfort, embarrassment, or even physical harm, depending on the context and the amount of water thrown.\n\nBased on these analyses:\n- Scenario 1 is not wrong.\n- Scenario 2 is wrong.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong"
