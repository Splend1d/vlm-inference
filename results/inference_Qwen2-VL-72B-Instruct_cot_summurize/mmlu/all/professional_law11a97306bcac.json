The brothers took the wife hostage, pointed a gun at her head, and demanded that she drive them in her car to their hideout. As the wife was driving down the street, a woman pushing her baby in a stroller suddenly stopped in the middle of the intersection. In order to avoid hitting the woman and her child, the wife veered the car to the left, and intentionally struck a bystander, instantly killing him. If the wife is subsequently prosecuted for the murder of the bystander, she will most likely be found\n\nA. guilty, because she intentionally veered the car, striking the bystander.\nB. not guilty, by reason of necessity.\nC. not guilty, by reason of duress.\nD. not guilty, by reason of self-defense.\n"

                    "text": "The scenario described involves a complex legal situation where the wife acted under significant duress and faced an immediate threat to herself and potentially others. Let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Guilty, because she intentionally veered the car, striking the bystander.**\n   - This option suggests that the wife's intentional action makes her guilty of murder. However, the context of her actions under duress and the necessity to avoid a more immediate danger (the woman with the baby) complicates this straightforward interpretation.\n\nB. **Not guilty, by reason of necessity.**\n   - Necessity is a defense that can be invoked when someone commits an illegal act to prevent a greater harm. In this case, the wife veered the car to avoid hitting the woman and her baby, which could have resulted in severe injury or death. This defense might apply if it can be shown that her actions were necessary to prevent a greater harm.\n\nC. **Not guilty, by reason of duress.**\n   - Duress is a defense used when someone commits a crime because they were coerced or threatened with immediate harm. Here, the wife was under the control of the kidnappers who had a gun pointed at her head. This coercion could justify her actions as being taken under duress.\n\nD. **Not guilty, by reason of self-defense.**\n   - Self-defense typically applies when someone uses force to protect themselves from an immediate threat of harm. While the wife was indeed under threat, her action of veering the car was more about avoiding hitting the woman and baby rather than directly defending herself against the kidnappers.\n\nGiven the circumstances, the most appropriate defense seems to be duress, as the wife was coerced into acting under the threat posed by the kidnappers. Therefore, the most likely outcome would be:\n\n**C. Not guilty, by reason of duress.**"
