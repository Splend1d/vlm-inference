No, technological and institutional innovations have permitted food supplies to more than keep pace with population growth.\nB. Yes, it is only because of widespread famines that population has not overwhelmed food supplies altogether.\nC. No, but it is only because of the introduction of genetically modified food that supplies have kept pace with population growth.\nD. No, but supplies are not likely to keep pace with population growth over the next 10 years.\n"

No, technological and institutional innovations have permitted food supplies to more than keep pace with population growth.\n\nThis answer reflects the historical perspective on Thomas Robert Malthus's theory, which suggested that population growth would inevitably outstrip food production, leading to widespread famine and other social ills. However, advancements in agriculture, technology, and institutional frameworks have significantly increased food production capabilities, allowing for the support of growing populations without the dire consequences predicted by Malthus."
