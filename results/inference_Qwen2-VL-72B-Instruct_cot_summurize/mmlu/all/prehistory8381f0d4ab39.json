The structure of the innominate (pelvis), including the ilium and ischium: Bipedalism requires a pelvis that supports the body's weight and allows for efficient walking and running. The shape and orientation of the ilium and ischium can indicate adaptations for bipedal locomotion.\n\nB. The position of the foramen magnum: In bipedal species, the foramen magnum (the opening at the base of the skull through which the spinal cord passes) is positioned more towards the bottom center of the skull, allowing for an upright posture.\n\nC. The absence of a divergent big toe: In bipedal species, the big toe is aligned with the other toes to form a flat foot, which is better suited for walking on two legs. In non-bipedal species, the big toe often diverges from the other toes, aiding in grasping or climbing.\n\nTherefore, all these features together provide strong evidence for determining whether a species was bipedal."
