The endpoint is determined by the stoichiometry of the reaction, not by when the indicator is added.\n\nB. **The wrong indicator was used.**\n   - Using the wrong indicator could lead to an incorrect endpoint, but it wouldn't necessarily cause one sample to require significantly more base than the others. It would likely affect all samples similarly.\n\nC. **There was a base contaminating the unclean beaker.**\n   - If there was a base contaminating the beaker, it would neutralize some of the acid (phenol) before the titration started, thus requiring less base to reach the endpoint. This does not explain why one sample required significantly more base.\n\nD. **There was an acid contaminating the unclean beaker.**\n   - If there was an acid contaminating the beaker, it would react with the base added during the titration, thus requiring more base to neutralize both the original acid (phenol) and the contaminant acid. This would result in one sample requiring significantly more base to reach the endpoint.\n\nGiven the context and the options provided, the most plausible explanation for why one of the samples required significantly more base to reach the endpoint is:\n\n**D. There was an acid contaminating the unclean beaker.**"
