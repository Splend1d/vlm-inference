Indiscriminate attack.\n\nIn the context of military operations and the Revolution in Military Affairs (RMA), which refers to significant changes in military technology, doctrine, and organization, terms like \"surgical strike,\" \"smart bomb,\" and \"precision target\" are often used to describe highly accurate and targeted actions that minimize collateral damage. On the other hand, \"indiscriminate attack\" implies a lack of precision and control, leading to widespread and potentially uncontrolled damage, which is not aligned with the principles of modern, high-tech warfare emphasized by RMA."
