The period of rotation is the same on every point on the disk.\n\nExplanation:\nWhen a solid disk rotates, every point on the disk completes one full rotation in the same amount of time, which is known as the period of rotation. This means that regardless of how far a point is from the center (axis), it will take the same amount of time to go around once.\n\nLet's clarify why the other options are incorrect:\n\nA. The velocity is not the same on every point on the disk. The tangential velocity \\( v \\) at any point on the disk is given by \\( v = r\\omega \\), where \\( r \\) is the distance from the axis and \\( \\omega \\) is the angular velocity. Since \\( r \\) varies across different points on the disk, the velocity also varies.\n\nB. The part closer to the axis does not have a longer period. All parts of the disk complete one rotation in the same amount of time, so they all have the same period.\n\nD. The part closer to the axis does not have a shorter period. As mentioned earlier, all parts of the disk have the same period of rotation."
