The niece and her husband took immediate possession of the farm and lived there with their daughter and son. Thereafter, the husband died in an automobile accident. In 1972, two years after her father's death, the daughter moved to another state. The son lived with his mother on the farm until her death intestate in 1980. The son continued in exclusive possession of the farm until his death in 2001. In his will, the son devised the farm to a local charity. When he was alive, the son was unaware that his sister was still alive and that title to the farm had descended to the two of them as their mother's sole surviving heirs. Since his mother's death in 1980, the son has held himself out as the owner of the farm, maintaining it and paying all of the taxes on the property. The sister had not communicated with either her mother or her brother since her redomiciling in 1972. The jurisdiction in which the farm is located has a 20-year limitation period for the acquisition of property by adverse possession. What interest, if any, does the sister have in the property?\n\nA. None, because of her own laches.\nB. None, because the brother acquired title to the farm by adverse possession.\nC. An undivided one-half interest because the brother's possession was not adverse to her title.\nD. An undivided one-half interest because the 20-year limitation period did not run against her because she was unaware of the brother's exclusive possession.\n"

                    "text": "To determine the sister's interest in the property, we need to analyze the situation step-by-step:\n\n1. **Initial Ownership**: The farm was initially owned by the farmer who devised it to his niece and her husband as tenants by the entirety.\n\n2. **Death of the Husband**: Upon the husband's death, the entire interest in the farm passed to the wife (the niece) due to the nature of tenancy by the entirety.\n\n3. **Intestate Succession**: The niece died intestate in 1980. As she had no will, her estate would be divided among her surviving heirs. Her surviving heirs were her son and daughter.\n\n4. **Exclusive Possession by Son**: The son continued to live on the farm and maintained it exclusively from 1980 until his death in 2001. He paid all taxes and held himself out as the owner of the farm.\n\n5. **Adverse Possession**: The jurisdiction has a 20-year limitation period for acquiring property through adverse possession. The son's exclusive possession began in 1980 and continued until his death in 2001, which is more than 20 years.\n\n6. **Awareness of Sister**: The sister was unaware of her brother's exclusive possession and did not communicate with him or her mother since 1972.\n\nGiven these points, let's evaluate each option:\n\n**Option A: None, because of her own laches.**\n- Laches refers to a legal doctrine that prevents a claim from being brought due to undue delay. However, laches typically applies when the party with the claim knew about the adverse possession but delayed taking action. Here, the sister was unaware of her brother's possession, so laches would not apply.\n\n**Option B: None, because the brother acquired title to the farm by adverse possession.**\n- Adverse possession requires that the possessor's actions must be hostile, actual, open, notorious, continuous, and exclusive. The son's possession meets these criteria, and since it exceeded the 20-year limitation period, he could have acquired title by adverse possession.\n\n**Option C: An undivided one-half interest because the brother's possession was not adverse to her title.**\n- This option suggests that the brother's possession was not adverse to the sister's title. However, the brother's exclusive possession and payment of taxes indicate that his possession was indeed adverse to her title.\n\n**Option D: An undivided one-half interest because the 20-year limitation period did not run against her because she was unaware of the brother's exclusive possession.**\n- The law generally requires that the adverse possessor's actions be known or should reasonably have been known to the true owner. If the sister was unaware of her brother's possession, the 20-year period might not have run against her. However, this depends on whether the jurisdiction recognizes constructive notice or actual knowledge as sufficient for the adverse possession period to commence.\n\nConsidering the details provided and the principles of adverse possession, the most accurate answer is:\n\n**B. None, because the brother acquired title to the farm by adverse possession.**\n\nThe son's exclusive possession, maintenance of the property, and payment of taxes for over 20 years meet the requirements for adverse possession, thereby extinguishing the sister's interest in the property."
