The anxiety reaction of a woman who is driving on the highway for the first time after being involved in a major accident on that highway\n\nThis response is most likely acquired through classical conditioning because it involves an association between a neutral stimulus (driving on the highway) and an unconditioned stimulus (the major accident) that elicits an emotional response (anxiety). Over time, the neutral stimulus alone can come to elicit the same emotional response, which is a hallmark of classical conditioning."
