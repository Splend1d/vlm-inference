The teachers want more money, and the district, claiming, as always, budget constraints, wants to pay as little as possible. The district, like most, has a large number of moderately paid teachers and a few highly paid administrators. The salaries of all teachers and administrators are included in trying to figure out, on average, how much the professional staff currently earn. Which of the following would the teachers' union be most likely to quote during negotiations?\n\nA. The mean of all the salaries.\nB. The mode of all the salaries.\nC.

The median of all the salaries** during negotiations.\n\nHere\u2019s why:\n\n1. **Mean (Average) of All Salaries**: This includes both the moderately paid teachers and the highly paid administrators. Since there are fewer administrators but they are paid significantly more, the mean would be skewed upwards, making it seem like the average salary is higher than what most teachers actually earn. This would not serve the teachers' interests well in negotiations.\n\n2. **Mode of All Salaries**: The mode represents the most frequently occurring salary. In this scenario, since there are many more teachers than administrators, the mode would likely reflect the salary of the majority of teachers. However, the mode does not provide a comprehensive measure of central tendency that includes all salaries, which might make it less effective in negotiations compared to the median.\n\n3. **Standard Deviation of All Salaries**: This measures the dispersion or spread of salaries around the mean. While useful for understanding variability, it doesn't directly represent a typical salary and wouldn't be as persuasive in negotiations about average earnings.\n\n4. **Median of All Salaries**: The median is the middle value when all salaries are arranged in order. It is not affected by extreme values (like the high salaries of administrators). Therefore, it provides a better representation of what the typical teacher earns, excluding the influence of the highly paid administrators. This makes it a stronger argument for the teachers' union to use in negotiations to demonstrate that their current salaries are lower than what the district might suggest based on the mean.\n\nThus, the median would be the most advantageous statistic for the teachers' union to quote during negotiations to support their case for higher salaries."
