The defendant put a loaded gun in his coat pocket and went outside for a walk, not sure if and when he may see the victim. The defendant passed by a bar and decided to go inside for a drink. While in the bar, he drank several bottles of beer and became intoxicated. While walking home from the bar, the defendant bumped into the victim. As soon as the defendant recognized him, he pulled out his gun and shot and killed the victim. In this jurisdiction, first-degree murder is defined as a premeditated and deliberate killing. All other forms of murder are second-degree murder. The defendant is guilty of\n\nA. first-degree murder.\nB. second-degree murder.\nC. involuntary manslaughter.\nD. voluntary manslaughter.\n"

The defendant must have planned the killing beforehand with a clear intention to kill.\n\n2. **Second-Degree Murder**: This involves an intentional killing without premeditation or deliberation but still with malice aforethought (the intent to cause serious harm or death).\n\n3. **Involuntary Manslaughter**: This occurs when someone causes another person's death through reckless behavior or negligence, without any intent to kill.\n\n4. **Voluntary Manslaughter**: This involves an intentional killing that is provoked by adequate provocation, such as in the heat of passion.\n\nGiven the details:\n\n- The defendant had a loaded gun in his coat pocket, indicating some level of preparation.\n- He was not sure if and when he would encounter the victim, suggesting there was no immediate plan to commit the murder at the time he left his house.\n- He became intoxicated while drinking at the bar, which could affect his judgment and decision-making.\n- Upon encountering the victim, he immediately recognized him and shot him, indicating a spontaneous reaction rather than a premeditated act.\n\nConsidering these points, the defendant did not have a specific plan to kill the victim at the exact moment he encountered him. Instead, the killing appears to be a spontaneous act driven by the defendant\u2019s recognition of the victim and his existing hatred towards him.\n\nTherefore, the most fitting charge under these circumstances is:\n\n**B. Second-degree murder.**\n\nThis conclusion aligns with the fact that the killing was intentional but lacked the premeditation required for first-degree murder."
