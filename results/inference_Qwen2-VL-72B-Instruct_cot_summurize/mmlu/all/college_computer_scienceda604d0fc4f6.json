It works by repeatedly dividing in half the portion of the list that could contain the item, until you've narrowed down the possible locations to just one.\n\nHere's how it applies to this scenario:\n\n1. **Initial Range**: The range of numbers Bob can choose from is from 1 to 1,000.\n2. **Binary Search Strategy**: With each question, Mary can divide the remaining range in half. For example, her first question might be: \"Is the number greater than 500?\" This would eliminate either the lower half (1-500) or the upper half (501-1000) of the range.\n3. **Worst Case Scenario**: In the worst case, Mary will continue to ask questions until she has narrowed down the range to a single number.\n\nThe key point here is to determine how many times we can halve the range before reaching a single number. We can express this mathematically using logarithms. Specifically, we want to find the smallest integer \\( n \\) such that:\n\\[ 2^n \\geq 1000 \\]\n\nWe calculate:\n\\[ \\log_2(1000) \\approx 9.97 \\]\n\nSince we need an integer value and we're looking for the worst-case scenario, we round up to the next whole number:\n\\[ n = 10 \\]\n\nTherefore, in the worst case, Mary will need to ask exactly 10 questions to determine the number Bob wrote down.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nD. 10"
