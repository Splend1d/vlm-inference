Intent can be demonstrated through various means, including:\n\nA. A law that is discriminatory on its face: This refers to laws that explicitly target or exclude certain groups based on characteristics such as race, gender, religion, etc.\n\nB. A discriminatory application of a facially neutral law: This involves the enforcement of laws in a manner that disproportionately affects one group over another, even if the law itself appears neutral on its face.\n\nD. A discriminatory motive: This involves showing that the government's actions were motivated by an intention to discriminate against a particular group.\n\nHowever, a discriminatory effect alone is not sufficient to prove discriminatory intent. Discriminatory effects may occur without intentional discrimination, and proving intent requires evidence beyond just the outcomes. Therefore, option C is the correct choice."
