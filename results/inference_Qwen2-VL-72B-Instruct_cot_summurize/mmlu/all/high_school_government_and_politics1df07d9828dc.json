Presidential elections typically have higher voter turnout compared to midterm elections.\n\nB. **Voters lacking party affiliation tend to vote less regularly than those with strong party affiliation.**\n   - This statement is also generally true. Party affiliation often motivates individuals to vote more consistently.\n\nC. **Young adults are less likely to vote than senior citizens.**\n   - This statement is true as well. Historically, younger age groups have lower voter turnout rates compared to older age groups.\n\nD. **Individuals are more likely to vote when they believe they know which candidate will win an election.**\n   - This statement is not necessarily true. In fact, many studies suggest that individuals might be less likely to vote if they believe their vote won't make a difference or if they think the outcome is already decided. This phenomenon is known as \"voter apathy\" or \"strategic voting.\"\n\nGiven this analysis, the statement that is LEAST true is:\n\n**D. Individuals are more likely to vote when they believe they know which candidate will win an election.**"
