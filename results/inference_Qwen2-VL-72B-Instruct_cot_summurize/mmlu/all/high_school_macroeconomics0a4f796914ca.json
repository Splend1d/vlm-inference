An increase in government spending\n\nAn increase in government spending is likely to increase real GDP because it directly adds to the aggregate demand in an economy, which can lead to increased production and economic growth. The other options (an increase in the real rate of interest, an increase in taxes, and a decrease in net exports) tend to have contractionary effects on the economy and are less likely to increase real GDP."
