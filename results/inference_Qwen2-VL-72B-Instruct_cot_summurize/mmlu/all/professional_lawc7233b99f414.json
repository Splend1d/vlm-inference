The buyer later stopped the seller from continuing to use the strip for travel because no road had been constructed. The landowner sued the buyer, claiming that he still owned the forty-foot strip of land because it was not conveyed in the deed and was at best ambiguously stated. Will the court consider the outside evidence that the parties intended this to be a right-of-way over the buyer's land?\n\nA. No, the court will confine itself to what is in the four corners of the deed.\nB. No, because that would violate the parole evidence rule.\nC. Yes, because the court always has a right to reform the wording of a deed according to the court's interpretation of what it means.\nD. Yes, because an ambiguously-worded easement or right-of-way can be supplemented by outside information to get at the true intention of the parties.\n"

Yes, because an ambiguously-worded easement or right-of-way can be supplemented by outside information to get at the true intention of the parties.\n\nIn legal terms, when a deed contains ambiguous language, courts may look beyond the four corners of the document to determine the intent of the parties involved. This is particularly relevant in cases involving easements or rights-of-way, where the specific nature and extent of the right must be clearly understood. The court may consider external evidence such as the side agreement mentioned to clarify the intentions of the parties regarding the use of the strip of land."
