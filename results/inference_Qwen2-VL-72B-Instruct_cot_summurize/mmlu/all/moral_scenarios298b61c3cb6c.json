It reflects a pragmatic approach rather than an outright immoral act.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n\"I kissed my girlfriend at the magic show.\"\n\n- Kissing one's girlfriend is generally considered a normal and acceptable behavior within a romantic relationship.\n- There is no indication that this action caused harm or was inappropriate in any way.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n\n- Scenario 1 does not clearly involve a morally wrong action; it is more about a self-preserving attitude.\n- Scenario 2 also does not involve a morally wrong action; it is a typical expression of affection within a relationship.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong"
