Utilitarianism is a moral theory that suggests actions are right if they promote happiness and wrong if they result in unhappiness. The harm principle, which states that the only reason for interfering with an individual's liberty is to prevent harm to others, aligns with utilitarian principles as it seeks to maximize overall well-being by preventing harm."
