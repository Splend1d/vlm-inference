The contract provided that the construction company would be paid upon completion of the warehouse. The contractor finished the warehouse but it had some minor deviations from the plans due to substitution for certain building materials that were not available in the market. The construction company finished working and demanded payment. The paper company refused to pay based on deviations from the specifications. Will the construction company likely prevail in a breach of contract action against the paper company?\n\nA. Yes, a company that performs construction work can always collect for what it has done on a job.\nB. No, the construction company cannot change the specifications and hope to get paid.\nC. No, the construction company is guilty of fraud and misrepresentation.\nD. Yes, the construction company has substantially performed the contract.\n"

Yes, the construction company has substantially performed the contract.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, if a party has substantially performed their contractual obligations despite minor deviations or defects, they may still be entitled to payment. Substantial performance means that the party has completed the majority of the work as per the contract's terms, even if there are some minor issues. In this case, since the warehouse was completed with only minor deviations due to the unavailability of specific building materials, the construction company could argue that they have substantially performed the contract. The paper company would then be obligated to pay, potentially minus any deductions for the cost of correcting the deviations or for any damages caused by them."
