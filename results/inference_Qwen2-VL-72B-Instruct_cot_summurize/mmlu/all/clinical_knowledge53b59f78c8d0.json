Common causes include benign prostatic hyperplasia (enlarged prostate) in men, tumors, or strictures in the urethra. While other options like haematuria, drinking alcohol, and kidney stones can affect urination, they are less likely to directly cause acute urinary retention compared to bladder outflow obstruction."
