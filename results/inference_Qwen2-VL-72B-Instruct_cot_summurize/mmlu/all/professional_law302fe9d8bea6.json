The city acquired a valid easement for construction of the sewer from the development company that owned the subdivision. One year later a buyer purchased a house within the subdivision. Unknown to the buyer, the sewer line ran across his property, approximately 10 feet beneath the foundation of his home. The deed that the buyer received from the grantor, the development company, made no mention of the easement. Ten years after the buyer purchased his house, a crack in the sewer line caused water to leak into the buyer's basement. The flooding resulted in extensive damage to his home. The city has abolished governmental immunity. In an appropriate action by the buyer against the city to recover damages, the plaintiff will probably\n\nA. not prevail, because the sewer line was installed before the buyer purchased the property.\nB. not prevail, because the city had acquired a valid easement for the sewer line.\nC. prevail, only if the sewer line was negligently maintained.\nD. prevail, because under the circumstances, the sewer line constituted a public nuisance.\n"

Even though the city had a valid easement to install and maintain the sewer line, it still has a duty to ensure that the infrastructure is properly maintained to prevent harm to adjacent properties. If the city failed to maintain the sewer line adequately, leading to the damage, the buyer could potentially succeed in a negligence claim. The fact that the sewer line was installed before the buyer purchased the property and the existence of the easement do not absolve the city of its maintenance responsibilities."
