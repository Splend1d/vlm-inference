Unbeknownst to the defendant, the woman had just stolen the briefcase from the man on the street. Believing the woman to be the victim of an attack, the defendant intervened and punched the man until the woman was able to get away with the briefcase. Confused as to why he wasn't being hailed as a hero by the woman, the defendant eventually realized that he had been an unwitting accomplice to the woman's theft. The defendant apologized profusely to the man and went home. According to the alter ego rule, which of the following statements is correct with respect to the amount of force that the defendant was entitled to use in the woman's defense?\n\nA. Since the defendant did not stand in any personal relationship with the woman, he was not justified in using force in her defense.\nB. Not knowing the true facts, the defendant was not justified in using force to protect the woman because the man was privileged to recapture his briefcase.\nC. The defendant was justified in using reasonable force in the woman's defense, since he reasonably believed she was in immediate danger of unlawful bodily harm from the man.\nD. The defendant was justified in using reasonable force in the woman's defense, since his belief that she was in immediate danger of unlawful bodily harm from the man was both objectively and subjectively reasonable.\n"

Given this context, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. This statement is incorrect because the alter ego rule does not require a personal relationship between the defender and the person being defended.\n\nB. This statement is partially correct but misses the key point about the defendant's reasonable belief. While it is true that the man was privileged to recapture his property, the defendant's intervention was based on a mistaken but reasonable belief that the woman was being attacked.\n\nC. This statement is correct. The defendant was justified in using reasonable force in the woman's defense because he reasonably believed she was in immediate danger of unlawful bodily harm from the man.\n\nD. This statement is also correct but adds an unnecessary distinction between objective and subjective reasonableness. The defendant's belief was reasonable, and that is sufficient under the alter ego rule.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. The defendant was justified in using reasonable force in the woman's defense, since he reasonably believed she was in immediate danger of unlawful bodily harm from the man."
