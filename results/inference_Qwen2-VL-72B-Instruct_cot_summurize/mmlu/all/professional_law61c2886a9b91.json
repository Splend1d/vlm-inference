At trial, the widow offered the testimony of a coworker of the husband. The coworker testified that he had seen the rail car on which the husband was riding slow down and the cars behind it gain speed. The coworker also stated that he later heard a loud crash, but did not turn around to look because loud noises were common in the yard. Three other railroad employees testified that no collision had occurred. At the close of the evidence, the railroad moved for judgment as a matter of law, which was denied, and the case was submitted to the jury. The jury returned a verdict for the widow. The railroad has made a renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law. What standard should the court apply to determine how to rule on the motion?\n\nA. Whether the evidence revealed a genuine dispute of material fact supporting the widow's claim.\nB. Whether the verdict is against the weight of the evidence.\nC. Whether the widow presented a scintilla of evidence to support the verdict.\nD. Whether there is substantial evidence in the record to support the verdict, resolving all disputed issues in the widow's favor.\n"

Whether there is substantial evidence in the record to support the verdict, resolving all disputed issues in the widow's favor.\n\nThis standard is consistent with the legal principle that a motion for judgment as a matter of law (JMOL) is appropriate only if there is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find for the party on that issue. In other words, the court must determine whether, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party (in this case, the widow), there is substantial evidence to support the jury's verdict. If there is, the motion should be denied; if not, the motion should be granted."
