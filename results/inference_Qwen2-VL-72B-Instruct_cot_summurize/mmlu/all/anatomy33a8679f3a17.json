When this block is successfully administered, it results in anesthesia of the lower lip, the mandibular teeth on the side where the block was performed, as well as the labial (outer) gingivae of the anterior mandibular teeth and the buccal (cheek-side) gingivae of the posterior mandibular teeth. This block does not typically anesthetize the tongue or the floor of the mouth unless additional local anesthetic is infiltrated into those areas."
