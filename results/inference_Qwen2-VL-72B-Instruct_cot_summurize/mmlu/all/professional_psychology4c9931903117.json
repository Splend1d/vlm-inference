This includes acknowledging the limitations of their data and conclusions to avoid misleading testimony or reports. Stating conclusions in tentative terms (option A) can also be important, but it is not as directly related to avoiding misleading testimony as acknowledging the limits of their data or conclusions. Refusing to testify if they have had a prior professional relationship with one of the parties (option B) addresses potential conflicts of interest rather than the accuracy of testimony. Providing access to psychometric information (option C) is about transparency and may not directly address the issue of misleading testimony."
