                    "text": "To determine the populations of the 1H energy levels after a 5.0 \u03bcs pulse with B1 = 4.697 mT, we need to consider the effect of the RF pulse on the nuclear spins in the presence of an external magnetic field.\n\nThe RF pulse causes the spins to precess around the effective magnetic field (which is the vector sum of the external magnetic field and the RF field). The duration and strength of the pulse determine how much the spins flip between the \u03b1 and \u03b2 states.\n\nFor a 5.0 \u03bcs pulse with B1 = 4.697 mT, we can calculate the flip angle using the formula:\n\n\u03b8 = \u03b3 * B1 * t\n\nwhere:\n- \u03b8 is the flip angle in radians,\n- \u03b3 is the gyromagnetic ratio for 1H (approximately 26.75 \u00d7 10^7 rad/T\u00b7s),\n- B1 is the amplitude of the RF field (4.697 mT or 4.697 \u00d7 10^-3 T),\n- t is the pulse duration (5.0 \u03bcs or 5.0 \u00d7 10^-6 s).\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\u03b8 = (26.75 \u00d7 10^7 rad/T\u00b7s) * (4.697 \u00d7 10^-3 T) * (5.0 \u00d7 10^-6 s)\n\n\u03b8 \u2248 628.3 rad\n\nThis corresponds to approximately 100 revolutions, which means the spins will be completely flipped multiple times during the pulse. However, since the question asks about the populations after the pulse, we need to consider the net effect of this flipping.\n\nAfter a complete flip (180\u00b0), the populations of the \u03b1 and \u03b2 states would swap. Since the pulse duration is long enough for multiple flips, the final populations will depend on whether the number of flips is odd or even.\n\nIf the number of flips is odd, the populations will swap (n\u03b1 becomes n\u03b2eq and n\u03b2 becomes n\u03b1eq).\nIf the number of flips is even, the populations will return to their initial state (n\u03b1 remains n\u03b1eq and n\u03b2 remains n\u03b2eq).\n\nGiven that the flip angle corresponds to approximately 100 revolutions, which is an even number, the populations will return to their initial state.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. n\u03b1 = n\u03b1eq and n\u03b2 = n\u03b2eq"
