The motel owner's conviction would likely be overturned based on the principle that consenting adults have the right to view such films in private. This is grounded in the concept of privacy rights, which are protected under the U.S. Constitution. The Supreme Court has ruled in cases like Stanley v. Georgia (1969) that adults have a constitutional right to possess and view obscene materials in the privacy of their own homes. Since the motel rooms are considered private spaces, the state statute prohibiting the showing of obscene films in public areas does not apply to these private settings. Therefore, the owner's conviction would probably be overturned on this basis."
