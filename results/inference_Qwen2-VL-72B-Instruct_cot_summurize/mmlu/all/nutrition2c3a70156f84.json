It is partly related to sympathetic nervous system activity, which increases during the postprandial phase (after a meal) to help with digestion and metabolism. This increased sympathetic activity contributes to the rise in energy expenditure observed during TEF.\n\nOptions A, B, and D are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nA. The thermic effect of food is generally higher for protein compared to carbohydrates or fats, not the other way around.\n\nB. The thermic effect of food typically results in an increase in body core temperature due to the metabolic processes involved in digesting and utilizing the nutrients from the food.\n\nD. Food malabsorption can indeed attenuate the thermic effect of food because if nutrients are not properly absorbed, the body will not expend as much energy processing them."
