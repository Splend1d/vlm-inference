To consent to the consignment year after year of hundreds of innocent victims to a cruel and untimely end, when the power exists of preventing it, is a predicament which no conscience can contemplate without horror. But, on the other hand, to put to hazard by a contrary course the very safety of the British Empire in India is an alternative which itself may be considered a still greater evil. When we had powerful neighbours and greater reason to doubt our own security, expediency might recommend a more cautious proceeding, but now that we are supreme my opinion is decidedly in favour of an open and general prohibition.\nWilliam Bentinck, Govenor-General of India, \"On the Suppression of Sati,\" 1829\nI have made it my study to examine the nature and character of the Indians [who trade with us], and however repugnant it may be to our feelings, I am convinced they must be ruled with a rod of iron, to bring and keep them in a proper state of subordination, and the most certain way to effect this is by letting them feel their dependence on [the foodstuffs and manufactured goods we sell them].\nGeorge Simpson, Head of Northern Department, Hudson's Bay Company, 1826\nThe authors of both passages served institutions associated with which of the following colonial techniques commonly used by Western imperial powers?\n\nA. Direct rule by the crown\nB. Complete privatization of colonial authority\nC. Martial law enforced by sizable armies\nD. The chartering of companies to assume costs and share profits\n"

                    "text": "To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the context and content of each passage:\n\n1. **William Bentinck** was the Governor-General of India, representing British colonial rule in India. His passage discusses the suppression of the practice of sati, indicating direct involvement in governance and policy-making.\n\n2. **George Simpson** was the head of the Northern Department of the Hudson's Bay Company, which was a chartered company involved in fur trading and colonization in North America. His passage suggests a focus on controlling indigenous peoples through economic means and maintaining subordination.\n\nGiven these details, let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. **Direct rule by the crown**: This would imply direct governance by the British monarchy, which is partially true for William Bentinck's role but not applicable to George Simpson's position within a chartered company.\n\nB. **Complete privatization of colonial authority**: This implies that private entities fully control colonial territories, which does not fit either author's situation as there was significant government oversight.\n\nC. **Martial law enforced by sizable armies**: This suggests military enforcement, which is not the primary focus of either passage. While military presence was part of colonial rule, it is not the main technique discussed here.\n\nD. **The chartering of companies to assume costs and share profits**: This fits well with George Simpson's role in the Hudson's Bay Company, which was a chartered company. It also aligns with the broader historical context where such companies were often used by Western imperial powers to manage colonies.\n\nConsidering the analysis, the best answer is:\n\n**D. The chartering of companies to assume costs and share profits**"
