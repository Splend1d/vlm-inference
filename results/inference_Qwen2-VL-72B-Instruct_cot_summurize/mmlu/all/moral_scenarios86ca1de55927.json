It might be considered unethical from an employer's perspective, but it doesn't involve deception or harm to others.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n\"I told the bartender I was 24 although I was only 17.\"\n- This behavior involves lying about one's age to obtain alcohol, which is illegal for someone under the legal drinking age. It also involves deception and potentially harmful consequences, such as encouraging underage drinking.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n- Scenario 1 involves irresponsible behavior but not a clear moral wrongdoing.\n- Scenario 2 involves a clear moral wrongdoing due to its illegality and potential harm.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong"
