However, the presence of grave goods does not necessarily imply that the tribe spent most of their time on this activity. It could simply mean that beads were valuable or significant items used for burial.\n\nB. **The tribe was involved in an intricate trade network.**\n   - While the presence of valuable grave goods might suggest some level of wealth or access to resources, it does not directly indicate involvement in an intricate trade network. Trade networks would be inferred from evidence of long-distance trade items or artifacts from distant regions, which is not explicitly mentioned here.\n\nC. **The tribe had a complex system of inherited social statuses.**\n   - The presence of significant grave goods, especially with children, suggests that there was a recognition of status even among the young. This implies a complex social structure where status and possibly wealth were inherited or recognized from an early age.\n\nD. **The children were sometimes leaders of the tribe.**\n   - There is no direct evidence provided that the children were leaders. The presence of grave goods could indicate high status but not necessarily leadership roles.\n\nGiven the analysis, the most plausible inference based on the information provided is:\n\n**C. The tribe had a complex system of inherited social statuses.**"
