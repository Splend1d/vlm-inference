                    "text": "To determine which statement about the calcium atom is correct, let's analyze each option step by step:\n\n1. **Atomic Number and Protons**:\n   - The atomic number of calcium (Ca) is 20. This means every calcium atom has 20 protons.\n\n2. **Electrons**:\n   - In a neutral atom, the number of electrons equals the number of protons. Therefore, a neutral calcium atom will have 20 electrons.\n\n3. **Neutrons**:\n   - The number of neutrons in an atom can vary due to isotopes. However, the most common isotope of calcium is Ca-40, which has 20 neutrons (since the atomic mass is approximately equal to the sum of protons and neutrons).\n\n4. **Atomic Mass**:\n   - The atomic mass of calcium is approximately 40.078 u (unified atomic mass units). This value represents the average mass of all naturally occurring isotopes of calcium, weighted by their natural abundance.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. \"It contains 20 protons and neutrons\"\n   - This is partially correct but incomplete because it doesn't mention electrons.\n\nB. \"It contains 20 protons and 20 electrons\"\n   - This is correct for a neutral calcium atom.\n\nC. \"It contains 20 protons, neutrons, and electrons\"\n   - This is incorrect because while it has 20 protons and 20 electrons, the number of neutrons can vary depending on the isotope.\n\nD. \"All atoms of calcium have a mass of 40.078 u\"\n   - This is incorrect because the atomic mass given is the average mass of all isotopes, not the exact mass of each individual atom.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. It contains 20 protons and 20 electrons"
