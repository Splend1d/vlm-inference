Yes, because of the rule in Shelly's case.\nB. No, because when property is put in a trust through a donee's special power of appointment, creditors cannot reach the funds.\nC. Yes, because the will is invalidated by the rule of sequential appointments, and the grandchild does not take at all.\nD. No, because the will as written violates the rule against perpetuities, and reconstructed, the funds revert to the original owner or her heirs.v\n"

                    "text": "To determine whether the creditors can attach the house upon the grandchild's death, we need to analyze the legal principles involved.\n\n1. **Fee Simple Absolute**: The lady owns the house outright with no restrictions on its transfer or use.\n\n2. **Devise to Trust**: She devises the house to her cousin in trust for her grandchild during the grandchild's lifetime.\n\n3. **Special Power of Appointment**: Upon the grandchild's death, the property is to be distributed according to the grandchild's will if she appoints children in her will. If no such appointment is made, it goes to any surviving children of the grandchild in equal shares.\n\n4. **Creditors' Rights**: We need to consider whether the creditors can attach the house after the grandchild's death.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **Rule in Shelley's Case**: This rule applies when a grantor gives a life estate to one person and a remainder interest to another person who is also capable of inheriting the life estate. It does not seem directly applicable here since the devise is to a trust and not directly to the grandchild.\n\n- **Special Power of Appointment**: The grandchild has a special power of appointment, meaning she can direct the distribution of the trust property to certain beneficiaries (her children) but does not have an absolute ownership interest. Creditors generally cannot reach assets held in trust under a special power of appointment unless the grantor has retained control over the trust assets.\n\n- **Rule Against Perpetuities**: This rule limits the time within which future interests must vest. However, it does not invalidate the entire will; it only affects the specific provision that fails to vest within the permissible period. In this case, the rule against perpetuities might affect the contingent remainder to the grandchild\u2019s children if they do not vest within the perpetuity period, but it would not necessarily invalidate the entire will.\n\nGiven these points, the most accurate answer is:\n\n**B. No, because when property is put in a trust through a donee's special power of appointment, creditors cannot reach the funds.**\n\nThis conclusion is based on the principle that assets held in trust under a special power of appointment are generally protected from the creditors of the donee (the grandchild in this case)."
