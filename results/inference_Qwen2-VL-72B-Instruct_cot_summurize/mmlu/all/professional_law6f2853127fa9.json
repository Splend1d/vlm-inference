He contacted the stadium's ticket sales office, which advised him that all tickets were to be placed on sale at the stadium at 9:00 a. m. the following day. The fan, who was employed as a bricklayer, realized that he could not leave work to purchase the tickets. Consequently, the fan telephoned his next-door neighbor and asked him if he would be interested in going to the stadium to purchase the baseball tickets. The neighbor told the fan that he would be happy to purchase the tickets for him and that he (the neighbor) also wanted to buy tickets for himself. However, the neighbor said that his car had broken down and that he did not have available transportation to get to the stadium. The fan suggested that he could lend his car to the neighbor. The neighbor agreed, and the following morning the two men met in front of the fan's home. The fan gave the neighbor the keys to his car and also money with which to buy his baseball tickets. Thereafter, the neighbor drove the fan's car to the stadium where he purchased the tickets for the fan and (using his own money) also bought a set of tickets for himself. The fan had instructed the neighbor to return the car to the fan's home after his trip to the stadium. After the neighbor left the stadium, however, he decided to visit a friend in a town located 120 miles from his home. As the neighbor was driving toward the town, an automobile crashed into him, causing significant damage to the fan's car. The cost of repairing the fan's car was determined to be more than the retail value of the auto. In an action by the fan against the neighbor to recover damages resulting from the accident, the fan will most likely\n\nA. recover nothing, because the neighbor was on a joint venture when the accident occurred.\nB. recover the cost of repairing the car.\nC. recover the retail value of the car.\nD. recover, because the neighbor was negligently operating the auto at the time of the accident.\n"

                    "text": "The scenario described involves a situation where one individual (the fan) lent their car to another individual (the neighbor) for a specific purpose (purchasing baseball tickets). The neighbor then used the car beyond the intended purpose, leading to an accident that caused significant damage to the car.\n\nIn such a case, the legal principle of bailment is relevant. A bailment occurs when one person (the bailor) entrusts property to another person (the bailee) for a specific purpose. The bailee has a duty to use the property only for the agreed-upon purpose and to return it in good condition.\n\nGiven this context, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Recover nothing, because the neighbor was on a joint venture when the accident occurred.**\n   - This option suggests that the neighbor and the fan were engaged in a joint venture. However, there is no indication in the scenario that they were involved in a joint venture. The neighbor was simply acting as a bailee, not a partner in a business or enterprise.\n\nB. **Recover the cost of repairing the car.**\n   - Since the cost of repairing the car exceeds its retail value, recovering the repair costs would not be appropriate. The fan should seek compensation based on the car's value rather than the repair costs.\n\nC. **Recover the retail value of the car.**\n   - This option seems reasonable. When the neighbor exceeded the scope of the bailment by using the car for personal purposes beyond purchasing tickets, he breached his duty as a bailee. The fan is entitled to compensation for the loss of the car, which would typically be measured by its retail value.\n\nD. **Recover, because the neighbor was negligently operating the auto at the time of the accident.**\n   - While negligence might be a factor in determining liability, the primary issue here is the breach of the bailment agreement. The neighbor\u2019s unauthorized use of the car is the key issue, not necessarily whether the neighbor was negligent in operating the vehicle.\n\nConsidering these points, the most appropriate answer is:\n\n**C. Recover the retail value of the car.**\n\nThis option aligns with the principles of bailment law, where the bailee is responsible for returning the property in the same condition as received or compensating the bailor for any loss or damage incurred while the property was in the bailee's possession."
