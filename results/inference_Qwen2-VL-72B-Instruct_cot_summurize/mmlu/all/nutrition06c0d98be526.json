While high-protein diets can increase calcium excretion, this does not necessarily translate into an increased risk of hip fractures if overall calcium intake is adequate.\n\nB. **Decrease calcium excretion in the urine**: This is incorrect. Additional dietary protein typically increases calcium excretion in the urine due to the metabolic processes involved in protein breakdown.\n\nC. **Stimulate production of insulin-like growth hormone (IGF-1)**: This is correct. Dietary protein, particularly from animal sources, has been shown to stimulate the production of IGF-1, which plays a role in muscle growth and repair.\n\nD. **Reduce muscle mass and strength**: This is incorrect. Additional dietary protein actually supports muscle mass and strength, especially when combined with resistance training.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Stimulate production of insulin-like growth hormone"
