Nations may be made up of different ethnic-identity groups.\n- This is true because nations often consist of diverse ethnic groups.\n\nB. Nations may be difficult to distinguish from societies.\n- This is also true because the terms 'nation' and 'society' can sometimes be used interchangeably, especially in contexts where they refer to a community of people living together under a common culture or governance.\n\nC. Nations are defined by the boundaries and borders of the state.\n- This statement is incorrect. Nations are primarily defined by shared cultural, historical, and social characteristics among their members, rather than by political boundaries. States, on the other hand, are defined by their territorial boundaries and sovereignty.\n\nD. Nations may contain multiple religious identity groups.\n- This is true because nations typically encompass various religious groups within their populations.\n\nTherefore, the statement that does not describe 'nations' is:\n\nC. Nations are defined by the boundaries and borders of the state."
