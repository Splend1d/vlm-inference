His will devised his estate in a Midwestern state to his son and daughter \"to share and share alike as tenants in common. \"At the time of their father's death, the daughter lived in a different part of the Midwestern state (in which the estate was located) while the son resided in a state in the Southwest. After the funeral, the daughter returned to her own residence, but the son decided to occupy the estate. He put his name on the mailbox and has paid the taxes and maintenance expenses. The daughter has been generally aware of this, but because she cared little about the estate, the daughter has never pressed her brother about the property. Since 1985, the daughter has not paid any rent or other compensation to her brother, nor has he requested such payment. In January 2010, a series of disputes arose between the son and daughter for the first time concerning their respective rights to the estate. The state in which the property is located recognizes the usual common law types of cotenancies and there is no applicable legislation on the subject. Now, the son claims the entire fee simple absolute title to the estate and brings an action against his sister to quiet title in himself. If the Midwestern states in which the property is located has an ordinary 20-year adverse possession statute, judgment should be for whom?\n\nA. The daughter, because one cotenant cannot acquire title by adverse possession against another.\nB. The daughter, because there is no evidence that her brother has performed sufficient acts to constitute an ouster.\nC. The son, because the acts of the parties indicate the sister's intention to renounce her ownership rights to the estate.\nD. The son, because during the past 25 years, the son has exercised the type of occupancy ordinarily considered sufficient to satisfy adverse possession requirements.\n"

                    "text": "To determine who should prevail in this case, we need to analyze the principles of adverse possession and the specific circumstances surrounding the actions of both the son and the daughter.\n\n### Key Points to Consider:\n\n1. **Adverse Possession Statute**: The Midwestern state has a 20-year adverse possession statute. This means that if someone occupies land continuously, openly, and adversely for 20 years, they can claim full ownership through adverse possession.\n\n2. **Cotenancy**: The property was devised to the son and daughter as tenants in common. In a tenancy in common, each tenant owns a distinct share of the property, and one tenant cannot adversely possess against another.\n\n3. **Ouster Requirement**: For one cotenant to claim adverse possession against another, there must be an actual ouster. An ouster involves clear and unequivocal acts demonstrating the intent to exclude the other cotenant from possession.\n\n4. **Actions of the Son**:\n   - Occupied the estate since 1985.\n   - Paid taxes and maintenance expenses.\n   - Put his name on the mailbox.\n   - Did not request rent or compensation from the daughter.\n\n5. **Actions of the Daughter**:\n   - Lived elsewhere and did not care much about the estate.\n   - Was generally aware of her brother\u2019s occupation but did not press him about it.\n   - Did not pay any rent or compensation to her brother.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **Option A: The daughter, because one cotenant cannot acquire title by adverse possession against another.**\n  - This statement is generally true under common law principles. However, it does not consider the specific actions and circumstances of the case.\n\n- **Option B: The daughter, because there is no evidence that her brother has performed sufficient acts to constitute an ouster.**\n  - This option focuses on the requirement of ouster. While the son has occupied the property and paid expenses, there is no explicit evidence of acts intended to exclude the daughter. The daughter's lack of interest and non-action might not necessarily amount to an ouster.\n\n- **Option C: The son, because the acts of the parties indicate the sister's intention to renounce her ownership rights to the estate.**\n  - This option suggests that the daughter's inaction and lack of interest could be interpreted as renouncing her rights. However, mere inaction without explicit renunciation or ouster is typically insufficient to establish adverse possession.\n\n- **Option D: The son, because during the past 25 years, the son has exercised the type of occupancy ordinarily considered sufficient to satisfy adverse possession requirements.**\n  - This option considers the son's continuous and exclusive possession over the 25-year period. However, it overlooks the fact that adverse possession among cotenants requires more than just possession; it requires an ouster.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nGiven the principles of adverse possession and the specific circumstances, the most accurate answer is:\n\n**B. The daughter, because there is no evidence that her brother has performed sufficient acts to constitute an ouster.**\n\nThe son's occupation and payment of expenses do not necessarily amount to an ouster, which is required for one cotenant to claim adverse possession against another. Therefore, the daughter retains her share of the estate."
