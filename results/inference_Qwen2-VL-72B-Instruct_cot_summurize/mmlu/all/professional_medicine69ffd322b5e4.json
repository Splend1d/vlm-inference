Her brother and maternal uncle had Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and died at the ages of 28 and 17 years, respectively. Genetic analysis was not performed on either relative prior to death. Serum studies show a muscle creatine kinase concentration of 120 U/L (N=22\u2013 198). The patient's 50-year-old mother has a serum muscle creatine kinase concentration of 300 U/L. Which of the following is the most appropriate assessment of this patient's carrier status for this disease?\n\nA. The patient has a 50% risk of having a child with DMD\nB. The patient is a carrier of the disease based on her family history of DMD\nC. The patient is not a carrier of the DMD based on her normal creatine kinase concentration\nD. The patient's DMD carrier status is uncertain because of random X inactivation\n"

The patient's DMD carrier status is uncertain because of random X inactivation.\n\nDuchenne muscular dystrophy is an X-linked recessive disorder. Females have two X chromosomes, while males have one X and one Y chromosome. A female can be a carrier if she inherits one affected X chromosome from her mother or father. Carriers typically do not show symptoms of the disease but can pass the mutation to their offspring.\n\nIn this case, the patient's family history indicates that her brother and maternal uncle had DMD, which suggests that her mother is likely a carrier. The patient's normal creatine kinase concentration does not rule out her being a carrier since carriers may have normal or slightly elevated levels. Additionally, random X inactivation (also known as Lyonization) means that in females, one of the two X chromosomes is randomly inactivated in each cell, leading to a mosaic pattern of expression. This can make it difficult to predict whether a female will show signs of being a carrier or not.\n\nTherefore, while the patient's family history increases the likelihood that she could be a carrier, definitive testing would be required to confirm her carrier status. Genetic testing, such as DNA analysis for the DMD gene mutation, would provide more accurate information about her carrier status."
