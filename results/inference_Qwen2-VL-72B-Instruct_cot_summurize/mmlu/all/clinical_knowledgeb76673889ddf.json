Bleeding haemorrhoids lead to melaena per rectum (PR): Melaena refers to black, tarry stools typically caused by bleeding higher up in the gastrointestinal tract. Haemorrhoidal bleeding usually results in bright red blood on the stool or toilet paper, not melaena.\n\nB. Pregnancy is a predisposing factor in causing haemorrhoids: This statement is true. Pregnancy can cause increased pressure in the pelvic region and veins around the anus, leading to the development of haemorrhoids.\n\nC. Bleeding from first-degree haemorrhoids is associated with pain: First-degree haemorrhoids are internal haemorrhoids that do not prolapse outside the anus. They may bleed but are generally not painful.\n\nD. Second-degree haemorrhoids cannot be returned to the anal canal: Second-degree haemorrhoids do prolapse outside the anus during bowel movements but can be manually reduced back into the anal canal.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Pregnancy is a predisposing factor in causing haemorrhoids"
