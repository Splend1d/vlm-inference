Stacy Adams, suggests that individuals compare their inputs (efforts, contributions) and outcomes (rewards, benefits) in a relationship with those of their partners. Satisfaction in a relationship is influenced by whether they perceive the relationship as fair or equitable. If an individual feels that the balance of contributions and rewards is equal, they are more likely to be satisfied with the relationship."
