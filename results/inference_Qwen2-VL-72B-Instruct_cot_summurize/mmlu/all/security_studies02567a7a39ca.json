Post-structuralism provides no basis for political action, being a dangerous mix of faux radicalism, relativism and obscurantism, whilst constructivism is an orientation to world politics rather than a specific political theory.\nB. Constructivism offers a number of specific political theories applicable to Critical Security Studies but all of these lack the tenability required in security studies. Post-structuralist theories similarly lack the durability desired by CSS scholars.\nC. Post-structuralism and constructivism are ill-defined theories that are better described as political orientations, applicable in vague terms but lacking the substance required by scholars in contemporary security studies.\nD. Constructivism is too dangerous a mix of political ideologies, combining elements of radicalism and relativism. Post-structuralism is more of an orientation to world politics rather than a specific and applicable political theory.\n"

Post-structuralism provides no basis for political action, being a dangerous mix of faux radicalism, relativism and obscurantism, whilst constructivism is an orientation to world politics rather than a specific political theory.\n\nThis option best captures Booth's critical stance on both constructivism and post-structuralism within Critical Security Studies (CSS). He views post-structuralism as lacking a solid foundation for practical political action and criticizes it for its perceived relativism and obscurity. Meanwhile, he sees constructivism more as a general approach to understanding world politics rather than a concrete political theory that can be directly applied to security studies."
