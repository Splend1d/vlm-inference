                    "text": "Let's analyze each statement to determine which one is incorrect:\n\nA. About 2% of the energy content of food is expended during the action of chewing and swallowing it.\n- This statement is generally correct. The process of chewing and swallowing does require some energy, but it is a relatively small amount compared to the total energy content of the food.\n\nB. Swallowing involves contraction and relaxation of at least 14 groups of muscles in about 10 seconds in healthy subjects.\n- This statement is also correct. Swallowing is a complex process that involves the coordination of multiple muscle groups, typically taking around 10 seconds to complete in a healthy individual.\n\nC. The biofilm covering tooth enamel contains several salivary and bacterial enzymes.\n- This statement is correct. Biofilms on teeth contain various components including enzymes from saliva and bacteria, which can contribute to dental health or disease.\n\nD. Salivary amylase digests the dextran film on tooth enamel formed from dietary sucrose.\n- This statement is incorrect. Salivary amylase primarily functions to break down starches into simpler sugars (such as maltose) in the mouth. It does not directly digest the dextran film on tooth enamel. Dextran is a polysaccharide produced by certain bacteria in the mouth when they metabolize sucrose, and it contributes to plaque formation rather than being broken down by amylase.\n\nTherefore, the incorrect statement is:\n\nD. Salivary amylase digests the dextran film on tooth enamel formed from dietary sucrose."
