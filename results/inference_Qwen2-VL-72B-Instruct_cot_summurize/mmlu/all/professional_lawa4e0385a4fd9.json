Hearsay is generally inadmissible unless it falls under a recognized exception. One such exception is the excited utterance exception, which allows for the admission of statements made under the stress of excitement caused by a startling event or condition.\n\nIn this case, the statement made by the plaintiff's son appears to have been made immediately after the explosion, which could be considered a startling event. Therefore, the statement might qualify as an excited utterance and be admissible under that exception.\n\nGiven these considerations, the correct answer would be:\n\nB. admissible, whether or not the son is available as a witness."
