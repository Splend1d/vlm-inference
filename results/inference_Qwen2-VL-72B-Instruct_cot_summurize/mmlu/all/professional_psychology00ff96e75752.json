This method presents raters with pairs or sets of statements about job performance and requires them to choose which statement best describes the employee's behavior. By forcing raters to make comparative judgments, it minimizes common rating errors such as leniency, severity, and halo effects, thereby improving the consistency and accuracy of performance evaluations.\n\nWhile options A, C, and D may have some validity in certain contexts, they do not accurately capture the primary advantage of the forced-choice distribution method in performance appraisal. Option A is incorrect because forced-choice does not eliminate all statistical concerns about ipsative measurement; option C is incorrect because forced-choice still involves evaluating an employee's strengths and weaknesses indirectly through comparative judgments; and option D is incorrect because while forced-choice can be faster to use, this is not its primary advantage."
