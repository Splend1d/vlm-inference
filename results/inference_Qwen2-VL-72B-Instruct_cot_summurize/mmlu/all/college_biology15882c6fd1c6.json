The number of action potentials per second\n\nThe ability of the brain to detect differences in stimulus intensity is primarily due to the frequency of action potentials, or the number of action potentials per second. This is known as the rate coding mechanism. As the intensity of a stimulus increases, the frequency of action potentials generated by sensory neurons also increases, allowing the brain to interpret the strength of the stimulus based on the rate of incoming signals."
