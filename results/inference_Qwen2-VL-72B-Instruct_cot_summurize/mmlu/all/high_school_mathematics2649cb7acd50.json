                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to understand how the degrees of polynomials interact when they are composed or added together.\n\nGiven:\n- $f(x)$ is a polynomial of degree $6$.\n- $g(x)$ is a polynomial of degree $3$.\n- $h(x)$ is a polynomial of unknown degree.\n- The expression $f(g(x)) + g(h(x)) + h(f(x))$ results in a polynomial of degree $36$.\n\nLet's analyze each term separately:\n\n1. **$f(g(x))$:** When you substitute $g(x)$ into $f(x)$, the degree of the resulting polynomial is determined by multiplying the degrees of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$. Since $f(x)$ has degree $6$ and $g(x)$ has degree $3$, the degree of $f(g(x))$ is $6 \\times 3 = 18$.\n\n2. **$g(h(x))$:** Similarly, substituting $h(x)$ into $g(x)$ means we multiply the degrees of $g(x)$ and $h(x)$. Let's denote the degree of $h(x)$ as $d_h$. Therefore, the degree of $g(h(x))$ is $3 \\times d_h$.\n\n3. **$h(f(x))$:** Substituting $f(x)$ into $h(x)$ means we multiply the degrees of $h(x)$ and $f(x)$. Thus, the degree of $h(f(x))$ is $d_h \\times 6$.\n\nThe sum of these three terms results in a polynomial of degree $36$. The highest degree term will determine the overall degree of the sum. Since $f(g(x))$ already gives us a degree of $18$, which is less than $36$, the degree of the entire expression must be influenced by either $g(h(x))$ or $h(f(x))$.\n\nGiven that $f(g(x))$ contributes a degree of $18$, for the overall expression to have a degree of $36$, one of the other two terms must contribute at least a degree of $18$ (since adding terms of lower degree does not increase the overall degree). \n\nSince $g(h(x))$ has a degree of $3 \\times d_h$ and $h(f(x))$ has a degree of $6 \\times d_h$, both expressions depend on the degree of $h(x)$, denoted as $d_h$. For the overall expression to have a degree of $36$, it must be that $6 \\times d_h = 36$ or $3 \\times d_h = 36$, because these are the only ways for the degree to reach $36$ given the constraints.\n\nSolving $6 \\times d_h = 36$ gives $d_h = 6$, and solving $3 \\times d_h = 36$ gives $d_h = 12$. However, since $f(g(x))$ already contributes a degree of $18$, the degree of $h(x)$ must be such that when combined with $f(x)$ or $g(x)$, it doesn't exceed $36$ but still allows for the overall degree to be $36$. \n\nGiven the options, the correct answer is:\n\nD. 12\n\nThis is because if $d_h = 12$, then $h(f(x))$ would contribute a degree of $6 \\times 12 = 72$, which is too high, but $g(h(x))$ would contribute a degree of $3 \\times 12 = 36$, which aligns with the requirement for the overall degree of the expression."
