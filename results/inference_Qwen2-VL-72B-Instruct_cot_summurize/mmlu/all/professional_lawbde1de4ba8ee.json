The woman explained that her car was being serviced and would not be ready for a couple of days. The woman told her neighbor that she had a doctor's appointment that afternoon and would return the car immediately afterwards. The neighbor agreed and gave the woman permission to use her car. As the woman was driving to her doctor's office, she collided with another car. As a result of the accident, the other driver brought suit against the woman and the neighbor to recover for her personal injuries. The other driver asserted a claim against the neighbor for negligent entrustment of an automobile and charged the woman with negligent operation of a motor vehicle. In her case-in-chief, the other driver called a witness to testify to three incidents of careless driving on the woman's part during the past six months. The trial judge should rule the testimony\n\nA. admissible as circumstantial evidence that the woman was negligent on this occasion.\nB. admissible, because the witness had personal knowledge of the woman's poor driving record.\nC. admissible against the neighbor as evidence of the woman's lack of fitness.\nD. inadmissible, because specific acts are not admissible except to rebut evidence of good character.\n"

This rule is based on the principle that individuals should not be judged solely by their past actions but rather by the circumstances surrounding the specific incident in question. However, such evidence may be admissible under certain exceptions, such as when it is used to rebut evidence of good character or when it is relevant to proving a pattern of behavior that directly relates to the issue at hand (e.g., in cases involving habitual offenders).\n\nIn this scenario, the witness's testimony about the woman's past incidents of careless driving is not admissible to prove that she was negligent on the day of the accident. The purpose of the rule is to prevent unfair prejudice and ensure that the jury focuses on the facts of the case rather than on potentially irrelevant or prejudicial information about the defendant's past behavior."
