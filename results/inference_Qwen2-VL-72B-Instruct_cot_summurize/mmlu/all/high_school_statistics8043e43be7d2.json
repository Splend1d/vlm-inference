Therefore, the variance of the total weight is the sum of the variances of these components, assuming they are independent (which is a reasonable assumption in this context).\n\nLet's denote:\n- \\( \\sigma_{books}^2 \\) as the variance of the weight of the books,\n- \\( \\sigma_{boxes}^2 \\) as the variance of the weight of the boxes,\n- \\( \\sigma_{material}^2 \\) as the variance of the weight of the packing material.\n\nGiven:\n- \\( \\sigma_{books} = 2 \\) pounds,\n- \\( \\sigma_{boxes} = 0.15 \\) pounds,\n- \\( \\sigma_{material} = 0.25 \\) pounds.\n\nWe calculate the variances:\n\\[ \\sigma_{books}^2 = (2)^2 = 4 \\]\n\\[ \\sigma_{boxes}^2 = (0.15)^2 = 0.0225 \\]\n\\[ \\sigma_{material}^2 = (0.25)^2 = 0.0625 \\]\n\nThe total variance of the packed box weight is:\n\\[ \\sigma_{total}^2 = \\sigma_{books}^2 + \\sigma_{boxes}^2 + \\sigma_{material}^2 \\]\n\\[ \\sigma_{total}^2 = 4 + 0.0225 + 0.0625 \\]\n\\[ \\sigma_{total}^2 = 4.085 \\]\n\nThe standard deviation of the total weight is the square root of the total variance:\n\\[ \\sigma_{total} = \\sqrt{4.085} \\approx 2.021 \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. 2.021 pounds"
