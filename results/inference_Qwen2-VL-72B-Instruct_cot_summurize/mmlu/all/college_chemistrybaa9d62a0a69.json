                    "text": "To determine the number of lines that will appear in the EPR spectrum of a solution of a rigid nitronyl nitroxide diradical, we need to consider the hyperfine splitting due to the interaction between the unpaired electron and the magnetic nuclei.\n\nIn this case, the unpaired electron is coupled to two equivalent nitrogen nuclei. Each nitrogen nucleus has a nuclear spin of \\( I = \\frac{1}{2} \\), leading to two possible orientations (spin up or down) for each nucleus.\n\nThe total number of lines in the EPR spectrum can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[ N = (2I + 1)^n \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( I \\) is the nuclear spin quantum number,\n- \\( n \\) is the number of equivalent nuclei.\n\nFor nitrogen (\\( I = \\frac{1}{2} \\)) and two equivalent nuclei (\\( n = 2 \\)):\n\n\\[ N = (2 \\times \\frac{1}{2} + 1)^2 \\]\n\\[ N = (1 + 1)^2 \\]\n\\[ N = 2^2 \\]\n\\[ N = 4 \\]\n\nHowever, since the question specifies that \\( J >> a \\), where \\( J \\) is the exchange coupling constant and \\( a \\) is the hyperfine coupling constant, it implies that the exchange coupling dominates over the hyperfine coupling. This means that the two unpaired electrons on the diradical will couple strongly, effectively reducing the system to a single electron interacting with the two equivalent nitrogen nuclei.\n\nThus, the number of lines in the EPR spectrum remains:\n\n\\[ N = 4 \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. 5 lines"
