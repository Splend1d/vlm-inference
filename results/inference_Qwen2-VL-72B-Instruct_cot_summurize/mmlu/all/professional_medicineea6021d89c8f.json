She has been treated with amoxicillin for the past 5 days for left otitis media. Her temperature is 38.5\u00b0C (101.3\u00b0F), pulse is 100/min, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 80/60 mm Hg. Examination shows the left ear displaced forward and laterally from the head. There is edema and tenderness behind the left ear. Otoscopic examination shows a red, dull, left tympanic membrane that does not move. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\n\nA. Acoustic neuroma\nB. Labyrinthitis\nC. Lateral sinus thrombosis\nD. Mastoiditis\n"

It often occurs as a complication of untreated or inadequately treated acute otitis media (middle ear infection). The symptoms described, such as fever, ear pain, displacement of the ear, edema, and tenderness behind the ear, along with a red, dull tympanic membrane that does not move, are consistent with mastoiditis. The patient's history of being treated with amoxicillin for otitis media also supports this diagnosis, as it suggests that the initial infection may have spread to the mastoid bone."
