Erectus possessed a larger brain.\n\nHomo erectus is known for having a larger brain compared to Homo habilis, which is one of the key differences between these two hominin species. Additionally, Homo erectus fossils have been found outside of Africa, indicating that they were more geographically widespread than Homo habilis. Homo erectus also had a longer duration as a species compared to Homo habilis."
