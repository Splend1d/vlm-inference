                    "text": "The assertion that would LEAST likely remove liability for felony murder is:\n\nA. The defendant did not intend to kill the victim.\n\nIn the context of felony murder, the defendant's intent to kill the victim is not a necessary element for establishing liability. Felony murder occurs when someone dies during the commission or attempted commission of a felony, regardless of whether the death was intended. Therefore, proving that the defendant did not intend to kill the victim would not absolve him of felony murder liability.\n\nLet's briefly analyze the other options:\n\nB. The defendant was insane when he set the fire.\n   - Insanity could potentially be a valid defense, depending on the jurisdiction and the specific legal standards for insanity.\n\nC. The defendant was coerced by another to set the fire.\n   - Coercion might also serve as a defense if it can be shown that the defendant acted under duress and had no reasonable alternative but to comply.\n\nD. The victim died of a heart attack before the fire spread to his bedroom.\n   - This assertion could potentially exonerate the defendant from felony murder if it can be proven that the victim died from natural causes (heart attack) before the fire reached him, thus removing the direct causal link between the felony (setting the fire) and the victim's death.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A."
