A high-energy diet and large appetite can support performance, but they are not the primary factors. High intelligence can be beneficial in strategic sports, but it is not as crucial as physical ability and training response. A good coach and motivation are important for guidance and drive, but they still rely on the athlete's inherent abilities and their ability to improve through training."
