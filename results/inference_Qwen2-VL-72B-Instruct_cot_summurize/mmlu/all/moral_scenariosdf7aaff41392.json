However, the reason provided is forgetfulness, which might be seen as an oversight rather than intentional harm. Nonetheless, failing to vaccinate due to forgetfulness could still be considered morally wrong because it puts the child at risk.\n\nGiven this analysis:\n- Scenario 1 involves breaking the law and disregarding property rights, which is morally wrong.\n- Scenario 2 involves neglecting the health of children, which is also morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, both scenarios involve actions that are clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nA. Wrong, Wrong"
