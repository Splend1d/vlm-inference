Then \\(\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} s_n t_n = st\\).\n\nThis statement is true based on the properties of limits in complex analysis. The product of two convergent sequences converges to the product of their limits. This can be formally stated as follows:\n\nIf \\(\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} s_n = s\\) and \\(\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} t_n = t\\), then\n\\[\n\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} (s_n t_n) = (\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} s_n)(\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} t_n) = st.\n\\]\n\n### Statement 2:\nThere exists a bounded sequence of real numbers with no convergent subsequence.\n\nThis statement is false. According to the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem, every bounded sequence of real numbers has at least one convergent subsequence. Therefore, it is not possible for a bounded sequence of real numbers to have no convergent subsequence.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- Statement 1 is true.\n- Statement 2 is false.\n\nThus, the correct answer is **B. True, False**."
