No, because the defendant failed to object after the judge gave the instructions to the jury.\n\nIn federal court proceedings, a party must timely object to jury instructions before the jury retires to deliberate in order to preserve an issue for appeal. The fact that the defendant submitted a proposed instruction is not sufficient; there must be a specific objection to the absence of the instruction after the judge has given the final instructions to the jury. Since neither party objected at the appropriate time, the issue was not preserved for appeal."
