Human migration will arise as a result of global inequalities in the distribution of power, wealth, and resources. Disempowerment of populations will lead to competition and violence, manifested in transnational movements; and environmental threats and resources scarcity will lead to conflict.\nB. Economic interdependency between states will strengthen global security and lead to a reduction in international conflict. Human migration will lead to overcrowding and resource scarcity but this will be addressed by the technological advancements of developing states to which most migration will take place.\nC. The primary cause of conflict, both at international and sub-national level will be based in ideological differences between populations as resources scarcity, population growth and human migration forces diverse identity groups into increasingly close contact.\nD. Environmental concerns will be overshadowed by immediate threats to international security, posed by global economic crisis and the subsequent rise of fundamentalist ideologies and violence. Human migration will be managed within the current global economic system as poverty restricts movement although there is a limited risk of transnational revolt as a result of disempowerment and resource scarcity.\n"

Disempowered populations may compete for resources, leading to violence and transnational movements. Environmental threats and resource scarcity could exacerbate these issues, potentially sparking conflicts over access to essential resources like water, food, and energy.\n\nB. **Economic Interdependency and Technological Advancements**: While economic interdependency might initially seem to strengthen global security and reduce conflict, it can also create vulnerabilities. Overcrowding and resource scarcity due to human migration might be mitigated by technological advancements in developing states, but this assumes that such advancements can keep pace with the challenges posed by migration and resource demands.\n\nC. **Ideological Differences and Identity Groups**: Ideological differences between populations could become a primary cause of conflict, especially as diverse identity groups come into closer contact due to factors like resource scarcity, population growth, and human migration. These ideological clashes could manifest at both international and sub-national levels, potentially leading to significant social and political unrest.\n\nD. **Environmental Concerns and Fundamentalist Ideologies**: While environmental concerns are critical, they might be overshadowed by more immediate threats such as global economic crises and the rise of fundamentalist ideologies. Economic instability could fuel violence and extremism, while poverty might limit large-scale human migration. However, there remains a risk of transnational revolts driven by disempowerment and resource scarcity.\n\nIn summary, the evolving global security landscape suggests that future conflicts will likely involve a complex interplay of factors including human migration, resource scarcity, ideological differences, and economic instability. Technological advancements and economic interdependencies might offer some solutions, but they also introduce new vulnerabilities and potential sources of conflict."
