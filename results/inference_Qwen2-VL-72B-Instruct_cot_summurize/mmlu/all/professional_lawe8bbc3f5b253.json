The businessman had slightly grazed against the drunk man's body. \"Man, are you trying to kill me or something?'' said the very drunk man. The businessman did not think anything of it, since he had barely grazed the drunkard. The drunk continued to bully the businessman, calling him made-up names, and saying things that were nonsensical to the businessman and to others at the bar who were listening to the drunk's boisterous and irrational rants. The drunk then took a gun out of his pocket and shot the businessman, killing him. At trial, the defense argued that the man could not form the specific intent to premeditate for first degree murder. Which of the following crimes is the defendant most likely guilty of under these facts?\n\nA. Voluntary Manslaughter\nB. First Degree Murder\nC. Second Degree Murder\nD. Involuntary Manslaughter\n"

                    "text": "The scenario described involves a situation where a very drunk man, after being slightly grazed by a businessman, reacts violently by shooting and killing the businessman. The defense argues that the man could not form the specific intent to premeditate for first-degree murder due to his intoxicated state.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Voluntary Manslaughter**: This typically involves a killing that occurs in the heat of passion or as a result of provocation. While the drunk man's actions were impulsive, the situation does not clearly fit the criteria for voluntary manslaughter because there was no significant provocation that would justify such a reaction.\n\nB. **First Degree Murder**: This crime requires premeditation and deliberation. Given that the defense argues the man was too intoxicated to form the specific intent to premeditate, this charge seems less likely to be sustained based on the facts provided.\n\nC. **Second Degree Murder**: This type of murder does not require premeditation but does involve malice aforethought. It can include situations where the killing is done impulsively with a depraved indifference to human life. Given the drunk man's irrational behavior and the fact that he used a gun to shoot the businessman, second-degree murder seems plausible.\n\nD. **Involuntary Manslaughter**: This typically involves a killing that occurs during the commission of an unlawful act without the intent to kill. While the drunk man's actions were unlawful, the use of a gun and the intentional act of shooting suggest a higher level of culpability than involuntary manslaughter.\n\nConsidering the facts and the analysis above, the defendant is most likely guilty of:\n\n**C. Second Degree Murder**\n\nThis conclusion is based on the defendant's impulsive action with a weapon, demonstrating a depraved indifference to human life, even if there was no premeditation."
