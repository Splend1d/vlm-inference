While this trend has been observed in some studies, it may not be as widespread as \"about a quarter\" suggests.\n\nB. **Most women believe that there is equal opportunity today between men and women in career choice, advancement, and income.**\n   - Current research indicates that many women still perceive barriers to equal opportunities in the workplace, including issues related to career advancement and pay equity. Therefore, this statement is likely inconsistent with current findings.\n\nC. **Most men believe that women should be homemakers because men earn more money.**\n   - Research shows that attitudes toward traditional gender roles have evolved over time, and while some men might hold such views, it is unlikely that most men believe this way. This statement seems inconsistent with current trends.\n\nD. **Most men married to working women do not share housework and childcare obligations equally with their working wives.**\n   - Numerous studies have shown that despite increases in women\u2019s participation in the workforce, men often do less housework and childcare compared to their working wives. This statement aligns well with current research findings.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statement that is consistent with current research conducted in the area of gender roles and the workplace is:\n\n**D. Most men married to working women do not share housework and childcare obligations equally with their working wives.**"
