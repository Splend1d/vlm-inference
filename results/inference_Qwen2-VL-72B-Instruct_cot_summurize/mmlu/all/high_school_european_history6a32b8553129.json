One would find it hard to imagine how the laws of movement cause such frightful disasters in the best of possible worlds. A hundred thousand ants, our fellows, crushed all at once in our ant-hill, and half of them perishing, no doubt in unspeakable agony, beneath the wreckage from which they cannot be drawn. Families ruined all over Europe, the fortune of a hundred businessmen, your compatriots, swallowed up in the ruins of Lisbon. What a wretched gamble is the game of human life! What will the preachers say, especially if the palace of the Inquisition is still standing? I flatter myself that at least the reverend father inquisitors have been crushed like others. That ought to teach men not to persecute each other, for while a few holy scoundrels burn a few fanatics, the earth swallows up one and all.\n\u2014Voltaire, in a letter, 1755\nWhich of the following Enlightenment philosophes questioned reliance on reason and began the Romantic Movement for the rationale given?\n\nA. Jean-Jacques Rousseau because he thought society corrupted noble souls.\nB. Baron Montesquieu because he thought that governments were not capable of being fair.\nC. Mary Wollstonecraft because she railed against the subjugation of women emotionally.\nD. Adam Smith because he stated that reason could not be used to understand how another feels.\n"

                    "text": "To determine which Enlightenment philosopher questioned reliance on reason and began the Romantic Movement based on the rationale provided by Voltaire's quote, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Jean-Jacques Rousseau** - He believed that society corrupted noble souls. This aligns with the Romantic Movement's emphasis on emotion and individualism, as well as a critique of societal structures.\n\nB. **Baron Montesquieu** - He thought that governments were not capable of being fair. While this is an important Enlightenment idea, it does not directly relate to questioning reason or the beginning of the Romantic Movement.\n\nC. **Mary Wollstonecraft** - She railed against the subjugation of women emotionally. Although her work was influential in advocating for women's rights, it does not specifically address the broader critique of reason or the start of the Romantic Movement.\n\nD. **Adam Smith** - He stated that reason could not be used to understand how another feels. This idea touches on the limitations of reason but is more closely associated with economics and moral philosophy rather than the Romantic Movement.\n\nGiven the context of Voltaire's quote, which critiques the harsh realities of life and suggests that reason alone may not fully explain or justify these experiences, the most fitting answer is:\n\n**A. Jean-Jacques Rousseau because he thought society corrupted noble souls.**\n\nRousseau's ideas about the corruption of society and the importance of individual emotions and nature align well with the themes of the Romantic Movement."
