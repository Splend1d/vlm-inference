The First Great Awakening\n\nPhillis Wheatley's poem \"On Being Brought from Africa to America\" reflects themes of religious conversion and spiritual enlightenment, which were central to the First Great Awakening. This religious revival movement emphasized personal salvation and the potential for moral transformation, aligning with Wheatley's message that even those viewed negatively due to their skin color could achieve spiritual refinement and join the \"angelic train.\" The poem challenges racial prejudice by asserting the capacity for spiritual growth and redemption among all individuals, regardless of race."
