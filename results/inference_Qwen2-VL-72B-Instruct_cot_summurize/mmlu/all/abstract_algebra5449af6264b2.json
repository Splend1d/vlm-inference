For \\(x = 0\\):\n\\[ (0)^2 + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1 \\]\nSince 1 is not equal to 0 in \\(\\mathbb{Z}_2\\), 0 is not a zero of the polynomial.\n\n2. For \\(x = 1\\):\n\\[ (1)^2 + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2 \\]\nIn \\(\\mathbb{Z}_2\\), 2 is equivalent to 0 because \\(2 \\mod 2 = 0\\). So, 1 is a zero of the polynomial.\n\nTherefore, the only zero of the polynomial \\(x^2 + 1\\) in \\(\\mathbb{Z}_2\\) is 1.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nB. 1"
