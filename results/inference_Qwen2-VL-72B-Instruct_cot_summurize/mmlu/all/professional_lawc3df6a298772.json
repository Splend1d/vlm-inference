                    "text": "The scenario described involves a situation where the owner of the liquor store is being asked to testify about a previous identification he made from a photograph. Let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Admissible as a prior identification by the witness.**\n   - This option suggests that the testimony can be admitted as evidence because it pertains to a prior identification made by the witness. In legal terms, this would mean that the witness had previously identified the defendant from a photograph, which could be relevant to establishing the identity of the robber.\n\nB. **Admissible as past recollection recorded.**\n   - This option implies that the testimony can be admitted because it records the witness\u2019s past memory. However, for this to apply, the witness must have been unable to recall the information at the time of testifying but had previously recorded it accurately. Since the witness admits he cannot identify the man now, this might fit if the witness had previously recorded the identification accurately.\n\nC. **Inadmissible, because it is hearsay not within any recognized exception.**\n   - Hearsay refers to out-of-court statements offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. If the witness is merely repeating what he said earlier without providing direct evidence or personal observation, it could be considered hearsay. However, there are exceptions to the hearsay rule, such as prior consistent statements or prior identification.\n\nD. **Inadmissible, because it is a violation of the man's right of confrontation.**\n   - The right of confrontation ensures that the accused has the opportunity to cross-examine witnesses against them. This option suggests that allowing the witness to testify about a previous identification violates this right. However, the witness is still present and available for cross-examination regarding the previous identification.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most appropriate answer is:\n\n**A. Admissible as a prior identification by the witness.**\n\nThis is because the witness had previously identified the defendant from a photograph, and this prior identification can be used as evidence to support the prosecution's case."
