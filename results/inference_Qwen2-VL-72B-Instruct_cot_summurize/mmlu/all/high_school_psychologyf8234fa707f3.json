Over 75% of respondents said that if they had it to do over again, they would not have children. The columnist concludes that most parents are sorry that they had children. For which of the following reasons is her conclusion not valid?\n\nA. Her participants were not randomly assigned in her study.\nB. The number of respondents from across the country was too small.\nC. The study was not replicated.\nD. Her sample may not have been representative of the population.\n"

Her sample may not have been representative of the population.\n\nThis option highlights a critical flaw in the columnist's reasoning: the sample of respondents may not accurately reflect the broader population of parents. The responses came from people who chose to respond to the column, which introduces a selection bias. Those who feel strongly about their regrets might be more likely to respond, leading to an overrepresentation of negative sentiments. Therefore, the sample may not be representative of all parents' feelings and experiences."
