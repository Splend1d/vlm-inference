The newborn calves need constant attention and care. One day one of the employees inadvertently leaves the fence door open and a newly-born calf breaks free and goes to his neighbor's land. The breeder went to the neighbor's land to retrieve the calf for its safety and to make sure it was unharmed. However, he was arrested on a trespass charge after entering the land. The breeder appealed. Will the court dismiss the charge?\n\nA. Yes, because he had a limited privilege to enter the land to prevent harm to his chattel.\nB. Yes, because the tender pet doctrine allows temporary entry to retrieve baby animals.\nC. No, because the neighbor had a right to keep any living chattels that crossed onto his land.\nD. No, because his status as a breeder made him unqualified for a limited license.\n"

Yes, because he had a limited privilege to enter the land to prevent harm to his chattel.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, there is a legal principle that allows an individual to enter another person's property without permission under certain circumstances, such as when necessary to prevent harm or loss to their own property. In this case, the breeder entered the neighbor's land to retrieve a newborn calf, which could be considered a valuable piece of property (chattel) that required immediate attention and care. This action can be seen as a reasonable measure to protect his property from potential harm or loss. Therefore, the court may recognize this as a limited privilege, justifying the breeder's entry onto the neighbor's land."
