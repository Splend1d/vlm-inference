We seem bent upon saving the Vietnamese from Ho Chi Minh even if we have to kill them and demolish their country to do it. As the native people survey bombed-out villages, women and children burned by napalm, rice crops destroyed and cities overrun with our military personnel, they are doubtless saying secretly of the Vietcong guerillas and of the American forces, \"A plague on both your houses.\" \u2026 Stop the bombing, north and south, end search and destroy offensive sweeps, and confine our military action to holding operations on the ground. Bombing the north has failed to halt or seriously check the flow of troops to the south and may, in fact, have prompted a much greater war effort by Hanoi.\n\u2014Senator George McGovern, \"The Lessons of Vietnam,\" April 25, 1967\nThe sentiments expressed in the speech above most directly influenced which of the following?\n\nA. The passage of the War Powers Act of 1973\nB. The Tet Offensive of 1968\nC. The resignation of Richard Nixon in 1974\nD. The emergence of a youth counterculture\n"

The passage of the War Powers Act of 1973\n\nThe sentiments expressed in Senator George McGovern's speech, which criticize U.S. military involvement in Vietnam and advocate for a reduction in military action, align closely with the motivations behind the War Powers Act of 1973. This act was designed to check the president's power to commit the United States to an armed conflict without the consent of Congress, reflecting a broader sentiment against prolonged and unauthorized military engagements, such as the Vietnam War."
