Cynical, enthusiastic\n\nDickens's description of the French Revolution in \"A Tale of Two Cities\" is characterized by a sense of irony and skepticism, as he portrays the revolution as both the best and worst of times, highlighting the contradictions and extremes of the era. This suggests a cynical view of the revolution.\n\nWordsworth's poem \"The Prelude,\" on the other hand, expresses a sense of excitement and optimism about the revolutionary period, particularly from the perspective of youth. The lines \"Bliss was it in that dawn to be alive. But to be young was very heaven\" convey an enthusiastic and idealistic attitude toward the revolution."
