Therefore, it is less likely to experience significant population pressure.\n\nB. **A society with a highly mechanized agricultural sector**: Mechanization in agriculture often leads to increased efficiency and higher yields, which can support a larger population. Thus, this society is also less likely to experience severe population pressure.\n\nC. **A non-ecumene**: Non-ecumene refers to areas that are not suitable for permanent human habitation due to harsh environmental conditions. These areas naturally have low population densities and thus do not experience population pressure.\n\nD. **A slash-and-burn agricultural society**: Slash-and-burn agriculture is a traditional method where land is cleared by cutting and burning vegetation. This method is often practiced in areas with limited arable land and can lead to soil degradation over time. As the population grows, the available land for agriculture diminishes, leading to increased competition for resources and potential population pressure.\n\nGiven this analysis, the option that is most likely to experience population pressure is:\n\n**D. A slash-and-burn agricultural society**"
