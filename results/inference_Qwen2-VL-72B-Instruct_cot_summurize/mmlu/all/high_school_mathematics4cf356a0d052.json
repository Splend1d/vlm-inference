                    "text": "To determine how many palindromes containing the letter 'M' can be formed from the letters in \"MISSISSIPPI,\" we need to consider the structure of palindromes and the constraints imposed by the available letters.\n\nThe word \"MISSISSIPPI\" consists of:\n- 4 I's\n- 4 S's\n- 2 P's\n- 1 M\n\nSince we're looking for palindromes that contain the letter 'M', let's break down the problem into cases based on the length of the palindrome:\n\n### Case 1: Palindromes of length 2\n- The only palindrome of length 2 that contains 'M' is \"MM\".\n\n### Case 2: Palindromes of length 3\n- The palindrome must have 'M' in the middle. The other two positions can be filled with any of the remaining letters (I, S, P). However, since we need to form a palindrome, the first and last letters must be the same.\n  - Possible pairs are: II, SS, PP\n  - So, there are 3 palindromes of length 3: \"MII\", \"MSS\", \"MPP\"\n\n### Case 3: Palindromes of length 4\n- The palindrome must have 'M' in the middle. The outer two positions can be filled with any of the remaining letters (I, S, P), but they must be the same. The inner position next to 'M' can also be filled with any of the remaining letters.\n  - For the outer positions, we have 3 choices (II, SS, PP).\n  - For the inner position next to 'M', we again have 3 choices (I, S, P).\n  - Therefore, there are \\(3 \\times 3 = 9\\) palindromes of length 4.\n\n### Case 4: Palindromes of length 5\n- The palindrome must have 'M' in the middle. The outermost positions can be filled with any of the remaining letters (I, S, P), but they must be the same. The two inner positions next to 'M' can also be filled with any of the remaining letters, but they must be the same.\n  - For the outermost positions, we have 3 choices (II, SS, PP).\n  - For the two inner positions next to 'M', we again have 3 choices (I, S, P).\n  - Therefore, there are \\(3 \\times 3 = 9\\) palindromes of length 5.\n\n### Case 5: Palindromes of length 6\n- The palindrome must have 'M' in the middle. The outermost positions can be filled with any of the remaining letters (I, S, P), but they must be the same. The two inner positions next to 'M' can also be filled with any of the remaining letters, but they must be the same.\n  - For the outermost positions, we have 3 choices (II, SS, PP).\n  - For the two inner positions next to 'M', we again have 3 choices (I, S, P).\n  - Therefore, there are \\(3 \\times 3 = 9\\) palindromes of length 6.\n\n### Case 6: Palindromes of length 7\n- The palindrome must have 'M' in the middle. The outermost positions can be filled with any of the remaining letters (I, S, P), but they must be the same. The three inner positions next to 'M' can also be filled with any of the remaining letters, but they must be the same.\n  - For the outermost positions, we have 3 choices (II, SS, PP).\n  - For the three inner positions next to 'M', we again have 3 choices (I, S, P).\n  - Therefore, there are \\(3 \\times 3 = 9\\) palindromes of length 7.\n\n### Case 7: Palindromes of length 8\n- The palindrome must have 'M' in the middle. The outermost positions can be filled with any of the remaining letters (I, S, P), but they must be the same. The four inner positions next to 'M' can also be filled with any of the remaining letters, but they must be the same.\n  - For the outermost positions, we have 3 choices (II, SS, PP).\n  - For the four inner positions next to 'M', we again have 3 choices (I, S, P).\n  - Therefore, there are \\(3 \\times 3 = 9\\) palindromes of length 8.\n\n### Case 8: Palindromes of length 9\n- The palindrome must have 'M' in the middle. The outermost positions can be filled"
