SKILLS ACQUISITION\u2192 learning relaxation, self-statements, escape routes not necessary with rehearsing them\n\nIn Stress Inoculation Training (SIT), skills acquisition involves not only learning new skills such as relaxation techniques, self-statements, and coping strategies but also rehearsing these skills. Rehearsal is an essential part of the process to ensure that the individual can effectively apply these skills in real-life stressful situations. Therefore, stating that rehearsal is \"not necessary\" is incorrect."
