We of the Progressive party here dedicate ourselves to the fulfillment of the duty laid upon us by our fathers to maintain the government of the people, by the people and for the people whose foundations they laid. We hold with Thomas Jefferson and Abraham Lincoln that the people are the masters of their Constitution, to fulfill its purposes and to safeguard it from those who, by perversion of its intent, would convert it into an instrument of injustice. In accordance with the needs of each generation the people must use their sovereign powers to establish and maintain equal opportunity and industrial justice, to secure which this Government was founded and without which no republic can endure.\n\"This country belongs to the people who inhabit it. Its resources, its business, its institutions and its laws should be utilized, maintained or altered in whatever manner will best promote the general interest. It is time to set the public welfare in the first place.\"\nProgressive Party Platform, 1912\n\"Muckraking\" author Jacob A.

                    "text": "To determine which quote from the Progressive Party Platform best exemplifies Jacob A. Riis's \"How the Other Half Lives,\" we need to understand the context and content of both the platform and Riis's work.\n\n**Context:**\n- The Progressive Party Platform of 1912 emphasizes the importance of maintaining a government that serves the people and promotes social justice.\n- Jacob A. Riis was a journalist and social reformer known for his book \"How the Other Half Lives,\" which exposed the harsh living conditions of the poor in New York City during the late 19th century.\n\n**Analysis:**\n- **Option A: \"the duty laid upon us by our fathers\"** - This phrase speaks to the responsibility inherited from previous generations to uphold certain values and principles. While Riis's work does reflect a sense of duty to improve society, it is more focused on the immediate conditions rather than historical obligations.\n  \n- **Option B: \"masters of their Constitution\"** - This phrase suggests that the people have control over their governance and constitution. Riis's work does not directly address constitutional matters but focuses on social issues.\n  \n- **Option C: \"an instrument of injustice\"** - This phrase implies that something (likely the government or societal structures) is being used unjustly. Riis's book highlights how the system fails the poor, making them victims of injustice. This aligns well with Riis's work, as he exposes the injustices faced by the underprivileged.\n  \n- **Option D: \"without which no republic can endure\"** - This phrase suggests that certain conditions are necessary for the survival of a republic. While Riis's work does highlight critical social issues, it does not explicitly discuss the endurance of the republic itself.\n\nGiven the analysis, the quote that best exemplifies Jacob A. Riis's \"How the Other Half Lives\" is:\n\n**Final Answer: C. an instrument of injustice**"
