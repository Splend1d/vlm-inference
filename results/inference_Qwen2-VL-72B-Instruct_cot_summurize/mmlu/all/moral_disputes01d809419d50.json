The action, apart from its effects, is morally permissible.\n- This aligns with the idea of intrinsic permissibility. An action is considered intrinsically permissible if it is morally acceptable in itself, regardless of any consequences or side effects.\n\nB. The action, only because of its effects, is morally permissible.\n- This suggests that the moral acceptability of the action depends solely on its outcomes, which contradicts the notion of intrinsic permissibility. Intrinsic permissibility focuses on the nature of the action itself, not just its results.\n\nC. No actual person would ever endorse that action.\n- This statement is about the endorsement of the action by people and does not relate to the intrinsic nature or permissibility of the action itself.\n\nD. The action is valuable because of its relationship to things that are intrinsically valuable.\n- While this might be true for some actions, it doesn't directly address the concept of intrinsic permissibility. It speaks more to the value derived from the action rather than its inherent moral status.\n\nGiven these analyses, the most accurate definition of an action being intrinsically permissible is:\n\n**A. The action, apart from its effects, is morally permissible.**"
