Prior to the signing of the contract, the homeowner and the painter orally agreed that their contract would be null and void unless the homeowner was able to obtain a $3,000 loan from National Bank before April 1. On March 31, the homeowner was informed by National Bank that his loan application had been rejected. The next day, the homeowner telephoned the painter and informed him that the deal was off. If the painter brings an action for breach of contract against the homeowner, would the latter's inability to secure the loan provide him with a valid defense?\n\nA. No, because the homeowner is estopped to deny the validity of the written contract.\nB. No, because the agreement regarding the loan varied the express terms of the writing.\nC. Yes, because the agreement regarding the loan constituted a valid modification of the writing.\nD. Yes, because the loan agreement was a condition precedent to the existence of the contract.\n"

Yes, because the loan agreement was a condition precedent to the existence of the contract.\n\nExplanation:\nIn this scenario, the homeowner and the painter had an oral agreement that the contract would only be valid if the homeowner could secure a $3,000 loan from National Bank before April 1. This oral agreement acted as a condition precedent to the formation of the contract. A condition precedent is an event or state of affairs that must occur before a contract becomes binding on the parties involved.\n\nSince the homeowner did not obtain the required loan, the condition precedent was not met, and therefore the contract never became fully enforceable. As a result, the homeowner's inability to secure the loan provides a valid defense against any claim of breach of contract brought by the painter."
