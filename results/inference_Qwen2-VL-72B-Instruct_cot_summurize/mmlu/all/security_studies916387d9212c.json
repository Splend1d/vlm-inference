Anarchy means that the state exists as part of society being indistinguishable from national government and the domestic character of the state.\nB. Anarchy refers to the lack of over-arching power in the international system - there is no controlling power beyond the multiple states. In the absence of such authority, states have their own agenda for achieving security, and can determine their own goals and behaviour.\nC. Anarchy means that there is little continuity in a government's foreign policy over time. Leaders come and go and their foreign policy changes, which is reflective of different preoccupations and ideologies.\nD. Anarchy means that the structure of the international system is distinctive because states have a strong sense that they are part of a larger entity in international politics with overarching interests and goals, making association unlimited and important.\n"

In the absence of such authority, states have their own agenda for achieving security, and can determine their own goals and behaviour.\n\nIn the context of realism in international relations, anarchy signifies the absence of a central authority or governing body above individual states. This condition leads to a self-help system where states must rely on their own capabilities to ensure their survival and security. As a result, states act based on their own interests and power dynamics, often leading to competition and conflict."
