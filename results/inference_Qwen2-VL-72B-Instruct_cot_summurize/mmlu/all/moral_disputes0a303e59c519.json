At least some nonhuman beings: This suggests that certain nonhuman entities (such as animals or plants) have direct moral standing.\n\nB. At least some nonconscious beings: This implies that even entities without consciousness (like rocks or trees) might have direct moral standing.\n\nC. Both A and B: This would mean that both nonhuman and nonconscious beings have direct moral standing.\n\nD. Neither A nor B; an environmental ethic may deny that there are any nonhuman and nonconscious beings with direct moral standing: This suggests that only human beings have direct moral standing within an environmental ethic.\n\nAn environmental ethic typically considers the well-being of the environment and its components, including nonhuman and potentially nonconscious entities. Many environmental ethics argue for the intrinsic value of nature and its elements beyond human interests alone.\n\nGiven this context, the most inclusive and commonly accepted view in environmental ethics is that at least some nonhuman beings (option A) should have direct moral standing. This aligns with deep ecology and other environmental philosophies that recognize the intrinsic value of nonhuman life forms.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is:\n\nA. At least some nonhuman beings"
