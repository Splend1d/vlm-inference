He then began oil drilling operations and removed large quantities of oil, which he sold. At no time did he give notice to the personal assistant of his oil-drilling activities. Months passed before the personal assistant learned that the uncle was selling oil from the drilling operations.

                    "text": "The correct answer is:\n\nD. the right to remove oil is an incident of the right to possession.\n\nHere\u2019s the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Understanding the Deed**: The deed states that the uncle holds the property with the condition that if his wife dies without issue, the property will pass to the personal assistant. This creates a defeasible fee simple estate for the uncle, meaning his ownership can be terminated under certain conditions (his wife dying without issue).\n\n2. **Incident of Possession**: The uncle has taken possession of the property and has the right to use and enjoy it as long as the condition is not met. The right to remove oil is generally considered an incident of the right to possess and use the land. Therefore, while the uncle holds possession, he has the right to drill for and extract oil.\n\n3. **Equity and Accounting**: The personal assistant seeks an accounting of the oil removed and an injunction against further oil removal. However, since the uncle has the right to possession and thus the right to extract oil, the court would likely rule in favor of the uncle unless there were other legal grounds such as breach of fiduciary duty or fraud, which are not indicated here.\n\n4. **Bad Faith**: While the absence of bad faith by the uncle might be relevant in some contexts, it does not directly address the core issue of the right to remove oil.\n\n5. **Interest in the Tract**: The personal assistant does have a contingent interest in the property, which means she could inherit it under certain conditions. However, this does not negate the uncle's current right to possess and use the property.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate basis for the decision being in favor of the uncle is that the right to remove oil is an incident of the right to possession."
