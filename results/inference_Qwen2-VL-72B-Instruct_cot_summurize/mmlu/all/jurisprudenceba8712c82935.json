Hohfeld identified six fundamental jural relations, each with its corresponding correlative:\n\n1. **Right and Duty**: If A has a right against B, then B has a duty towards A.\n2. **Privilege and No-right**: If A has a privilege over B, then B has no-right against A.\n3. **Power and Liability**: If A has a power over B, then B is liable to A.\n4. **Immunity and Disability**: If A has immunity from B, then B is disabled by A.\n\nNow let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Right and Duty**: This is a correct correlative according to Hohfeld's scheme.\nB. **Privilege and No-right**: This is also a correct correlative according to Hohfeld's scheme.\nC. **Power and Liability**: This is another correct correlative according to Hohfeld's scheme.\nD. **Immunity and Disability**: This is a correct correlative according to Hohfeld's scheme.\n\nNone of the options listed contradict Hohfeld's scheme of 'jural relations.' Therefore, it seems there might be an error in the question as all the provided options align correctly with Hohfeld's framework.\n\nHowever, if we consider the possibility that the question might have been intended to identify an incorrect pairing not listed among the options, then the answer would be that none of the provided options contradict Hohfeld's scheme. \n\nThus, based on the information provided and the analysis of Hohfeld's jural relations, the answer is:\n\n**None of the above options (A, B, C, or D) contradicts Hohfeld's scheme of 'jural relations.'**"
