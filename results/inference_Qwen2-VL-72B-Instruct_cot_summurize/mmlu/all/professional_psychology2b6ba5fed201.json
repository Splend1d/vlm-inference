However, age discrimination can occur even without explicit policies if there is a pattern of adverse treatment towards older workers.\n\nB. \"whenever the employee's age, instead of work performance, is the basis for firing\" - This directly addresses the core issue of age discrimination: if age is used as a criterion for firing rather than work performance, it constitutes age discrimination.\n\nC. \"whenever the affected employee can demonstrate substantial economic loss\" - Economic loss alone does not necessarily indicate age discrimination; it could result from various other factors unrelated to age.\n\nD. \"only when the majority of employees in a given age group are adversely affected economically\" - This implies a statistical approach where a significant number of employees in a specific age group must face economic harm. While this might indicate a pattern, it doesn't capture individual instances of age discrimination.\n\nGiven these analyses, the most accurate statement regarding evidence of age discrimination in the context of firing an employee is:\n\nB. Whenever the employee's age, instead of work performance, is the basis for firing.\n\nFinal answer: B."
