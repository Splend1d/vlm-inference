According to ordinary moral standards, this is considered morally wrong because it involves a failure to act to prevent harm to another person.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n\"I planned to meet up after the heist.\"\n- This action involves participating in a criminal activity (a heist). Planning and executing a crime is generally considered morally wrong under ordinary moral standards.\n\nGiven these analyses, both scenarios involve actions that are considered morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nA. Wrong, Wrong"
