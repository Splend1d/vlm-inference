Let's break down each potential crime:\n\n1. **Assault**: This is the threat or attempt to inflict violence on another person. The defendants threatened the victim with bodily harm, which constitutes assault.\n\n2. **Battery**: This is the actual use of force or violence against another person. Although the defendants did not physically harm the victim, they did push her inside her house, which could be considered battery.\n\n3. **Robbery**: This is the taking of property from someone through the use of force or intimidation. The defendants used threats and tied up the victim before taking her valuables, which fits the definition of robbery.\n\n4. **Burglary**: This is the unlawful entry into a building (or sometimes vehicle) with intent to commit a felony or theft. The defendants entered the victim's home unlawfully and intended to steal her possessions, which is burglary.\n\n5. **Larceny**: This is the unlawful taking and carrying away of someone else's personal property without their consent and with the intent to permanently deprive them of it. The defendants took the victim's valuables and left with them, which is larceny.\n\nGiven these definitions, the most comprehensive answer would include all relevant crimes:\n\n**Final Answer: B. Larceny, robbery, and burglary.**"
