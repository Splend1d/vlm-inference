However, if we consider the relative increase:\n\n- Option A suggests an increase of 2 items, which is incorrect.\n- Option B suggests an increase of 10 items, which is also incorrect.\n- Option C suggests a doubling (2 times as many), which is correct because \\(128\\) is indeed twice \\(64\\).\n- Option D suggests a tenfold increase (10 times as many), which is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the best description of the result of using 7-bit sequences instead of 6-bit sequences is:\n\n**C. 2 times as many items can be uniquely identified.**"
