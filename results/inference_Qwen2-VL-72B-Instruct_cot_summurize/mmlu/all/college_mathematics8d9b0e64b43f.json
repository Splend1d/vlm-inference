The complement of this event is that both \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are less than or equal to 3.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the probability that \\(X \\leq 3\\). Given the probability distribution of \\(X\\), we have:\n\n- \\(P(X=1) = \\frac{1}{2^1} = \\frac{1}{2}\\)\n- \\(P(X=2) = \\frac{1}{2^2} = \\frac{1}{4}\\)\n- \\(P(X=3) = \\frac{1}{2^3} = \\frac{1}{8}\\)\n\nSo, the probability that \\(X \\leq 3\\) is:\n\\[P(X \\leq 3) = P(X=1) + P(X=2) + P(X=3) = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{7}{8}\\]\n\nSince \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are independent, the probability that both \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are less than or equal to 3 is:\n\\[P(X \\leq 3 \\text{ and } Y \\leq 3) = P(X \\leq 3) \\cdot P(Y \\leq 3) = \\left(\\frac{7}{8}\\right)^2 = \\frac{49}{64}\\]\n\nTherefore, the probability that at least one of \\(X\\) or \\(Y\\) is greater than 3 (the complement of both being less than or equal to 3) is:\n\\[P(\\text{at least one of } X \\text{ or } Y > 3) = 1 - P(X \\leq 3 \\text{ and } Y \\leq 3) = 1 - \\frac{49}{64} = \\frac{15}{64}\\]\n\nThe correct answer is B. 15/64."
