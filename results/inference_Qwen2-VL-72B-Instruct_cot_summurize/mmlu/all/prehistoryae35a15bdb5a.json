Stratified societies ruled by kings:\nMayan society was indeed hierarchical, with a ruling class of kings and nobles.\n\nB. Ritual ball games and a reverence for precious jade:\nThe Mayans played a ritual ball game and placed significant value on jade, often using it in their jewelry and as a symbol of status.\n\nC. A sophisticated bronze-producing industry:\nThe Mayans primarily used stone tools and did not develop a significant bronze-producing industry like some other ancient civilizations.\n\nD. A hieroglyphic written language and calendar:\nThe Mayans had a complex hieroglyphic writing system and an advanced calendar system.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nC. A sophisticated bronze-producing industry."
