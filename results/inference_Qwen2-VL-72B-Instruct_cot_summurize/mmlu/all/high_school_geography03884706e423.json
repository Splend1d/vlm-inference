Pioneer settlement to 1870\u2014Germans, British, Scotch-Irish, Africans\n- This period saw significant immigration from these groups, especially Germans, British, and Scotch-Irish. Africans were also brought to the United States as slaves during this time.\n\nB. 1870\u20131914\u2014Asians\n- While there was some Asian immigration during this period (e.g., Chinese laborers for the railroads), it was not the dominant group. The majority of immigrants during this period came from Europe.\n\nC. 1870\u20131914\u2014Eastern and southern Europeans\n- This is accurate. During this period, there was a large influx of immigrants from Eastern and Southern Europe, including Italians, Poles, Greeks, and others.\n\nD. 1965\u2013present\u2014Hispanics\n- This is also accurate. Since the passage of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, there has been a significant increase in Hispanic immigration to the United States.\n\nGiven this analysis, the association that is NOT correct is:\n\nB. 1870\u20131914\u2014Asians"
