Separation of powers\n\nThe principle of separation of powers is violated when one branch or agency of government assumes functions that are constitutionally assigned to another branch. In this scenario, if the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) were to issue, enforce, and adjudicate all disputes regarding a new regulation, it would be performing legislative, executive, and judicial functions, which are typically divided among different branches of government to prevent any one branch from becoming too powerful. This consolidation of power in a single agency would undermine the system of checks and balances established by the Constitution."
