According to the problem, she counted \\(x + 34\\) birds in the morning.\n\nThe total number of birds she counted throughout the day is given as 76. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n\n\\[x + (x + 34) = 76\\]\n\nSolving for \\(x\\):\n\n\\[2x + 34 = 76\\]\n\\[2x = 76 - 34\\]\n\\[2x = 42\\]\n\\[x = 21\\]\n\nSo, Keiko counted 21 birds in the afternoon.\n\nThe correct answer is A. 21 birds."
