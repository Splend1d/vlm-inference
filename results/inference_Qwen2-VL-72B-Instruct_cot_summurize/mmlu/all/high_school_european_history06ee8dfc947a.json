Instead, it suggests a positive reaction.\n\n2. **Option B: Clemenceau had grave doubts about France's ability to win a war against Germany.**\n   - There is no indication in the passage that Clemenceau had doubts about France's ability to win the war. His response is more about the morale of the people rather than his strategic concerns.\n\n3. **Option C: Clemenceau would one day serve as prime minister of France.**\n   - This option is not supported by the passage. The passage does not provide any information about Clemenceau's future political career.\n\n4. **Option D: Clemenceau was relieved to hear that Paris was reacting with joy at the advent of war.**\n   - The passage indicates that when Clemenceau heard that Paris was singing (reacting joyfully), he responded with \"It will be all right then.\" This suggests relief or satisfaction with the morale of the people.\n\nGiven this analysis, the most appropriate inference is:\n\n**D. was relieved to hear that Paris was reacting with joy at the advent of war.**"
