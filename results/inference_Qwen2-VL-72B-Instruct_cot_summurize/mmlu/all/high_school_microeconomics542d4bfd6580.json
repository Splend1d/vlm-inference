At this point, both consumer surplus (the benefit consumers receive from paying less than their maximum willingness to pay) and producer surplus (the benefit producers receive from receiving more than their minimum willingness to accept) are maximized. This results in the total welfare, which is the sum of consumer surplus and producer surplus, being maximized as well. This is considered an efficient outcome because it allocates resources in a way that maximizes overall societal benefit."
