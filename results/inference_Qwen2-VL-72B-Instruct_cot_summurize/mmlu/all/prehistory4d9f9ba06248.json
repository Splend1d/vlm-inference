While the Aztec Empire was known for its strong centralized authority, it is unlikely that every village had armies stationed there constantly.\n\nB. **were forced to send half of all maize they grew to the king as tribute and lived in absolute poverty.**\n   - The Aztec Empire did require tributes from conquered territories, but the idea of sending half of all maize grown seems exaggerated. Additionally, while some commoners might have been poor, living in \"absolute poverty\" is an extreme claim.\n\nC. **were mostly left alone and did fairly well for themselves.**\n   - This option implies a level of autonomy and prosperity for the commoners. Given the structure of the Aztec society, where local governance was often maintained by local leaders under the empire's oversight, this could be plausible.\n\nD. **had no protection from city states that invaded from the north.**\n   - The Aztec Empire was known for its military strength and ability to protect its territories. It is unlikely that these villages would have been left completely unprotected from invasions.\n\nConsidering the historical context and the nature of the Aztec Empire, the most reasonable conclusion is:\n\n**C. were mostly left alone and did fairly well for themselves.**\n\nThis option aligns best with the known practices of the Aztec Empire, which allowed local governance and economic activities to continue under their overarching rule."
