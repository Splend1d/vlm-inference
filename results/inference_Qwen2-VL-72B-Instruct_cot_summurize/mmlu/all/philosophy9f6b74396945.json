Psychological egoism posits that all human actions are motivated by self-interest. If this claim were true, it could be seen as supporting the idea that people act out of self-interest because they seek pleasure.\n\n2. **Option B: is true, but does not support psychological egoism.**\n   - This option implies that the claim is true but does not support psychological egoism. This seems contradictory since feeling pleasure from getting what one wants aligns with the notion of self-interest, which is central to psychological egoism.\n\n3. **Option C: is false, and would not support psychological egoism even if it were true.**\n   - This option states that the claim is false and even if it were true, it wouldn't support psychological egoism. This is logically inconsistent because if the claim were true, it would likely support the idea of self-interest, which is fundamental to psychological egoism.\n\n4. **Option D: is false, but would support psychological egoism if it were true.**\n   - This option asserts that the claim is false but would support psychological egoism if it were true. This makes sense because if the claim were true (that we always feel pleasure when we get what we want), it would align with the idea that our actions are driven by self-interest, thus supporting psychological egoism.\n\nGiven Feinberg's views and the logical analysis of each option, the most coherent and accurate choice is:\n\n**Final Answer: D. is false, but would support psychological egoism if it were true.**"
