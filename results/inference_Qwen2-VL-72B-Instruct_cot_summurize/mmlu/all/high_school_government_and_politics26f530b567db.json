                    "text": "Let's analyze each statement:\n\nA. \"All revenue bills must originate in the Senate before moving to the House.\"\n- This statement is incorrect. According to Article I, Section 7 of the U.S. Constitution, all revenue bills must originate in the House of Representatives.\n\nB. \"Representation in the House is allocated equally among the states, while representation in the Senate is allocated proportional to population.\"\n- This statement is incorrect. Representation in the House is based on population (proportional representation), while representation in the Senate is equal for each state (each state has two senators regardless of population).\n\nC. \"The Speaker of the House wields less power than the president pro tempore of the Senate.\"\n- This statement is incorrect. The Speaker of the House typically wields more power than the president pro tempore of the Senate. The Speaker of the House is second in line for presidential succession after the Vice President, and they have significant influence over the legislative agenda and committee assignments.\n\nD. \"The House has a Committee on Ways and Means, while the Senate does not.\"\n- This statement is correct. The House of Representatives has a Committee on Ways and Means, which is responsible for taxation and other financial matters. The Senate does not have an equivalent committee with the same name or responsibilities.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D."
