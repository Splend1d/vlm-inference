                    "text": "The scenario described involves kittens being raised with alternating monocular vision, where each eye is used on alternate days. This type of visual experience can lead to specific developmental issues in visual processing.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **They were unable to make use of interposition depth perception.**\n   - Interposition depth perception refers to the ability to perceive depth based on objects partially blocking other objects. While this could be affected by monocular vision, it is not the primary issue caused by the described experimental condition.\n\nB. **They were unable to maintain perceptual constancy.**\n   - Perceptual constancy is the ability to recognize that an object remains constant despite changes in sensory input (e.g., recognizing an object regardless of lighting conditions or viewing angles). This is not directly related to the specific visual limitations caused by the described experimental condition.\n\nC. **They were unable to distinguish left from right monocular cues.**\n   - This option suggests a confusion in spatial orientation, which is not a typical outcome of the described experimental condition. Monocular vision does not typically cause confusion about left and right cues.\n\nD. **They were unable to use binocular cues for depth perception.**\n   - Binocular cues for depth perception involve using both eyes simultaneously to perceive depth through mechanisms like stereopsis. Since the kittens were never allowed to use both eyes together, they would lack the ability to develop normal binocular depth perception.\n\nGiven the experimental setup, the most accurate description of the visual limitations experienced by these cats as adults is:\n\n**D. They were unable to use binocular cues for depth perception.**"
