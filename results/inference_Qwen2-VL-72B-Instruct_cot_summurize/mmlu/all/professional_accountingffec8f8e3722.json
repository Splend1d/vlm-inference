We can use the present value of an ordinary annuity formula to find the total present value of these cash inflows:\n\n\\[ \\text{Present Value of Annuity} = \\text{Annual Cash Inflow} \\times \\text{Present Value of $1 Ordinary Annuity for 4 Years at 10\\%} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Present Value of Annuity} = \\$25,000 \\times 3.170 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Present Value of Annuity} = \\$79,250 \\]\n\nNow, we subtract the initial investment from this present value to get the NPV:\n\n\\[ \\text{NPV} = \\text{Present Value of Annuity} - \\text{Initial Investment} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{NPV} = \\$79,250 - \\$80,000 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{NPV} = -\\$750 \\]\n\nSince the NPV is negative (-$750), it indicates that the present value of the future cash inflows is less than the initial investment. Therefore, the machine does not generate enough cash to cover its cost when discounted back to the present at the cost of capital.\n\nBased on this analysis, Skytop Co. should not acquire the machine because the NPV is negative.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nC. No Net present value is ($750)"
