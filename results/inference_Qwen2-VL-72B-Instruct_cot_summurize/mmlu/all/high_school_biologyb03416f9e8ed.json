Typically, females have two X chromosomes (XX), but in Turner's syndrome, they have only one X chromosome (X0).\n\n2. **Hemophilia**: This is a recessive, X-linked trait. It means that the gene responsible for hemophilia is located on the X chromosome.\n\nGiven these points, let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. **Have an extra X chromosome**: This is incorrect because Turner's syndrome involves having only one X chromosome, not an extra one.\n\nB. **Have an extra Y chromosome**: This is also incorrect because Turner's syndrome does not involve an extra Y chromosome; it involves a missing X chromosome.\n\nC. **Lack an X chromosome**: This is correct. Females with Turner's syndrome have only one X chromosome instead of the usual two.\n\nD. **Have red blood cells that clump**: This is not related to Turner's syndrome or hemophilia. Hemophilia affects clotting factors, not the clumping of red blood cells.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n**C. Lack an X chromosome**"
