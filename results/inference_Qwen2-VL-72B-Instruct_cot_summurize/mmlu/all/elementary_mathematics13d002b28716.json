Since 0.95 has two digits after the decimal point, it can be expressed as 95/100 (because 0.95 = 95/100).\n\nNow, we simplify the fraction 95/100 to its simplest form. Both the numerator and the denominator can be divided by their greatest common divisor, which is 5:\n\n\\[ \\frac{95}{100} = \\frac{95 \\div 5}{100 \\div 5} = \\frac{19}{20} \\]\n\nSo, the decimal 4.95 as a mixed number in simplest form is 4 and 19/20.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nA. 4 and 19 over 20"
