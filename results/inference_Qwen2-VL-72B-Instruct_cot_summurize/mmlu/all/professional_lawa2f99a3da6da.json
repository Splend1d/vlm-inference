When the dealer received the tapestry, he noticed that it had been damaged in transit.

The collector told the dealer that he would get back to him with re-shipping instructions. The collector did not make any further contact with the dealer.

The contract specified that delivery would be F.O.B. (Free On Board) at the dealer's shop, meaning the risk of loss or damage passes to the buyer once the goods are delivered to the carrier.\n\n2. **Damage in Transit**: The tapestry was damaged during transit. Since the contract was F.O.B. at the dealer's shop, the risk of loss passed to the dealer when the tapestry was delivered to the carrier. Therefore, the dealer bears the responsibility for the damage.\n\n3. **Rejection by Dealer**: The dealer rejected the tapestry due to the damage. However, the dealer did not return the tapestry to the collector within a reasonable time frame. Instead, the dealer held onto the tapestry for four weeks before reselling it.\n\n4. **Resale by Dealer**: The dealer sold the tapestry to another buyer for $120,000. This indicates that the tapestry still had value despite the damage.\n\n5. **Legal Analysis**:\n   - **Conversion**: Conversion occurs when someone wrongfully takes or retains property belonging to another. Here, the dealer retained the tapestry without returning it to the collector, which could be considered conversion.\n   - **Damages Calculation**: If the dealer is found liable for conversion, the collector would be entitled to the market value of the tapestry at the time of conversion, which is the resale price ($120,000).\n\nGiven these points, the correct answer is:\n\nA. $120,000, for conversion."
