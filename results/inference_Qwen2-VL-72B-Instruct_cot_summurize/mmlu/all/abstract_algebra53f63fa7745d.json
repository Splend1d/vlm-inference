The equality \\( aH = Ha \\) holds if and only if \\( H \\) is a normal subgroup of \\( G \\). For a general subgroup \\( H \\), it is not necessarily true that \\( aH = Ha \\) for all \\( a \\in G \\). \n\n### Statement 2: If \\( H \\) is normal of \\( G \\) and \\( a \\) belongs to \\( G \\), then \\( ah = ha \\) for all \\( h \\) in \\( H \\).\n\nThis statement is **True**. By definition, a subgroup \\( H \\) is normal in \\( G \\) (denoted as \\( H \\triangleleft G \\)) if and only if for every \\( a \\in G \\) and every \\( h \\in H \\), there exists some \\( h' \\in H \\) such that \\( ah = h'a \\). However, this implies that \\( ah \\) can be written as \\( h'a \\) for some \\( h' \\in H \\), which means \\( ah \\) and \\( ha \\) belong to the same coset. In fact, for a normal subgroup, \\( aH = Ha \\) for all \\( a \\in G \\), which directly implies \\( ah = ha \\) for all \\( h \\in H \\).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. False, True"
