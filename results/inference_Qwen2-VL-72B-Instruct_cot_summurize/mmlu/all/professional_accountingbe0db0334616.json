This means that the full amount of the unrealized gain ($100,000) would be reported in OCI.\n\nSince the gain is not recognized in net income, there is no tax effect on net income. However, for tax purposes, the unrealized gain may still have an impact on the company's taxable income if it is realized in the future. But for the current year, since it is unrealized, it does not affect the current year's taxable income.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. $0 $75000"
