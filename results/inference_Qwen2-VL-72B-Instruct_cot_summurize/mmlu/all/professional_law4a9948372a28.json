In the deed, the grantee and her assigns were required by covenant to share proportionately in the paving of a road that abutted the property. The grantee conveyed the property to a married couple by special warranty deed that did not contain any of the conditions of the covenant regarding paving the new road. The buyers did not have an attorney and did not do a title search. When the road was completed, the married couple buyers refused to pay the share that was demanded of them. The original sellers of the parcel sued the couple in an equity claim without a jury. The judge ruled that the couple had to pay their share of the paving. On appeal, will the appellate court affirm the trial judge's order?\n\nA. Yes, this is a covenant running with the land because it was intended to apply to the first purchaser's heirs and \"assigns\".\nB. Yes, because a landowner is in any event responsible for her share of improvements to any abutting private roads.\nC. No, because the general warranty of the original sellers did not apply beyond the first purchaser.\nD. No, because the paving requirement had to be placed in the deed to the married couple and it was not.\n"

Yes, this is a covenant running with the land because it was intended to apply to the first purchaser's heirs and \"assigns\".\n\nIn real estate law, a covenant running with the land is one that binds or benefits subsequent owners of the property. This type of covenant must meet certain criteria, including being intended to run with the land and being capable of touching and concerning the land. Since the original deed contained a covenant requiring the grantee and her assigns to share in the cost of paving the road, and the covenant was intended to benefit or burden the land itself rather than just the original parties, it would likely be considered a covenant running with the land. Therefore, the appellate court would likely affirm the trial judge's order that the married couple must pay their share of the paving costs."
