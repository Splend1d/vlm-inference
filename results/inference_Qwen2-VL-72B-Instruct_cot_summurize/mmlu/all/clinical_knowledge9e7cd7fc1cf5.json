The named consultant.\n\nIn most healthcare systems, the named consultant or attending physician is legally responsible for a patient's care during hospital admission, stay, and discharge. This includes making decisions about treatment plans, overseeing the patient's progress, and ensuring that appropriate care is provided by the medical team. The named nurse and ward manager also play important roles in patient care, but they typically operate under the direction of the consultant. The GP (general practitioner) may be involved in the patient's care before and after hospitalization but is not usually responsible for inpatient care."
