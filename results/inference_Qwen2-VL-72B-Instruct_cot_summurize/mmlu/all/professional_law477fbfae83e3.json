A lay witness, like the neighbor in this case, can only testify to facts within their personal knowledge. Since the neighbor's testimony is based on an appraisal report rather than her own expertise or firsthand knowledge, it would typically be considered inadmissible unless the neighbor herself is qualified as an expert in real estate valuation."
