While progress was made, the goal of halving the number of hungry people by 2015 was not fully achieved.\n\nB. **The number decreased, but not by nearly enough to meet the Summit's goal.**\n   - This statement is accurate. There has been a decrease in the number of food insecure people globally, but it was not sufficient to meet the ambitious target set by the Summit.\n\nC. **The number increased slightly.**\n   - This statement is not entirely accurate. While there have been fluctuations, the overall trend has been a decrease rather than an increase.\n\nD. **Because of rising food prices, the number increased dramatically.**\n   - This statement is partially correct regarding the impact of rising food prices on food insecurity, but it does not accurately reflect the overall trend since 1996.\n\nGiven this analysis, the most accurate answer is:\n\n**B. The number decreased, but not by nearly enough to meet the Summit's goal.**"
