                    "text": "To determine the effect of folic acid supplementation on the methylation of the imprinted gene IGF2 in the resulting children, we need to consider the role of folic acid in DNA methylation.\n\nFolic acid (folate) is essential for the synthesis of nucleotides and plays a crucial role in one-carbon metabolism, which is critical for DNA methylation. DNA methylation is an epigenetic modification that can influence gene expression, including the expression of imprinted genes like IGF2.\n\nIGF2 (Insulin-like Growth Factor 2) is an imprinted gene that is typically expressed from the paternal allele while the maternal allele is silenced through methylation. Folic acid supplementation during pregnancy can affect the availability of methyl groups, potentially influencing the methylation patterns of genes, including IGF2.\n\nGiven this information, the most likely answer is:\n\nB. Methylation of IGF2 is increased.\n\nThis is because adequate folic acid levels can lead to increased availability of methyl groups, which could result in increased methylation of the IGF2 gene. However, it's important to note that the exact effects can vary based on individual factors and further research might provide more specific insights."
