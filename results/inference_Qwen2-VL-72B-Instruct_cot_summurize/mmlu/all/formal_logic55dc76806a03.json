Therefore, \\( U \\supset Z \\) is not an immediate consequence.\n\n### Option B: \\( U \\lor W \\)\nThis disjunction can be derived directly from the first premise \\( U \\supset W \\):\n- If \\( U \\) is true, then \\( W \\) must be true by the implication \\( U \\supset W \\).\n- If \\( U \\) is false, then \\( U \\lor W \\) is still true because \\( W \\) could still be true independently.\n\nThus, \\( U \\lor W \\) is always true based on the first premise alone.\n\n### Option C: \\( \\neg W \\)\nThis would mean that \\( W \\) is false. To check if this is an immediate consequence:\n- If \\( W \\) were false, then \\( \\neg Z \\) would follow from the chain of implications \\( U \\supset W \\), \\( W \\supset (X \\equiv \\neg Y) \\), \\( (X \\equiv \\neg Y) \\supset Z \\), and \\( \\neg Z \\).\n\nHowever, \\( \\neg W \\) is not an immediate one-step consequence; it requires multiple steps of reasoning through the implications.\n\n### Option D: \\( \\neg (X \\equiv \\neg Y) \\)\nThis would mean that \\( X \\equiv \\neg Y \\) is false. To check if this is an immediate consequence:\n- If \\( X \\equiv \\neg Y \\) were false, then \\( Z \\) would also be false due to the premise \\( (X \\equiv \\neg Y) \\supset Z \\).\n\nSince \\( \\neg Z \\) is given as a premise, \\( \\neg (X \\equiv \\neg Y) \\) follows immediately from the third premise \\( (X \\equiv \\neg Y) \\supset Z \\) and the fourth premise \\( \\neg Z \\).\n\nTherefore, the immediate one-step consequence is:\n\n**Final Answer: D. \\( \\neg (X \\equiv \\neg Y) \\)**"
