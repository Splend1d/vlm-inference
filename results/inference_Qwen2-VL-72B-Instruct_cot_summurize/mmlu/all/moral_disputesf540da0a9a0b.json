                    "text": "To determine which option best characterizes Rachels's argument, we need to understand the core of his stance on euthanasia. Rachels argues that there is no significant moral distinction between active euthanasia (intervening to cause death) and passive euthanasia (withholding or withdrawing treatment necessary for life).\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. \"Both active and passive euthanasia involve the intentional termination of a human life with dignity; therefore, both are morally wrong.\"\n- This option suggests that both forms of euthanasia are morally wrong because they involve intentional termination of life. However, Rachels does not argue that both are morally wrong; he focuses on the lack of moral distinction between them.\n\nB. \"Neither active nor passive euthanasia involves the intentional termination of a human life with dignity; therefore, both are morally permissible.\"\n- This option suggests that neither form of euthanasia involves intentional termination of life, making both morally permissible. This does not align with Rachels's argument, as he acknowledges that both can be seen as involving the termination of life.\n\nC. \"There is no inherent moral difference between killing and letting die; therefore, there is no inherent moral difference between active and passive euthanasia.\"\n- This option accurately reflects Rachels's main point: that there is no fundamental moral difference between active and passive euthanasia because both involve decisions about ending life.\n\nD. \"There is no inherent moral difference between killing and letting die; therefore, both active and passive euthanasia are morally wrong.\"\n- This option incorrectly concludes that both forms of euthanasia are morally wrong based on the lack of moral difference. Rachels does not make this claim; he only states that there is no moral difference between the two.\n\nGiven this analysis, the option that best characterizes Rachels's argument is:\n\nC. There is no inherent moral difference between killing and letting die; therefore, there is no inherent moral difference between active and passive euthanasia."
