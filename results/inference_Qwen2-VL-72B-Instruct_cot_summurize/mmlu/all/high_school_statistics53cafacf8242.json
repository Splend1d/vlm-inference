This manipulation is a key characteristic of an experiment.\n\nThe second study was an observational study because it simply asked students about their television usage and class grades without manipulating any variables. The researchers did not control or change the amount of television watched by the participants; they only observed and recorded the data as it naturally occurred.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. The first study was an experiment without a control group, while the second was an observational study."
