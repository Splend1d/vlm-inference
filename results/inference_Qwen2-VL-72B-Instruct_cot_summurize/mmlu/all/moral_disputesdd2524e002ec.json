They seem to entail that any instance of killing in self-defense is wrong.**\n   - This implies that the arguments are overly broad and could lead to the conclusion that even justified killings (such as in self-defense) are morally impermissible.\n\nC. **Both A and B**\n   - This option combines both criticisms, suggesting that the arguments are both insufficiently specific about degradation and overly broad in their implications.\n\nD. **None of the above**\n   - This option denies that either of the previous criticisms applies.\n\nGiven the nature of dignity-based arguments, it is plausible that Metz might find fault with both aspects: the arguments may not clearly establish the degradation aspect of capital punishment, and they might also be too broad, potentially undermining justifiable actions like self-defense.\n\nTherefore, the most comprehensive answer is:\n\n**C. Both A and B**"
