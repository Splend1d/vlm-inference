The parties agreed that the employment would be on an at-will basis. At the end of her first week of work, the employee was given a booklet entitled \"Employment Manual,\" with instructions to read the book in its entirety by the end of the following week. That evening, the employee began reading the manual. The first few pages described the history of the company and provided a personal biography of its president. On page 20, the manual stated that the company treats its employees \"as family\" and that employees will be discharged \"only with good cause. \" The employee finished reading the manual as requested. The employee interpreted the statement on page 20 as insuring continued employment unless good cause existed for termination. Over the next two months, the employee continually complained to her supervisor that the lighting in the accounting department was insufficient. Finally the supervisor, fed up with the complaints, fired the employee. The employee then sued the company, seeking to recover on grounds of promissory estoppel. Which of the following facts, if true and provable, would be most helpful for the employee's cause of action?\n\nA. At the time when the company hired the employee, the company subjectively intended that the employee be given job security.\nB. The employee interpreted the clause in the manual stating that company employees would be treated \"as family\" to mean that she would have job security and could only be fired for good cause.\nC. Just prior to receiving the manual, the employee seriously considered quitting, but continued to work for the company in reliance on the provisions contained on page 20 of the manual.\nD. The employee's complaints regarding the insufficient lighting were factually true and justifIable.\n"

Just prior to receiving the manual, the employee seriously considered quitting, but continued to work for the company in reliance on the provisions contained on page 20 of the manual.\n\nPromissory estoppel is a legal doctrine that prevents a party from going back on a promise if the other party has reasonably relied on that promise to their detriment. In this case, the employee's reliance on the statement in the manual that employees would be discharged \"only with good cause\" and the subsequent decision not to quit based on that belief would be crucial evidence supporting the claim of promissory estoppel. This demonstrates that the employee changed her position in reliance on the company's promise, which is a key element of promissory estoppel."
