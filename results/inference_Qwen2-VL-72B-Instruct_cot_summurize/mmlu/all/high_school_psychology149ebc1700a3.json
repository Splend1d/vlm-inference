Vigorous scratching can stimulate large-diameter nerve fibers, which send signals to the spinal cord that can temporarily close these gates, blocking the transmission of pain signals from the smaller-diameter pain fibers associated with the skin rash. This results in temporary pain relief. Once the scratching stops, the gates reopen, allowing the pain signals to reach the brain again."
