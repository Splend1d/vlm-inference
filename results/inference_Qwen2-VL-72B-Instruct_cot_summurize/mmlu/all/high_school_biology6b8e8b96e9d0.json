Short loops of Henle to maximize water secretion\n\nIn hot and arid environments, animals need to conserve as much water as possible. The long loops of Henle in the kidneys help to reabsorb more water from the urine, which is beneficial for water conservation. Conversely, short loops of Henle would lead to greater water loss, making it less suitable for survival in such environments."
