The idea is to ensure impartiality and fairness in the selection of principles.\n\n2. **Social Primary Goods**: These are things that have value in any social system, such as rights, opportunities, income, and wealth. Rawls argues that these should be distributed fairly.\n\n3. **Principles of Justice**:\n   - **First Principle**: Equal basic liberties compatible with similar liberties for others.\n   - **Second Principle**: \n     - Liberty Principle: Each person has an equal right to the most extensive basic liberty compatible with similar liberties for others.\n     - Difference Principle: Social and economic inequalities are to be arranged so that they are both:\n       1. Reasonably expected to be to everyone's advantage, and\n       2. Attached to positions and offices open to all under conditions of fair equality of opportunity.\n\nGiven this framework, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **The POP will choose wealth over a compassionate society.**\n   - This contradicts Rawls's principles because the original position emphasizes fairness and the distribution of social primary goods in a way that benefits everyone, especially the least advantaged. Choosing wealth over compassion does not align with the difference principle.\n\nB. **The POP will choose equality over power.**\n   - This is closer to Rawls's thinking but is somewhat vague. Equality is a key aspect of Rawls's principles, but it's more about ensuring that inequalities benefit the least advantaged rather than simply choosing equality over power.\n\nC. **The POP will be unselfish.**\n   - This is consistent with the idea of the veil of ignorance, which aims to eliminate self-interest in the selection of principles. However, it doesn't directly address the distribution of social primary goods.\n\nD. **The POP will choose to protect the disabled.**\n   - This aligns well with Rawls's difference principle, which suggests that social and economic inequalities should be arranged to benefit the least advantaged. Protecting the disabled would be a direct application of this principle.\n\nConsidering the above analysis, the proposition that is most consistent with what Rawls claims the original position would opt for in respect of social primary goods is:\n\n**D. The POP will choose to protect the disabled.**"
