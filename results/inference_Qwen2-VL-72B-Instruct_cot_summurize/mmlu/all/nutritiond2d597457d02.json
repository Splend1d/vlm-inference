A difference in perception of risk\n\nMad cow disease, also known as bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), significantly impacted food choices primarily because it altered public perception of the risks associated with consuming beef. The fear of contracting variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) from eating contaminated beef led many consumers to avoid beef products, thus changing their food choices. This shift was driven by concerns about health and safety rather than factors such as price, trust in government, or scientific investigations into meat alternatives."
