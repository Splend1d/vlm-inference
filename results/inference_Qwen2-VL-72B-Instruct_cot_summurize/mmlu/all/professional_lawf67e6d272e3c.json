                    "text": "The scenario presented involves a legal situation where the defendant has taken the stand and denied committing false pretenses. During rebuttal, the prosecuting attorney introduces testimony from a court officer who claims that the defendant admitted to committing false pretenses but was granted immunity in exchange for his testimony against others.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Admissible, as bearing on the defendant's credibility.**\n   - This option suggests that the court officer's testimony is admissible because it relates to the defendant's credibility. If the defendant admitted to committing false pretenses under immunity, this could undermine his credibility when he denies committing the crime during his testimony. Therefore, this testimony could be relevant to assess the defendant's truthfulness.\n\nB. **Admissible, as bearing on the defendant's guilt.**\n   - This option implies that the testimony is admissible because it directly relates to the defendant's guilt. However, since the defendant was granted immunity, any admissions made under such circumstances cannot be used to establish guilt. Immunity typically means that the admissions cannot be used against the defendant in a criminal case.\n\nC. **Inadmissible, because the testimony is extrinsic evidence.**\n   - Extrinsic evidence refers to evidence that is not directly related to the main issue at hand but is used to prove or disprove a collateral matter. In this context, the court officer's testimony about the defendant's admission under immunity is not extrinsic evidence; rather, it is directly related to the defendant's credibility and potentially his guilt.\n\nD. **Inadmissible, because the court order is the best evidence.**\n   - The \"best evidence\" rule generally requires that original documents (or their equivalent) be produced in court if they are the best evidence of the content of those documents. However, this rule does not apply here because the court officer's testimony is not about the contents of a document but about an oral admission made by the defendant.\n\nGiven these analyses, the most appropriate answer is:\n\n**A. Admissible, as bearing on the defendant's credibility.**\n\nThis conclusion is based on the fact that the testimony can be used to challenge the defendant's credibility, which is a permissible use of such evidence even though it cannot be used to establish guilt due to the immunity agreement."
