However, since the parabola is symmetric about the y-axis, we can calculate the area from \\(x = 0\\) to \\(x = 3\\) and then double it.\n\nThe integral for the area under the curve \\(y = x^2\\) from \\(x = 0\\) to \\(x = 3\\) is:\n\\[\\int_{0}^{3} x^2 dx\\]\n\nSolving this integral gives us:\n\\[\\left[\\frac{x^3}{3}\\right]_0^3 = \\frac{3^3}{3} - \\frac{0^3}{3} = \\frac{27}{3} = 9\\]\n\nSince we only calculated half of the area (from \\(x = 0\\) to \\(x = 3\\)), we need to double this result to account for the other half (from \\(x = -3\\) to \\(x = 0\\)):\n\\[2 \\times 9 = 18\\]\n\nHowever, this calculation doesn't directly match any of the provided options, indicating that there might have been a misunderstanding in interpreting the question or the options. The correct approach should consider the area between the parabola and the lines \\(y = 1\\) and \\(y = 9\\), not just under the parabola up to \\(y = 9\\).\n\nLet's correct the approach:\n\nThe area between the parabola \\(y = x^2\\) and the line \\(y = 1\\) from \\(x = -1\\) to \\(x = 1\\) is:\n\\[\\int_{-1}^{1} (1 - x^2) dx\\]\n\nAnd the area between the parabola \\(y = x^2\\) and the line \\(y = 9\\) from \\(x = -3\\) to \\(x = 3\\) is:\n\\[\\int_{-3}^{3} (9 - x^2) dx\\]\n\nWe need to subtract the smaller area from the larger one to get the total area between \\(y = 1\\) and \\(y = 9\\).\n\nCalculating these integrals:\n\nFor the area between \\(y = 1\\) and the parabola:\n\\[\\int_{-1}^{1} (1 - x^2) dx = \\left[x - \\frac{x^3}{3}\\right]_{-1}^{1} = (1 - \\frac{1}{3}) - (-1 + \\frac{1}{3}) = \\frac{2}{3} + \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{4}{3}\\]\n\nFor the area between \\(y = 9\\) and the parabola:\n\\[\\int_{-3}^{3} (9 - x^2) dx = \\left[9x - \\frac{x^3}{3}\\right]_{-3}^{3} = (27 - 9) - (-27 + 9) = 18 + 18 = 36\\]\n\nSubtracting the smaller area from the larger one gives us the total area:\n\\[36 - \\frac{4}{3} = 35\\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{107}{3}\\]\n\nNone of the provided options match this calculation, suggesting there may be an error in the interpretation of the question or the options given. Given the calculations, none of the provided options (A. 8, B. 84/3, C. 64\u221a2/3, D. 104/3) correctly represent the area described.
