This means that even if suppliers raise prices due to a tax, consumers are unlikely to significantly reduce their consumption. As a result, suppliers can pass on the tax to consumers in the form of higher prices without losing many sales. In contrast, if demand were highly elastic, consumers would be very sensitive to price increases and would likely buy much less at higher prices, making it difficult for suppliers to pass on the tax."
