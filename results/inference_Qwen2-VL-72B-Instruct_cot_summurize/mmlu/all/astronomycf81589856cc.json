                    "text": "The correct answer is B. Most rocks on the Moon\u2019s surface are older than those on the Earth\u2019s surface.\n\nThe Giant Impact Hypothesis suggests that the Moon formed from the debris resulting from a collision between Earth and a Mars-sized body early in the solar system's history. This hypothesis explains several observations about the Moon, including:\n\nA. The relative size of the Moon to the size of Earth is large compared to most planets and their moons. This unusual size ratio is consistent with the idea that a significant amount of material was ejected into orbit around Earth during the impact, eventually coalescing to form the Moon.\n\nC. The Moon has a much smaller iron core than the Earth even considering its size. This is because the impacting body likely had a lower density than Earth, and the collision would have preferentially ejected lighter materials into orbit while leaving heavier materials behind on Earth.\n\nD. The Moon was once entirely molten. The energy released by the impact would have been sufficient to melt the Moon, which then solidified over time.\n\nHowever, the age of rocks on the Moon's surface being older than those on Earth's surface does not directly support the Giant Impact Hypothesis. The ages of lunar rocks indicate that the Moon solidified relatively early in the history of the solar system, but this fact alone does not provide evidence for or against the specific mechanism of the Moon's formation proposed by the Giant Impact Hypothesis."
