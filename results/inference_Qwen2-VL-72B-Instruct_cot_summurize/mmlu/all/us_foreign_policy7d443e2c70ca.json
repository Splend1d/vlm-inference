Threats to the state centralize political and economic power, threatening state development\n\nInternational development can indeed be tied to the security of the state because threats to the state often lead to the centralization of political and economic power as governments attempt to maintain control and stability. This centralization can stifle development by limiting the autonomy and innovation necessary for economic growth and social progress. Additionally, resources that could be used for development are often diverted to security measures, further hindering development efforts."
