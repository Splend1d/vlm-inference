The U.S. population at that time was around 316 million people.\n\nLet's calculate the daily coffee consumption:\n\n1. Calculate the number of coffee drinkers:\n   \\( 316 \\text{ million} \\times 0.40 = 126.4 \\text{ million people} \\)\n\n2. Assuming each person drinks one cup of coffee per day:\n   \\( 126.4 \\text{ million people} \\times 1 \\text{ cup/person/day} = 126.4 \\text{ million cups/day} \\)\n\n3. Calculate the weekly consumption:\n   \\( 126.4 \\text{ million cups/day} \\times 7 \\text{ days/week} = 884.8 \\text{ million cups/week} \\)\n\nGiven the options provided:\n\nA. 300 million cups per week\nB. 1 billion cups per week\nC. 3 billion cups per week\nD. 9 billion cups per week\n\nThe closest option to our calculated value is:\n\nB. 1 billion cups per week"
