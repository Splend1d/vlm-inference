Let's analyze each option to determine which best captures this relationship.\n\nA. **Mythos is ultimately based on logos, just as myth is ultimately based on reasoning or thinking.**\n   - This option implies a hierarchical relationship where myth (mythos) is grounded in reason (logos). However, the original statement suggests a more reciprocal relationship rather than a one-way dependency.\n\nB. **Myth does not \"explain\" how things are related as much as it simply reveals them as related.**\n   - This option focuses on the role of myth in revealing relationships rather than explaining them. While insightful, it doesn't fully capture the mutual definition aspect highlighted in the original statement.\n\nC. **Metaphysicians are justified in reasoning as they do because there is only one true answer about being.**\n   - This option introduces a concept of metaphysics and a singular truth about existence, which is not directly addressed in the original statement. It diverges from the core idea of the interdependence between myth and reason.\n\nD. **Myth and reason are the same: \"myth\" defines \"reason,\" and \"reason\" defines \"myth.\"**\n   - This option accurately reflects the idea that myth and reason are mutually defining. The original statement suggests that myth and reason are so deeply intertwined that each is necessary to define the other, making them essentially inseparable.\n\nGiven the analysis, the most appropriate interpretation of the statement is:\n\n**Final Answer: D. Myth and reason are the same: \"myth\" defines \"reason,\" and \"reason\" defines \"myth.\"**"
