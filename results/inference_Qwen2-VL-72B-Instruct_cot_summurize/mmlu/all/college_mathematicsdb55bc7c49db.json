Let's break down the solution step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: Each student dislikes three other students. We need to divide the class into teams such that no student is on the same team with any of the three students they dislike.\n\n2. **Minimum Number of Teams**: Since each student dislikes three others, the minimum number of teams required to ensure no student is on the same team with anyone they dislike is determined by the maximum number of dislikes any single student can have. \n\n3. **Dislikes and Teams**: If we consider the worst-case scenario where every student dislikes three different students, we need to distribute these students into teams in such a way that no two students who dislike each other end up in the same team.\n\n4. **Calculating Minimum Teams**: \n   - If there were only one team, it would be impossible because each student dislikes three others.\n   - With two teams, it's still impossible since at least one disliked pair would end up together.\n   - With three teams, it's also impossible for the same reason.\n   - With four teams, it becomes possible to distribute the students such that no student is on the same team with any of the three they dislike. For example:\n     - Team 1: Student A (dislikes B, C, D)\n     - Team 2: Student B (dislikes A, E, F)\n     - Team 3: Student C (dislikes A, G, H)\n     - Team 4: Student D (dislikes A, I, J)\n\n5. **Verification**:\n   - In this setup, each student is placed in a separate team from the three they dislike. This ensures that no student ends up on the same team with anyone they dislike.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of teams required is **4**.\n\nThe correct answer is **A. 4**."
