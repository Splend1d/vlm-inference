How nuclear attacks are identified and responded to; who controls the weapons\n\nBureaucratic politics focuses on the internal decision-making processes within government agencies, including those related to national security and defense. In the context of nuclear weapons, bureaucratic politics would be concerned with how decisions are made regarding the identification and response to potential nuclear attacks, as well as the control and management of nuclear arsenals. This includes issues such as command and control structures, communication protocols, and the roles and responsibilities of various governmental bodies in managing nuclear risks and responses."
