She does not recall any sick contacts. She had chickenpox at the age of 7 years. Her most recent examination 1 year ago included PPD skin testing and showed no abnormalities. She takes a daily multivitamin and an herbal weight-loss preparation. She received all appropriate immunizations during childhood but has not received any since then. She does not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. There is no family history of serious illness. She appears lethargic. Her temperature is 39.1\u00b0C (102.4\u00b0F), pulse is 112/min, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 100/68 mm Hg. Examination shows diffuse petechiae. Kernig and Brudzinski signs are present. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. A lumbar puncture is performed. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis shows numerous segmented neutrophils and a decreased glucose concentration. A Gram stain of the CSF shows gram-negative cocci. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy?\n\nA. Ceftriaxone\nB. Clindamycin\nC. Erythromycin\nD. Metronidazole\n"

Ceftriaxone\n\nThe patient's symptoms, including headache, stiff neck, sensitivity to light, fever, and the presence of Kernig and Brudzinski signs, suggest meningitis. The finding of numerous segmented neutrophils and a decreased glucose concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) further supports this diagnosis. The Gram stain showing gram-negative cocci is indicative of bacterial meningitis, likely caused by Neisseria meningitidis.\n\nCeftriaxone is a third-generation cephalosporin that is highly effective against N. meningitidis and is the recommended first-line treatment for suspected or confirmed bacterial meningitis. It has excellent penetration into the central nervous system and provides broad-spectrum coverage against common causes of bacterial meningitis.\n\nClindamycin, erythromycin, and metronidazole are not typically used as first-line agents for bacterial meningitis because they do not have adequate activity against N. meningitidis or other common causative organisms, nor do they penetrate the blood-brain barrier as effectively as ceftriaxone."
