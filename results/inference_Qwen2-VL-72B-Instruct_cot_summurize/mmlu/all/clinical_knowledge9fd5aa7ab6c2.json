In the presence of adequate oxygen, the process of oxidative phosphorylation in the mitochondria can efficiently produce ATP, which is then used to resynthesize PCr from creatine and ADP. However, in conditions of hypoxia or a lack of oxygen, this process is impaired, leading to reduced PCr resynthesis. Therefore, option D is correct."
