Examination shows no cervical adenopathy. The lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely causal organism?\n\nA. Haemophilus influenzae type b\nB. Moraxella catarrhalis\nC. Staphylococcus aureus\nD. Streptococcus pneumoniae\n"

The most common causative organisms for acute bacterial sinusitis include Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. However, Haemophilus influenzae type b is less common in adults and is more commonly associated with invasive disease such as meningitis. Staphylococcus aureus is also a possible cause but it is less common than the other three. Therefore, the most likely causal organism in this case would be D. Streptococcus pneumoniae."
