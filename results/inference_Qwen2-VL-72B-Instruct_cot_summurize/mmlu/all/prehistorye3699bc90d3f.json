These elements, though present in very small quantities, can provide clues about the geological origin of the material. By comparing the trace element composition of an artifact with known sources, archaeologists can infer where the raw material for the artifact came from. This technique is particularly useful in provenance studies, helping to understand trade routes, resource procurement, and cultural interactions in the past."
