After telling his employer by phone that he was going for lunch and getting approval, he pulled into the entrance of a restaurant where he intended to have his usual 30- minute lunch break. While entering the parking lot, the driver carelessly ran over and seriously injured a pedestrian. The injured person sued the driver and the driver's employer for negligence in causing her injuries. Is the employer liable?\n\nA. Yes, because of the doctrine of vicarious liability.\nB. Yes, because the employer owned the truck.\nC. No, because the employee was not within the scope of his employment.\nD. No, because liability cannot be imputed from one person to another.\n"

                    "text": "To determine whether the employer is liable for the injuries caused by the truck driver, we need to consider the principles of vicarious liability and the scope of employment.\n\n1. **Vicarious Liability**: This legal principle holds an employer responsible for the actions of their employees if those actions occur within the scope of employment. \n\n2. **Scope of Employment**: For an employer to be held liable under the doctrine of vicarious liability, the employee must have been acting within the scope of their employment at the time of the incident.\n\nGiven these principles:\n\n- **Option A**: \"Yes, because of the doctrine of vicarious liability.\" This option suggests that the employer could be liable if the driver was acting within the scope of employment when the accident occurred. However, this needs further clarification based on the specific circumstances.\n\n- **Option B**: \"Yes, because the employer owned the truck.\" Ownership of the vehicle alone does not necessarily make the employer liable; it depends on whether the driver was acting within the scope of employment.\n\n- **Option C**: \"No, because the employee was not within the scope of his employment.\" This option implies that the driver was not performing work duties at the time of the accident. If the driver was on a personal lunch break and not engaged in any work-related activity, the employer might not be liable.\n\n- **Option D**: \"No, because liability cannot be imputed from one person to another.\" This statement is incorrect as liability can indeed be imputed from an employee to an employer under the doctrine of vicarious liability if certain conditions are met.\n\nConsidering the scenario provided:\n- The driver was approved for a lunch break and was heading to a restaurant for a 30-minute lunch break.\n- The accident occurred while the driver was entering the parking lot of the restaurant.\n\nThe key question here is whether the lunch break was considered part of the driver\u2019s workday or a purely personal activity. If the lunch break was considered part of the workday (e.g., the employer allowed paid breaks), then the driver could still be seen as within the scope of employment during this period.\n\nBased on the information given, it is reasonable to conclude that the driver was likely still within the scope of employment during the lunch break, especially since the employer had approved the lunch break.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer is:\n\n**A. Yes, because of the doctrine of vicarious liability.**\n\nThis conclusion assumes that the lunch break was part of the workday and thus the driver was still within the scope of employment."
