This means that:\n\n\\[x = 0.17777...\\]\n\nTo eliminate the repeating part, we multiply both sides of the equation by 10 (since there is one digit in the non-repeating part) and then subtract the original equation from this new equation:\n\n\\[10x = 1.7777...\\]\n\\[x = 0.1777...\\]\n\nSubtracting these two equations gives us:\n\n\\[9x = 1.6\\]\n\nSolving for $x$ gives:\n\n\\[x = \\frac{1.6}{9}\\]\n\nTo simplify this fraction, we convert $1.6$ to $\\frac{16}{10}$, which simplifies further to $\\frac{8}{5}$ when divided by $9$:\n\n\\[x = \\frac{8}{5} \\times \\frac{1}{9} = \\frac{8}{45}\\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. $\\frac{8}{45}$."
