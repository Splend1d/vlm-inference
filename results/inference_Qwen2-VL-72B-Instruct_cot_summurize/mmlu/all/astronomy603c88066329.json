                    "text": "To determine which statement(s) about planetary rings is/are correct, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. Known to exist for all of the jovian planets.\n- This statement is not entirely accurate. While Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune (the jovian planets) do have ring systems, they are not equally prominent or well-known. Saturn's rings are the most famous and extensive, while the rings around the other jovian planets are much less pronounced.\n\nB. Composed of a large number of individual particles that orbit their planet in accord with Kepler's third law.\n- This statement is correct. Planetary rings are indeed made up of countless small particles ranging from dust-sized grains to larger boulders. These particles orbit their respective planets according to the laws of celestial mechanics, including Kepler's third law, which relates the orbital period of a planet to its distance from the central body.\n\nC. Nearer to their planet than any of the planet's large moons.\n- This statement is generally true. Planetary rings typically lie within the Roche limit, which is the distance at which a celestial body would be torn apart by tidal forces if it were to approach too closely to another massive body. This means that rings are usually closer to their planet than the larger moons, which tend to orbit beyond this limit.\n\nGiven these analyses, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Composed of a large number of individual particles that orbit their planet in accord with Kepler's third law."
