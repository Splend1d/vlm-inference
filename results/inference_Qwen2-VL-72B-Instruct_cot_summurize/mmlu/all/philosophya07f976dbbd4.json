Anscombe, in her influential essay \"Modern Moral Philosophy,\" criticizes Immanuel Kant's concept of the categorical imperative. She argues that Kant's moral philosophy, which relies heavily on the notion of duty and the categorical imperative, is problematic because it fails to ground morality in human nature or the natural world. Anscombe suggests that Kant's approach to ethics is too abstract and detached from the concrete realities of human life and relationships."
