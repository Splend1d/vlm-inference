Sufficient, because the property can be identified.\n\nExplanation:\nIn legal terms, for a conveyance of real property to be valid, the description of the property must be sufficient to identify the parcel with reasonable certainty. The description provided by Farmer Fred includes specific fractions and geographic references (\"the eastern one tenth of the western corner of the property\"), which should allow for the identification of the parcel being gifted. Therefore, the description is considered sufficient for the purpose of conveying the property.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the description is not too vague; it provides enough detail to identify the property. Option B is irrelevant because the title of seisin refers to the actual possession or control of property, not the adequacy of the description in the conveyance. Option D is also incorrect because the question pertains to the adequacy of the description, not the presence of consideration (which is typically not required for a gift)."
