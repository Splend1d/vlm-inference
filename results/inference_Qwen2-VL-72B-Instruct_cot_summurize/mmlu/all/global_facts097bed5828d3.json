Given the general perception and discussions about corruption in politics, this seems relatively low.\n\n2. **Option B: 56%**\n   - This percentage indicates that slightly more than half of the population believes political parties are corrupt. This could be plausible but might not capture the widespread skepticism often discussed.\n\n3. **Option C: 76%**\n   - This percentage suggests that a significant majority of the population believes political parties are corrupt. This aligns with common perceptions and discussions about political corruption in various media and public forums.\n\n4. **Option D: 96%**\n   - This percentage implies almost everyone believes political parties are corrupt. While there may be widespread distrust, it is unlikely to be this high as some people might still have faith in political institutions or specific parties.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most reasonable and likely option is:\n\n**Option C: 76%**\n\nThis percentage reflects a substantial level of distrust without being overly exaggerated. Therefore, the share of people in the United States who think political parties are corrupt as of 2013 is most likely 76%."
