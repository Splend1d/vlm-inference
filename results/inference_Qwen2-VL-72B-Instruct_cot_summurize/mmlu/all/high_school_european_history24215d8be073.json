The clergy's monopoly on academic scholarship in eighteenth-century Britain**\n   - This option is not directly related to the content of the quote. The quote does not discuss the role or influence of the clergy in academic scholarship during the eighteenth century.\n\n   **B. The hatred of all things Roman by British scholars in the eighteenth century**\n   - The quote does not indicate any hatred towards Roman culture or civilization. It simply describes the views of different groups within ancient Rome regarding their religious practices.\n\n   **C. The spread of religious skepticism among the educated elite of Britain in the eighteenth century**\n   - This option aligns well with the quote. The mention of philosophers viewing different modes of worship as \"equally false\" suggests a skeptical attitude towards religion, which could reflect the spread of religious skepticism among the educated elite at the time.\n\n   **D. The lack of sources available to the eighteenth-century scholar for the study of ancient Roman civilization**\n   - The quote does not address the availability of sources for studying ancient Rome. It focuses on the differing perspectives on religion within ancient Roman society.\n\nGiven this analysis, the most appropriate answer is:\n\n**C. The spread of religious skepticism among the educated elite of Britain in the eighteenth century**"
