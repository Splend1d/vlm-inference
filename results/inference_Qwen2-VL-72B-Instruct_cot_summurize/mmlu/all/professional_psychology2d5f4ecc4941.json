A mixed model analysis of variance (ANOVA) could be used to analyze the data**: This is correct because a mixed model ANOVA can handle both between-subjects and within-subjects factors, making it suitable for this type of experimental design.\n- **B. The design includes one between-subjects factor and one within-subjects factor**: This is also correct. The between-subjects factor is the type of treatment (cognitive behavioral vs. brief dynamic), and the within-subjects factor is the time of assessment (pretest vs. posttest).\n- **C. Each factor comprises two levels**: This is accurate as well. The between-subjects factor has two levels (cognitive behavioral and brief dynamic treatments), and the within-subjects factor also has two levels (pretest and posttest).\n\nTherefore, all statements A, B, and C are correct, leading to the conclusion that D. All of the above is the right answer."
