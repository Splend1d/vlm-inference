He argued that the death penalty serves as a deterrent and is morally justified in certain cases.\n\nGiven this information:\n\n- A distributionist typically refers to someone who advocates for the equitable distribution of resources or wealth, which does not directly relate to Van den Haag's stance on capital punishment.\n- An abolitionist is someone who opposes and seeks to end a particular practice, such as slavery or capital punishment. This does not align with Van den Haag's views.\n- A retentionist is someone who supports the continued use of a particular practice, such as capital punishment. This aligns with Van den Haag's stance.\n- A humanitarian generally focuses on promoting human welfare and compassion, which does not specifically describe Van den Haag's position on capital punishment.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. a retentionist."
