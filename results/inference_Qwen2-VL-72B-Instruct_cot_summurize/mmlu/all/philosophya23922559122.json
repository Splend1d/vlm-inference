Writers often have differing opinions on what constitutes ethical behavior, leading to a lack of consensus on certain issues.\nB. Many ethical debates have been ongoing for decades, which can make it feel like progress is slow or that the same discussions are being repeated without resolution.\nC. Certain research methods may be more frequently associated with ethical violations, which can lead to biases or stereotypes about those methods.\nD. Therefore, all of these points contribute to the complexities and challenges in discussing research ethics."
