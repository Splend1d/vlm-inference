Lack of coordination\n\nAfter two sleepless nights, participants in a sleep deprivation study are likely to experience a decline in cognitive and physical performance, including lack of coordination. This is a common symptom of sleep deprivation as it affects the brain's ability to process information and control motor functions effectively. While hunger and thirst might also increase due to metabolic changes, and hallucinations can occur with more prolonged or severe sleep deprivation, lack of coordination is a more immediate and typical effect after just two nights without sleep."
