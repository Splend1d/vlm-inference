If banks hold excess reserves, they have less money available to lend, which reduces the money creation potential of the banking system. When banks lend money, it gets deposited back into the banking system, allowing for further lending and money creation through the money multiplier effect. However, if banks choose to hold more reserves than required, this limits their ability to lend and thus dampens the money creation process."
