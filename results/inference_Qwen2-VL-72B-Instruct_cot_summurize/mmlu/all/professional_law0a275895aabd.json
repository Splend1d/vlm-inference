                    "text": "A homeowner died in 1985. His will devised his estate in a southern state to his uncle and his best friend \"to share and share alike as tenants in common. \"At the time of the homeowner's death, the uncle lived in a different part of the southern state (in which the estate was located), while the best friend resided in a northern state. After the homeowner's funeral, the uncle returned to his own residence, but the best friend decided to occupy the estate. He put his name on the mailbox and has paid the taxes and maintenance expenses. To earn extra money, the best friend rented a small house on the property to a teacher and received a monthly rental payment from her. The best friend also grew fruits on the property and sold them at a stand on Fridays. The uncle has been generally aware of this, but because he cared little about the estate, the uncle has never pressed the best friend about the property. Since 1985 the uncle has not paid any rent or other compensation to the best friend, nor has the best friend requested such payment. In January 2010, a series of disputes arose between the uncle and the best friend for the first time concerning their respective rights to the estate. The state in which the property is located recognizes the usual common law types of cotenancies and follows majority rules on rents and profits. There is no applicable legislation on the subject. The uncle brings an appropriate action for a portion of the proceeds that the best friend received from his fruit stand and a portion of the rent that the teacher paid. If the best friend contests the apportionment of the monies he received, judgment should be for whom?\n\nA. As a cotenant in possession, the best friend retains the profits from his crops and the rents paid by the teacher.\nB. As a cotenant in possession, the best friend retains the profits from his crops, and the uncle is entitled to a share of the rent paid by the teacher.\nC. The uncle is entitled to a share of the rent that the teacher paid and the profits from the best friend's crops.\nD. The uncle is entitled to no share of any of the monies raised because the uncle's lack of contact with the best friend will be deemed a waiver.\n"

                    "text": "To determine the correct answer, we need to analyze the legal principles governing cotenancy and the rights of cotenants under common law.\n\n1. **Cotenancy and Profits**: Under common law, when two or more individuals hold title to real property as tenants in common, each cotenant has an equal right to possess and use the entire property. However, if one cotenant occupies and uses the property, they are responsible for maintaining it and paying taxes, but they can retain the profits from the use of the property unless there is an agreement to the contrary.\n\n2. **Rents and Profits**: Generally, rents and profits from the property are shared among the cotenants according to their respective shares in the property. However, if one cotenant occupies and maintains the property, they may retain the rents and profits as compensation for their efforts and expenses.\n\nGiven these principles:\n\n- The best friend has occupied and maintained the property since 1985, paying taxes and maintenance expenses.\n- The uncle has been aware of this arrangement but has not contributed financially or contested the best friend\u2019s actions until 2010.\n- The best friend has used the property to generate income through renting a house and selling fruits.\n\n**Analysis of Options:**\n\nA. **As a cotenant in possession, the best friend retains the profits from his crops and the rents paid by the teacher.**\n   - This option suggests that the best friend retains all profits and rents. However, under common law, the best friend would typically retain the profits from the crops as compensation for his efforts and expenses, but the rents from the tenant might be shared.\n\nB. **As a cotenant in possession, the best friend retains the profits from his crops, and the uncle is entitled to a share of the rent paid by the teacher.**\n   - This option aligns with the principle that the best friend can retain the profits from the crops as compensation for his efforts and expenses, while the uncle is entitled to a share of the rent from the tenant.\n\nC. **The uncle is entitled to a share of the rent that the teacher paid and the profits from the best friend's crops.**\n   - This option incorrectly implies that the uncle is entitled to a share of both the rents and the profits from the crops. The best friend should retain the profits from the crops as compensation for his efforts and expenses.\n\nD. **The uncle is entitled to no share of any of the monies raised because the uncle's lack of contact with the best friend will be deemed a waiver.**\n   - This option suggests that the uncle waives his rights due to lack of contact. However, mere lack of contact does not necessarily waive the uncle's rights to a share of the rents.\n\nBased on the analysis, the most accurate answer is:\n\n**B. As a cotenant in possession, the best friend retains the profits from his crops, and the uncle is entitled to a share of the rent paid by the teacher.**"
