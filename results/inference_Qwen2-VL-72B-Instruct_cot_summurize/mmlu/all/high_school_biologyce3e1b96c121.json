This causes all the codons downstream of the mutation to be read incorrectly.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. CAT HAS HIS \u2192 CAT HAS HIT\n- This change involves replacing one letter with another, which does not alter the reading frame. It's a point mutation, not a frameshift mutation.\n\nB. CAT HAS HIS \u2192 CAT HSH ISA\n- Here, two letters have been deleted (\"A\" and \"S\"), but since this deletion is not a multiple of three, it shifts the reading frame. This is a frameshift mutation.\n\nC. CAT HAS HIS \u2192 CAT HIS HAT\n- In this case, three letters have been deleted (\"A\", \"S\", and \" \"). Since the deletion is a multiple of three, it does not shift the reading frame. This is not a frameshift mutation.\n\nD. CAT HAS HIS \u2192 CAT WAS HIT\n- This change involves replacing three letters with three different letters, which does not alter the reading frame. It's a substitution mutation, not a frameshift mutation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. CAT HAS HIS \u2192 CAT HSH ISA"
