This effect is most commonly discussed in the context of sound waves but applies to all types of waves.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **The source travels toward the stationary detector.**\n   - In this case, the detector will perceive an increase in the frequency of the sound (a higher pitch) due to the Doppler effect. Therefore, there is a perceived Doppler shift.\n\nB. **The detector travels toward the stationary source.**\n   - Similarly, when the detector moves towards the source, the detector will also perceive an increase in the frequency of the sound. Thus, there is a perceived Doppler shift.\n\nC. **Both the source and detector travel in the same direction.**\n   - If both the source and detector are traveling in the same direction at the same speed, they maintain a constant distance between them. In this scenario, the frequency of the sound waves reaching the detector remains unchanged, resulting in no perceived Doppler shift.\n\nD. **Both the source and detector travel in opposite directions, with the source and detector moving away from each other.**\n   - When the source and detector move away from each other, the detector perceives a decrease in the frequency of the sound (a lower pitch). Hence, there is a perceived Doppler shift.\n\nTherefore, the situation where there is NO perceived Doppler shift is:\n\n**C. Both the source and detector travel in the same direction.**"
