                    "text": "To determine which of the given sets are ideals in the ring \\( R \\), we need to check if they satisfy the ideal properties:\n\n1. **Closure under addition**: For any elements \\( a, b \\) in the set, their sum \\( a + b \\) must also be in the set.\n2. **Closure under multiplication by elements of \\( R \\)**: For any element \\( r \\) in \\( R \\) and any element \\( a \\) in the set, both \\( ra \\) and \\( ar \\) must also be in the set.\n\nNow let's analyze each option:\n\n### I. \\( \\{u + v : u \\in U \\text{ and } v \\in V\\} \\)\n\nThis is the sum of two ideals \\( U \\) and \\( V \\). We need to verify that this sum is closed under addition and multiplication by elements of \\( R \\).\n\n- **Closure under addition**: If \\( u_1 + v_1 \\) and \\( u_2 + v_2 \\) are in the set, then:\n  \\[\n  (u_1 + v_1) + (u_2 + v_2) = (u_1 + u_2) + (v_1 + v_2)\n  \\]\n  Since \\( U \\) and \\( V \\) are ideals, \\( u_1 + u_2 \\in U \\) and \\( v_1 + v_2 \\in V \\). Thus, \\( (u_1 + u_2) + (v_1 + v_2) \\) is in the set.\n\n- **Closure under multiplication by elements of \\( R \\)**: Let \\( r \\in R \\).\n  - \\( r(u + v) = ru + rv \\)\n    - Since \\( U \\) and \\( V \\) are ideals, \\( ru \\in U \\) and \\( rv \\in V \\). Hence, \\( ru + rv \\) is in the set.\n  - Similarly, \\( (u + v)r = ur + vr \\)\n    - Since \\( U \\) and \\( V \\) are ideals, \\( ur \\in U \\) and \\( vr \\in V \\). Hence, \\( ur + vr \\) is in the set.\n\nThus, the sum \\( \\{u + v : u \\in U \\text{ and } v \\in V\\} \\) is an ideal.\n\n### II. \\( \\{uv : u \\in U \\text{ and } v \\in V\\} \\)\n\nThis is the product of two ideals \\( U \\) and \\( V \\). We need to verify that this product is closed under addition and multiplication by elements of \\( R \\).\n\n- **Closure under addition**: If \\( u_1v_1 \\) and \\( u_2v_2 \\) are in the set, then:\n  \\[\n  (u_1v_1) + (u_2v_2)\n  \\]\n  This sum does not necessarily belong to the set because it is not guaranteed that \\( u_1v_1 + u_2v_2 \\) can be expressed as \\( uv \\) for some \\( u \\in U \\) and \\( v \\in V \\).\n\n- **Closure under multiplication by elements of \\( R \\)**: Let \\( r \\in R \\).\n  - \\( r(uv) = (ru)v \\)\n    - Since \\( U \\) is an ideal, \\( ru \\in U \\). Hence, \\( (ru)v \\) is in the set.\n  - Similarly, \\( (uv)r = u(vr) \\)\n    - Since \\( V \\) is an ideal, \\( vr \\in V \\). Hence, \\( u(vr) \\) is in the set.\n\nThus, the product \\( \\{uv : u \\in U \\text{ and } v \\in V\\} \\) is not necessarily an ideal because it may not be closed under addition.\n\n### III. \\( \\{x : x \\in U \\text{ and } x \\in V\\} \\)\n\nThis is the intersection of two ideals \\( U \\) and \\( V \\). We need to verify that this intersection is closed under addition and multiplication by elements of \\( R \\).\n\n- **Closure under addition**: If \\( x_1 \\) and \\( x_2 \\) are in the set, then:\n  \\[\n  x_1 + x_2\n  \\]\n  Since \\( x_1 \\in U \\) and \\( x_2 \\in U \\), \\( x_1 + x_2 \\in U \\). Similarly, since \\( x_1 \\in V \\) and \\( x_2 \\in V \\), \\( x_1 + x_2 \\in V \\). Hence, \\( x_1 + x_2 \\) is in the set.\n\n- **"
