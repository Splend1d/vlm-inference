It can also lead to conflicts and misinformation.\n\nC. **With access to digital information, such as media and the internet, disempowered populations will become aware of their own exclusion and the inequalities of the global system. This could lead to widespread frustration and revolution.**\n   - This option highlights a potential negative implication where awareness of inequalities might lead to frustration and unrest. Peace studies often consider how information access can exacerbate social tensions.\n\nD. **Technological change and development is likely to strengthen the power of already dominant international players, and to reinforce the status quo of international relations.**\n   - This statement suggests that technological advancements might consolidate existing power structures, which aligns with some perspectives in peace studies that focus on power dynamics and inequality.\n\nGiven these analyses, the most accurate reflection of concerns within peace studies regarding technological change and development is:\n\n**C. With access to digital information, such as media and the internet, disempowered populations will become aware of their own exclusion and the inequalities of the global system. This could lead to widespread frustration and revolution.**\n\nThis option captures the potential for increased awareness leading to social tensions and unrest, which is a significant consideration in peace studies."
