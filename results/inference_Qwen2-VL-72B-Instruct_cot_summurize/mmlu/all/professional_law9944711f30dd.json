On March 7, the woman sent the following purchase order to a manufacturer of widgets:\"Promptly ship 1,000 widgets, catalogue #B4-IEU, at the current wholesale price to our warehouse. Thank you for your attention to this matter. \"This order was received by the manufacturer on March 9. The next day, the manufacturer replied by fax:\"Your order has been received. Shipment date will be March 12. Price $50 for each widget delivered. Be advised that these are the last widgets, under catalogue #B4-IEU, that we can deliver, since this variety is no longer being manufactured. \"Upon receipt of the fax, the woman immediately sent the following fax:\"Cancel our previous order for 1,000 widgets under catalogue #B4-IEU. Price too high. \"Assume $50 per widget was the current wholesale market price. Was an enforceable contract in effect between the woman and the manufacturer?\n\nA. No, because the woman's order was too indefinite to constitute an offer, since it didn't contain a price term.\nB. No, because even if the woman's order was a valid offer, it was effectively revoked prior to acceptance.\nC. Yes, because the woman's order created a valid option contract.\nD. Yes, because the manufacturer's fax of March 10 constituted an acceptance of the woman's offer.\n"

                    "text": "To determine whether an enforceable contract existed between the woman and the manufacturer, let's analyze the sequence of events and the legal principles involved.\n\n1. **Initial Offer**: The woman sent a purchase order to the manufacturer on March 7, requesting the shipment of 1,000 widgets at the current wholesale price. This constitutes an offer, as it specifies the quantity and type of widgets desired.\n\n2. **Acceptance**: The manufacturer responded on March 10, confirming the receipt of the order and providing a specific price ($50 per widget) along with the shipment date (March 12). This response includes all necessary terms and conditions, making it a clear acceptance of the woman's offer.\n\n3. **Revocation Attempt**: Upon receiving the manufacturer's acceptance, the woman immediately sent a fax to cancel the order due to the price being too high. However, this revocation attempt occurred after the manufacturer had already accepted the offer.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **Option A**: This option suggests that the woman's order was too indefinite to constitute an offer because it did not contain a price term. However, the offer specified the quantity and type of widgets and referenced the current wholesale price, which is sufficient to make it a valid offer.\n\n- **Option B**: This option claims that even if the woman's order was a valid offer, it was effectively revoked prior to acceptance. However, the manufacturer's acceptance on March 10 was communicated before the woman attempted to revoke her order, making this argument invalid.\n\n- **Option C**: This option suggests that the woman's order created a valid option contract. An option contract requires consideration to keep the offer open, but there is no indication that any such consideration was provided in this scenario.\n\n- **Option D**: This option states that the manufacturer's fax of March 10 constituted an acceptance of the woman's offer. Since the manufacturer's response included all necessary terms and conditions and was communicated before the woman's revocation attempt, it qualifies as a valid acceptance.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe correct answer is **D**. The manufacturer's fax of March 10 constituted an acceptance of the woman's offer, thereby creating an enforceable contract between the two parties."
