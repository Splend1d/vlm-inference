The Nicaragua case is particularly relevant here because it involved significant discussions about the definition of an armed attack under international law.\n\nIn the 1986 case of *Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. United States)*, the ICJ did address the concept of an armed attack. The court ruled that an armed attack must be a \"substantial operation\" and that the accumulation of smaller incidents does not necessarily constitute an armed attack. This ruling effectively dismissed the accumulation theory.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate statement based on the ICJ's ruling in the Nicaragua case is:\n\n**C. In the Nicaragua case the ICJ dismissed the accumulation theory**\n\nThis option correctly reflects the ICJ's position on the matter."
