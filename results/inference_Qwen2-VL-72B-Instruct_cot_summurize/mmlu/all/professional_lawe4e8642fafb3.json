As a result, the husband drove to his friend's house with a loaded shotgun. Believing that his friend was in an upstairs bedroom, the husband fired the shotgun through the dining room window, as he only wanted to teach him a lesson. Unbeknownst to the husband, his friend's wife was in the dining room and suffered a minor gunshot wound. The husband should be found\n\nA. guilty of attempted murder of his friend's wife only.\nB. guilty of attempted murder of his friend only.\nC. guilty of attempted murder of both his friend and his friend's wife.\nD. not guilty of attempted murder of either his friend or his friend's wife.\n"

                    "text": "To determine the appropriate charge for the husband, we need to consider the elements of attempted murder and the specific circumstances described.\n\n1. **Intent**: Attempted murder requires intent to kill. The husband intended to harm his friend, not his friend's wife. His intention was directed towards his friend, whom he believed was in the upstairs bedroom.\n\n2. **Target**: The husband fired the shotgun at what he believed was the location of his friend, not his friend's wife. The fact that his friend's wife was injured is incidental and not part of his original intent.\n\n3. **Legal Principle**: In criminal law, the principle of \"transferred intent\" applies when someone intends to harm one person but accidentally harms another. However, this principle typically applies to completed crimes (like murder) rather than attempts.\n\nGiven these considerations:\n\n- The husband did not have the intent to kill his friend's wife; therefore, he cannot be charged with attempted murder of his friend's wife.\n- He had the intent to harm his friend, so he can be charged with attempted murder of his friend.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\n**B. guilty of attempted murder of his friend only.**"
