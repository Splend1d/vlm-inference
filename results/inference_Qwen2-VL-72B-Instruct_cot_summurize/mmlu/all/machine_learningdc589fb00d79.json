Other factors such as the complexity of the model, the choice of kernel, and the specific characteristics of the test data can influence performance.\n- Therefore, the statement is true because the margins alone do not provide enough information to predict which classifier will perform better on the test set.\n\n### Statement 2:\n\"The activation function of BERT is the GELU.\"\n\n**Analysis:**\n- BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) uses the GELU (Gaussian Error Linear Unit) as its activation function.\n- This is well-documented in the original BERT paper and subsequent literature on transformer models.\n\nTherefore, this statement is also true.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBoth statements are true.\n\nThe correct answer is **A. True, True**."
