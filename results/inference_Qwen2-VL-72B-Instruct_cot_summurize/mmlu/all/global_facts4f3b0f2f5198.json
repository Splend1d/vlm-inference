However, it's important to note that economic performance varies significantly across the region, and not all countries have seen the same level of growth. The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is an example of a country that has faced significant economic challenges and has struggled with poverty and instability. Therefore, option D is also partially correct, but option C is more broadly accurate regarding the overall trend of growth in the region."
