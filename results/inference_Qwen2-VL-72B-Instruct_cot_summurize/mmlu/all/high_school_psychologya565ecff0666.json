This includes the acquisition of gender roles and identities. According to this theory, children observe and imitate the behaviors of significant role models, such as parents, siblings, and other influential figures in their environment, which contributes to the development of their gender identity.\n\nWhile options A, B, and D also play roles in the development of gender identity according to different theories (such as biological theories for A, psychoanalytic theories for B, and operant conditioning for D), social learning theory specifically highlights the importance of observational learning and imitation."
