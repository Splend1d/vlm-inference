This is because Mill's utilitarianism is based on the principle of \"the greatest happiness for the greatest number,\" which means that the rightness or wrongness of actions is determined by their consequences in terms of overall happiness and satisfaction. Therefore, if people desire something, it is considered desirable according to this framework."
