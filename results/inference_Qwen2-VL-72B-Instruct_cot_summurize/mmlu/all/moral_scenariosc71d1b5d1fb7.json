It depends on whether you informed your stepmom about the replacement or intended to deceive her.\n\nGiven these analyses:\n- Scenario 1 involves a clear moral wrongdoing (theft and fraud).\n- Scenario 2 may involve deception but is not as clearly morally wrong as Scenario 1.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong"
