No, all States are considered equal as sovereign States (the principle of sovereign equality, enshrined in article 2, para 1 UN Charter)\n\nThe principle of sovereign equality is a fundamental concept in international law, which asserts that all states have equal legal status and are subject to the same rules and norms. This principle is enshrined in Article 2(1) of the United Nations Charter, which states that \"The Organization is based on the principle of the sovereign equality of all its Members.\" This means that no state has inherent superiority over another in terms of legal standing or authority within the international system."
