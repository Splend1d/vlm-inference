This action decreases the money supply because banks will have less excess reserves to create new loans.\n\nTo calculate the potential change in the money supply, we use the money multiplier formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Money Multiplier} = \\frac{1}{\\text{Reserve Requirement}} \\]\n\nGiven a reserve requirement of 5%, or 0.05, the money multiplier is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Money Multiplier} = \\frac{1}{0.05} = 20 \\]\n\nThe change in the money supply is then calculated by multiplying the change in reserves by the money multiplier:\n\n\\[ \\text{Change in Money Supply} = \\text{Change in Reserves} \\times \\text{Money Multiplier} \\]\n\nSince the FED sold $10 million worth of securities, this action reduces reserves by $10 million. Therefore:\n\n\\[ \\text{Change in Money Supply} = -\\$10 \\text{ million} \\times 20 = -\\$200 \\text{ million} \\]\n\nThus, the money supply can potentially decrease by $200 million.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nB. decrease by $200 million."
