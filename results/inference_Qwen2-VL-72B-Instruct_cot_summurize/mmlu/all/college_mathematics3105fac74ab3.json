For example, the Dirichlet function (which is 1 on the rationals and 0 on the irrationals) is Lebesgue integrable but not Riemann integrable.\n- B. The existence of a countably infinite set where the function is non-differentiable does not contradict the properties of being bounded and Lebesgue integrable. For instance, the Weierstrass function is nowhere differentiable but is continuous (and hence bounded) and Lebesgue integrable over any finite interval.\n- C. Similarly, the existence of an uncountable subset where the function is non-differentiable also does not contradict the properties of being bounded and Lebesgue integrable. The Weierstrass function again serves as a counterexample since it is nowhere differentiable.\n- D. Since none of the statements A, B, or C must be true for a bounded, Lebesgue integrable function, the correct answer is D."
