To help administer the new statute Congress created a seven-member agency, four members of which were appointed by the President, two by the Senate, and one by the Speaker of the House. The agency was authorized to issue rules interpreting regulations prescribed under existing federal law. It was also authorized to issue \"cease and desist\" orders after hearings against private retail sellers of gasoline who \"intentionally engaged in price gouging. \" In this regard, violations of the cease and desist orders were made punishable by fine and/or imprisonment. Which of the following is the strongest constitutional argument against the authority of this agency?\n\nA. Congress may not delegate to the agency power to make interpretations of existing federal laws.\nB. Congress may not delegate to the agency power to make \"cease and desist\" orders, the violation of which is punishable by imprisonment.\nC. Congress may not delegate enforcement of a federal law in any governmental body other than the U. S. Attorney General or the courts.\nD. Congress may not retain the power to appoint even a minority of members of such an agency.\n"

Congress may not delegate to the agency power to make \"cease and desist\" orders, the violation of which is punishable by imprisonment.\n\nThis argument is based on the principle of separation of powers. Under the U.S. Constitution, the legislative branch (Congress) makes laws, the executive branch enforces them, and the judicial branch interprets them. The issuance of \"cease and desist\" orders that carry criminal penalties (fines and/or imprisonment) involves both executive and judicial functions. By delegating this power to an administrative agency, Congress might be seen as violating the separation of powers doctrine by blurring the lines between these branches. This argument is particularly strong because it directly challenges the constitutionality of the agency's ability to impose criminal sanctions, which is traditionally a function reserved for the judiciary."
