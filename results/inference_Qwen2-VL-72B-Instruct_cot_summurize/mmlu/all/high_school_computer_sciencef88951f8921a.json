The ability to provide data transmission even when some connections have failed\n\nThe fault-tolerant nature of routing on the Internet refers to its ability to continue functioning and transmitting data even if some parts of the network fail or become unavailable. This is achieved through various mechanisms, including redundant paths, dynamic routing protocols that can adapt to changes in network topology, and the distributed nature of the Internet infrastructure."
