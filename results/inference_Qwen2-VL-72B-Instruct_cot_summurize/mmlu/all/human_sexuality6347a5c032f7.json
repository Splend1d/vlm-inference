Declined for both men and women:\n- This would mean that the number of unmarried adults reporting multiple partners decreased for both genders during this period.\n\nB. Declined for men, but not for women:\n- This would mean that the number of unmarried men reporting multiple partners decreased, while the number for women did not change or increased.\n\nC. Declined for women, but not for men:\n- This would mean that the number of unmarried women reporting multiple partners decreased, while the number for men did not change or increased.\n\nD. Declined for men, and remained the same for women:\n- This would mean that the number of unmarried men reporting multiple partners decreased, while the number for women stayed the same.\n\nGiven the options, we need specific data or trends from 1988 to 1990 to accurately determine which one is correct. However, without access to detailed historical data on sexual behavior trends during those years, it is challenging to definitively choose an answer based solely on general knowledge.\n\nIf we assume that the trends were influenced by societal changes, public health campaigns, or other factors affecting sexual behavior during that time, we might consider broader trends observed in similar periods. For example, the AIDS epidemic was a significant factor influencing sexual behavior in the late 1980s and early 1990s, potentially leading to declines in risky behaviors such as having multiple partners.\n\nBased on this reasoning and assuming societal influences led to more cautious behavior:\n\nThe most plausible answer, given the context of public health awareness and potential behavioral changes due to the AIDS epidemic, could be:\n\n**A. Declined for both men and women**\n\nHowever, without specific data, this remains an educated guess rather than a definitive conclusion."
