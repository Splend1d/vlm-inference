At sentencing the court made additional factual findings, based on a preponderance of the evidence, that resulted in the addition of a 10-year enhancement to the sentence, which was over and above the maximum provided for by the jury's verdict. Defense counsel objected that the judge-made enhancement was unconstitutional and denied his right to a jury trial on that issue. Does counsel have a valid constitutional argument?\n\nA. No, sentencing laws widely authorize the sentencing court to engage in fact-finding that is based on a preponderance of the evidence.\nB. No, it has never been decided that a defendant has a right to be judged on proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\nC. Yes, judicial fact-finding that increases the maximum sentence over what the jury's verdict allows is unconstitutional.\nD. Yes, it is unconstitutional for a court to use its discretion to fashioning a defendant's sentence.\n"

Yes, judicial fact-finding that increases the maximum sentence over what the jury's verdict allows is unconstitutional.\n\nThis answer is based on the principle established by the United States Supreme Court in the case of Apprendi v. New Jersey (2000), where it was held that any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt. This ruling protects the defendant's Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial. Therefore, if the judge's findings result in an increased sentence beyond the maximum allowed by the jury's verdict, such findings would indeed be unconstitutional under this precedent."
