The elevator is moving upward and slowing down.\n\nWhen the scale reading is less than the person's usual weight, it indicates that the person is experiencing a net force downwards. This can happen when the elevator has an acceleration component in the downward direction. \n\n- If the elevator is moving upward and slowing down (decelerating), it has a downward acceleration, which would cause the scale to read less than the person's usual weight.\n- If the elevator were moving downward and slowing down (accelerating upwards), the scale would read more than the person's usual weight because there would be an upward acceleration.\n- If the elevator were moving at a constant speed in either direction, there would be no acceleration, and the scale would read the person's usual weight.\n\nTherefore, the only option that matches the scenario described is:\n\nB. It is moving upward and slowing down."
