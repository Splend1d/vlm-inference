Ask them to hold their breath at the end of the inspiration on using the inhaler.\n\nTo ensure that a large proportion of the drug reaches the lower airways when teaching a patient inhaler technique, it is important to instruct them to hold their breath for about 10 seconds after inhaling the medication. This allows the medication to settle deeper into the lungs and increases the likelihood of it reaching the lower airways where it can be most effective."
