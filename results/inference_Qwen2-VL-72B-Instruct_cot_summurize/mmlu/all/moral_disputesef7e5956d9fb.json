Imposing on them the lasting effects of historical crimes: Pogge argues that the current global order perpetuates injustices rooted in historical colonialism and exploitation. Affluent nations benefit from this historical legacy at the expense of poorer nations.\n\nB. Keeping them below welfare in the state-of-nature: Pogge suggests that the global economic system is structured in such a way that it keeps many people in poverty, even though they would be better off under a hypothetical state of nature (a pre-societal condition where everyone has equal access to resources).\n\nGiven these points, both options A and B accurately reflect aspects of Pogge's argument about how affluent citizens harm the poor.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC.
