Interest rates will remain relatively constant.\n\nWhen both expansionary fiscal and expansionary monetary policies are used simultaneously, the goal is often to stimulate economic growth by increasing aggregate demand. Expansionary fiscal policy involves increasing government spending or reducing taxes, which increases disposable income and encourages consumption and investment. Expansionary monetary policy, on the other hand, involves actions such as lowering interest rates or increasing the money supply, which makes borrowing cheaper and encourages more spending and investment.\n\nThe combination of these two policies can lead to an increase in aggregate demand, which may result in higher output (real GDP), lower unemployment, and potentially higher inflation. However, it does not necessarily mean that interest rates will remain constant; in fact, if the economy overheats due to excessive demand, central banks might need to raise interest rates to cool down the economy and control inflation. But in the context of the question, the focus is on the immediate effects of the combined policies, and the most accurate statement among the options provided is that interest rates will remain relatively constant, assuming the central bank aims to maintain low rates to support the expansionary policies."
