This implies that the cost of producing plastic army figures would remain relatively stable even if the industry's output were to increase or decrease.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate conclusion based on the provided information is:\n\n**B. constant-cost industry**\n\nThis choice aligns with the idea that the industry's reliance on a small fraction of the total plastic demand means its costs are unlikely to fluctuate significantly with changes in output."
