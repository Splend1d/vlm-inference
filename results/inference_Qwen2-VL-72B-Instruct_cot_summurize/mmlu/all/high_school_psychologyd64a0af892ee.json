Intrinsic motivation\n\nIntrinsic motivation refers to the internal drive or interest in performing an activity for its own sake, rather than for external rewards or pressures. This type of motivation is often associated with positive behaviors that persist over long periods of time because it is driven by personal satisfaction, enjoyment, and a sense of accomplishment.\n\nWhile primary drives (such as hunger or thirst) and secondary drives (such as the desire for social acceptance or status) can also motivate behavior, they may not be as sustainable over time as intrinsic motivation. Similarly, achievement motivation, which is the desire to succeed and excel in one's endeavors, can be a powerful motivator but may not always lead to positive behaviors if it is driven by external factors such as competition or fear of failure.\n\nTherefore, intrinsic motivation is generally considered the most effective type of motivation for encouraging positive behaviors to persist over long periods of time."
