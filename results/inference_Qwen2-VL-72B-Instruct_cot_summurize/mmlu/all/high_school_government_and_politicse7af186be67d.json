Tenth Amendment to the Constitution\n\nAmerican federalism refers to the division of power between the national (federal) government and the state governments. The Tenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution explicitly addresses this by stating that powers not delegated to the federal government nor prohibited to the states are reserved to the states or to the people. This amendment is a key example of how federalism operates in the United States, as it underscores the principle that the states retain certain sovereign powers."
