The shape is approximately normal with a mean of 210 and a standard deviation of 3.75.\n\nAccording to the Central Limit Theorem, the sampling distribution of the sample means will be approximately normally distributed when the sample size is sufficiently large, regardless of the shape of the population distribution. In this case, the sample size is 16, which is generally considered large enough for the Central Limit Theorem to apply. Therefore, the sampling distribution of the sample means will be approximately normal with a mean equal to the population mean (210 mg/dL) and a standard deviation equal to the population standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size (15 mg/dL / \u221a16 = 3.75 mg/dL)."
