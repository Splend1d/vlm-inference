The door opened at 6 a.m. and hundreds of people rushed the entrance for a chance at a hugely discounted holiday gift. When defendant saw that there was a signed copy of a book written by his mother's favorite author, he jumped towards it, only to be blocked by a little old lady with a baseball bat. She was using the bat as a blocking tool, but he was determined to get the book, so he deliberately stuck his leg out in front of her and tripped her. She fell hard and in the process ended up with a blood clot in her leg, which traveled to her heart over a period of weeks, and ultimately caused her death. What crime can the defendant likely be convicted of?\n\nA. First degree murder\nB. Second degree murder\nC. Involuntary manslaughter\nD. voluntary manslaughter\n"

Let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **First degree murder** typically requires premeditation, deliberation, and intent to kill. In this case, the defendant did not have the intention to kill the little old lady; the primary goal was to obtain the book.\n\nB. **Second degree murder** usually involves a killing that is done impulsively or recklessly, without premeditation but with malice aforethought (a general intent to harm). While the defendant acted recklessly by tripping the lady, the intent was to get the book, not to harm her seriously or cause her death.\n\nC. **Involuntary manslaughter** occurs when someone causes the death of another person through reckless behavior or negligence, without any intent to kill. Here, the defendant\u2019s action of tripping the lady was reckless, leading to her death indirectly due to the resulting injury.\n\nD. **Voluntary manslaughter** typically involves a killing committed in the heat of passion or during a sudden quarrel. This does not seem to fit the situation, as the defendant\u2019s actions were not provoked by anger or a quarrel but rather by a desire to reach the book first.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most appropriate charge would be:\n\n**C. Involuntary manslaughter**\n\nThis charge reflects the defendant's reckless behavior that unintentionally resulted in the death of the little old lady."
