The eight major food allergens are:\n\n1. Milk\n2. Eggs\n3. Peanuts\n4. Tree nuts (such as almonds, walnuts, cashews)\n5. Wheat\n6. Soy\n7. Fish\n8. Shellfish (including crustaceans like shrimp and lobster)\n\nNow let's analyze each option:\n\nA. Cow's milk, egg - Both cow's milk and eggs are among the eight major allergens.\n\nB. Mustard seeds, lamb - Mustard seeds are not considered one of the eight major allergens, while lamb is also not on the list.\n\nC. Soy, peanuts - Both soy and peanuts are among the eight major allergens.\n\nD. Fish, shellfish - Both fish and shellfish are among the eight major allergens.\n\nThe correct answer is B. Mustard seeds, lamb, because mustard seeds are not part of the group of eight major allergens."
