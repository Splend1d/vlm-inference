Without meaning to say that the foreigners harbor such destructive intentions in their hearts, we yet positively assert that from their inordinate thirst after gain, they are perfectly careless about the injuries they inflict upon us! And such being the case, we should like to ask what has become of that conscience which heaven has implanted in the breasts of all men? We have heard that in your own country opium is prohibited with the utmost strictness and severity. This is a strong proof that you know full well how hurtful it is to mankind. Since you do not permit it to injure your own country, you ought not to have this injurious drug transferred to another country, and above all others, how much less to the Inner Land! Of the products which China exports to your foreign countries, there is not one which is not beneficial to mankind in some shape or other.\nLin Zexu, Chinese trade commissioner, letter to Queen Victoria, 1839\nWhich of the following background facts persuaded Europeans to engage in the actions described in the passage?\n\nA. China had recently placed an embargo on exports of silk.\nB. The price of Chinese tea had risen higher than European buyers found acceptable.\nC. China refused to allow a meaningful volume of European goods to be sold there.\nD. China's emperor had repeatedly insulted the British ambassador.\n"

                    "text": "To determine which background fact persuaded Europeans to engage in the actions described in the passage, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **China had recently placed an embargo on exports of silk.**\n   - This option suggests a restriction on silk exports, but the passage focuses on the importation of opium rather than the export of silk. Therefore, this does not directly relate to the actions described.\n\nB. **The price of Chinese tea had risen higher than European buyers found acceptable.**\n   - While this might have been a factor affecting trade, the passage specifically addresses the issue of opium, not the price of tea. Thus, this option is not directly relevant to the actions described.\n\nC. **China refused to allow a meaningful volume of European goods to be sold there.**\n   - This option indicates a significant trade imbalance where European goods were not allowed into China in substantial quantities. This would create a situation where Europeans sought alternative ways to balance trade, potentially leading to the introduction of opium as a commodity to sell in China. This aligns well with the context of the passage.\n\nD. **China's emperor had repeatedly insulted the British ambassador.**\n   - Diplomatic insults might have strained relations, but they do not directly explain the economic motivations behind the actions described in the passage regarding opium trade.\n\nGiven the analysis, the most plausible background fact that persuaded Europeans to engage in the actions described in the passage is:\n\n**C. China refused to allow a meaningful volume of European goods to be sold there.**"
