                    "text": "To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the context provided by the Port Huron Statement and the historical period it references.\n\nThe Port Huron Statement was written in 1962 by Tom Hayden and others, and it reflects the sentiments and concerns of young Americans during the early 1960s. The statement addresses issues such as civil rights, the Cold War, and the desire for social change. It was a foundational document for the Students for a Democratic Society (SDS), an influential student activist group during the 1960s.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. **Rapid industrialization, urban growth and congestion, and corporate consolidation.**\n   - While these factors were significant during the post-World War II era, they do not directly address the specific concerns and motivations of the SDS and the broader student activism movement of the 1960s.\n\nB. **The baby boom, economic growth, and a rapid expansion of higher education.**\n   - This option aligns well with the context of the 1960s. The baby boom led to a large cohort of young people entering college, and the expansion of higher education provided a platform for activism and intellectual engagement. Economic growth also contributed to the resources available for activism.\n\nC. **Economic polarization, supply-side economic policies, and the disappearance of the middle class.**\n   - These trends became more prominent in the late 1970s and 1980s, particularly under the Reagan administration. They do not fit the early 1960s context described in the Port Huron Statement.\n\nD. **The proliferation of personal computer technologies, the rise of Christian fundamentalism, and an increase in student apathy.**\n   - Personal computers became widespread in the 1980s and beyond, and while Christian fundamentalism did grow in the late 20th century, it does not directly relate to the early 1960s activism. Student apathy is also not consistent with the active and engaged nature of the SDS.\n\nGiven this analysis, the best answer is:\n\n**B. The baby boom, economic growth, and a rapid expansion of higher education.**\n\nThese factors provided the demographic, economic, and institutional conditions that facilitated the growth of student activism and organizations like the SDS during the 1960s."
