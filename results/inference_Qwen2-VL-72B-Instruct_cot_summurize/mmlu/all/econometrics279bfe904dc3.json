(i), (ii), (iii), and (iv).\n\nHere's why:\n\n(i) The Box-Jenkins approach does indeed help determine if the model is either too large (overfitting) or too small (underfitting). This is done by examining the residuals from the fitted model.\n\n(ii) Diagnostic testing in the Box-Jenkins approach involves checking the model residuals for several properties, including autocorrelation (using the autocorrelation function, ACF), heteroscedasticity (variance changes over time), and non-normality (deviation from normal distribution).\n\n(iii) If the model suggested at the identification stage is appropriate, the autocorrelation function (ACF) and partial autocorrelation function (PACF) for the residuals should not show any significant patterns or structures, indicating that the model has captured all relevant information in the data.\n\n(iv) Under the overfitting approach, if the model suggested at the identification stage is appropriate, adding extra terms to the model should result in coefficients on these additional variables being statistically insignificant, as they do not contribute new information beyond what is already captured by the initial model.\n\nTherefore, all statements (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv) are true concerning the Box-Jenkins approach to diagnostic testing for ARMA models."
