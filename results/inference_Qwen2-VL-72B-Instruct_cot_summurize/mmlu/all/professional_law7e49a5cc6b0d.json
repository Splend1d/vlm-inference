The hospital negligently misidentified the husband's body and sent it to be cremated. When she was informed of the hospital's mistake, the widow suffered serious emotional distress. She has sued the hospital. Is the hospital likely to be held liable to the widow?\n\nA. No, because the widow did not witness the cremation.\nB. No, because the widow was never in any danger of bodily harm.\nC. Yes, because hospitals are strictly liable if they do not properly dispose of corpses.\nD. Yes, because the negligent handling of the husband's body was especially likely to cause his widow serious emotional distress. \u0080\u0083\n"

Yes, because the negligent handling of the husband's body was especially likely to cause his widow serious emotional distress.\n\nIn this scenario, the hospital's negligence in misidentifying and improperly disposing of the husband's body could lead to liability for causing the widow serious emotional distress. This type of harm is recognized in many jurisdictions as a basis for legal action, even if there was no direct physical harm to the widow herself. The emotional distress caused by such a significant error can be substantial and legally actionable."
