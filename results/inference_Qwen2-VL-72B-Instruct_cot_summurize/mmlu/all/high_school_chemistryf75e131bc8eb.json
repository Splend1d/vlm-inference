Electronegativity generally increases from left to right within a period.\n2. Electronegativity generally decreases from top to bottom within a group.\n\nLet's analyze each pair:\n\nA. Oxygen (O) and Chromium (Cr)\n- Oxygen is in Group 16 and Period 2.\n- Chromium is in Group 4 and Period 4.\n- Oxygen is higher up and further to the right than Chromium, so Oxygen has a higher electronegativity.\n\nB. Chlorine (Cl) and Iodine (I)\n- Chlorine is in Group 17 and Period 3.\n- Iodine is in Group 17 and Period 5.\n- Both are in the same group, but Chlorine is higher up, so Chlorine has a higher electronegativity.\n\nC. Calcium (Ca) and Cesium (Cs)\n- Calcium is in Group 2 and Period 4.\n- Cesium is in Group 1 and Period 6.\n- Calcium is higher up and further to the right than Cesium, so Calcium has a higher electronegativity.\n\nD. Sulfur (S) and Nitrogen (N)\n- Sulfur is in Group 16 and Period 3.\n- Nitrogen is in Group 15 and Period 2.\n- Nitrogen is higher up and further to the right than Sulfur, so Nitrogen has a higher electronegativity.\n\nBased on this analysis, the pair where the second element has the larger electronegativity is:\n\nD. Sulfur, nitrogen"
