This is because if \\(a \\notin H\\), then \\(aH\\) will not contain the identity element of \\(G\\) (since multiplying any element of \\(H\\) by \\(a\\) will not yield the identity unless \\(a\\) itself is the identity).\n\nThus, **Statement 1** is **True**.\n\n### Statement 2:\n\"If H is a subgroup of G and a and b belong to G then aH = bH if and only if ab is in H.\"\n\n**Analysis:**\n- The equality of two left cosets \\(aH = bH\\) implies that there exists an element \\(h \\in H\\) such that \\(ah = bh\\), which simplifies to \\(a = bh^{-1}\\) or equivalently \\(b = ah^{-1}\\).\n- This means that \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the same left coset of \\(H\\), but this does not directly imply that their product \\(ab\\) is in \\(H\\).\n- The correct condition for \\(aH = bH\\) is actually that \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are related by an element of \\(H\\), i.e., \\(a = bh\\) for some \\(h \\in H\\), which does not necessarily mean \\(ab \\in H\\).\n\nThus, **Statement 2** is **False**.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe correct answer is **C. True, False**."
