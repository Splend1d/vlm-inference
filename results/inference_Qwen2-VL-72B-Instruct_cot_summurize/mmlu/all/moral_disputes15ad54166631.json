                    "text": "The case discussed by Frances Kamm involves a scientist who is motivated by a \"bad\" desire (in this context, the desire for mastery) to find a cure for congenital blindness. The key point here is to understand whether the motivation behind an action affects its moral permissibility.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Sometimes an action can be permissible even if it is motivated by a bad desire.\n- This option suggests that the morality of an action can be independent of the motivation behind it. If the scientist's work leads to a cure despite being motivated by a bad desire, the action might still be considered permissible.\n\nB. All actions motivated by bad desires are impermissible.\n- This option contradicts the idea that the outcome or nature of the action itself could be morally good regardless of the motivation.\n\nC. The desire for mastery is not, as Sandel argues, a bad desire.\n- This option addresses the nature of the desire itself rather than the permissibility of the action. It shifts focus from the ethical evaluation of the action to debating the classification of the desire.\n\nD. Sometimes the only way to cure a disease is through selfish desires.\n- This option implies that certain outcomes can only be achieved through specific motivations, which is not necessarily what Kamm is arguing. Her point is more about the permissibility of actions regardless of motivation.\n\nGiven the context provided by Kamm's discussion, the most fitting interpretation is:\n\n**A. Sometimes an action can be permissible even if it is motivated by a bad desire.**\n\nThis aligns with the idea that the scientist's work, though motivated by a bad desire, could still result in a morally permissible outcome (finding a cure)."
