By comparing the maximum altitude of the Sun in two cities at different latitudes at the same time on the same day.\n\nEratosthenes estimated the size of the Earth by using the difference in the angle of the Sun's rays at two different locations: Alexandria and Syene (modern-day Aswan, Egypt). He knew that at noon on the summer solstice, the Sun shone directly into a well in Syene, indicating that it was directly overhead. In Alexandria, on the same day at the same time, he measured the angle of the Sun's rays by observing the shadow cast by a vertical stick. The difference in these angles allowed him to calculate the angular difference between the two cities. Knowing the distance between Alexandria and Syene, he could then estimate the circumference of the Earth."
