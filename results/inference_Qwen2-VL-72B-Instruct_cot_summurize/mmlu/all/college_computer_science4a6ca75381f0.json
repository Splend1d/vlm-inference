While they can display realistic lighting and shading and allow for fast hardware manipulation of pixel blocks, they do not inherently ensure that all line segments will appear perfectly straight. This is because the edges of lines in bitmap graphics can appear jagged or aliased, especially when viewed at certain sizes or angles, unless anti-aliasing techniques are applied."
