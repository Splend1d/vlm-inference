For a full-face image, the mirror must reflect the entire vertical span of your face.\n\n2. **Mirror Requirement**: To see your full face, the mirror must be at least as tall as your face. This means the clear portion of the mirror (the part not covered by steam) must also be at least as tall as your face.\n\n3. **Minimum Clear Area**: Since the mirror needs to be as tall as your face for you to see your full face, the minimum height of the patch that needs to be wiped away should be equal to the height of your face.\n\nGiven these points, the correct answer is:\n\n**C. the same.**\n\nThis means the minimum height of the patch to wipe away should be the same as the height of your face."
