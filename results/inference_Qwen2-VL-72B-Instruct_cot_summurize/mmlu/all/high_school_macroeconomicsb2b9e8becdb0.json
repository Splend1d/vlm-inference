                    "text": "To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the given information step by step:\n\n1. **Technology makes production less expensive**: This implies that the cost of producing goods and services decreases. As a result, producers can potentially produce more output at lower costs.\n\n2. **Exports decrease**: When exports decrease, it means that there is less demand for domestically produced goods from foreign buyers. This could lead to a surplus of goods in the domestic market if domestic demand does not compensate for the reduced export demand.\n\nGiven these points, let's evaluate each option:\n\n**A. Real GDP will increase.**\n- Real GDP measures the total value of all final goods and services produced within an economy in a given period, adjusted for inflation. If production becomes cheaper due to technological advancements, it might initially seem like real GDP would increase because producers can produce more. However, the decrease in exports means that there is less demand for these goods from abroad. Without sufficient domestic demand to offset this reduction, the overall production may not necessarily increase, and thus real GDP may not necessarily increase.\n\n**B. Real GDP will decrease.**\n- If exports decrease significantly and domestic demand does not rise enough to absorb the excess supply, the overall production and sales within the country might fall. This could lead to a decrease in real GDP.\n\n**C. The price level will increase.**\n- If production costs decrease due to technological advancements, one might expect prices to fall as producers can afford to sell their products at lower prices. However, if exports decrease and there is a surplus of goods, producers might also reduce prices to clear inventory. Therefore, the price level is likely to decrease rather than increase.\n\n**D. The price level will decrease.**\n- With decreased production costs and a potential surplus due to reduced exports, producers are likely to lower prices to sell their goods. This would lead to a decrease in the price level.\n\nBased on the analysis, the most certain outcome given the conditions described is:\n\n**Final Answer: D. The price level will decrease.**"
