It aligns with what might be expected from a developed country like Australia.\n\n3. **Option C: $12 billion annual Revenue**\n   - While this is possible, it seems high for a single category of consumer electronics in a single country over one year.\n\n4. **Option D: $120 billion annual Revenue**\n   - This is extremely high and unrealistic for the sale of flat screen televisions alone in any single country within a year.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most reasonable and realistic option is:\n\n**B. $1.2 billion annual Revenue**"
