                    "text": "To determine whether the action was properly removed to federal court, we need to consider several factors related to jurisdiction and the rules governing removal.\n\n1. **Timeliness of Removal**: According to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1446(b), a defendant must file a notice of removal within 30 days after receiving a copy of the initial pleading setting forth the claim for relief. In this case, the retailer filed the notice of removal 20 days after being served, which is within the 30-day period. Therefore, the removal was timely.\n\n2. **Diversity Jurisdiction**: For a case to be removed to federal court based on diversity jurisdiction, the following conditions must be met:\n   - The parties must be completely diverse (i.e., no plaintiff can share citizenship with any defendant).\n   - The amount in controversy must exceed $75,000.\n\nIn this scenario:\n- The plaintiff is a citizen of State A.\n- The retailer is incorporated in State C and has its principal place of business in State B. Under the law, a corporation is considered a citizen of both its state of incorporation and its principal place of business. Thus, the retailer is a citizen of both State B and State C.\n- The amount in controversy is $100,000, which exceeds the $75,000 threshold.\n\nGiven these points:\n\n- **Option A** (\"No, because the notice of removal was not timely filed.\") is incorrect since the notice was filed within the required 30-day period.\n- **Option B** (\"No, because the retailer is a citizen of State B.\") is incorrect because the retailer's citizenship in State B does not preclude diversity jurisdiction if the plaintiff is from a different state.\n- **Option C** (\"Yes, because the parties are citizens of different states and more than $75,000 is in controversy.\") is correct. The plaintiff is from State A, and the retailer is from States B and C, satisfying complete diversity. The amount in controversy also meets the requirement.\n- **Option D** (\"Yes, because the retailer is a citizen of both State B and State C.\") is partially correct but not the most accurate answer because it focuses only on the retailer's citizenship without addressing the plaintiff's citizenship or the amount in controversy.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer is:\n\n**C. Yes, because the parties are citizens of different states and more than $75,000 is in controversy.**"
