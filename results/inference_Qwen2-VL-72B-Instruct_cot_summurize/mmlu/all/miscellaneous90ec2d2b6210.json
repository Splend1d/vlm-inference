The base consists of 4 sides (since it is a square).\n3. Each side of the square base is connected to a single apex (the top point of the pyramid) by triangular faces.\n\nSince there are 4 sides on the base and each side connects to the apex with a triangular face, there are 4 triangular faces in addition to the square base.\n\nTherefore, the total number of sides (including the base) is:\n- 4 sides from the triangular faces\n- 1 side from the square base\n\nAdding these together gives us:\n\\[ 4 + 1 = 5 \\]\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nC. five"
