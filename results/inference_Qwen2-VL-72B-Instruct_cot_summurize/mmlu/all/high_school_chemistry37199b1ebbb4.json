In this case, acetic acid (HC2H3O2) is a weak acid, and potassium acetate (KC2H3O2) provides the acetate ion (C2H3O2-), which is the conjugate base of acetic acid. This combination can effectively resist changes in pH when small amounts of acid or base are added, making it a suitable buffer solution."
