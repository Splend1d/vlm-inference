For every 4 DVD players sold, 1 home entertainment system is sold. Therefore, we can calculate the weighted average contribution margin per set of 5 units (4 DVD players + 1 home entertainment system).\n\nWeighted Average Contribution Margin per Set:\n(4 * $40) + ($140) = $160 + $140 = $300\n\nNow, we can calculate the break-even point in terms of sets of 5 units:\n\nBreak-Even Point (in Sets):\nFixed Costs / Weighted Average Contribution Margin per Set\n$90,000 / $300 = 300 sets\n\nSince each set consists of 4 DVD players, we multiply the number of sets by 4 to find the total number of DVD players needed to break even:\n\nTotal DVD Players Needed to Break Even:\n300 sets * 4 DVD players/set = 1200 DVD players\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. 1200."
