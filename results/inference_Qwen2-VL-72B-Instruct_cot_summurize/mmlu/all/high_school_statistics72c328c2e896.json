Option II if it wants to maximize expected return:**\n- Option II has the highest expected return ($30,000).\n\n**B. Option I if it needs at least $20,000 to pay off an overdue loan:**\n- Option I guarantees $25,000, which is more than enough to cover the $20,000 loan.\n\n**C. Option III if it needs at least $80,000 to pay off an overdue loan:**\n- Option III has a very low probability (5%) of achieving $100,000, which is the only way to meet or exceed the $80,000 requirement. This is a high-risk strategy with a low chance of success.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- **Option A** is correct because Option II maximizes the expected return.\n- **Option B** is correct because Option I provides a guaranteed amount that exceeds the minimum required to pay off the loan.\n- **Option C** is not correct because Option III has a very low probability of meeting the high financial need.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**D. All of the above answers are correct.** (except for Option C, which is not correct)."
