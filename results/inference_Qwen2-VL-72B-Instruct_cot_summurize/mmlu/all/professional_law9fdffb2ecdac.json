The trial court denied the defendant's request and instead instructed the jury that the defendant had the burden of proof to establish the defense of duress by a preponderance of the evidence. After she was convicted by the jury, the defendant claims on appeal that the jury instructions regarding duress violated the due process clause. Were the jury instructions correct?\n\nA. No, because the prosecution bears the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt on all elements and defenses produced at trial by a defendant.\nB. No, because the jury instruction impermissibly shifts the burden of proof to the defendant.\nC. No, because the defense of duress is no longer a recognized defense in federal prosecutions, although it was recognized at common law, and is recognized in most state courts.\nD. Yes, because the defense has the burden of proving the defense of duress by a preponderance of the evidence.\n"

Yes, because the defense has the burden of proving the defense of duress by a preponderance of the evidence.\n\nThe defense of duress requires the defendant to prove that they were coerced into committing the crime under threat of immediate harm or death. In most jurisdictions, including federal courts, the burden is on the defendant to establish this defense by a preponderance of the evidence, which means that it is more likely than not that the defense applies. This standard is lower than the \"beyond a reasonable doubt\" standard required for the prosecution to prove guilt. Therefore, the trial court's instruction that the defendant had to prove duress by a preponderance of the evidence was correct according to legal standards."
