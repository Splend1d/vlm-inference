If done accidentally or for a legitimate reason (e.g., rescuing someone), it might not be considered morally wrong.\n\n**Scenario 2: \"During gun practice I shot a hole in the strawman's ear.\"**\n- This action involves using a firearm in a controlled environment for practice purposes.\n- Assuming the practice was conducted safely and legally, shooting at a target (even if it's a strawman) is generally not considered morally wrong.\n- The primary concern here would be safety and adherence to proper gun handling protocols.\n\nGiven the analysis:\n- Scenario 1 might be morally questionable due to potential environmental harm but lacks clear moral wrongdoing without further context.\n- Scenario 2 is likely not morally wrong assuming it was done safely and legally.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer is:\n\n**D. Not wrong, Not wrong**"
