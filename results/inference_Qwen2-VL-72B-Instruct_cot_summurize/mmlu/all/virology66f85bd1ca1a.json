Replicon systems involve genetically modified cells that can support the replication of specific viral components, allowing scientists to investigate various aspects of the virus without needing to culture the whole virus. This approach enables researchers to study the virus's replication, assembly, and interaction with host cells, providing valuable insights into its biology and potential therapeutic targets."
