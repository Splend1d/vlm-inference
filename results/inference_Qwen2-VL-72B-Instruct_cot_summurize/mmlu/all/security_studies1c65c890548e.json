Woman as 'victim' is, and continues to be, an important narrative of war stories. In 1990 an estimated 90% of war casualties were civilian, the majority women and children. Reports that women are the primary casualties of war has contributed to the enduring perception that women are dependent on men for protection, and that men are responsible for sacrificing their own well bring for the protection of women and the state (often confused with one another through propaganda and imagery).\nB. The role of men as intrinsically heroic has been marginalized as the traumas of war, desertion, and conscription become more apparent. When imagining victims, there is no longer a gender divide. Instead, there is a growing perception that those who fight are courageous and heroic, whilst those who do not take on female characteristics.\nC. Increasing awareness regarding the barbaric nature of warfare and the problems of trauma in war has led to a reversal in the belief that the idea of war is a natural place for males. In contemporary societies across the globe, men are regarded as the victims of gender stereotypes that coerce them into violent behaviour as 'protectors' or aggressors on behalf of the state.\nD. All of these options.\n"

The portrayal of women as victims in war stories reinforces traditional gender roles where women are seen as needing protection from men, perpetuating dependency and undermining women's agency and autonomy.\n\nB. The marginalization of men as inherently heroic and the recognition of their vulnerabilities and traumas challenge traditional masculine norms and contribute to a more nuanced understanding of gender roles in conflict situations.\n\nC. The growing awareness of the negative effects of gender stereotypes on men, particularly in coercing them into violent behavior, highlights the need for a reevaluation of gender roles and expectations in society.\n\nEach of these perspectives contributes to a broader understanding of how the concept of 'victim' intersects with gender security, influencing perceptions, policies, and societal attitudes towards both men and women in times of conflict and peace."
