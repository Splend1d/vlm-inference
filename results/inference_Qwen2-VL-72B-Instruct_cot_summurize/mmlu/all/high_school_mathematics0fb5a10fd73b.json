The quadratic equation associated with the given inequality is:\n\n\\[x^2 - 6x + c = 0\\]\n\nThe discriminant $\\Delta$ of this equation is given by:\n\n\\[\\Delta = b^2 - 4ac\\]\n\nwhere $a = 1$, $b = -6$, and $c$ is the constant term. Substituting these values into the formula gives:\n\n\\[\\Delta = (-6)^2 - 4(1)(c) = 36 - 4c\\]\n\nFor the quadratic equation to have real solutions, the discriminant must be greater than zero:\n\n\\[36 - 4c > 0\\]\n\nSolving for $c$:\n\n\\[36 > 4c\\]\n\\[9 > c\\]\n\nTherefore, $c$ must be less than 9 for the inequality $x^2 - 6x + c < 0$ to have real solutions. Since $c$ must also be positive, the correct interval for $c$ is $(0, 9)$.\n\nSo, the correct answer is A. (0, 9)."
