The receiver is put in a position where they cannot satisfy both demands simultaneously, leading to confusion, frustration, or distress.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. A father tells his son, \u201cI sure hope you can come to the movies with us tonight,\u201d when his tone and posture show he does not hope so.\n- This is a clear example of a double-bind message because the verbal message (hoping the son comes) contradicts the non-verbal cues (tone and posture indicating he doesn't hope so). The son is left confused about whether the father truly wants him to come.\n\nB. A mother tells her daughter, \u201cGood move,\u201d when the daughter drops and breaks a dinner plate.\n- This is not a double-bind message. It is simply an ironic statement, as \"good move\" is used sarcastically to comment on an unfortunate event.\n\nC. A teacher tells a student, \u201cYou can do that if you want to, but you'll get into trouble.\u201d\n- This is not a double-bind message. It clearly communicates that there will be consequences if the student chooses to do something, without presenting contradictory demands.\n\nD. A teacher tells a student, \u201cYou can do that if you want to, but I would appreciate it if you would not.\u201d\n- This is not a double-bind message either. It expresses a preference without creating a contradictory demand. The teacher is stating that while the student has the choice to do something, the teacher would prefer they did not.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. A father tells his son, \u201cI sure hope you can come to the movies with us tonight,\u201d when his tone and posture show he does not hope so."
