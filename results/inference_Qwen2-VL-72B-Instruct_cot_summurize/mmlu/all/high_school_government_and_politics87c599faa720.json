While this might be true in some cases due to perceived inevitability or lack of competitive interest, it is not universally accurate. Voter turnout can also increase if the front-runner mobilizes their supporters.\n\nB. **White-collar workers are more likely to vote than are blue-collar workers, with the exception of blue-collar workers who belong to unions.**\n   - This statement aligns with research showing that higher socioeconomic status (often associated with white-collar jobs) correlates with higher voter turnout. Union membership can also increase political engagement and turnout among blue-collar workers.\n\nC. **Voters who are registered as independent are less likely to vote than those who are registered Democrats or Republicans.**\n   - This statement is generally supported by data indicating that party affiliation can motivate individuals to vote, as registered members of major parties often have stronger partisan ties and are more likely to participate in elections.\n\nD. **There is no difference in the likelihood of voting among those with undergraduate degrees and those with postgraduate degrees.**\n   - This statement is likely false. Research typically shows that higher levels of education correlate with higher voter turnout. Therefore, individuals with postgraduate degrees are generally more likely to vote compared to those with only undergraduate degrees.\n\nBased on this analysis, the statement that is most likely false is:\n\n**D. There is no difference in the likelihood of voting among those with undergraduate degrees and those with postgraduate degrees.**"
