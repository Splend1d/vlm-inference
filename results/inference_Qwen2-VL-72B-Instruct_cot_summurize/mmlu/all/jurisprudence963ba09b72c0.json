Both adopt a liberal ideology.\n\nCritical Legal Studies (CLS) and American Realism share several similarities, including their focus on the 'law in action' (option A), their anti-formalist and skeptical stance towards legal doctrines (option B), and their efforts to demystify the law (option D). However, CLS is generally associated with a more radical or critical perspective that challenges not only formalist legal theories but also the underlying social, economic, and political structures, often adopting a more leftist or progressive ideology. In contrast, American Realism, while also critical of formalism, does not necessarily align itself with a specific ideological position in the same way CLS does. Therefore, it would be inaccurate to say that both adopt a liberal ideology, as CLS tends to transcend or critique liberal perspectives in favor of more fundamental social change."
