Capitalized and depreciated over its estimated useful life.\n\nThis approach aligns with accounting principles that dictate capitalizing assets that have a useful life beyond the current period and depreciating them over that useful life. Since the equipment has alternative future uses, it indicates that it will provide economic benefits beyond the R&D project itself, justifying its capitalization and subsequent depreciation."
