He argues that addiction is not solely due to biological or psychological factors but rather a complex interplay between an individual's thoughts, behaviors, and their environment.\n\nGiven this understanding, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **One's individual mindset and social setting** - This aligns with Shapiro's holistic approach, considering both personal and environmental factors.\n\nB. **The pharmacological effects of drug use (e.g., withdrawal)** - While pharmacological effects are important, Shapiro's explanation goes beyond just the physical aspects of addiction.\n\nC. **One's genetic profile, which explains why some people have \"addictive personalities\"** - Shapiro does not focus primarily on genetics or the concept of an \"addictive personality.\"\n\nD. **Specific psychological disorders such as obsessive-compulsive disorder** - Shapiro's explanation is broader than attributing addiction solely to specific psychological disorders.\n\nBased on Shapiro's emphasis on the interaction between individual mindset and social setting, the best explanation for drug addiction according to Shapiro is:\n\n**A. One's individual mindset and social setting.**"
