This law was developed by Isaac Newton after Kepler's work.\n\nD. **A planet travels faster when it is nearer to the Sun and slower when it is farther from the Sun.**\n   - This is a consequence of Kepler's Second Law (Law of Equal Areas). Since a planet sweeps out equal areas in equal times, it must move faster when closer to the Sun (where the area swept per unit time is larger) and slower when farther from the Sun.\n\nGiven this analysis, the statement that does not follow directly from Kepler's laws is:\n\n**C. The force of attraction between any two objects decreases with the square of the distance between their centers.**\n\nThis statement is part of Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation, not Kepler's laws."
