These structures not only served practical purposes but also demonstrated the power, wealth, and cultural sophistication of the ruling elite. While stone tablets, pyramids, and irrigation canals are also significant artifacts from ancient civilizations, they are more specific to certain cultures or regions, whereas monumental works are a common feature across various ancient state societies."
