Recognition is simply declaratory of statehood but not determinate.\n\nThe declaratory theory of recognition holds that the recognition of a new state by other states does not create or confer statehood upon the entity being recognized. Instead, it is a formal acknowledgment that the entity already possesses the attributes of statehood under international law. According to this theory, statehood is determined by the fulfillment of certain criteria (such as a defined territory, a permanent population, a government, and the capacity to enter into relations with other states), and recognition by other states is merely a reflection of this pre-existing status."
