However, this contradicts the principle of distinguishing between combatants (those who participate directly in hostilities) and noncombatants (civilians or those not participating in hostilities), which is a fundamental aspect of international humanitarian law.\n\nB. **The difference between combatants and noncombatants is a matter of degree.**\n   - This suggests that the distinction is not absolute but rather exists on a spectrum. This could imply that some individuals might fall into a gray area where it's difficult to categorically define them as either combatants or noncombatants. This aligns with the complexities of modern warfare where roles can sometimes blur.\n\nC. **The difference between combatants and noncombatants is categorical and clear.**\n   - This statement asserts that the distinction is straightforward and unambiguous. While this is an ideal under international humanitarian law, in practice, it can be challenging to maintain such clarity, especially in asymmetric conflicts or urban warfare.\n\nD. **\"Terrorism\" should be defined as indiscriminate violence.**\n   - This option focuses on defining terrorism specifically as acts of violence that do not discriminate between combatants and noncombatants. This aligns with common definitions of terrorism, which often involve targeting civilians or non-combatants without regard for their status.\n\nGiven these analyses, the most fitting interpretation of Valls' discussion on discrimination in war, considering the nuances and complexities of modern conflicts, would likely be:\n\n**B. The difference between combatants and noncombatants is a matter of degree.**\n\nThis option acknowledges the complexities and potential ambiguities in distinguishing between combatants and noncombatants in contemporary warfare."
