The word \"good\" in this context is often used to express approval or positive feelings about something.\n\nGiven this understanding, let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. Descriptive use: This would imply that \"good\" is used to describe an objective fact or characteristic. However, according to Stevenson, \"good\" is not primarily descriptive but expressive.\n\nB. Constructive use: This term does not directly relate to Stevenson's theory. It seems less relevant compared to other options.\n\nC. Dynamic use: This could imply that \"good\" is used in a way that motivates or influences behavior, which aligns with emotivism as it suggests the expression of emotion can influence others.\n\nD. Propositional use: This would mean using \"good\" to make a factual claim or proposition. Again, this does not fit well with Stevenson's view on the emotive nature of moral language.\n\nConsidering Stevenson's emphasis on the emotive function of moral terms like \"good,\" the most fitting option is:\n\nC. Dynamic use."
