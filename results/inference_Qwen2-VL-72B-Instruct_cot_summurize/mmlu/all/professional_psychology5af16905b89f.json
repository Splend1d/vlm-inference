In this case, the student is more likely to believe that her low score is due to her own lack of ability rather than external factors such as lack of time to study, the difficulty of the exam items, or the instructor's teaching skills. This negative self-perception can exacerbate feelings of hopelessness and contribute to the maintenance of depressive symptoms."
