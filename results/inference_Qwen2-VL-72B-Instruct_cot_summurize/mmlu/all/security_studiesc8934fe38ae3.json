Coercive diplomacy has proven a successful policy tool and one that is integral to conflict management. The successes of the past policy initiatives in the post-9/11 community have reinforced the trend toward coercive diplomacy by increasing American political will to counter mass casualty terrorism in failing states.\nB. The favourable geo-political environment, characterized by an overwhelmingly Western military superiority and a low risk of hostile great power intervention, has generated pressures and incentives for Western policymakers to promote their policy agenda, and to manage armed conflicts from weak states and failing states.\nC. The demise of the ideological bipolar division of international society in the Cold War, rather than resulting in a reduction of hostilities, has left an unstable legacy where a policy of force and mass retaliation continues to pose a very real threat. Risk of uncontrollable escalation still remains but in a different form; mass casualty terrorism, contagion from failing states and non-state actors seeking to acquire WMD are the primary concern of states and require responses in the form of military intervention.\nD. The hostile geopolitical environment has encouraged states to pursue military strategies in order to secure their interests. The use of violence rather than diplomacy or incentives has become the primary response to threats, whether these are posed by other states, resource scarcity, pandemic diseases, or other non-traditional threats.\n"

This option suggests that coercive diplomacy has been successful and is now integral to conflict management. It highlights the successes of past policy initiatives and the increased American political will to counter mass casualty terrorism in failing states.\n\nB. This option points out that the favorable geo-political environment, characterized by Western military superiority and low risk of great power intervention, has led to pressures and incentives for Western policymakers to promote their policy agenda and manage conflicts from weak and failing states.\n\nC. This option argues that the end of the Cold War did not reduce hostilities but instead created an unstable legacy where a policy of force and mass retaliation continues to pose a threat. It mentions the risks of escalation and the need for military intervention to address mass casualty terrorism and threats from failing states and non-state actors.\n\nD. This option claims that the hostile geopolitical environment has encouraged states to pursue military strategies over diplomacy or incentives. It suggests that violence has become the primary response to various threats, including those from other states, resource scarcity, and pandemic diseases.\n\nBased on the analysis, the most accurate description of how the use of coercive diplomacy by Western powers has changed since the end of the Cold War is:\n\n**C. The demise of the ideological bipolar division of international society in the Cold War, rather than resulting in a reduction of hostilities, has left an unstable legacy where a policy of force and mass retaliation continues to pose a very real threat. Risk of uncontrollable escalation still remains but in a different form; mass casualty terrorism, contagion from failing states and non-state actors seeking to acquire WMD are the primary concern of states and require responses in the form of military intervention.**\n\nThis option best captures the shift towards a more unstable and complex security environment where coercive diplomacy and military intervention have become more prevalent in addressing new forms of threats."
