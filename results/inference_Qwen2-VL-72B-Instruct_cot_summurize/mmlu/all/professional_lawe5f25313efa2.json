He saved up some money to buy a bow and other archery equipment. He set up a target in his backyard in order to practice. He surrounded the target with stacks of hay bales to stop any arrows that missed the target. After practicing for a few weeks, the boy made great improvements in his technique and accuracy. While practicing one afternoon, however, the boy lost his balance just as he released an arrow. As a result, the arrow flew way off course, going over the target and all the hay bales and flying into a wooded area behind the boy's house. The boy assumed no one was in the woods, so he was relieved that the errant arrow would not hurt anyone. However, a hiker happened to be in the woods near the boy's house. As he paused for a moment to take a drink of water, the hiker suddenly saw something out of the corner of his eye. It was the stray arrow shot by the boy. Without even thinking about it, the hiker reflexively ducked out of the way. The arrow narrowly missed the hiker's head; but as the hiker ducked out of the way, his head struck the limb of a tree, causing a stick to stab painfully into his eye. Which of the following causes of action could the hiker successfully assert against the boy?\n\nA. Assault, but not battery.\nB. Battery, but not assault.\nC. Assault and battery.\nD. Neither assault nor battery.\n"

                    "text": "The scenario described involves a situation where the boy unintentionally shot an arrow that nearly hit a hiker. Let's analyze each option based on the definitions of assault and battery in tort law:\n\n1. **Assault**: This is defined as the intentional creation of a reasonable apprehension of imminent harmful or offensive contact without consent. In this case, the boy did not intend to create fear or apprehension in the hiker, and the hiker did not perceive the threat until after the arrow was already in motion.\n\n2. **Battery**: This is defined as the intentional infliction of harmful or offensive contact upon another person without their consent. Although the boy did not intend to harm the hiker, the hiker did suffer injury (the stick stabbing his eye) due to the boy's actions.\n\nGiven these definitions:\n- The boy did not intentionally create a reasonable apprehension of imminent harm (assault), so assault does not apply.\n- The boy's actions led to the hiker being injured (battery), even though the injury was caused indirectly by the hiker's own reaction to avoid the arrow.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**B. Battery, but not assault.**"
