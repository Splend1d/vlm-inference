This means that the stopping potential (the potential difference needed to prevent the ejected electrons from reaching the collector) is also directly proportional to the frequency of the light above the threshold frequency. The work function of the metal, which is the minimum energy required to remove an electron from the metal surface, is a constant for a given material and does not depend on the frequency or wavelength of the incident light. The current in the tube can be affected by the intensity of the light and the number of electrons ejected, but it is not a simple linear function of the wavelength."
