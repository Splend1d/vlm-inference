Since \\( pre(u) < pre(v) \\), \\( u \\) was visited before \\( v \\) in the preorder traversal. However, the postorder traversal numbers do not necessarily follow the same order as the preorder traversal numbers. Therefore, \\( post(u) < post(v) \\) does not have to be true. \n\n### Statement II: \\( u \\) is an ancestor of \\( v \\) in \\( T \\)\n\nSince \\( (u, v) \\) is an edge in \\( G \\) but not in \\( T \\), it implies that \\( u \\) and \\( v \\) are in different subtrees of the DFS tree. This means neither \\( u \\) nor \\( v \\) can be an ancestor of the other in \\( T \\). Therefore, \\( u \\) being an ancestor of \\( v \\) in \\( T \\) is false.\n\n### Statement III: If \\( w \\) is the lowest common ancestor of \\( u \\) and \\( v \\) in \\( T \\), then \\( w = u \\)\n\nThe lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two nodes in a tree is the deepest node that has both nodes as descendants. Given that \\( u \\) and \\( v \\) are in different subtrees and \\( pre(u) < pre(v) \\), the LCA of \\( u \\) and \\( v \\) would be the last node visited before the subtree containing \\( v \\) was explored. This node cannot be \\( u \\) because \\( u \\) and \\( v \\) are in different subtrees. Therefore, \\( w = u \\) is false.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nNone of the statements I, II, or III must be true based on the given conditions.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\n**A. I only**"
