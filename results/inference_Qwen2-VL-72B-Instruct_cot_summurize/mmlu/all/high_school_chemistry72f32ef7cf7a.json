The point at which the attractive and repulsive forces between the two atoms are equal\n\nIn a covalent bond, the bond length is determined by the equilibrium position where the attractive forces (due to the sharing of electrons) and the repulsive forces (between the positively charged nuclei and the negatively charged electrons) are balanced. This balance results in the minimum potential energy for the system, leading to the stable bond length."
