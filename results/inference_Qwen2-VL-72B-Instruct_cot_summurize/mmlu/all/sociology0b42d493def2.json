                    "text": "To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option in the context of the 1980s and its impact on income inequality.\n\nA. **Rates of income tax increased equally for all occupational groups**: If income tax rates had increased equally for all occupational groups, it would likely have reduced income inequality rather than increased it, as higher taxes on higher incomes would redistribute wealth more evenly.\n\nB. **There were more professional jobs available but not enough people to fill them**: This scenario could lead to an increase in wages for those who do fill these high-paying jobs, potentially widening the gap between those with professional jobs and those without, thus contributing to income inequality.\n\nC. **The price of consumer goods rose at a higher rate than earnings**: While this would certainly cause financial strain for many individuals, especially those with lower incomes, it does not directly explain why income inequality grew. It would affect purchasing power rather than directly increasing the disparity in income levels.\n\nD. **Growing unemployment made more people dependent on welfare benefits**: While this would certainly exacerbate poverty and economic hardship, it doesn't directly explain the growth in income inequality. It might contribute indirectly by creating a larger pool of low-income individuals, but it doesn't address the root causes of the widening gap between different income brackets.\n\nGiven these analyses, the most plausible explanation for the growth in income inequality in the 1980s is:\n\n**B. There were more professional jobs available but not enough people to fill them**\n\nThis situation would lead to higher salaries for those in professional roles, thereby increasing the income disparity between professionals and non-professionals."
