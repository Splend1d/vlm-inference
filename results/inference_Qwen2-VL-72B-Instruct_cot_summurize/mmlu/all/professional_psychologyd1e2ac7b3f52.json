Sexual selection and parental investment\n\nThese two theories provide the primary conceptual framework for understanding the evolution of mating adaptations in organisms. Sexual selection focuses on how traits evolve due to their attractiveness or dominance in mate choice, while parental investment theory examines the costs and benefits associated with caring for offspring, which can influence mating strategies."
