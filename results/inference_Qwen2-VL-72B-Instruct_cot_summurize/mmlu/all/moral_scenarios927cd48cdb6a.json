However, it is not typically seen as a severe moral transgression.\n- This action might be considered rude or inconsiderate but not necessarily morally wrong in the strictest sense.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n\"I dug up the teacher's corpse and left it in her old classroom.\"\n- Digging up a corpse is a serious violation of both legal and moral standards. It involves desecration of a grave, which is illegal and deeply disrespectful to the deceased and their family.\n- This action is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong"
