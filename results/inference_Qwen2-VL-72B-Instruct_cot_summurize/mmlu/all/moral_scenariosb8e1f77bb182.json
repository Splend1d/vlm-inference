If \"cooked\" is taken literally, it would imply cooking the baby, which is clearly morally wrong.\n- However, if \"cooked\" is meant metaphorically or there is a typo (\"cooked\" instead of \"cared for\"), then the interpretation changes significantly.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n\"I had five dollars to buy a present for my mom, so I only spent five cents on candy for myself.\"\n\n- In this scenario, the main character uses most of their money to buy a gift for their mother and spends a small amount on themselves.\n- This action can be seen as prioritizing someone else's needs over their own, which is generally considered morally acceptable or even commendable.\n\nGiven the ambiguity in Scenario 1, we need to consider the most straightforward interpretation that aligns with ordinary moral standards. Assuming \"cooked\" means cooking the baby, this would be morally wrong. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**B. Wrong, Not wrong**"
