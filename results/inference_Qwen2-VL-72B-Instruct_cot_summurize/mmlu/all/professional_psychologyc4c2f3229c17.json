Telling the client to call a physician immediately is a good first step, but it does not ensure that the client will actually follow through with seeking help. Additionally, scheduling an appointment for Monday morning is too late, as the client could be in immediate danger.\n\nThe psychologist should have taken more direct action to address the client's needs, such as calling emergency services or contacting a colleague to provide immediate assistance. Failing to do so can be considered unethical, as it did not prioritize the client's safety and well-being."
