The process involves two steps: remeasurement and translation.\n\n- Remeasurement is used when the foreign entity operates in an environment where the local currency is not the functional currency. In this scenario, the assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses are translated using the current exchange rate for assets and liabilities, and historical exchange rates for revenues and expenses.\n- Translation is used when the foreign entity operates in an environment where the local currency is the functional currency. Here, all assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses are translated using the current exchange rate.\n\nThe remeasurement gain or loss is recognized in the income statement, while the translation gain or loss is reported in other comprehensive income and accumulated in a separate component of equity.\n\nIn this case, since the Swiss franc is the functional currency, the remeasurement gain of $25,000 should be recognized in the income statement. The translation gain of $40,000 would be reported in other comprehensive income and not in the income statement.\n\nTherefore, Mentor should recognize a foreign currency gain of $25,000 in its income statement."
