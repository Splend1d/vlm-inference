In one of the resonance structures, the nitrogen atom forms a double bond with one oxygen atom and single bonds with the other two oxygen atoms. The double bond consists of one sigma bond and one pi bond, while each single bond is a sigma bond.\n\nTherefore, in this resonance structure:\n- There are 3 sigma bonds (one from each single bond).\n- There is 1 pi bond (from the double bond).\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nD. 3 sigma and 1 pi"
