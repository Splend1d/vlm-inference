This finding is known as a \"paradoxical splitting\" of the second heart sound and is a relatively specific sign of increased pulmonary artery pressure. The other options listed (increased jugular venous pressure, peripheral edema, and presence of an S3) can also be associated with various cardiac and non-cardiac conditions and are less specific indicators of pulmonary arterial hypertension."
