To address this, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Killing them by sending poisoned food.**\n   - This scenario involves an active intervention where one directly causes harm through a deliberate action (sending poisoned food). It is clearly an act of killing.\n\nB. **Refusing to give them the money they need to purchase food.**\n   - This scenario involves a passive stance where one does not provide necessary resources (money) that could prevent starvation. It is an example of letting die rather than actively killing.\n\nC. **Withholding medicine that they need to survive.**\n   - Similar to B, this scenario involves withholding something essential (medicine) that could save lives. It is also an example of letting die rather than actively killing.\n\nD. **Depriving them of knowledge they need to produce food.**\n   - This scenario involves denying access to information that could help them become self-sufficient. Like B and C, it is an example of letting die rather than actively killing.\n\nGiven these analyses, the most direct comparison to \"allowing people in Third World countries to starve\" would be:\n\n**B. Refusing to give them the money they need to purchase food.**\n\nThis option aligns closely with the concept of letting die because it involves withholding necessary resources without actively causing harm."
