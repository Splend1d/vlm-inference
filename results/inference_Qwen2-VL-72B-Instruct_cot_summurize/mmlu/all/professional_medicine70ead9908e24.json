Neurologic examination shows no other abnormalities. A skull x-ray shows a linear, nondepressed basal skull fracture. Two weeks later, the patient develops polyuria and polydipsia. Laboratory studies show a serum glucose concentration within the reference range, increased serum osmolality, and decreased urine osmolality. Following the administration of desmopressin, urine osmolality increases. The beneficial effect of this drug is most likely due to activation of which of the following?\n\nA. Adenylyl cyclase\nB. Ca2+ channels\nC. Janus kinase\nD. Serine kinase\n"

It acts by binding to V2 receptors in the renal collecting ducts, leading to an increase in intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) via adenylyl cyclase activation. This results in increased water reabsorption and decreased urine output, effectively treating diabetes insipidus, which is characterized by polyuria and polydipsia. Therefore, the beneficial effect of desmopressin in this scenario is most likely due to its activation of adenylyl cyclase."
