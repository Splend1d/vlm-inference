                    "text": "To determine the truthfulness of these statements, we need to analyze the properties of groups of order 42 and apply relevant theorems from group theory.\n\nFirst, let's recall some key facts about groups:\n\n1. **Lagrange's Theorem**: If \\( G \\) is a finite group and \\( H \\) is a subgroup of \\( G \\), then the order of \\( H \\) divides the order of \\( G \\).\n\n2. **Sylow's Theorems**: For a prime \\( p \\) dividing the order of a group \\( G \\), there exists a Sylow \\( p \\)-subgroup of \\( G \\). Moreover, all Sylow \\( p \\)-subgroups are conjugate, and the number of Sylow \\( p \\)-subgroups, denoted by \\( n_p \\), satisfies:\n   - \\( n_p \\equiv 1 \\mod p \\)\n   - \\( n_p \\) divides the index of \\( p \\) in \\( G \\)\n\nNow, let's examine each statement:\n\n### Statement 1: Every group of order 42 has a normal subgroup of order 7.\n- The prime factorization of 42 is \\( 42 = 2 \\times 3 \\times 7 \\).\n- According to Sylow's Theorems, the number of Sylow 7-subgroups, \\( n_7 \\), must satisfy:\n  - \\( n_7 \\equiv 1 \\mod 7 \\)\n  - \\( n_7 \\) divides \\( \\frac{42}{7} = 6 \\)\n  \n  The only value that satisfies both conditions is \\( n_7 = 1 \\). This means there is exactly one Sylow 7-subgroup, which must be normal (since it is unique).\n\nThus, Statement 1 is true.\n\n### Statement 2: Every group of order 42 has a normal subgroup of order 8.\n- The prime factorization of 42 does not include 8 as a factor. Therefore, there cannot exist a subgroup of order 8 within a group of order 42 because 8 does not divide 42.\n\nThus, Statement 2 is false.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**C. True, False**"
