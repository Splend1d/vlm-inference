One evening, the guard saw a young man stealing a rake that a homeowner in the neighborhood had left outside in his yard. The guard ran toward the young man. Seeing the guard, the young man dropped the rake and began to flee. Believing that the young man was about to escape, the guard pulled out his gun and fired a shot at the young man. The bullet struck the young man in the arm. If the young man asserts a claim against the security company for damages for his injuries, the young man will\n\nA. prevail, because the guard used unreasonable force to protect the homeowner's property.\nB. prevail, because the guard did not give a warning that he had a gun and was about to shoot.\nC. not prevail, because the young man was trespassing on the homeowner's property.\nD. not prevail, because the young man was engaged in theft when he was shot.\n"

In this scenario, the young man was fleeing and did not pose an immediate threat to anyone's life or safety. Therefore, shooting him with a gun would be considered excessive and unreasonable force to protect property."
