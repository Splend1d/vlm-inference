The factors of this GCD will be the numbers that divide both 120 and 40.\n\nFirst, let's factorize both numbers:\n\n- \\(120 = 2^3 \\times 3 \\times 5\\)\n- \\(40 = 2^3 \\times 5\\)\n\nThe GCD is found by taking the lowest power of each prime number that appears in the factorization of both numbers. Here, the GCD is \\(2^3 \\times 5 = 8 \\times 5 = 40\\).\n\nNow, we need to find the factors of 40. The factors of 40 are: 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 20, and 40.\n\nTherefore, there are 8 positive integers that are factors of both 120 and 40.\n\nThe correct answer is B. 8."
