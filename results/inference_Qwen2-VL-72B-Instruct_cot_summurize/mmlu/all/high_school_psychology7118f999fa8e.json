The neural connections to the primary visual cortex are not fully connected.\n\nDuring early development, the neural connections in the brain, including those responsible for vision, are still forming and maturing. This process, known as synaptogenesis, involves the growth and strengthening of connections between neurons. In the case of vision, these connections are crucial for transmitting visual information from the eyes to the primary visual cortex in the brain. Until these connections are fully established and refined through experience, a baby's vision will be relatively poor."
