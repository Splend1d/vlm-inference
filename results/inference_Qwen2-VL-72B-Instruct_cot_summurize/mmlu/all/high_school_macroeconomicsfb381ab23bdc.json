Income earned by the factors of production.\n\nNational income is the total income earned by the factors of production within a country's borders, including wages, rents, profits, and interest. It represents the sum of all incomes earned by households, businesses, and government entities from productive activities. \n\nOption C, GDP minus depreciation and indirect business taxes, refers to Net National Product (NNP), which is a measure of the value of goods and services produced in a country after accounting for depreciation and indirect business taxes. While NNP is related to national income, it is not the same thing.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. Income earned by the factors of production."
