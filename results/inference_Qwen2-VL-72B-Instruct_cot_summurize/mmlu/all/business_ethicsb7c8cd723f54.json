This means that even if all the company's assets were liquidated, there would not be enough money to fully repay all creditors.\n\nLet's briefly discuss why the other options are not accurate definitions of insolvency:\n\nA. Having negative working capital indicates that a company's current liabilities exceed its current assets, which can be a sign of financial distress but does not necessarily mean the company is insolvent.\n\nB. Not meeting budgeted levels of profit is a performance issue and may indicate poor management or market conditions, but it does not directly relate to the company's ability to pay its debts.\n\nC. Making a loss means the company's expenses exceed its revenues for a period, which can lead to financial difficulties but does not equate to insolvency unless it results in an inability to pay debts.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate definition of insolvency is option D."
