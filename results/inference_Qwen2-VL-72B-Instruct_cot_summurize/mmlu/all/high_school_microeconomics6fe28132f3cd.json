Here's an analysis of each option:\n\nA. **There is no price leader.**\n   - This statement is correct because the kinked demand curve model assumes that firms will match any price cuts but not necessarily price increases made by their competitors. It does not assume a single price leader.\n\nB. **There are relatively equal shares of the market.**\n   - This statement is also correct as it aligns with the assumption that firms in an oligopoly have similar market power and influence over prices.\n\nC. **Price is greater than marginal costs.**\n   - This statement is correct because in oligopolistic markets, firms often set prices above marginal costs to maximize profits.\n\nD. **The demand curve is of one continuous function.**\n   - This statement is incorrect. The kinked demand curve is characterized by a discontinuity at the current price level, where the demand curve is more elastic above the current price and less elastic below it. Therefore, it is not a continuous function.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\n**D. The demand curve is of one continuous function.**"
