Therefore, this statement is true.\n\nB. **If the Fed decreases the money supply, the value of the dollar depreciates.**\n   - Decreasing the money supply typically increases the value of the currency because there is less money available, which can lead to higher demand for the remaining currency. Thus, this statement is false.\n\nC. **If EU consumers are less inclined to purchase American goods, the dollar appreciates.**\n   - If EU consumers buy fewer American goods, the demand for dollars decreases, which should cause the dollar to depreciate rather than appreciate. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\nD. **If U.S. income levels are rising relative to incomes in the EU, the euro depreciates.**\n   - Rising income levels in the U.S. could increase the demand for imports from the EU, thereby increasing the demand for euros. This could lead to an appreciation of the euro against the dollar. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\nThe correct answer is A."
