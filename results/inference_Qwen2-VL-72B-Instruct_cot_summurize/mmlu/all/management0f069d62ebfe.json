It provides a clear sense of direction and sets the tone for the organization's strategic planning and operations. While vision statements describe where the organization aims to be in the future, strategy statements outline how it plans to achieve its goals, and business statements may describe what the organization does, the mission statement captures the essence of why the organization exists and what it stands for."
