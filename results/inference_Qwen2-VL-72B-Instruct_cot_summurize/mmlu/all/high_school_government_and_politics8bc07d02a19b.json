Appellate judges review decisions of lower courts.\n\nAppellate courts primarily focus on reviewing the decisions made by lower courts to ensure that the law was applied correctly and that there were no procedural errors. They do not typically re-evaluate the facts of the case or conduct new trials, nor do they usually involve juries. The principle of stare decisis, which means \"to stand by things decided,\" is indeed used by appellate judges to maintain consistency in legal interpretations."
