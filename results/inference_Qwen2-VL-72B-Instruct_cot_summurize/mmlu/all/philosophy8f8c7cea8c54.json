He suggests that if we have the ability to prevent something bad without sacrificing anything of comparable moral significance, we ought to do so. This challenges the idea that helping others is purely an act of charity rather than a moral duty.\n\n2. **Egoism and Altruism**: While Singer does discuss the concept of altruism, his primary focus in \"Famine, Affluence, and Morality\" is not on distinguishing between egoistic and altruistic motivations but rather on the obligations we have towards others.\n\n3. **Rights and Privileges**: Singer's arguments in this essay do not primarily revolve around the distinction between rights and privileges. His focus is more on moral obligations and responsibilities.\n\n4. **Positive and Negative Rights**: Although Singer has written about rights in other works, \"Famine, Affluence, and Morality\" is more concerned with moral duties and obligations rather than the specific types of rights.\n\nGiven this analysis, the most accurate answer is:\n\n**A. duty and charity.**\n\nSinger's argument indeed challenges the traditional view by suggesting that actions traditionally considered charitable should instead be seen as moral duties."
