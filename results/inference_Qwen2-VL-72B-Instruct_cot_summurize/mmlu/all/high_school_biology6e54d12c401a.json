As a result, they have had more time to accumulate differences in their genetic makeup and physical characteristics. Therefore, they would be expected to share fewer homologous structures (structures that have the same origin but may have different functions) compared to two more closely related organisms, which have diverged more recently and thus retain more similarities."
