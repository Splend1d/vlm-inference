The monsoon is crucial for agriculture in this region, as it provides the necessary water for crops to grow. Irregular or insufficient rainfall can lead to crop failures, reduced yields, and ultimately affect food security. This has direct implications for the economy and livelihoods of millions of people who depend on agriculture."
