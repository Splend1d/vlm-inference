                    "text": "To determine when the major shift by Greek philosophers who rejected the anthropomorphic view of the divine occurred, let's analyze the historical context and the development of philosophical thought in ancient Greece.\n\n1. **Early Third Century BCE (A)**: This period is marked by the Hellenistic era, which saw the spread of Greek culture and philosophy across the Mediterranean world. However, the major shift away from anthropomorphic views of the divine had already begun earlier.\n\n2. **Second and First Century BCE (B)**: This period is also part of the Hellenistic era, but it follows the initial shift in philosophical thought that began earlier.\n\n3. **Late Sixth Century BCE (C)**: This period corresponds to the time of early Greek philosophers such as Thales, Anaximander, and Heraclitus. While these thinkers were foundational in moving away from mythological explanations towards more naturalistic ones, the major shift away from anthropomorphic views of the divine happened later.\n\n4. **Fourth and Third Century BCE (D)**: This period includes the time of Plato and Aristotle, who significantly influenced Western philosophy. Plato, in particular, developed a more abstract and non-anthropomorphic view of the divine through his theory of Forms. Aristotle also contributed to this shift with his metaphysical concepts.\n\nGiven this analysis, the most significant shift away from anthropomorphic views of the divine among Greek philosophers occurred during the Fourth and Third Century BCE.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**D. Fourth and Third Century BCE**"
