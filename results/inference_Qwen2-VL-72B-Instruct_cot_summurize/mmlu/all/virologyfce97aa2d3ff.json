The virion RNA acting as mRNA\n\nPicornaviruses, as positive-strand RNA viruses, have genomes that can be directly translated by the host cell's ribosomes upon entry into the cell. This means their RNA acts as messenger RNA (mRNA), directing the synthesis of viral proteins necessary for replication and assembly."
