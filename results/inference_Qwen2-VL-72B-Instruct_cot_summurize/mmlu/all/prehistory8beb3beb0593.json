This region was rich in natural resources, particularly salmon and other marine life, which provided a reliable and abundant food source. The abundance of food allowed these societies to develop complex social structures, engage in trade, create art, and build elaborate ceremonial practices without the immediate pressures of subsistence farming or irrigation technology. Social stratification often emerged as a result of this surplus, but it was the food surplus itself that was the foundational element enabling such developments."
