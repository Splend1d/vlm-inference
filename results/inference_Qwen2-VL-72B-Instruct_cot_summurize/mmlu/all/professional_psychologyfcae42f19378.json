Refer the client to another therapist after discussing the reason with her.\n\nIt's important for therapists to maintain professional boundaries and ensure that their personal issues do not interfere with their ability to provide effective treatment. In this case, Dr. Lykowski's feelings of hostility towards the client due to countertransference (the therapist's emotional reactions to the client) could potentially impact the therapeutic relationship and the client's progress. By referring the client to another therapist and explaining the reason for the referral, Dr. Lykowski is taking responsibility for his own emotional state and prioritizing the client's well-being. This approach also allows the client to understand the situation and make an informed decision about continuing therapy with a different therapist."
