After paying the sale price and taking occupancy, the buyer experienced drainage and interior flooding problems with the home. The city issued citations against the owner for not following code regulations regarding construction on a flood-prone slope. The buyer asked the seller to repair all of the defects at his own expense but the seller refused. The buyer brought an action in court alleging breach of warranty against the builder-seller. Will the court hold the builderseller liable to live up to any warranties in favor of the buyer?\n\nA. No, the buyer had an obligation to make a full inspection and discover any defects prior to paying the full price and taking occupancy.\nB. No, the law regarding a building purchase is based on the premise \"Let the buyer beware.\"\nC. Yes, every builder-seller warrants that a newly constructed home is built in a good and workmanlike manner.\nD. Yes, the seller has strict liability to the buyer for any defects that arise within one year of the sale.\n"

Yes, every builder-seller warrants that a newly constructed home is built in a good and workmanlike manner.\n\nIn most jurisdictions, when a builder-seller constructs and sells a new home, there is an implied warranty that the home is built in a good and workmanlike manner, meaning it should be free from defects that would render it uninhabitable or unsafe. This warranty typically covers issues such as structural integrity, plumbing, electrical systems, and other essential components of the home. If the home fails to meet these standards due to poor construction practices or non-compliance with building codes, the builder-seller can be held liable for breaches of this warranty.\n\nOptions A and B are incorrect because they suggest that the buyer bears the responsibility for discovering defects before purchase, which is not generally the case with new construction homes where the builder-seller is expected to ensure the quality of their work. Option D is also incorrect because while some jurisdictions may have specific time frames for warranty claims, the primary issue here is the breach of the implied warranty of good and workmanlike construction, which does not necessarily hinge on a strict one-year limitation."
