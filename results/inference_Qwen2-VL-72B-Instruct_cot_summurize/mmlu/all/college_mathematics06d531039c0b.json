The rank-nullity theorem states that for any linear transformation \\( T: V \\rightarrow W \\) between finite-dimensional vector spaces \\( V \\) and \\( W \\),\n\n\\[ \\dim(\\ker(T)) + \\dim(\\text{Im}(T)) = \\dim(V) \\]\n\nHere, \\( \\dim(\\ker(T)) \\) is the dimension of the kernel (null space) of \\( T \\), \\( \\dim(\\text{Im}(T)) \\) is the dimension of the image (range) of \\( T \\), and \\( \\dim(V) \\) is the dimension of the domain \\( V \\).\n\nFirst, let's find the dimensions of \\( V \\) and \\( W \\):\n\n- \\( V \\) is the space of all real 2x3 matrices. Each matrix has 6 entries, so \\( \\dim(V) = 6 \\).\n- \\( W \\) is the space of all real 4x1 column vectors. Each vector has 4 entries, so \\( \\dim(W) = 4 \\).\n\nSince \\( T \\) is a linear transformation from \\( V \\) onto \\( W \\), it means that \\( T \\) is surjective (onto). Therefore, the dimension of the image of \\( T \\) is equal to the dimension of \\( W \\):\n\n\\[ \\dim(\\text{Im}(T)) = \\dim(W) = 4 \\]\n\nNow we can apply the rank-nullity theorem:\n\n\\[ \\dim(\\ker(T)) + \\dim(\\text{Im}(T)) = \\dim(V) \\]\n\\[ \\dim(\\ker(T)) + 4 = 6 \\]\n\\[ \\dim(\\ker(T)) = 6 - 4 \\]\n\\[ \\dim(\\ker(T)) = 2 \\]\n\nThus, the dimension of the kernel of \\( T \\) is 2.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nA. 2"
