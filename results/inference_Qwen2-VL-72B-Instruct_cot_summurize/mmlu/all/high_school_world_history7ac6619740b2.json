The rehabilitation and upbuilding of our countries will have little meaning. Our revolutions will not be allowed to run their course. What can we do? We can do much! We can inject the voice of reason into world affairs. We can mobilize all the spiritual, all the moral, all the political strength of Asia and Africa on the side of peace. Yes, we! We, the peoples of Asia and Africa, 1.4 billion strong.\nIndonesian leader Sukarno, keynote address to the Bandung Conference, 1955\nThe passage above is most associated with which of the following developments?\n\nA. The formation of the non-aligned movement\nB. Global disarmanent and nuclear non-proliferation\nC. The Green Revolution in agriculture\nD. Mobilization of pan-Asian ideology\n"

The formation of the non-aligned movement\n\nThe passage emphasizes the importance of peace and the need for Asian and African nations to unite and use their collective strength to promote peace. This aligns with the principles of the non-aligned movement, which was formed during the Cold War by countries that did not want to align with either the United States or the Soviet Union. The Bandung Conference, where this speech was given, was a significant event in the formation of the non-aligned movement."
