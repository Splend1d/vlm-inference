Subsequent to the statute a resident alien enters into a contract to buy 50 acres of land located in the state. Assume that the statute empowers the state to bring an ejectment action against any alien who owns more than 10 acres of land. If the resident alien brings an action in federal court to enjoin the state from enforcing the statute against him, his best argument is\n\nA. the statute violates the privileges or immunities clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nB. the statute violates the contract clause.\nC. the statute violates the commerce clause in that it interferes with land ownership.\nD. the statute violates the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n"

The statute violates the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nThe equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment requires states to provide equal treatment under the law to all persons within their jurisdictions. A statute that prohibits aliens from owning more than 10 acres of land while allowing citizens to own larger parcels could be seen as discriminatory and thus a violation of the equal protection clause. This argument would focus on the discriminatory nature of the statute based on nationality or immigration status, which is a suspect classification under the Equal Protection Clause and therefore subject to strict scrutiny by the courts."
