Leaders have incentives to lie: Countries may choose to conceal their nuclear capabilities for strategic reasons, such as maintaining a deterrent effect or avoiding international sanctions.\n\nB. If leaders revealed their programs, they would be more likely to be attacked: The revelation of a nuclear program could invite preemptive strikes from other nations seeking to neutralize the perceived threat.\n\nC. Leaders will not always grant foreign monitors access to their nuclear programs: Without transparency and cooperation, it becomes difficult for the international community to verify the status of a country's nuclear arsenal.\n\nThese factors combined contribute to the uncertainty surrounding the nuclear capabilities of various states."
