The land conveyed to the woman fronted on a public highway. The land retained by the man was landlocked. One year later, the man died intestate, leaving a cousin as his only heir. The cousin visited the man's land for the first time and discovered that it had no access to a public highway. A neighbor who owned adjoining land fronting on the public highway offered to sell the cousin a right to cross the neighbor's land for access to the highway. Although the neighbor's price was reasonable, the cousin rejected the offer. The woman has refused to allow the cousin to cross her land for access to the public highway even though the woman's land is still vacant. The cousin has sued the woman, seeking access across the woman's land to the public highway. Who is likely to prevail?\n\nA. The cousin, based on necessity.\nB. The cousin, because the woman's land is still vacant.\nC. The woman, because the cousin could obtain an alternative access to the highway from the neighbor.\nD. The woman, because the man failed to reserve an easement in his deed to the woman.\n"

This easement allows the landlocked owner to have access to a public road over the conveyed land if there is no other reasonable means of access.\n\nGiven the scenario:\n\n1. The man conveyed the eastern half of the tract to the woman, which resulted in the remaining land being landlocked.\n2. The cousin, as the heir to the man's land, now finds himself with no access to a public highway.\n3. The woman's land fronts on the public highway, making it the most direct route for the cousin to gain access.\n\nSince the cousin has no other reasonable means of access to the public highway (the neighbor's offer was rejected), an easement by necessity would likely be granted to the cousin over the woman's land.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. The cousin, based on necessity."
