(Before Present).\n\nA. **Finely carved obsidian statuary**: This suggests advanced craftsmanship and artistic skill, indicating a society with specialized roles and possibly a hierarchical structure.\n\nB. **Decorated stepped platforms**: These structures imply significant architectural knowledge and communal effort, pointing towards organized labor and societal planning.\n\nC. **The introduction of chocolate into the Mesoamerican economy**: While important, the introduction of chocolate does not directly indicate complexity in terms of societal organization or technological advancement.\n\nD. **A ritual ball game in which the losers were sacrificed to the gods**: This indicates religious practices and possibly a complex belief system, but it doesn't necessarily reflect early evidence of societal complexity in terms of material culture or organizational structure.\n\nGiven these considerations, options A and B both suggest aspects of societal complexity through material culture and architectural achievements. However, finely carved obsidian statuary specifically points to advanced craftsmanship and specialization, which are strong indicators of societal complexity.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer is:\n\n**A. finely carved obsidian statuary.**"
