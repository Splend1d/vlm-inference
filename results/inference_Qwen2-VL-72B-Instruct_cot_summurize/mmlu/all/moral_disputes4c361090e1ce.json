Aristotle argues that each thing has a specific function or purpose, and its goodness or excellence is determined by how well it fulfills that function. This idea is foundational to his virtue ethics, where human beings, as rational animals, have a function that is distinct from other entities, and their good is tied to fulfilling this rational function excellently."
