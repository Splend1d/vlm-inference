Upon approaching the car, the officer noticed a strong odor of alcohol and immediately asked whether the driver had been drinking. The driver admitted having had several alcoholic drinks that evening. The driver, charged with driving while intoxicated, moved to suppress the officer's testimony regarding the driver's statement about his drinking. The driver argued that the officer had elicited the statement without providing the requisite Miranda warnings. The prosecutor has responded that the statement The prosecutor has responded that the statement should be allowed in the prosecution's case-in- chief or, at a minimum, should be allowed as impeachment in the event the driver testifies and denies drinking. How should the court rule regarding the driver's statement admitting his drinking?\n\nA. The statement should be allowed, because although the driver was in custody, the officer's spontaneous utterance upon smelling alcohol did not rise to the level of interrogation.\nB. The statement should be allowed, because the driver was not in custody for Miranda purposes when the admission was made.\nC. The statement should be suppressed both in the prosecution's case-in-chief and as impeachment evidence, even if the driver testifies.\nD. The statement should be suppressed in the prosecution's case-in-chief, but it may be prosecution's case-in-chief, but it may be used as impeachment evidence if the driver testifies.\n"

                    "text": "To determine how the court should rule on the admissibility of the driver's statement admitting his drinking, we need to consider the legal principles surrounding custodial interrogation and the application of Miranda warnings.\n\n1. **Custody and Interrogation:**\n   - **Custody:** For Miranda warnings to apply, the individual must be in custody. This typically means they are not free to leave and are under the control of law enforcement.\n   - **Interrogation:** Miranda warnings are required before any custodial interrogation. Interrogation includes both express questioning and its functional equivalent, which is any words or actions by the police that the police should know are reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from the suspect.\n\n2. **Spontaneous Utterances:**\n   - If the statement was a spontaneous utterance (not elicited through interrogation), it would generally be admissible regardless of whether Miranda warnings were given.\n\n3. **Impeachment Evidence:**\n   - Even if a statement is suppressed in the prosecution's case-in-chief due to lack of Miranda warnings, it can still be used for impeachment purposes if the defendant testifies and contradicts the statement.\n\nGiven these considerations:\n\n- **Option A:** This suggests the statement should be allowed because it was a spontaneous utterance. However, the scenario does not clearly indicate that the statement was entirely spontaneous; rather, it was in response to the officer's question.\n  \n- **Option B:** This suggests the statement should be allowed because the driver was not in custody. This option hinges on whether the driver was considered to be in custody at the time of the statement. If the driver was not in custody, then no Miranda warning was necessary, and the statement could be admitted.\n\n- **Option C:** This suggests the statement should be suppressed both in the prosecution's case-in-chief and as impeachment evidence. This would only be appropriate if the driver was in custody and the statement was a result of interrogation without Miranda warnings.\n\n- **Option D:** This suggests the statement should be suppressed in the prosecution's case-in-chief but could be used for impeachment if the driver testifies. This aligns with the general rule that statements obtained without Miranda warnings cannot be used in the prosecution's case-in-chief but can be used for impeachment.\n\nBased on the information provided and the principles outlined above, the most accurate answer is:\n\n**D. The statement should be suppressed in the prosecution's case-in-chief, but it may be used as impeachment evidence if the driver testifies.**\n\nThis option reflects the nuanced application of Miranda warnings and the admissibility rules for statements obtained without them."
