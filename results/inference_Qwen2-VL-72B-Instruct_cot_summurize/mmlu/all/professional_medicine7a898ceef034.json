He says he intentionally burned his right thigh several times with a cigarette lighter 6 days ago. This morning he soaked his thigh in a tub of hot water and massaged it, after which a large amount of \"greenish fluid\" drained from the wound sites. The patient normally takes lithium carbonate but stopped 3 months ago after he lost his job. Medical history is otherwise unremarkable. Vital signs are temperature 39.2\u00b0C (102.5\u00b0F), pulse 170/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/60 mm Hg. Physical examination shows an edematous right lateral thigh with multiple burn sites with a white exudative appearance. There is erythema surrounding the burn areas with red streaks extending up the thigh. Palpation of the burn sites discloses fluctuance. Results of laboratory studies show a hemoglobin concentration of 14 g/dL and a leukocyte count of 19,000/mm3 . In addition to beginning antibiotic therapy, which of the following is the most appropriate next step?\n\nA. Incision and drainage\nB. Psychiatric consultation\nC. Topical silver sulfadiazine\nD. Transfer to a burn center\n"

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings suggest that he has developed an infection at the site of the burns. The presence of fluctuance on palpation indicates the presence of pus, which needs to be drained to prevent further spread of the infection. Antibiotic therapy should also be started to treat the infection. A psychiatric consultation may be necessary to address the patient's history of self-mutilation, but it is not the most urgent next step in this case. Topical silver sulfadiazine can be used to prevent infection in burn wounds, but it is not sufficient to treat an established infection. Transfer to a burn center may be necessary if the patient's condition does not improve or if there are complications, but it is not the most immediate next step."
