After an extensive search, he purchased a three-acre undeveloped tract of land for the purpose of developing a small shopping center. At the time the sale was finalized, the developer told his plans to the seller of the three-acre tract, and also mentioned that he was worried whether he had sufficient funds to complete the project. The seller agreed to lend money to the developer to allow for completion of the project. The seller then wrote out the following contract:\"In order to help the developer with his plans for development of a shopping center on the three- acre tract he has this day purchased from me, I will lend him $50,000 at 10 percent interest provided he signs a contract with a builder for construction of the shopping center on this tract. Repayment to me at the rate of $5,000 per year to be secured by a mortgage on the three-acre tract. \"Both parties then signed the contract. The seller's promise to lend $50,000 to the developer is\n\nA. a condition precedent in form but subsequent in substance to the developer's duty to enter into a building construction contract.\nB. a condition subsequent in form but precedent in substance to the developer's duty to enter into a building construction contract.\nC. a condition subsequent to the developer's duty to enter into a building construction contract.\nD. not a condition, either precedent or subsequent, to the developer's duty to enter into a building construction contract.\n"

This makes it appear to be a condition precedent because the seller's obligation to lend the money is dependent on the developer fulfilling a specific action first (signing the building construction contract). However, in substance, the seller's promise to lend the money is subsequent because it occurs after the developer has already taken the necessary step of entering into the building construction contract. Therefore, the correct answer is A."
