It targeted crops Africans don't grow and eat.\n\nThe Green Revolution, which occurred in the mid-20th century, primarily focused on increasing the yield of staple crops such as wheat and rice through the use of high-yielding varieties, chemical fertilizers, and improved irrigation techniques. These crops were not widely grown or consumed in many parts of Africa, where the staple foods often include crops like millet, sorghum, cassava, and yams. As a result, the benefits of the Green Revolution were not as pronounced in Africa compared to other regions like Asia and Latin America."
