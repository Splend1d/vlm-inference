Rubidium is the limiting reagent.\n\nAfter the reaction, all of the rubidium will be consumed, forming RbBr. The amount of RbBr formed can be calculated as follows:\n\n\\[ \\text{moles of RbBr} = \\text{moles of Rb} = 0.0117 \\text{ mol} \\]\n\nThe mass of RbBr produced:\n\\[ \\text{mass of RbBr} = \\text{moles of RbBr} \\times \\text{molar mass of RbBr} \\]\n\\[ \\text{molar mass of RbBr} = 85.47 \\text{ g/mol} + 79.90 \\text{ g/mol} = 165.37 \\text{ g/mol} \\]\n\\[ \\text{mass of RbBr} = 0.0117 \\text{ mol} \\times 165.37 \\text{ g/mol} \\approx 1.93 \\text{ g} \\]\n\nSince bromine is in excess, there will be some bromine left unreacted. The amount of bromine left can be calculated as follows:\n\n\\[ \\text{moles of Br}_2 \\text{ left} = \\text{initial moles of Br}_2 - \\text{moles of Br}_2 \\text{ reacted} \\]\n\\[ \\text{moles of Br}_2 \\text{ reacted} = \\frac{0.0117 \\text{ mol}}{2} = 0.00585 \\text{ mol} \\]\n\\[ \\text{moles of Br}_2 \\text{ left} = 0.0063 \\text{ mol} - 0.00585 \\text{ mol} = 0.00045 \\text{ mol} \\]\n\nThe mass of bromine left:\n\\[ \\text{mass of Br}_2 \\text{ left} = \\text{moles of Br}_2 \\text{ left} \\times \\text{molar mass of Br}_2 \\]\n\\[ \\text{mass of Br}_2 \\text{ left} = 0.00045 \\text{ mol} \\times 159.80 \\text{ g/mol} \\approx 0.072 \\text{ g} \\]\n\nTherefore, the reaction vessel"
