When a preliminary injunction hearing could not be scheduled within the original 14-day period, the court extended the TRO for another 30 days. The lender appealed the court's order extending the TRO. The homeowner has moved to dismiss the appeal. Is the appellate court likely to dismiss the appeal?\n\nA. No, because a TRO is immediately appealable.\nB. No, because the 30-day extension makes the TRO equivalent to a preliminary injunction and therefore appealable.\nC. Yes, because a TRO is not appealable under the interlocutory appeals statute.\nD. Yes, because there is no final judgment from which an appeal may be taken.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is:\n\nC. Yes, because a TRO is not appealable under the interlocutory appeals statute.\n\nTemporary restraining orders (TROs) are generally considered interlocutory orders, meaning they are made during the course of litigation but do not resolve the entire case. Under the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, interlocutory orders are typically not appealable unless specifically provided for by statute. Since a TRO is not one of the few types of interlocutory orders that are appealable, the appellate court is likely to dismiss the appeal.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while some interlocutory orders are immediately appealable, TROs are not among them. Option B is incorrect because even if the TRO were extended to resemble a preliminary injunction, it would still be considered an interlocutory order and thus not appealable. Option D is incorrect because the lack of a final judgment does not directly determine the appealability of a TRO; rather, it is the nature of the order itself that determines its appealability."
