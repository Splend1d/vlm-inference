All of these options.\n\nSecuritization, in the context of international relations and security studies, refers to the process by which an issue is framed as a matter of security, thereby enabling extraordinary measures to be taken to address it. This process can lead to several tangible benefits:\n\nA. **Injecting Urgency**: By framing an issue as a security threat, securitization can create a sense of urgency that prompts immediate action and sustained mobilization of political support and resources.\n\nB. **Efficient Handling of Complex Problems**: Securitization can streamline decision-making processes and resource allocation, potentially leading to more efficient handling of complex issues.\n\nC. **Mobilizing Popular Support**: By linking an issue to national or collective security, securitization can mobilize public opinion and garner widespread support for policies and measures that might otherwise face resistance.\n\nTherefore, all the options listed above are commonly regarded as tangible benefits of the securitization process."
