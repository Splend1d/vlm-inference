A small but significant percentage of the genome of modern humans who trace their ancestry to Europe and Asia originated with Neandertals.\n\nThis statement is supported by genetic studies that have shown that non-African populations of modern humans (those outside of Africa) have inherited a small percentage of their DNA from Neandertals, indicating interbreeding between the two groups. This interbreeding likely occurred when anatomically modern humans migrated out of Africa and encountered Neandertals in Eurasia."
