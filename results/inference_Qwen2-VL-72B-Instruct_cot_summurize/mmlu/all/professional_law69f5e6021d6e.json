                    "text": "The scenario described involves a situation where an injured claimant seeks compensation from an insurance company after a negligent motorist caused them harm. The motorist's insurance policy has a limited coverage amount, and the insurance company refused to pay the policy limits despite being provided with necessary documentation. A jury awarded the injured claimant significantly more than the policy limit, and the injured claimant obtained an assignment from the negligent motorist to pursue any rights the motorist might have against the insurer.\n\nTo determine whether the court will likely compel the insurance company to pay the full amount of the jury verdict to the injured person, we need to consider several legal principles:\n\n1. **Policy Limit**: The insurance policy has a limit of $15,000 for third-party liability. This means that the insurance company is only obligated to pay up to this amount for claims arising from the policyholder's negligence.\n\n2. **Bad Faith**: Insurance companies have an implied duty to act in good faith and deal fairly with their policyholders. If an insurance company unreasonably refuses to pay a valid claim within the policy limits, it may be liable for bad faith.\n\n3. **Assignment of Rights**: The injured claimant obtained an assignment from the negligent motorist, which allows the claimant to pursue any rights the motorist has against the insurer. However, the validity and enforceability of such assignments vary by jurisdiction.\n\n4. **Excess Judgment**: If the jury award exceeds the policy limit, the injured claimant typically has the right to seek the excess amount directly from the negligent motorist, not necessarily from the insurance company.\n\nGiven these considerations, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **The policy limit is $15,000 and that is all that can be collected by the injured person \u2013 there is no action for bad faith on an insurance contract.**\n   - This statement is partially correct regarding the policy limit but overlooks the potential for a bad faith claim. If the insurance company acted in bad faith by refusing to pay the policy limits when presented with sufficient evidence, the injured claimant could potentially sue for bad faith.\n\nB. **The insurance company breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing that is implicit in every insurance contract and must pay the full amount of the judgment.**\n   - This statement suggests that the insurance company's refusal to pay the policy limits constitutes bad faith, which could lead to additional damages beyond the policy limit. However, the insurance company is still only obligated to pay the policy limit unless proven to have acted in bad faith.\n\nC. **Bad faith is personal to the insured party and his insurer \u2013 the assignment was invalid, and the injured person has no claim to compel the insurer to pay.**\n   - This statement correctly notes that bad faith claims are typically between the insured and the insurer. However, the validity of the assignment and its impact on the injured claimant's ability to pursue the insurer depends on specific jurisdictional laws.\n\nD. **The injured party must enforce his entire judgment against the motorist and may never pursue the insurer for that amount.**\n   - This statement is generally accurate in that the injured party can enforce the excess judgment against the negligent motorist. However, if the insurance company acted in bad faith, the injured party might have grounds to pursue the insurer for the policy limits or additional damages.\n\nConsidering the above analysis, the most accurate answer is:\n\n**B. The insurance company breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing that is implicit in every insurance contract and must pay the full amount of the judgment.**\n\nThis option acknowledges the potential for a bad faith claim and the possibility that the insurance company may be compelled to pay more than just the policy limit if found to have acted in bad faith."
