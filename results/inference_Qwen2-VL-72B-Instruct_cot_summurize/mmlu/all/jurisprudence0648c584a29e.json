In other words, if someone intentionally creates a situation where another person reasonably fears that they are about to be harmed, it constitutes assault.\n\n2. **Battery**: Battery is the actual infliction of harmful or offensive contact upon another person without their consent. It involves physical contact.\n\nIn this case:\n- Donny intended to injure Sally with the knife, which created a reasonable apprehension of imminent harm for Sally. Therefore, Donny can be held liable for assault.\n- However, Donny missed Sally, so there was no physical contact. Thus, Donny cannot be held liable for battery.\n\nGiven these definitions and the details of the scenario:\n\n**Final Answer: B. Donny will be liable for assault, but not battery.**"
