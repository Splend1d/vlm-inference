Therefore, any payable from a subsidiary to the parent would not be reported in the consolidated balance sheet because it would be offset by the corresponding receivable on the parent's side.\n\nHowever, in the individual balance sheets of each entity (the parent and the subsidiary), these payables and receivables would be reported as they reflect the actual financial position of each entity before consolidation.\n\nGiven this context:\n\n- Strut Co.'s balance sheet (the subsidiary) should report the payable to Plane Co.\n- Plane Co.'s balance sheet (the parent) should also report the receivable from Strut Co.\n\nBut in the consolidated balance sheet, this payable/receivable would be eliminated.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB.
