The increased levels of globalization in trade, finance, and movement have produced an environment conducive to TNC by making it easier for criminals to move illicit profits and illegal goods, provide service, and smuggle persons across borders.\nB. The wave of political transitions to democracy and economic transitions to free market capitalism since the 1980s - a phenomenon which frequently occurred simultaneously in the same country - have undermined state capacity to enforce rule of law and created new opportunities for organized crime groups to penetrate societies in transition.\nC. The sharp increase in civil conflicts around the globe also created a new generation of refugees. These diasporas have provided the family and ethnic ties that help facilitate a transnational criminal enterprise.\nD. All of these options.\n"

Globalization has indeed facilitated the operations of Transnational Criminal Organizations (TNCs) by making it easier for them to move illicit profits, illegal goods, and people across borders, thereby challenging the ability of states to control their own territories and enforce laws.\n\nB. Political and economic transitions towards democracy and free market capitalism have often led to periods of instability and weakened state institutions, creating opportunities for organized crime to flourish and penetrate societies in transition.\n\nC. Civil conflicts have resulted in large diaspora populations that can be exploited by criminal networks, using familial and ethnic ties to support transnational criminal activities.\n\nTherefore, all of these factors have played a role in undermining state authority in the post-Cold War era."
