We differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to time \\( t \\):\n\n\\[ 2x \\frac{dx}{dt} + 2y \\frac{dy}{dt} = 0 \\]\n\nSubstitute \\( \\frac{dx}{dt} = 2 \\) into the equation:\n\n\\[ 2x(2) + 2y \\frac{dy}{dt} = 0 \\]\n\\[ 4x + 2y \\frac{dy}{dt} = 0 \\]\n\nNow, we need to find \\( x \\) when \\( y = 3 \\). Using the Pythagorean theorem again:\n\n\\[ x^2 + 3^2 = 81 \\]\n\\[ x^2 + 9 = 81 \\]\n\\[ x^2 = 72 \\]\n\\[ x = \\sqrt{72} \\]\n\\[ x = 6\\sqrt{2} \\]\n\nNow substitute \\( x = 6\\sqrt{2} \\) and \\( y = 3 \\) into the differentiated equation:\n\n\\[ 4(6\\sqrt{2}) + 2(3) \\frac{dy}{dt} = 0 \\]\n\\[ 24\\sqrt{2} + 6 \\frac{dy}{dt} = 0 \\]\n\\[ 6 \\frac{dy}{dt} = -24\\sqrt{2} \\]\n\\[ \\frac{dy}{dt} = -4\\sqrt{2} \\]\n\nSo, the top end of the ladder is sliding downward at a rate of \\( -4\\sqrt{2} \\) meters per second (the negative sign indicates the direction is downward).\n\nThe correct answer is C. 4*sqrt(2)."
