C. training, the student was required to spend three weeks at a camp for Marine Corps. summer field exercises. While at the camp, the student was given a new synthetic helmet to wear during her basic training. An agency purchased the new high-technology helmets for the Army and Marine Corps. to replace the old \"steel pot\" headgear worn for decades by U. S. soldiers. These new synthetic helmets were manufactured by a corporation and were made of Kevlar, an extremely tough fiber material with high energy-absorbing qualities that made it stronger in some ways than steel. When the student received her helmet from the Marine Corps. , it was packaged in the original carton supplied by the corporation. On the box, there was a picture that depicted an off-duty marine wearing the helmet while riding a bicycle. One afternoon after training, the student decided to take a ride on her bicycle. Believing that it could be used as a bicycle helmet, the student decided to use it for that purpose. During the ride, the student hit a deep pothole that caused her to be thrown headfirst from the bicycle. As she was flying through the air, the strap from her helmet came loose, and the helmet fell off her head. The student landed on a lawn and was temporarily knocked unconscious. She suffered serious head injuries. If the student asserts a claim against the corporation to recover damages for her injuries, she will most likely\n\nA. prevail, because under the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur negligence can be inferred from the fact that the helmet came off the student's head.\nB. prevail, because the original package depicted a picture of a cyclist wearing the helmet.\nC. not prevail, because the student was not using the helmet for its intended purpose.\nD. not prevail, because the helmet had been properly designed by the corporation for its intended use by the Army and Marine Corps.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is:\n\nC. not prevail, because the student was not using the helmet for its intended purpose.\n\nHere\u2019s why:\n\n1. **Intended Use**: The helmet was specifically designed and manufactured for military use, particularly for the Army and Marine Corps. It was not intended for civilian use or for activities such as cycling. The fact that the helmet was depicted being worn by an off-duty marine on a bicycle does not change its primary intended use, which is for military purposes.\n\n2. **Misuse of Product**: The student chose to use the helmet for a purpose other than what it was designed for. This constitutes misuse of the product. Manufacturers are generally not liable for injuries resulting from the misuse of their products if the product was otherwise safe for its intended use.\n\n3. **Design and Manufacturing**: The helmet was designed and manufactured for military use, where it would be secured properly and used in conjunction with other protective gear. The student\u2019s injury occurred due to the helmet coming off during a civilian activity, which is outside the scope of its intended use.\n\n4. **Legal Doctrine**: The doctrine of res ipsa loquitur (the thing speaks for itself) typically applies when the circumstances surrounding an accident suggest that negligence must have been involved. However, this doctrine does not apply here because the helmet was not being used for its intended purpose, and thus any failure of the helmet cannot be attributed to the manufacturer\u2019s negligence.\n\nTherefore, the student\u2019s claim against the corporation is unlikely to succeed because she was not using the helmet for its intended purpose, and the helmet was designed and manufactured for military use, not for civilian activities like cycling."
