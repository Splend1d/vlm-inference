The defendant was inside the store waiting for his coffee when a member of the city's parking enforcement department drove by the vehicle. Seeing that there was no handicapped sticker on the car, the parking official stopped and started ticketing the vehicle. When the defendant came outside, he got into an argument with the parking official. After the defendant became verbally abusive, the parking official told him to desist or he was going to impound the vehicle. After the defendant continued his badgering, the parking official told him that he was impounding the vehicle and called the station house for officer assistance. A few minutes later, a police officer arrived on the scene. He asked the defendant for identification and then proceeded to frisk him for weapons. The officer found a clear vial containing heroin in the defendant's back pocket. He then placed the defendant under arrest. Thereupon, the parking official went into the defendant's car and began an inventory search. In this jurisdiction, parking enforcement personnel have statutory authority to conduct inventory searches of impounded vehicles. The parking official did not find anything of interest. After the police officer placed the defendant in the patrol car, the officer asked the parking official if he could search the vehicle, to which the parking official responded yes. The officer looked under the floor mat and found a bag containing marijuana. The defendant was taken to the station house and charged with unlawful possession of heroin and marijuana. Prior to trial, the defense filed a motion to exclude the heroin and marijuana from being admitted into evidence. The motion will be granted with respect to\n\nA. the heroin only.\nB. the marijuana only.\nC. both the heroin and the marijuana.\nD. neither the heroin nor the marijuana.\n"

This falls within the scope of a Terry stop and frisk, which is permitted under the Fourth Amendment when an officer has reasonable suspicion that the person may be armed and dangerous. Therefore, the discovery of the heroin is admissible as evidence.\n\nOn the other hand, the marijuana was found during a search conducted by the police officer after the vehicle had already been inventoried by the parking official. While parking enforcement personnel have statutory authority to conduct inventory searches, police officers do not have the same authority unless they have probable cause or consent. Since the parking official had already completed the inventory search and found nothing of interest, the subsequent search by the police officer would likely be considered unreasonable and a violation of the Fourth Amendment. Therefore, the marijuana found during this second search would be excluded from evidence."
