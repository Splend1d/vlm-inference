Almost immediately, photoelectrons would be produced with a kinetic energy equal to the energy of the incident photons minus the work function of the metal.\nC.

                    "text": "The correct answer is:\n\nD. Nothing would happen.\n\nExplanation:\nThe photoelectric effect is governed by the principle that the energy of a photon must exceed the work function of the material in order to eject an electron. The intensity of the light does not affect whether or not photoelectrons are emitted; only the frequency (or equivalently, the wavelength) of the light matters. In this case, since low-intensity visible light of 550 nm did not produce any photoelectrons, increasing the intensity of the same light will not change this outcome. The energy of the photons at 550 nm is insufficient to overcome the work function of the metal, regardless of how intense the light is. Therefore, no photoelectrons will be produced even with a dramatic increase in intensity."
