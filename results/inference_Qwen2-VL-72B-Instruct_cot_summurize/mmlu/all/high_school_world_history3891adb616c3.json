Here we had not only a servile war, but we had a war of religion, a war of race, and a war of revenge, of hope, of national promptings to shake off the yoke of a stranger, and to re-establish the full power of native chiefs, and the full sway of native religions. Whatever the causes of the mutiny and the revolt, it is clear enough that one of the modes by which the leaders, as if by common instinct, determined to effect their end was, the destruction of every white man, woman or child who fell into their hands.\nBritish journalist William Howard Russell, My Indian Mutlny Diary, 1860\nViolence, it must be emphasized, was an essential component of the British presence in India. A dominant power is always uneasy with violence directed against it. The right to violence is, therefore, everywhere a privilege that authority enjoys and refuses to share with those under it: power always insists on violence as its exclusive monopoly. British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin. This was the condition of their domination, of their superiority: rulers and ruled were arranged hierarchically as superior and inferior races, as civilized and uncivilized. And this superiority manifested itself by denying to the Indians a \"humanness\"; by treating them and conceiving of them as animals.\nRudrangshu Mukherjee, \"The Kanpur [Cawnpore] Massacres in India in the Revolt of 1857,\" 1990\nAccording to the second passage, the Cawnpore Massacre\n\nA. was justifiable according to local military custom, even if it violated Western military norms.\nB. can be viewed as a reaction to the systemic brute force with which the British governed India.\nC. should be praised as a brave patriotic blow against British colonial oppression.\nD. seems to have been the product of a well-organized and long-premeditated conspiracy.\n"

It emphasizes that violence was an essential part of British dominance and that they had constructed a monopoly over violence.\n\n2. **Key Points from the Passage**:\n   - Violence was an essential component of British presence in India.\n   - Dominant powers are uneasy with violence directed against them.\n   - Power insists on violence as its exclusive monopoly.\n   - British rule in India had a monopoly on violence.\n   - The revolt of 1857 shattered this monopoly by matching official violence with indigenous violence.\n   - The British bodies had certain dignities in India due to their birth and skin color.\n   - Rulers and ruled were arranged hierarchically as superior and inferior races.\n   - The British denied \"humanness\" to Indians, treating them as animals.\n\n3. **Analyzing Each Option**:\n   - **Option A**: \"was justifiable according to local military custom, even if it violated Western military norms.\"\n     - The passage does not discuss local military customs or justify the massacre based on such norms.\n   \n   - **Option B**: \"can be viewed as a reaction to the systemic brute force with which the British governed India.\"\n     - This option aligns with the passage's emphasis on the British monopoly on violence and the indigenous response to it. The revolt is seen as a reaction to British brutality.\n   \n   - **Option C**: \"should be praised as a brave patriotic blow against British colonial oppression.\"\n     - The passage does not suggest that the massacre should be praised; rather, it focuses on the nature of violence and the hierarchical structure of British rule.\n   \n   - **Option D**: \"seems to have been the product of a well-organized and long-premeditated conspiracy.\"\n     - There is no mention in the passage about the organization or premeditation of the massacre.\n\nBased on the analysis, the most accurate interpretation of the second passage is that the Cawnpore Massacre can be viewed as a reaction to the systemic brute force with which the British governed India.\n\n**Final Answer: B. can be viewed as a reaction to the systemic brute force with which the British governed India.**"
