Cut marks on animal bones that were made by butchering with pieces of stone indicate that early hominids were capable of using tools to process meat, which suggests the presence of stone tool technology.\n\nB. The anatomy of Australopithecus africanus hands and analogies with studies of living non-human primates that demonstrate tool use provide insights into the potential capabilities of early hominids to manipulate objects and create tools.\n\nC. Simple stone cores, anvil stones, and flakes found at the Lomekwi 3 site in West Turkana, Kenya, directly demonstrate the presence of stone tools and their use by early hominids.\n\nTogether, these lines of evidence support the idea that hominids were making and using stone tools by at least 3.3 million years ago."
