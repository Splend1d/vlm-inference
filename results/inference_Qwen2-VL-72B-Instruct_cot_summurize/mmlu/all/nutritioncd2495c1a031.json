May be affected through the epigenetic effects of intrauterine nutritional inadequacy\n\nPrenatal programming refers to the idea that experiences during prenatal development can have long-lasting effects on an individual's health and well-being. One way this can occur is through epigenetic changes, which are modifications to DNA that do not alter the genetic code but can affect gene expression. Intrauterine nutritional inadequacy, such as maternal malnutrition or excessive weight gain during pregnancy, can lead to epigenetic changes that may increase the risk of certain health conditions later in life, including obesity and high blood pressure. Therefore, option B is the most accurate statement about prenatal programming."
