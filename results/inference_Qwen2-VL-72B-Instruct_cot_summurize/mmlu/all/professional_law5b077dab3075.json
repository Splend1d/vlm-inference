The patient's cancer was diagnosed six months later, based on the same X-ray, when the patient sought a second opinion. In the interim, the cancer had spread. Fact and expert discovery have been completed in the action. The hospital has moved for summary judgment. In support of its motion, the hospital has submitted a memorandum identifying facts that it claims are not in dispute. It has also cited and attached supporting exhibits, including a report from the hospital's radiologist, who found no signs of cancer on the X-ray. What is the best way for the patient to raise a genuine dispute of material fact?\n\nA. Submit a report from the patient's expert radiologist contradicting the findings in the report of the hospital's radiologist.\nB. Submit an affidavit from the patient's attorney detailing his conversations with the patient's expert radiologist.\nC. Submit an affidavit from the patient's expert radiologist with findings that contradict the report of the hospital's radiologist.\nD.

Submit an affidavit from the patient's expert radiologist with findings that contradict the report of the hospital's radiologist.\n\nAn affidavit from the patient's expert radiologist would provide direct evidence from a qualified professional that directly addresses the disputed issue (the presence or absence of cancer signs on the X-ray). This would create a genuine dispute of material fact regarding whether the hospital staff should have diagnosed the cancer based on the initial X-ray, which is crucial for the patient's medical malpractice claim."
