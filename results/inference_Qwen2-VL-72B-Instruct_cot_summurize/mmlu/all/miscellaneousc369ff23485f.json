Take periodic breaks to view natural lighting\n\nTaking periodic breaks to view natural lighting can help reduce screen-induced eyestrain by giving your eyes a chance to rest and adjust to different light levels. This can help reduce eye strain and fatigue, which can occur when you spend long periods of time looking at a computer screen.\n\nUsing eye drops regularly may also be helpful in reducing dryness and irritation, but it is not a substitute for taking breaks and allowing your eyes to rest. Changing the choice of software programs or limiting the resolution on the monitor may not have a significant impact on reducing screen-induced eyestrain."
