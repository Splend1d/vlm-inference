It could be seen as a helpful or considerate act.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n- \"I had to sneeze, so I quickly turned toward my mother-in-law.\"\n- This action involves sneezing in close proximity to another person, potentially spreading germs or viruses.\n- Given the context of 2020 and the heightened awareness of health risks due to the COVID-19 pandemic, sneezing directly towards someone could be considered morally wrong due to the potential health risk it poses.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n- Scenario 1 is not morally wrong.\n- Scenario 2 is morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong"
