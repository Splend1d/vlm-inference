It does not inherently involve harm or wrongdoing.\n- There is no indication that renting the boat has any negative consequences or violates ethical principles.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n\"I put the candy-coated pills on a low shelf because my kid brother thinks they're candy.\"\n- Placing pills where a child can easily access them, especially when the child might mistake them for candy, poses a significant risk to the child's safety.\n- This action could lead to accidental ingestion and potential harm or even death, which is clearly against ordinary moral standards.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n- Scenario 1 does not involve a morally wrong action.\n- Scenario 2 involves a morally wrong action due to the potential harm it poses to the child.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong"
