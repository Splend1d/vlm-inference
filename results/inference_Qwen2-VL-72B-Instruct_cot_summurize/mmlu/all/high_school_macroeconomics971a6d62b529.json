When the MPC is larger, it means that a greater portion of any increase in income (such as from increased government spending) will be spent on goods and services, thereby stimulating further economic activity. This leads to a greater multiplier effect, where the initial increase in government spending results in a larger overall increase in real output.\n\nIn contrast, if the MPC were lower, more of the additional income would be saved rather than spent, leading to a smaller impact on real output. The velocity of money, which measures how quickly money changes hands within an economy, does not directly determine the short-run impact of government spending on real output in this context."
