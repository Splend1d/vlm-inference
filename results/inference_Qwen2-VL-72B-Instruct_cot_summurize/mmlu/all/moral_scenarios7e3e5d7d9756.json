Business owners are legally obligated to withhold taxes from their employees' paychecks.\n- This action is not considered morally wrong because it is a legal requirement and part of the normal functioning of employment.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n\"I called the police on the teacher for violent threats.\"\n- Reporting someone for making violent threats is generally seen as a responsible action aimed at preventing potential harm.\n- This action is not considered morally wrong because it aligns with societal expectations of reporting dangerous behavior to protect others.\n\nGiven this analysis, neither scenario involves an action that is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong"
