The see-saw will balance when the clockwise moment equals the anticlockwise moment about the fulcrum.\n\nGiven:\n- Mass of the girl = \\( m \\)\n- Mass of the boy = \\( 2m \\)\n- Original distance of both from the fulcrum = \\( d \\)\n\nThe initial moment about the fulcrum is:\n- Moment due to the boy = \\( 2m \\times d \\)\n- Moment due to the girl = \\( m \\times d \\)\n\nSince \\( 2m \\times d > m \\times d \\), the see-saw tilts towards the boy.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Move the boy to half his original distance from the fulcrum:**\n   - New distance for the boy = \\( \\frac{d}{2} \\)\n   - New moment due to the boy = \\( 2m \\times \\frac{d}{2} = m \\times d \\)\n   - Moment due to the girl remains \\( m \\times d \\)\n   - Both moments are equal, so the see-saw balances.\n\nB. **Move the girl to double her original distance from the fulcrum:**\n   - New distance for the girl = \\( 2d \\)\n   - New moment due to the girl = \\( m \\times 2d = 2m \\times d \\)\n   - Moment due to the boy remains \\( 2m \\times d \\)\n   - Both moments are equal, so the see-saw balances.\n\nC. **Allow a second girl of mass \\( m \\) to join the first:**\n   - Combined mass of girls = \\( m + m = 2m \\)\n   - Moment due to the girls = \\( 2m \\times d \\)\n   - Moment due to the boy remains \\( 2m \\times d \\)\n   - Both moments are equal, so the see-saw balances.\n\nD. **Move the fulcrum to half its original distance from the boy:**\n   - If the fulcrum is moved closer to the boy, the distance of the boy from the new fulcrum becomes less than \\( \\frac{d}{2} \\).\n   - Let's assume the new distance of the boy from the fulcrum is \\( x \\), where \\( x < \\frac{d}{2} \\).\n   - New moment due to the boy = \\( 2m \\times x \\)\n   - Moment due to the girl remains \\( m \\times d \\)\n   - Since \\( x < \\frac{d}{2} \\), \\( 2m \\times x < m \\times d \\)\n   - The see-saw will tilt towards the girl, not balance.\n\nTherefore, the option that would NOT balance the see-saw is:\n\n**D.
