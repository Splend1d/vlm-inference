The patient was prescribed codeine after the procedure and instructed to take the medication every 4 hours, but she has continued pain despite adherence to this analgesic regimen. Other members of her family also have experienced poor pain control with codeine. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for this therapeutic failure?\n\nA. Decreased absorption of codeine\nB. Decreased metabolism of codeine to morphine\nC. Deficiency of \u03ba receptors\nD. Increased plasma protein-binding of codeine\n"

Decreased metabolism of codeine to morphine\n\nCodeine is a prodrug that requires metabolic conversion by the liver enzyme CYP2D6 to its active metabolite, morphine, in order to exert its analgesic effects. Some individuals may have genetic variations in the CYP2D6 gene that result in reduced or absent enzyme activity, leading to decreased metabolism of codeine to morphine. This can result in inadequate pain relief even when the prescribed dose is taken as directed. Therefore, the most likely explanation for the therapeutic failure in this case is decreased metabolism of codeine to morphine due to genetic variation in the CYP2D6 enzyme."
