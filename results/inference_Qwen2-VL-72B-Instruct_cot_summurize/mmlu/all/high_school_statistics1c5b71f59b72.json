The registrar decides to take a random sample of 150 students from the current directory of students and determine the number of students with the correct addresses on record. He then uses this information to construct a 95 percent confidence interval. Which of the following statements must be true?\n\nA. The true proportion of students at this university with the correct address on record is within the confidence interval constructed.\nB. Ninety-five percent of students at this university have the correct address on record.\nC. The true proportion of students at this university with the correct addresses on record is within the confidence interval 95 percent of the time.\nD. The sample proportion of students at this university with the correct address on record is within the confidence interval.\n"

The true proportion of students at this university with the correct addresses on record is within the confidence interval 95 percent of the time.\n\nExplanation:\nWhen constructing a 95% confidence interval, it means that if we were to repeat the sampling process many times, about 95% of those intervals would contain the true population parameter (in this case, the true proportion of students with the correct address). This statement reflects the interpretation of what a confidence interval represents in terms of repeated sampling. \n\n- A. This statement is not necessarily true for any single confidence interval; it's a probabilistic statement about the coverage rate over many intervals.\n- B. This statement misinterprets the meaning of a confidence interval; it does not provide a direct estimate of the proportion of students with correct addresses.\n- D. This statement is incorrect because the sample proportion is used to construct the confidence interval, but it is not the focus of the interval itself. The interval aims to estimate the true population proportion, not the sample proportion."
