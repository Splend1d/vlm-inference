There are people who seem to have no notion of sketching a character, or observing and describing salient points, either in persons or things: the good lady evidently belonged to this class; my queries puzzled, but did not draw her out. Mr. Rochester was Mr. Rochester in her eyes, a gentleman, a landed proprietor\u201a\u00c4\u00ecnothing more: she inquired and searched no further, and evidently wondered at my wish to gain a more definite notion of his identity. Mrs. Fairfax differs from the speaker in that Mrs. Fairfax\n\nA. has more interest in the complexities of people's personalities\nB. judges people by their social station in life\nC. is more willing to take people at face value\nD. has a more positive opinion of Mr. Rochester\n"

The speaker wants to know more about Mr. Rochester's character and identity, but Mrs. Fairfax provides limited information.\n\n2. **Analyzing Mrs. Fairfax's Perspective**:\n   - Mrs. Fairfax views Mr. Rochester simply as \"Mr. Rochester,\" a gentleman and a landed proprietor.\n   - She does not delve into his personality or other salient points.\n   - She seems puzzled by the speaker's desire for a more detailed understanding of Mr. Rochester.\n\n3. **Evaluating Each Option**:\n   - **Option A**: \"has more interest in the complexities of people's personalities\" \u2013 This is incorrect because Mrs. Fairfax shows little interest in delving into Mr. Rochester's personality.\n   - **Option B**: \"judges people by their social station in life\" \u2013 While Mrs. Fairfax does mention Mr. Rochester's social status, it doesn't necessarily mean she judges him solely by this criterion. The passage doesn't provide enough evidence to support this conclusion.\n   - **Option C**: \"is more willing to take people at face value\" \u2013 This option fits well with the passage. Mrs. Fairfax accepts Mr. Rochester at face value without seeking deeper insights into his character.\n   - **Option D**: \"has a more positive opinion of Mr. Rochester\" \u2013 The passage does not provide any indication that Mrs. Fairfax has a particularly positive or negative opinion of Mr. Rochester beyond his social status.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n**C. is more willing to take people at face value**"
