Including working class organizations in political bargaining and representation.\n\nIn the context of the labor movement in the 19th century, \"incorporation\" referred to the process by which working-class organizations, such as trade unions, were included in the political system and given a voice in political bargaining and representation. This was often seen as a way to integrate the working class into the broader society and to give them a stake in the political process. It was also seen as a way to reduce social tensions and to promote stability by giving workers a legitimate channel through which to express their grievances and to negotiate for better working conditions and wages."
