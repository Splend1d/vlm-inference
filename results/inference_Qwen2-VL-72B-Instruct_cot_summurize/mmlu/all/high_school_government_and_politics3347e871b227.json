A national election recalling an unpopular judge.\n\nFederal judges, including Supreme Court justices, are appointed for life and cannot be recalled through a national election. They can only be removed from office through the process of impeachment by the House of Representatives and conviction by the Senate. Therefore, a national election cannot limit the influence of the federal courts in this manner."
