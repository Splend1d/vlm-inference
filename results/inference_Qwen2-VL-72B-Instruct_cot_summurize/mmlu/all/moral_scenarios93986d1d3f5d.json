However, it is not typically considered a morally wrong action in the sense of violating ethical principles or laws.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n- The main character took pictures of women walking on the runway.\n- Taking pictures at a public event like a fashion show is generally acceptable and does not violate ordinary moral standards unless there are specific restrictions or privacy concerns involved.\n\nGiven this analysis, neither scenario appears to involve actions that are clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong"
