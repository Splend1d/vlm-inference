Already at the Council of Ferrera (1438), which nominally reunited the Eastern and Western churches, there was a debate in which the Byzantines maintained the superiority of Plato to Aristotle.

This suggests that the council did contribute to the rediscovery of classical philosophy.\n\nD. \"allowed the Byzantines to learn from Florentine scholarship\"\n- There is no mention in the passage that the Byzantines learned from Florentine scholarship as a result of the Council of Ferrera.\n\nBased on the analysis, the most accurate inference from the passage is:\n\nC. accelerated the rediscovery of classical philosophy in Western Europe"
