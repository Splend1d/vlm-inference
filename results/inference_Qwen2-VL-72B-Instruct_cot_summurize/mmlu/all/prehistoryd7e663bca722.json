It features large pyramids and plazas but does not have earthworks with concentric ridges in a semicircle.\n\nB. **Stonehenge** - Located in England, Stonehenge is famous for its circular arrangement of standing stones. While it includes earthworks, these do not consist of concentric ridges in a semicircle.\n\nC. **Poverty Point** - This archaeological site in Louisiana, USA, is known for its monumental earthworks, including six concentric semi-circular ridges. These earthworks date back to approximately 3,500 years ago, making this a strong candidate.\n\nD. **Gobekli Tepe** - Located in Turkey, Gobekli Tepe is one of the oldest known temple complexes, featuring stone pillars and carvings. However, it does not have earthworks with concentric ridges in a semicircle.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Poverty Point"
