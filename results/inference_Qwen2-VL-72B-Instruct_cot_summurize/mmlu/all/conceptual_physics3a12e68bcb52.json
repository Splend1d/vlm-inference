This change in the atomic number means the atom transforms into a different element.\n\nSimilarly, when an atom emits a beta particle (either a beta-minus particle, which is an electron, or a beta-plus particle, which is a positron), the atomic number changes due to the transformation of a neutron into a proton (beta-minus decay) or vice versa (beta-plus decay). This also results in the atom becoming a different element.\n\nTherefore, in both cases of alpha and beta decay, the atom always becomes an atom of a different element."
