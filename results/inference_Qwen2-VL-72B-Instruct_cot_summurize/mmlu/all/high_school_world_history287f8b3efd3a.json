Latin America has had a rich culture for centuries.\n\nThe poet, Rub\u00e9n Dar\u00edo, uses the phrase \"our America, that has had poets since ancient times, . . . that consulted the stars\" to emphasize the long-standing cultural richness and intellectual heritage of Latin America. By mentioning ancient poets and the practice of consulting the stars, he highlights the deep historical roots and sophisticated traditions of the region, suggesting that Latin America has a profound and enduring cultural legacy. This serves to counterbalance the implied threat or challenge posed by the United States (referred to as \"you\" in the poem) and to assert the inherent value and resilience of Latin American culture."
