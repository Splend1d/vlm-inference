The owner of a publication company was prosecuted and convicted of violating the state obscenity law by mailing adults sexual literature that appealed to their prurient interests. During the owner's trial, the judge instructed the jury that determining if the mailed materials were obscene depended in part on whether they were offensive to the average or normal person under contemporary community standards, and that the community standards test must be considered in light of the fact that many children reside in the community. Furthermore, the judge instructed the jury that in determining whether the materials were obscene, it could also consider evidence of pandering, or whether the materials were marketed purposely to appeal to the recipients' prurient interest in sex. The owner appealed her conviction, alleging a denial of her First Amendment rights. Which of the following is the strongest argument why the appellate court should reverse the owner's conviction?\n\nA. The method by which materials are marketed or advertised is not probative of whether they are obscene.\nB. It is an unconstitutional invasion of privacy for the government to interfere with the content of closed mailings intended for the private use by consenting adults.\nC. Under the First Amendment, the community's standards for children may not be applied in determining what constitutes obscenity for adults.\nD. Obscenity is to be determined by applying national standards, not contemporary community standards.\n"

Under the First Amendment, the community's standards for children may not be applied in determining what constitutes obscenity for adults.\n\nThis argument is based on the principle that the First Amendment protects freedom of speech and expression, including the distribution of materials to adults. The application of community standards for children to materials intended for adults would be an overreach, as it would unduly restrict the rights of adults to receive information and literature that is not harmful to them but might be inappropriate for children. This distinction is crucial in balancing the protection of adult rights against the need to shield minors from potentially harmful content."
