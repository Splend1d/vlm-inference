The luminosity integrated over all wavelengths.\n\nIn astronomy, bolometric luminosity refers to the total amount of energy emitted by an object per unit time across all electromagnetic wavelengths. This includes not only visible light but also ultraviolet, infrared, radio, and other forms of radiation. It provides a comprehensive measure of the total energy output of an astronomical object."
