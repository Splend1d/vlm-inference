It involves taking something that doesn't belong to you.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n\"I encouraged the bully\u2019s fights.\"\n- Encouraging someone to engage in bullying or violent behavior is also considered morally wrong. Bullying is harmful and unethical.\n\nGiven this analysis, both scenarios involve actions that are clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nA. Wrong, Wrong"
