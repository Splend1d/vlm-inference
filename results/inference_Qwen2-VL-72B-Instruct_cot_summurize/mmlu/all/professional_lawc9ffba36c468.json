                    "text": "The correct answer is:\n\nA. the buyer, because the covenants contained in the deed run with the land.\n\nExplanation:\nIn real estate law, covenants in a deed typically include promises made by the grantor (seller) to the grantee (buyer). These covenants can be categorized into two types: covenants that run with the land and those that do not. Covenants that run with the land bind subsequent owners and are enforceable by them. \n\nThe covenants mentioned in the question\u2014seisin, right to convey, and against encumbrances\u2014are examples of covenants that generally run with the land. Therefore, if the buyer was evicted due to a paramount title held by another party, the buyer would have grounds to sue the original seller (farmer) for breach of these covenants, as they are enforceable against subsequent owners.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the lack of privity of estate does not prevent the enforcement of covenants that run with the land. Option C is partially correct but incomplete, as all three covenants (seisin, right to convey, and against encumbrances) run with the land. Option D is incorrect because these covenants are not personal in nature; they are real covenants that run with the land."
