Now, Congress, under intense lobbying pressure from the press, proposes to enact legislation forbidding any state from requiring journalists to reveal the sources of their news articles in civil suits. Which of the following is the strongest constitutional argument in support of this proposed law?\n\nA. Congress has the authority under the commerce clause to regulate the flow of news.\nB. Acts of Congress are the supreme law of the land and take precedence over any conflicting state laws.\nC. Congress is essentially reaffirming the free speech guarantees of the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\nD. Under Article I, Section 8, Congress has the authority to secure to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries.\n"

Congress is essentially reaffirming the free speech guarantees of the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\n\nThis argument is based on the principle that the First Amendment protects freedom of the press, which includes the ability of journalists to maintain the confidentiality of their sources. By enacting such legislation, Congress would be reinforcing the constitutional protections for journalists' rights to free speech and a free press, which are fundamental principles enshrined in the Constitution. The Fourteenth Amendment also plays a role here by ensuring that these rights are protected against infringement by state governments."
