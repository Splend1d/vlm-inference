The success of the revolution discredited conservative ideas; the failure of the revolution discredited liberal ideas. After it, nothing remained but the idea of Force, and this idea stood at the helm of German history from then on. For the first time since 1521, the German people stepped on to the centre of the German stage only to miss their cue once more. German history reached its turning-point and failed to turn. This was the fateful essence of 1848.\nA. J. P. Taylor, The Course of German History, 1945\nFrom the quotation, one may infer that Taylor argues that the most important effect of the political revolutions of 1848 was\n\nA. the failure to bring about a change in the ruling class\nB. the demonstration of the power of ideas\nC. the discrediting of both conservative and liberal political ideology\nD. the creation of the idea of a modern police force\n"

                    "text": "To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the key points in the quotation:\n\n1. **Success and Failure of Ideas**: The quotation mentions that the success of the revolution discredited conservative ideas, while the failure of the revolution discredited liberal ideas. This indicates that both conservative and liberal ideologies were undermined as a result of the events of 1848.\n\n2. **Idea of Force**: It states that after the revolution, \"nothing remained but the idea of Force,\" suggesting that the reliance on force became central to German history following these events.\n\n3. **Turning Point**: The quotation emphasizes that 1848 was a turning point in German history where significant changes were expected but did not materialize, leading to a missed opportunity for transformation.\n\nGiven these points, let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. **The failure to bring about a change in the ruling class**:\n   - While the quotation does mention a missed cue and a failure to turn, it does not specifically focus on the ruling class changing or remaining the same.\n\nB. **The demonstration of the power of ideas**:\n   - The quotation actually suggests the opposite; it highlights how the power of ideas (both conservative and liberal) was discredited rather than demonstrated.\n\nC. **The discrediting of both conservative and liberal political ideology**:\n   - This is directly supported by the text, which explicitly states that the success of the revolution discredited conservative ideas and the failure discredited liberal ideas.\n\nD. **The creation of the idea of a modern police force**:\n   - There is no mention of the creation of a modern police force in the quotation.\n\nBased on the analysis, the most accurate inference from the quotation is:\n\n**C. The discrediting of both conservative and liberal political ideology**"
