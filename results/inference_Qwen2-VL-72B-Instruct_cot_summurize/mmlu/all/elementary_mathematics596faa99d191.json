Since 90 is exactly on the midpoint between 85 and 95, rounding rules would typically suggest rounding to the nearest even number when exactly halfway between two numbers (a convention known as \"round half to even\" or \"bankers' rounding\"), but since this rule isn't explicitly stated and the options provided don't include 90, we'll consider the closest option to 90 that fits the rounding instruction.\n\nThe options given are:\nA. 75 miles\nB. 100 miles\nC. 125 miles\nD. 180 miles\n\nSince 90 is closer to 100 than it is to 75, and considering the instruction to round to the nearest 5 miles, the best estimate of the total number of miles driven in 5 days is:\n\nB. 100 miles"
