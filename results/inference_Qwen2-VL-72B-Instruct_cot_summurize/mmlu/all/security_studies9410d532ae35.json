Different natures of the adversaries complicate the use of Western coercion. Their tendency to rely on irregular or asymmetric military strategies makes it hard to threaten or even defeat their opponent's military strategy. Those actors deny forces the ability to win quickly with little cost.\nB. Increased verification capabilities brought in with the technological and communication revolution have resulted in a practical difficulty for practitioners, enabling the verification of tactical/temporary and strategic/lasting - only the latter of which constituting a compliance success. The capacity to verify processes have highlighted instances of non-compliance following inconclusive coercive diplomacy exchanges.\nC. Coalitional coercive diplomacy is the only credible means for Western democracies to gain the sincerity required to make a threat of force real in the mind of the adversary. However, past efforts of coalitional building have proved to be extremely limited. Disagreements over the means and coordination of the policy often result in splits and consequently states are reluctant to employ it. Where it has been employed it collapses under the weight of its own inadequacy.\nD. All of these options.\n"

The nature of adversaries and their reliance on irregular or asymmetric strategies can indeed complicate the effectiveness of traditional coercive measures, as these tactics are designed to undermine conventional military superiority.\n\nB. Enhanced verification capabilities can reveal instances of non-compliance, which undermines the credibility of coercive diplomacy if it fails to achieve lasting compliance.\n\nC. The difficulties in forming and maintaining effective coalitions limit the ability of Western democracies to present a united front and a credible threat, which is essential for successful coercive diplomacy.\n\nTherefore, all of these issues contribute to the practical problems associated with applying coercive diplomacy in the West."
