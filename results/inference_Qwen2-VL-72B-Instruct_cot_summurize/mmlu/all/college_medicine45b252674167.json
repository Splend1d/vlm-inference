The gunshot came from an actor inside a car traveling 108 km/h, and it was recorded by a camera on a platform 200 meters away traveling at 72 km/h in the same direction. If the frequency of the gunshot is normally 800Hz, what is the perceived frequency which the camera picks up the gunshot at?\n\nA. 941 Hz\nB. 787 Hz\nC. 924 Hz\nD. 912 Hz\n"
