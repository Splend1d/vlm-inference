So, \\(20\\% \\times 100 = 20\\) workers leave.\n- Therefore, \\(100 - 20 = 80\\) workers remain at the end of the first year from the initial 100 hired.\n\n### Second Year:\n\n- At the start of the second year, another 100 workers are hired.\n- From the first batch of 100 workers:\n  - 5% of the remaining 80 workers leave during the second year. So, \\(5\\% \\times 80 = 4\\) workers leave.\n  - Therefore, \\(80 - 4 = 76\\) workers from the first batch remain at the end of the second year.\n  \n- All 100 workers from the second batch are still on the job at the end of the second year since they were just hired at the beginning of the year.\n\n### Total Workers Remaining at the End of the Second Year:\n\n- From the first batch: 76 workers.\n- From the second batch: 100 workers.\n- Total: \\(76 + 100 = 176\\) workers.\n\nHowever, none of the provided options (A. 140, B. 144, C. 152, D. 156) match the calculated total of 176 workers. It seems there might have been a misunderstanding or misinterpretation in the question or the answer choices provided. Based on the calculations, the correct number of workers expected to be on the job at the end of the second year is 176, which is not listed among the given options."
