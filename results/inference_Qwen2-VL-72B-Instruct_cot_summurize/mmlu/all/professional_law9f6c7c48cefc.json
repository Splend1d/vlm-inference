The parties met and signed a \"Letter Agreement\", which set forth the price, down payment amount, financing terms, the assets to be included, and a host of other pertinent details. The final closing date was not stated, but the purchasers left a down payment of $20,000 with the seller. The letter stated that the terms comprised their essential agreement, but that a formal document would be drafted by the parties' attorneys. Before that happened, the seller returned the check and refused to perform. The investor brought an equity action for specific performance to compel the sale. The equity court ruled that there was a complete and binding contract that must be specifically performed. Will the appellate court likely affirm the lower court's decision?\n\nA. No, because closing date was left out and the attorneys were supposed to compose the final contract with all of the remaining details put in.\nB. No, because this type of letter is basically a \"gentlemen's agreement\" that is not intended to be legally binding.\nC. Yes, because a letter of intent is legally binding if it sets forth the price, describes the business and is signed by both parties.\nD. Yes, because where the letter contains all of the essential terms required for a contract, it will be enforced as a contract.\n"

Yes, because where the letter contains all of the essential terms required for a contract, it will be enforced as a contract.\n\nIn legal terms, a letter agreement or letter of intent can indeed be considered a binding contract if it includes all the essential elements of a contract, such as mutual consent, consideration (the down payment in this case), and the essential terms of the agreement. The fact that the parties intended to draft a more formal document later does not necessarily negate the binding nature of the initial letter agreement, especially if it clearly states that the terms within it are essential and agreed upon by both parties. Therefore, the appellate court is likely to affirm the lower court's decision if the letter agreement meets these criteria."
