Your decision trees are too shallow.\n\nIf your decision tree model is performing poorly on both the training and test sets, it suggests that the model might not be capturing enough complexity in the data. This is often referred to as underfitting. Underfitting occurs when the model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns in the data, which can happen if the decision trees are too shallow. Increasing the depth of the decision trees (making them deeper) may help the model learn more complex patterns and improve its performance."
