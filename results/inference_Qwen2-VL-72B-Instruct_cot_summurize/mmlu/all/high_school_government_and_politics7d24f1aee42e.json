It's a broader claim about the overall trend in domestic policy.\n\nB. **the influence of political action committees has weakened in recent years**: This contradicts the premise since the legislative successes indicate strong influence from these groups.\n\nC. **the power of interest groups depends on the degree of support for their positions in the White House**: While this might be true in some cases, it doesn't fully explain the legislative successes of interest groups without considering other factors like public opinion or activism intensity.\n\nD. **majority opinion on an issue can sometimes be overridden by the intensity of a minority's commitment to activism**: This option aligns well with the idea that despite possibly not having majority support, the intense activism and lobbying efforts of these interest groups led to legislative successes.\n\nGiven the context and analysis, the most accurate conclusion is:\n\n**D. majority opinion on an issue can sometimes be overridden by the intensity of a minority's commitment to activism**"
