In light of the defendant's lengthy juvenile criminal history, which included violent offenses, and the fact that armed robbery is a crime of violence, he was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. Did the life-without-parole sentence violate the Eighth Amendment ban on cruel and unusual punishment?\n\nA. No, because a juvenile may be sentenced to life without parole if release would pose a danger to the community.\nB. No, because the Eighth Amendment does not apply outside the context of capital punishment.\nC. Yes, because a life-without-parole sentence is not permissible for a juvenile defendant convicted of a nonhomicide offense.\nD. Yes, because a life-without-parole sentence is not permissible for an adult or juvenile defendant convicted of a nonviolent offense.\n"

Yes, because a life-without-parole sentence is not permissible for a juvenile defendant convicted of a nonhomicide offense.\n\nThis conclusion is based on the Supreme Court's decision in Graham v. Florida (2010), where it held that sentencing a juvenile offender to life in prison without the possibility of parole for a nonhomicide crime violates the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishments. The Court reasoned that juveniles have diminished culpability compared to adults due to their immaturity, vulnerability to negative influences, and capacity for change. Therefore, such a harsh sentence is considered disproportionate for nonhomicide offenses committed by juveniles."
