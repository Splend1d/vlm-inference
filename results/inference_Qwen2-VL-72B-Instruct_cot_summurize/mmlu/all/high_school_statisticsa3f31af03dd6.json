It is calculated by squaring the correlation coefficient (\\( r \\)):\n\n\\[ R^2 = r^2 \\]\n\nFor a correlation coefficient of 0.6:\n\\[ R^2_{0.6} = (0.6)^2 = 0.36 \\]\n\nFor a correlation coefficient of 0.3:\n\\[ R^2_{0.3} = (0.3)^2 = 0.09 \\]\n\nNow, we compare these two values to find out how many times larger \\( R^2_{0.6} \\) is than \\( R^2_{0.3} \\):\n\n\\[ \\frac{R^2_{0.6}}{R^2_{0.3}} = \\frac{0.36}{0.09} = 4 \\]\n\nTherefore, the percentage of variation in \\( y \\) that is explained by the variation in \\( x \\) for a correlation of 0.6 is 4 times the percentage indicated by a correlation of 0.3.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nC. 4"
