This frictional force is given by:\n   \\[\n   f = \\mu N\n   \\]\n   where \\( \\mu \\) is the coefficient of friction.\n\n4. **Gravitational Force**: The gravitational force \\( mg \\) acts downward, where \\( g \\) is the acceleration due to gravity. For the person not to slide down, the frictional force must be at least equal to the gravitational force:\n   \\[\n   f \\geq mg\n   \\]\n\n5. **Equating Forces**: Substituting the expressions for \\( N \\) and \\( f \\):\n   \\[\n   \\mu N \\geq mg\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\mu \\left( m\\frac{v^2}{R} \\right) \\geq mg\n   \\]\n\n6. **Solving for Mass**: Simplify the inequality:\n   \\[\n   \\mu m\\frac{v^2}{R} \\geq mg\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\mu \\frac{v^2}{R} \\geq g\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   m \\leq \\frac{\\mu R g}{v^2}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the greatest mass \\( m \\) that a person can have to safely go on this ride is:\n\\[\nm \\leq \\frac{\\mu R g}{v^2}\n\\]\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nC. \\( \\frac{rg}{\\mu v^2} \\)"
