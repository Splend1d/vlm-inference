Given the points $(1,5)$, $(2,3)$, and $(3,1)$ on the graph of $y = f(x)$, let's see how these points transform under the composition $f(f(x))$.\n\n1. For $x = 1$, $f(1) = 5$. Then applying $f$ again, we need to find $f(5)$. However, we don't have the value of $f(5)$ based on the given points.\n\n2. For $x = 2$, $f(2) = 3$. Then applying $f$ again, we get $f(3) = 1$. So, one point on the graph of $y = f(f(x))$ is $(2, 1)$.\n\n3. For $x = 3$, $f(3) = 1$. Then applying $f$ again, we get $f(1) = 5$. So, another point on the graph of $y = f(f(x))$ is $(3, 5)$.\n\nTherefore, the points on the graph of $y = f(f(x))$ are $(2, 1)$ and $(3, 5)$. To find $ab + cd$, where $(a, b) = (2, 1)$ and $(c, d) = (3, 5)$, we calculate:\n\n\\[ab + cd = (2 \\cdot 1) + (3 \\cdot 5) = 2 + 15 = 17.\\]\n\nSo, the correct answer is D. 17."
