The estimated remaining useful lives of plant assets were revised upward.\n\nWhen the estimated remaining useful lives of plant assets are revised upward, it means that the assets will be used for a longer period than originally estimated. This revision results in lower annual depreciation expense going forward because the cost of the asset is spread over a longer period. However, to correct for the previously higher rate of depreciation, a debit (increase) to the accumulated depreciation account and a credit (decrease) to the depreciation expense account may be recorded to adjust the book value of the asset to reflect the new estimate. This adjustment ensures that the total depreciation over the asset's revised useful life equals its original cost less any salvage value.\n\nOptions A and B suggest errors in past or current depreciation calculations, which would typically require restatements of prior periods rather than adjustments to the current year's accumulated depreciation. Option D, retirement of plant assets, would generally result in a reduction of both the accumulated depreciation and the related asset account, not a debit to accumulated depreciation."
