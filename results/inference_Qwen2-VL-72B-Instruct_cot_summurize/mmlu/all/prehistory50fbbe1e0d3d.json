These genes can influence various traits and functions, including aspects of metabolism and susceptibility to certain diseases. For example, some Neandertal alleles have been linked to the metabolism of fat in modern Europeans, while others may be associated with an increased risk for autoimmune diseases like Lupus. However, it's important to note that not all Neandertal genes are universally beneficial or detrimental; their effects can vary depending on the specific genetic context and environmental factors."
