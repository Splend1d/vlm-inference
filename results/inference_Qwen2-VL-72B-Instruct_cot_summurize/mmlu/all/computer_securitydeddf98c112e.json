Yes, the key is k = m xor c.\n\nIn One-Time Pad (OTP) encryption, the encryption process involves XORing the plaintext message (m) with a random key (k) to produce the ciphertext (c). The decryption process reverses this by XORing the ciphertext (c) with the same key (k) to recover the original message (m).\n\nGiven that:\n\n\\[ c = m \\oplus k \\]\n\nwhere \\( \\oplus \\) denotes the XOR operation, we can solve for the key \\( k \\) as follows:\n\n\\[ k = m \\oplus c \\]\n\nThis is because the XOR operation is its own inverse, meaning that XORing a value twice with the same value results in the original value. Therefore, if you have both the message (m) and the ciphertext (c), you can compute the key (k) by XORing them together."
