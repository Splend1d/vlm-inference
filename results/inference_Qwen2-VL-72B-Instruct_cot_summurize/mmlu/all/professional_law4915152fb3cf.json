The U.S. Constitution: It is the supreme law of the land.\n2. Treaties and Federal Statutes: These are laws made by Congress and ratified treaties.\n3. Executive Agreements: These are agreements made by the President with foreign nations that do not require Senate approval.\n4. State Law: This includes state constitutions, state statutes, and local laws.\n\nThis hierarchy ensures that no law can contradict the higher laws in the system. If there is a conflict between a lower law and a higher law, the higher law prevails."
