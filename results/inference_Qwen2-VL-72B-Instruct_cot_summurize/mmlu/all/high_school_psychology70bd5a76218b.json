Encoding is the process by which new information is transformed into a form that can be stored in memory. If John never paid attention to or consciously processed the images on the coins and bills, he would not have encoded this information into his memory, making it impossible for him to recall later.\n\nHere's why the other options are less likely:\n\nA. Confabulation refers to the production of fabricated, distorted, or misinterpreted memories about oneself or the environment, usually as a result of brain injury or certain psychiatric conditions. It does not describe John's situation, where he simply cannot recall the images.\n\nB. Failure to reconstruct involves the inability to retrieve previously encoded information from memory. Since John never encoded the information in the first place, reconstruction is not applicable here.\n\nD. Deep processing refers to a level of cognitive processing that involves meaningful encoding of information, often leading to better retention. The issue with John is not related to the depth of processing but rather to whether the information was processed at all."
