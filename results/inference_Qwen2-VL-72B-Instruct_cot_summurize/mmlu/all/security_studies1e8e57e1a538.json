Traditional national security focuses on threats to the state and its sovereignty, not just individual human rights or dignity.\n\nC. \"The traditional interpretations of security and threats are important boundaries that define human security.\"\n- This statement implies that traditional national security concepts set the boundaries for understanding human security. While it might be true in some contexts, it doesn't directly characterize traditional national security itself.\n\nD. \"The concept of national security is too narrow to be useful when analysing the broad threats that currently exist.\"\n- This statement critiques traditional national security for being too narrow, suggesting it doesn't adequately address modern threats. It reflects a broader perspective beyond traditional national security.\n\nGiven this analysis, none of the statements (B, C, or D) directly and solely characterize the traditional concept of national security. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. All of these options."
