                    "text": "To find the area of a triangle given the lengths of its altitudes, we can use the fact that the area \\(A\\) of a triangle can be expressed in terms of its base \\(b\\) and corresponding altitude \\(h\\) as \\(A = \\frac{1}{2}bh\\). However, since we have three altitudes, we need to relate them to the sides of the triangle.\n\nLet's denote the sides of the triangle opposite to these altitudes as \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) respectively, with the corresponding altitudes being 10, 12, and 15. The area of the triangle can also be expressed using Heron's formula or by relating the sides and altitudes directly. However, a more direct approach involves recognizing that the product of an altitude and its corresponding base is twice the area of the triangle (since \\(A = \\frac{1}{2}bh\\)).\n\nGiven the altitudes, let's denote them as \\(h_a = 10\\), \\(h_b = 12\\), and \\(h_c = 15\\). Let the sides opposite to these altitudes be \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) respectively. We know that:\n\n\\[A = \\frac{1}{2}ah_a = \\frac{1}{2}bh_b = \\frac{1}{2}ch_c\\]\n\nSince we're looking for the area, we can express it in terms of one side and its corresponding altitude. For simplicity, let's use the altitude \\(h_a = 10\\) and solve for the area in terms of \\(a\\):\n\n\\[A = \\frac{1}{2}ah_a = \\frac{1}{2}a(10) = 5a\\]\n\nHowever, this approach doesn't directly lead us to the solution because we don't have the length of any side. Instead, we should use the fact that the area can also be expressed in terms of the semiperimeter (\\(s\\)) and the sides of the triangle through Heron's formula, but since we don't have the lengths of the sides, we'll take a different approach.\n\nWe can use the fact that the area of a triangle can also be found using the formula involving the sides and the semi-perimeter, but without the actual side lengths, we need to work with the information given differently.\n\nGiven the altitudes, we can use the fact that the area of the triangle is the same regardless of which altitude we use. Thus, we can equate the expressions for the area based on each altitude:\n\n\\[A = \\frac{1}{2}ah_a = \\frac{1}{2}bh_b = \\frac{1}{2}ch_c\\]\n\nBut since we're not given the lengths of the sides, we look for a relationship between the altitudes and the area directly. The key insight here is to recognize that the area can be expressed in terms of the product of the altitudes and their harmonic mean. The harmonic mean \\(H\\) of the numbers \\(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n\\) is given by:\n\n\\[H = \\frac{n}{\\frac{1}{x_1} + \\frac{1}{x_2} + ... + \\frac{1}{x_n}}\\]\n\nFor our case, with three altitudes, the harmonic mean \\(H\\) is:\n\n\\[H = \\frac{3}{\\frac{1}{10} + \\frac{1}{12} + \\frac{1}{15}}\\]\n\nCalculating the denominator:\n\n\\[\\frac{1}{10} + \\frac{1}{12} + \\frac{1}{15} = \\frac{6+5+4}{60} = \\frac{15}{60} = \\frac{1}{4}\\]\n\nThus,\n\n\\[H = \\frac{3}{\\frac{1}{4}} = 12\\]\n\nThe area \\(A\\) of the triangle can then be related to the product of the altitudes and their harmonic mean as follows:\n\n\\[A = \\frac{2}{3} \\times H \\times h_a \\times h_b \\times h_c\\]\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\n\\[A = \\frac{2}{3} \\times 12 \\times 10 \\times 12 \\times 15\\]\n\n\\[A = 8 \\times 10 \\times 12 \\times 15\\]\n\n\\[A = 8 \\times 1800\\]\n\n\\[A = 14400\\]\n\nThis calculation seems to have led us astray from the provided options, indicating a misunderstanding in the approach. The correct approach should directly relate the area to the altitudes without needing to calculate the harmonic mean explicitly in this manner. \n\nGiven the complexity introduced by my initial explanation, let's simplify the approach by recognizing that the area of a triangle can indeed be directly related to its altitudes in a specific way when all three altitudes are known. However, my initial explanation veered off into an incorrect path by attempting to relate the area to the harmonic mean of the altitudes, which isn't directly applicable here.\n\nInstead, let's correct the approach by focusing on the direct relationship between the area and the altitudes. The correct method involves understanding that the area of a triangle can be found using the formula involving the product of the altitudes and their harmonic mean, but my explanation incorrectly applied this concept.\n\nGiven the confusion in my initial response, let's clarify: the correct approach to solving this problem directly from the given altitudes without calculating the sides or using Heron's formula involves recognizing a specific relationship that directly relates the area to the altitudes. However, upon reviewing the options and my explanation, it appears there was a misunderstanding in applying the correct mathematical principle directly from the given information.\n\nTo provide a corrected and simplified approach, let's focus on the direct relationship between the area and the altitudes, acknowledging that my initial explanation led to an incorrect conclusion due to a misapplication of concepts.
