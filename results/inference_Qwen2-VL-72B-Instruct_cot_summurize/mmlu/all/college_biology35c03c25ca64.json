Archaea are a domain of single-celled microorganisms that have unique biochemistry, including their membrane lipids, which often consist of isoprenoid chains attached to glycerol via ether linkages rather than the ester linkages found in bacterial and eukaryotic phospholipids.\n\nProteobacteria, spirochetes, and members of the genus Chlamydia are all types of bacteria and do not share these specific characteristics."
