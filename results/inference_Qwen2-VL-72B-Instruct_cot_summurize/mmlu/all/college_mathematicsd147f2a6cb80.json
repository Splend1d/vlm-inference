Therefore, \\( f \\) cannot be onto.\n\nII. **The image of f is compact.**\n   - A set is compact if it is both closed and bounded. The interval (0, 1] is not compact because it is not closed (it does not contain its limit point 0). However, the image of \\( f \\) could potentially be a subset of (0, 1], which might or might not be compact depending on the specific function \\( f \\).\n\nIII. **f is continuous, one-to-one, and onto.**\n   - As we established in statement I, \\( f \\) cannot be onto. Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n\nGiven these analyses:\n- Statement I is false because \\( f \\) cannot be onto.\n- Statement II could be true depending on the specific function \\( f \\).\n- Statement III is false because \\( f \\) cannot be onto.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\nB.
