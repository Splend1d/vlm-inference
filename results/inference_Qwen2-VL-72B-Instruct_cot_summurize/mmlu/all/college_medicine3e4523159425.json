A marathon is a long-distance race covering 26.2 miles (42.195 kilometers), and the ability to maintain a consistent pace over such a distance requires significant endurance. While strength, power, and stride length can contribute to performance, they are not as essential as having the stamina to endure the entire race without fatigue."
