It becomes thicker: This is a common change that occurs with age.\n- B. It yellows: The lens can become more yellowish over time, which can affect vision.\n- C. It becomes clouded: This is often associated with the development of cataracts.\n\nHowever, the lens does not fill with fluid as it ages. The lens is composed of specialized cells and proteins, and any fluid accumulation would be indicative of a pathological condition rather than a normal aging process."
