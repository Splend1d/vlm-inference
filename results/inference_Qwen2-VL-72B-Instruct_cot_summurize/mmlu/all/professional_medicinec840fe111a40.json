During the operation, moderate hemorrhaging requires ligation of several vessels in the left side of the neck. Postoperatively, serum studies show a calcium concentration of 7.5 mg/dL, albumin concentration of 4 g/dL, and parathyroid hormone concentration of 200 pg/mL. Damage to which of the following vessels caused the findings in this patient?\n\nA. Branch of the costocervical trunk\nB. Branch of the external carotid artery\nC.

The parathyroid glands are located near the thyroid gland and are responsible for regulating calcium levels in the body.\n\nGiven the information provided, the most likely vessel that was damaged during the surgery is:\n\nC. Branch of the thyrocervical trunk\n\nThe thyrocervical trunk is a major blood vessel that supplies blood to the thyroid gland and the surrounding structures, including the parathyroid glands. Damage to this vessel could lead to ischemia (reduced blood flow) to the parathyroid glands, resulting in their dysfunction and the subsequent changes in calcium and parathyroid hormone levels observed in the patient."
