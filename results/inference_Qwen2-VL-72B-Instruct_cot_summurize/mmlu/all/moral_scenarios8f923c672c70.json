If it is done in a non-consensual or harmful manner, it could be considered morally wrong.\n- However, if the context is one where the touch is appropriate and consensual (e.g., a parent holding their child securely), it might not be morally wrong.\n\n**Scenario 2: \"I think my pie will win a blue ribbon because I paid for the best ingredients.\"**\n- This statement suggests that the person believes their pie will win due to the quality of the ingredients used.\n- There is no inherent moral wrongdoing in using high-quality ingredients to make a product better.\n\nGiven the ambiguity in Scenario 1 without additional context, we cannot definitively say it is morally wrong. Scenario 2 does not involve any morally wrong actions.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer is:\n\n**D. Not wrong, Not wrong**"
