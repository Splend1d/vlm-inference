The factory moved for summary judgment on the ground of res judicata (claim preclusion), arguing that the man had sued on and lost an identical claim one year before. The court denied the motion. The factory has asked its attorney's advice as to whether it may appeal the court's denial of summary judgment in order to avoid an expensive trial. What advice should the attorney give?\n\nA. The factory may appeal if the appellate court finds that the case involves a controlling question of law upon which the courts are divided.\nB. The factory may appeal if the trial court certifies that there is no just reason for delay.\nC. The factory may not appeal until after a trial on the merits or other disposition resulting in a final judgment.\nD. The factory may not appeal, because the denial of summary judgment is a collateral order.\n"

The factory may not appeal until after a trial on the merits or other disposition resulting in a final judgment.\n\nDenial of a motion for summary judgment is generally considered an interlocutory order, meaning it is made during the course of litigation but does not finally dispose of the case. Interlocutory orders are typically not appealable until after a final judgment has been entered. This rule is based on the principle that piecemeal appeals would unduly delay the resolution of cases and burden the judicial system. Therefore, the factory must wait until the conclusion of the trial or another final disposition before it can appeal the denial of summary judgment."
