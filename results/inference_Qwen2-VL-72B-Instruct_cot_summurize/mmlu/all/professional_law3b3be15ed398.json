During finals at the end of the fall semester, the student was caught cheating. His chemistry professor saw him looking at a fellow student's exam paper and copying the answers to three multiple choice questions. The professor notified the honor committee, which immediately found an honor code violation and ordered that the student receive a failing grade in the course. In addition, in accordance with the rules of the university, the student's financial aid was terminated. The student filed a lawsuit seeking reinstatement of his financial aid. The student's only argument was that his due process rights were violated in that he did not receive a notice of, or a hearing on, the alleged honor code violation. Which of the following facts, if true, would be most helpful to the student?\n\nA. The university was in financial difficulties and could not meet its payroll expenses.\nB. The university did not re-allocate the student's financial aid to another deserving student.\nC. The university received support from the state.\nD. The honor committee sent the student a letter to advise him of the hearing date.\n"

The honor committee sent the student a letter to advise him of the hearing date.\n\nThis fact directly addresses the student's claim that his due process rights were violated by not receiving notice of the hearing. If it can be proven that the student was indeed informed about the hearing, it would undermine his argument that he was denied due process. This would strengthen the university's position that they followed proper procedures in handling the honor code violation."
