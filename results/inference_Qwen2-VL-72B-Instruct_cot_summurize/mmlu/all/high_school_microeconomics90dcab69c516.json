The marginal utility of the fourth slice is not provided, so we don't know if it would be positive or negative.\n\n2. **Statement B: The marginal utility of the 4th slice of pizza will be 0.**\n   - There is no information provided about the marginal utility of the fourth slice. Therefore, we cannot conclude that it will be 0.\n\n3. **Statement C: The student should have stopped eating pizza after 2 slices.**\n   - This statement suggests that the student should have stopped at the point where the marginal utility started decreasing significantly. However, without knowing the cost or price of the pizza and the student's budget constraint, we cannot definitively say whether stopping after 2 slices was optimal.\n\n4. **Statement D: The total utility this student received from eating pizza is 20 utils.**\n   - To calculate the total utility, we sum up the marginal utilities of each slice:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total Utility} = \\text{MU of 1st slice} + \\text{MU of 2nd slice} + \\text{MU of 3rd slice}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total Utility} = 10 \\text{ utils} + 7 \\text{ utils} + 3 \\text{ utils} = 20 \\text{ utils}\n     \\]\n\nBased on the calculations, the correct statement is:\n\n**D. The total utility this student received from eating pizza is 20 utils.**"
