However, since there is one lone pair, the molecular geometry will be distorted from the ideal octahedral shape.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Tetrahedron**: This geometry corresponds to a steric number of 4, which does not match our requirement.\n\nB. **Square planar**: This geometry corresponds to a steric number of 4, which also does not match our requirement.\n\nC. **Octahedron**: This geometry corresponds to a steric number of 6, but it does not account for the presence of a lone pair.\n\nD. **Square pyramid**: This geometry corresponds to a steric number of 6 with one lone pair, fitting the description perfectly.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD.
