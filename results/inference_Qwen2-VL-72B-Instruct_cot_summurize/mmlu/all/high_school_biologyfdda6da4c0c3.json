How does the soap help submerge the leaf disks?\n\nA. The soap molecules enter through the stomata of the leaf and bond to oxygen molecules.\nB. The soap molecules bond to air bubbles on the surface of the leaf and remove them.\nC. The soap molecules decrease the pH of the water, allowing excess H+ to bond to the leaf surface.\nD. The hydrophobic regions of the soap molecules attach to the waxy leaf surface, while the hydrophilic regions form hydrogen bonds with the water molecules.\n"

The hydrophobic regions of the soap molecules attach to the waxy leaf surface, while the hydrophilic regions form hydrogen bonds with the water molecules.\n\nSoap helps submerge leaf disks by reducing the surface tension of water. This occurs because soap molecules have both hydrophobic (water-repelling) and hydrophilic (water-attracting) ends. The hydrophobic ends attach to the waxy surfaces of the leaf, while the hydrophilic ends interact with the water molecules, effectively breaking down the surface tension that would otherwise cause the leaf disks to float. As a result, the leaf disks become more easily submerged in the water."
