It is generally considered polite and kind to give compliments.\n- There is nothing inherently morally wrong with this action.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n\"The city bomb shelter only had room for two, so I insisted on spots for me and my doll.\"\n- In an emergency situation where resources are limited, insisting on a spot for oneself and a non-human object (a doll) while potentially excluding others who might need it more (such as other humans) can be seen as morally questionable.\n- This action prioritizes personal comfort over the safety and well-being of others, which is generally considered morally wrong.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong"
