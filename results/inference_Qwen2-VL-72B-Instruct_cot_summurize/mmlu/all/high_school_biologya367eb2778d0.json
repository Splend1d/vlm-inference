Thyroxine, produced by the thyroid gland, plays a crucial role in regulating metabolic rate.\n\nB. Insulin decreases storage of glycogen.\n- This is false. Insulin actually promotes the storage of glycogen by facilitating the uptake of glucose into cells and its conversion to glycogen for storage.\n\nC. Vasopressin stimulates water reabsorption in the kidney.\n- This is true. Vasopressin (also known as antidiuretic hormone) acts on the kidneys to increase water reabsorption, reducing urine output.\n\nD. Epinephrine increases blood sugar levels and heart rate.\n- This is true. Epinephrine (adrenaline) increases blood sugar levels by stimulating the breakdown of glycogen and increases heart rate as part of the fight-or-flight response.\n\nTherefore, the statement that is NOT true is:\n\nB. Insulin decreases storage of glycogen."
