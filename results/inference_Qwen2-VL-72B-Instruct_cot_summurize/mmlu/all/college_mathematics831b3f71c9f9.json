This follows from the Heine-Cantor theorem, which states that a continuous function from a compact metric space to any metric space is uniformly continuous.\n\nThus, **Statement 1 is true**.\n\n### Statement 2: If \\( f(x), g(x) : \\mathbb{R} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R} \\) are everywhere differentiable, \\( f(g(x)) \\) must be everywhere differentiable.\n\n**Analysis:**\n- **Chain Rule:** The chain rule in calculus states that if \\( f \\) and \\( g \\) are both differentiable functions, then their composition \\( f(g(x)) \\) is also differentiable, and its derivative can be found using the formula:\n\\[ (f \\circ g)'(x) = f'(g(x)) \\cdot g'(x) \\]\n\nThis means that if \\( f \\) and \\( g \\) are everywhere differentiable, then their composition \\( f(g(x)) \\) will also be everywhere differentiable.\n\nThus, **Statement 2 is true**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth statements are true.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nA. True, True"
