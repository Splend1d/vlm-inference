The Reds offer discounted parking for all home games.\n\nConsumer surplus refers to the difference between what consumers are willing to pay for a good or service and what they actually pay. Offering discounted parking can make attending games more attractive and affordable, potentially increasing the number of fans who choose to attend games. This could lead to an increase in consumer surplus as fans benefit from lower overall costs (ticket plus parking) compared to what they might have been willing to pay without the discount."
