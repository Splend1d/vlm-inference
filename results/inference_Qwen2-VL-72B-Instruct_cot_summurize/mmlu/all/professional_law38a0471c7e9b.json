The written lease agreement specified that rent should be paid at a rate of $2,000 per month and provided that the tenants were required to pay two months rent initially, of which one half, or $2,000, should be held by the landlord as a security deposit. In addition, the lease contained the following provision:\"The duration of this lease shall be month-to-month and either party may have the right to terminate on thirty (30) days notice. \"The lease agreement did not specify whether notice of termination must be in writing, but it did provide that the deposit could be applied, at the landlord's option, to unpaid rent and to reimbursement for damage done by the tenant(s) to the apartment or the fixtures attached thereto. On January 1, the husband and wife paid the landlord $4,000 and moved in. The tenants then paid the $2,000 rent on the first of each of the months of February, March, and April, and all rents were duly accepted by the landlord. On February 1, the city enacted a housing code applicable to all multiple dwellings in the city. A provision of that code required that in \"any building having a main or central entrance that is open and accessible to the public directly from a public street, a doorkeeper shall be maintained on duty at all times. \" Although the landlord's building has such an entrance, the landlord failed to comply with the requirement. On March 15 and again on April 1, the husband and wife lodged complaints with the city's housing authority relating to the landlord's failure to hire a doorkeeper in violation of the code regulation. On April 5, the landlord orally gave notice to the tenants that he was terminating the lease and demanded that they vacate the premises by May 5. No damage was done to the apartment, furnishings, or fixtures. There is no statute applicable to cover any landlord \u0080\u0094tenant dispute except those related to housing and building codes. In the landlord's action to evict, the husband and wife have contested the landlord's right to terminate on May 5. If the tenants prevail, it will probably be because\n\nA. there was no damage to the apartment, furnishings, or fixtures.\nB. the statute of frauds requires that the notice of termination be in writing.\nC. the jurisdiction recognizes that retaliatory actions are a defense.\nD. the husband and wife have the option to apply their $2,000 deposit to cover May's rental.\n"

                    "text": "C. the jurisdiction recognizes that retaliatory actions are a defense.\n\nIn this scenario, the landlord's oral notice to terminate the lease appears to be in response to the tenants' complaints about the landlord's non-compliance with the housing code. This suggests a retaliatory action by the landlord against the tenants for exercising their rights under the law. Jurisdictions often recognize retaliatory eviction as a defense, meaning that if the landlord's action to terminate the lease is found to be retaliatory, the tenants can contest the eviction and potentially prevail.\n\nLet's briefly analyze the other options:\n\nA. There was no damage to the apartment, furnishings, or fixtures.\n- While this is true, it does not directly address the issue of the landlord's right to terminate the lease. The lack of damage might be relevant in the context of the security deposit, but it doesn't affect the legality of the termination itself.\n\nB. The statute of frauds requires that the notice of termination be in writing.\n- The lease agreement did not specify that notice of termination must be in writing. Therefore, the statute of frauds would not necessarily apply here, and the oral notice given by the landlord might still be valid.\n\nD. The husband and wife have the option to apply their $2,000 deposit to cover May's rental.\n- This option pertains to the use of the security deposit and does not directly impact the landlord's right to terminate the lease. It might be relevant in a separate discussion about the financial aspects of the lease, but it does not address the legality of the termination itself.\n\nTherefore, the most likely reason the tenants would prevail in contesting the landlord's right to terminate the lease is that the jurisdiction recognizes retaliatory actions as a defense."
