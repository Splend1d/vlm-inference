A charge moving in the direction of an electric field experiences a force due to the electric field (F = qE). However, a charge moving along the direction of a magnetic field does not experience a force because the magnetic force acts perpendicular to both the velocity of the charge and the magnetic field.\n\nB. \"All charges experience a force in an electric field, but only moving charges can experience a force in a magnetic field.\"\n- This statement is also true. Charges experience a force in an electric field regardless of their motion (F = qE), whereas a magnetic field exerts a force on a charge only if it is moving (F = qvB sin\u03b8).\n\nC. \"A positive charge moves in the direction of an electric field; a positive charge moves perpendicular to a magnetic field.\"\n- This statement is partially correct. A positive charge moves in the direction of an electric field. However, it is not accurate to say that a positive charge moves perpendicular to a magnetic field. Instead, a moving positive charge experiences a force perpendicular to both its velocity and the magnetic field, according to the right-hand rule.\n\nD. \"All moving charges experience a force parallel to an electric field and perpendicular to a magnetic field.\"\n- This statement is false. Moving charges experience a force parallel to an electric field (F = qE) but perpendicular to both the magnetic field and the velocity of the charge (F = qvB sin\u03b8).\n\nTherefore, the false statement is D."
