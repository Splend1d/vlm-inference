                    "text": "This question refers to the following information.\nQuestions to the passage below, an account given to a French officer in Algeria in the 1830s by a member of an Arab slave trade caravan.\nThe Slave Trade\nAll of you [soldiers], are summoned . . . to hunt the idolatrous Koholanes [a pejorative word for \"black Africans\"]. . . . The soldiery divided themselves into two companies . . . with orders to attack places without defenses and to carry off the inhabitants as well as seizing all peasants busy cultivating their fields. . . . Whilst waiting for the return of the companies despatched to hunt Negroes, we went every day to the slave market where we bought at the following prices:\nA Negro with beard\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u202610 or 15,000 cowries.\nThey are not considered as merchandise since one has little chance of preventing them from escaping.\nAn adult Negress\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..10 or 15,000 cowries for the same reasons\nAn adolescent Negro\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.30,000 cowries\nA young Negress \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u202650\u201360,000 cowries\nThe price varies according to whether she is more or less beautiful.\nA male Negro child\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..45,000 cowries\nA female Negro child \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.35\u201340,000 cowries\nFinally, our caravan which had set out from Algeria with sixty-four camels and only sixteen persons, was now augmented by four hundred slaves, of whom three hundred were women. . . . It was at this point that suddenly a confused noise of cries and sobs passed from one group of slaves to another and reached our own. . . . Some rolled on the ground, clung to bushes and absolutely refused to walk. . . . They could only be got up with mighty lashes of the whip and by rendering them completely bloody.\nWhich conclusion is supported by the passage?\n\nA. Africans passively accepted their capture and subsequent enslavement.\nB. North Africans were primarily captured and enslaved by rival African tribes.\nC. Population changes from slavery resulted in North African tribes having more men than women.\nD. Adult male slaves were most highly valued due to their physical strength.\n"

                    "text": "To determine the correct conclusion supported by the passage, let's analyze each option in detail:\n\nA. **Africans passively accepted their capture and subsequent enslavement.**\n   - The passage mentions that some slaves \"rolled on the ground, clung to bushes and absolutely refused to walk,\" indicating resistance rather than passive acceptance. Therefore, this option is not supported by the passage.\n\nB. **North Africans were primarily captured and enslaved by rival African tribes.**\n   - The passage does not provide specific information about who was doing the capturing and enslaving. It focuses on the actions of the soldiers and the slave trade but does not specify the ethnicity or origin of the captors. Thus, this option cannot be conclusively supported by the passage.\n\nC. **Population changes from slavery resulted in North African tribes having more men than women.**\n   - The passage does not provide any information about population changes or gender ratios among North African tribes. It only discusses the number of slaves and their gender distribution within the caravan. Therefore, this option is not supported by the passage.\n\nD. **Adult male slaves were most highly valued due to their physical strength.**\n   - The passage lists the prices of different categories of slaves and notes that \"an adolescent Negro\" costs 30,000 cowries, while \"a young Negress\" costs 50-60,000 cowries. This suggests that young females were more highly valued than adolescent males, contradicting the idea that adult male slaves were most highly valued due to their physical strength. Therefore, this option is not supported by the passage.\n\nGiven the analysis, none of the provided options are directly supported by the passage. However, if forced to choose, the closest to being partially supported (though still not entirely accurate) might be B, as it is implied that the soldiers (likely North Africans) were involved in capturing and enslaving others. Yet, the passage does not explicitly state that these soldiers were North Africans or that they were primarily capturing other North Africans.\n\nIn conclusion, none of the conclusions are fully supported by the passage, but if forced to choose, B is the least inaccurate based on the limited information provided."
