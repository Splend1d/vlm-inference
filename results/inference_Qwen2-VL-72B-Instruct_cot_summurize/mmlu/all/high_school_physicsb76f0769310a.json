                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to consider the motion of the charged particle under the influence of an electric field. The force exerted on the particle by the electric field is given by:\n\n\\[ F = QE \\]\n\nThis force causes the particle to accelerate according to Newton's second law:\n\n\\[ F = ma \\]\n\nwhere \\( a \\) is the acceleration of the particle. Substituting the expression for the force, we get:\n\n\\[ QE = ma \\]\n\nSolving for the acceleration \\( a \\), we find:\n\n\\[ a = \\frac{QE}{m} \\]\n\nThe distance \\( d \\) traveled by the particle can be found using the kinematic equation for uniformly accelerated motion:\n\n\\[ d = v_0 t + \\frac{1}{2} at^2 \\]\n\nwhere \\( v_0 \\) is the initial velocity and \\( t \\) is the time taken to travel the distance \\( d \\). Since the particle starts from rest (\\( v_0 = 0 \\)), the equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[ d = \\frac{1}{2} at^2 \\]\n\nSubstituting the expression for \\( a \\):\n\n\\[ d = \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{QE}{m}\\right)t^2 \\]\n\nNow, let's consider the case where the original velocity is doubled and the mass is cut in half. The new initial velocity \\( v' \\) will be:\n\n\\[ v' = 2v_0 \\]\n\nAnd the new mass \\( m' \\) will be:\n\n\\[ m' = \\frac{1}{2}m \\]\n\nThe new acceleration \\( a' \\) will be:\n\n\\[ a' = \\frac{QE}{m'} = \\frac{QE}{\\frac{1}{2}m} = 2 \\cdot \\frac{QE}{m} = 2a \\]\n\nUsing the kinematic equation again with the new acceleration and initial velocity, we have:\n\n\\[ d' = \\frac{1}{2} a't'^2 \\]\n\nSince the initial velocity is doubled, the time \\( t' \\) it takes to travel the same distance \\( d \\) would be halved (because \\( d = v_0t \\)). Therefore, \\( t' = \\frac{1}{2}t \\).\n\nSubstituting \\( a' \\) and \\( t' \\) into the equation:\n\n\\[ d' = \\frac{1}{2} (2a) \\left(\\frac{1}{2}t\\right)^2 \\]\n\\[ d' = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 2a \\cdot \\frac{1}{4}t^2 \\]\n\\[ d' = \\frac{1}{4}at^2 \\]\n\nComparing this to the original distance \\( d \\):\n\n\\[ d' = \\frac{1}{4}d \\]\n\nTherefore, the particle travels one-fourth of the original distance when the original velocity is doubled and the mass is cut in half.\n\nThe correct answer is D. 1/2d."
