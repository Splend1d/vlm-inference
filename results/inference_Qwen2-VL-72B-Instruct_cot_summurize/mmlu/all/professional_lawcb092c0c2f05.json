                    "text": "To determine whether the farmer will most likely prevail in the in personam action against the friend to recover the amount of the mortgage due, we need to analyze the legal principles involved.\n\n1. **Assumption of Mortgage**: When the friend assumed the mortgage as stated in the quitclaim deed, it implies that the friend agreed to take over the responsibility for paying the mortgage debt. This is a crucial point because it indicates the friend's acknowledgment and agreement to fulfill the obligations associated with the mortgage.\n\n2. **In Personam Action**: An in personam action is one where the court orders the defendant (in this case, the friend) to pay a sum of money or perform some act. It is distinct from an in rem action, which focuses on the property itself rather than the individual.\n\n3. **Third-Party Beneficiary**: A third-party beneficiary is someone who benefits from a contract made by others. However, in this scenario, the farmer was not a party to the conveyance between the investor and the friend, so the farmer cannot claim to be a third-party beneficiary.\n\n4. **Delegation of Duties**: The conveyance between the investor and the friend did involve the assumption of the mortgage, which can be seen as a form of delegation of duties. However, the key issue here is whether the friend actually assumed the mortgage obligation.\n\nGiven these points:\n\n- Option A: The fact that the friend acquired title by quitclaim deed does not directly address the issue of whether the friend assumed the mortgage obligation.\n- Option B: The farmer was not a third-party beneficiary under the conveyance between the investor and the friend.\n- Option C: The conveyance did effectuate a delegation of duties since the friend assumed the mortgage.\n- Option D: The land being subject to the mortgage is relevant but does not address the friend\u2019s assumption of the mortgage obligation.\n\nThe most relevant consideration is the friend's assumption of the mortgage, which means the friend agreed to take over the mortgage payments. Therefore, the farmer will most likely prevail if the friend indeed assumed the mortgage obligation.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe farmer will most likely prevail, because the friend assumed the mortgage."
