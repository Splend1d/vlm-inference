Fred's unqualified acceptance on April 15 will not create a contract.\n\nHere's why:\n\n- **Option A** is incorrect because an unqualified acceptance within the specified time frame (ten days) would generally create a contract. Since the offer was received by Fred on April 5th, he has until April 14th to accept it unconditionally.\n\n- **Option B** is incorrect because the death of the offeror (James) does not automatically terminate the offer if it has been irrevocably made for a certain period. The offer remains valid for the stated duration unless otherwise specified.\n\n- **Option C** is incorrect because Fred's statement constitutes a counteroffer rather than an acceptance. A counteroffer terminates the original offer, so no contract is formed based on the original terms.\n\n- **Option D** is correct because the offer specifies that it will not be revocable for a ten-day period starting from when it was made, which is April 1st. Therefore, the offer expires on April 10th, and any acceptance after that date would not create a contract."
