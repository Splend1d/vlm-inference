                    "text": "A palpable left parasternal impulse suggests right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH). This is because the left parasternal area corresponds to the location of the right ventricle in the chest. When the right ventricle becomes enlarged or hypertrophied, it can cause a visible and palpable bulge or lift in this area during cardiac examination.\n\nHere's a brief overview of the other options:\n\n- B. Aortic stenosis: This condition involves narrowing of the aortic valve, which typically results in a systolic ejection murmur heard best at the right second intercostal space. It may not directly cause a palpable left parasternal impulse.\n  \n- C. Aortic regurgitation: This is characterized by backflow of blood from the aorta into the left ventricle during diastole, leading to a diastolic murmur heard best along the left sternal border. It does not typically present with a palpable left parasternal impulse.\n  \n- D. Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH): LVH is an enlargement of the left ventricle, often due to hypertension or aortic valve disease. While it can cause a displaced apical impulse (PMI), it would be felt more laterally and inferiorly than the left parasternal area.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Right ventricular hypertrophy"
