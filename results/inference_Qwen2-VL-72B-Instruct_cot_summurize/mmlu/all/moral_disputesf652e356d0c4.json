A self-evident proposition is one that is true by definition and does not require proof or evidence beyond itself.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. \"Every whole is greater than its part.\"\n- This statement is a fundamental principle in logic and mathematics, stating that a whole must be larger than any of its parts. It is generally accepted as self-evident.\n\nB. \"The light of Thy countenance, O Lord, is signed upon us.\"\n- This statement is a poetic or religious expression, likely from a psalm or prayer. It is not a logical or mathematical truth but rather an expression of faith or emotion. Therefore, it is not self-evident in the philosophical sense.\n\nC. \"Things equal to one and the same are equal to one another.\"\n- This is a basic principle of equality and is considered self-evident because it follows directly from the nature of equality.\n\nD. \"Man is a rational being.\"\n- This statement is a foundational concept in philosophy, particularly in discussions about human nature. While it may be widely accepted, it is not necessarily self-evident in the strictest sense, as it involves defining what constitutes a \"rational being.\"\n\nGiven this analysis, the statement that is not an example of a self-evident proposition according to Aquinas is:\n\nB. \"The light of Thy countenance, O Lord, is signed upon us.\""
