Although the owner used due care in keeping the animal in a securely fenced area, he knew of one prior incident where the animal got loose and bit someone. Is the dog's owner liable for the injuries to the mailman?\n\nA. No, he is not liable because he used due care and was not negligent under the circumstances.\nB. No, he is not liable because the man was on someone else's property at the time of the incident.\nC. Yes, he is liable because a dog owner is always liable for any injuries caused to a third person.\nD. Yes, he is liable because an owner who knows of the dog's dangerous propensities is strictly liable for ensuing damages.\n"

Yes, he is liable because an owner who knows of the dog's dangerous propensities is strictly liable for ensuing damages.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, if a dog owner knows or should have known about their dog's potentially dangerous behavior (such as a previous bite incident), they may be held strictly liable for any injuries caused by the dog, regardless of whether they took precautions like fencing the animal. This principle is based on the idea that the owner has a duty to control their pet and prevent foreseeable harm."
