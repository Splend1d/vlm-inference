In this case, the store is attempting to demonstrate that the plaintiff has a history of filing lawsuits alleging food poisoning, which could suggest that the current claim may not be genuine or is part of a pattern of behavior. This type of evidence can be relevant to the issue of the plaintiff's credibility and the genuineness of their claims."
