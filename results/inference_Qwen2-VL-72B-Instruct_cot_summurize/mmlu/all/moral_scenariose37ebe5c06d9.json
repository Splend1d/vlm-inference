It could be interpreted as an attempt to reassure the brother, even if not handled sensitively.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n- The main character observes someone putting drinks into their purse before checking out at a store.\n- This implies that the person is attempting to steal the drinks without paying for them.\n\n**Analysis:**\n- Observing someone stealing items from a store is a clear violation of moral and legal standards. Stealing is widely considered morally wrong.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n- Scenario 1 does not clearly involve a moral wrongdoing.\n- Scenario 2 clearly involves a moral wrongdoing.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong"
