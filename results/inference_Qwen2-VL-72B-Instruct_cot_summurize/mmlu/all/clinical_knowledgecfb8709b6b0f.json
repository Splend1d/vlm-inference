Alcohol can exacerbate the symptoms of benign essential tremor.\n\nB. Hemiballismus is due to a stroke causing paralysis of the distal half of the arm.\n- This statement is incorrect. Hemiballismus is characterized by violent, involuntary flinging movements of one side of the body, usually caused by lesions in the subthalamic nucleus, not by a stroke causing paralysis.\n\nC. A 'milkmaid' grip is sometimes found in dystonia.\n- This statement is correct. The 'milkmaid' grip is a term used to describe a dystonic posture where the hand is tightly clenched and the fingers are flexed, resembling the grip of a milkmaid.\n\nD. Writer's cramp is an example of a focal dystonia.\n- This statement is correct. Writer's cramp is a type of focal dystonia that affects the muscles involved in writing or other fine motor tasks.\n\nTherefore, the true statements are:\nA. Alcohol makes the tremor of benign essential tremor worse\nC. A 'milkmaid' grip is sometimes found in dystonia\nD. Writer's cramp is an example of a focal dystonia"
