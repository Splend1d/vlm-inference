C4 plants fix CO2 in the mesophyll but carry out the Calvin cycle in the bundle sheath, while CAM plants fix CO2 and carry out the Calvin cycle in the mesophyll.\nC.

C4 plants fix CO2 in the mesophyll but carry out the Calvin cycle in the bundle sheath, while CAM plants fix CO2 and carry out the Calvin cycle in the mesophyll.\n\nExplanation:\n- In C4 plants, the initial fixation of CO2 occurs in the mesophyll cells where it is converted into a four-carbon compound (oxaloacetate). This compound is then transported to the bundle sheath cells where it releases CO2 for use in the Calvin cycle.\n- In CAM plants, the fixation of CO2 occurs at night in the mesophyll cells, where it is stored as organic acids (such as malic acid). During the day, these acids release CO2 which is then used in the Calvin cycle within the same mesophyll cells."
