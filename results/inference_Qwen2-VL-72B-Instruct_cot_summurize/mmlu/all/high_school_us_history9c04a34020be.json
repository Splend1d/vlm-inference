                    "text": "To determine which of the given options best compares to Phillis Wheatley's poem \"On Being Brought from Africa to America,\" let's analyze the themes and messages present in both the poem and each option.\n\n1. **The Declaration of Independence**: This document asserts the natural rights of all individuals and the idea that all men are created equal. While it does touch on equality, it doesn't specifically address racial issues or the refinement of a particular group.\n\n2. **Jonathan Edwards's sermon \"Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God\"**: This sermon focuses on the wrath of God and the need for salvation through repentance. It does not address racial equality or the potential for moral refinement among different races.\n\n3. **The Seneca Falls Declaration of Rights and Sentiments**: This document advocates for women's rights and equality, particularly focusing on suffrage and other civil liberties for women. Although it deals with equality, it is specific to gender rather than race.\n\n4. **Martin Luther King, Jr.'s \"I Have a Dream\u201d speech**: This speech calls for racial equality and justice, emphasizing the potential for all people, regardless of race, to achieve their dreams and live together in harmony. It directly addresses the issue of racial discrimination and the hope for a better future.\n\nGiven this analysis, the most fitting comparison to Wheatley's poem, which speaks about the potential for moral refinement and inclusion of African Americans (referred to as \"Negroes\") into society and the possibility of them joining the \"angelic train,\" is Martin Luther King, Jr.'s \"I Have a Dream\u201d speech. Both works advocate for the recognition of inherent human dignity and the potential for all individuals, regardless of race, to achieve moral and social equality.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**D. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s \"I Have a Dream\u201d speech**"
