An excess of energy yielding substrates\n\nDe novo fatty acid synthesis, also known as lipogenesis, is the process by which organisms synthesize fatty acids from small-molecule substrates such as acetyl-CoA, derived from carbohydrates or amino acids. This process typically occurs when there is an excess of energy-yielding substrates available in the body, leading to the storage of energy in the form of fat."
