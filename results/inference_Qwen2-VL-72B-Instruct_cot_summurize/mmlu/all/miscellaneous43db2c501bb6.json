Ability to identify the main idea\n\nWhen assessing reading comprehension, the ability to identify the main idea is crucial because it demonstrates that the reader can grasp and retain the central message or theme of the text. This skill involves synthesizing information from various parts of the text and understanding the overall purpose or argument presented by the author. While other skills like decoding new words and recognizing rhyming patterns are important for different aspects of literacy, they do not directly measure the depth of comprehension as effectively as identifying the main idea does."
