                    "text": "An investor owned substantial oil and mineral interests in the Rocky Mountains. In July 1990, the investor acquired title to a 100-acre tract located just outside the city limits in a rural area. In 1997, the investor decided to sell his vast ranching and oil interests in the Rocky Mountains. In July, the investor conveyed the tract for a consideration of one dollar, receipt of which was acknowledged, \"to my nephew, his heirs, and assigns, but if my nephew's wife dies without issue, to my chef and her heirs and assigns. \"After taking possession of the 100-acre tract, the nephew discovered considerable oil reserves on the property. He then began oil drilling operations and removed large quantities of oil, which he sold. At no time did he give notice to the chef of his oil-drilling activities. Months passed before the chef learned that the nephew was selling oil from the drilling operations. The chef has now brought an action in equity for an accounting of the value of the oil removed and for an injunction against any further oil removal. If the nephew's wife died without issue before the beginning of the nephew's oil drilling operations, would this improve the likelihood of the chef's success than if the wife were still alive?\n\nA. No, because the right to remove oil is an incident of the right to possession.\nB. No, because the nature of the nephew's estate would not be altered by the wife's death.\nC. Yes, because the wife's death without issue would convert the nephew's fee into a reversionary interest.\nD. Yes, because although the nephew still has a fee, it would now be certain to terminate.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is:\n\nD. Yes, because although the nephew still has a fee, it would now be certain to terminate.\n\nExplanation:\nIn the given scenario, the conveyance to the nephew includes a condition subsequent: if the nephew's wife dies without issue, the property will revert to the chef. This creates a defeasible fee simple estate for the nephew, which can be terminated upon the occurrence of the specified event (the wife's death without issue).\n\nIf the nephew's wife dies without issue before the beginning of the oil drilling operations, the condition subsequent would have been met, and the nephew's estate would be subject to termination. This means that the nephew's right to possess and use the property, including the right to drill for oil, would be uncertain and could be extinguished at any moment. Therefore, the chef's claim for an accounting of the value of the oil removed and an injunction against further oil removal would be stronger, as the nephew's rights over the property are contingent and could be lost.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the right to remove oil is indeed an incident of the right to possession, but the key issue here is the uncertainty of the nephew's continued possession due to the condition subsequent.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the nature of the nephew's estate is indeed altered by the wife's death without issue, as it becomes subject to immediate termination.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the nephew's fee does not convert into a reversionary interest; rather, it remains a defeasible fee simple estate that is subject to termination upon the occurrence of the specified event."
