This means that a voter might vote for a presidential candidate from one party and a congressional candidate from another party.\n\nGiven this definition, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. A presidential nominee selects a running mate who can appeal to voter groups whose support of the nominee is weak.\n- This describes a strategy used by a presidential nominee to broaden their appeal, not a voting behavior.\n\nB. A voter chooses the presidential nominee of one major party, but chooses congressional nominees of the other major party.\n- This directly describes the act of a voter selecting candidates from different parties for different offices, which fits the definition of ticket splitting.\n\nC. A mayor orders the local police force to hand out fewer parking violations in the weeks leading up to the general election.\n- This describes an action taken by a mayor, likely to influence public opinion or gain favor, but it does not describe a voter's behavior regarding ticket splitting.\n\nD. A delegate to a national party convention supports the front-runner but remains uncommitted on the party platform.\n- This describes a delegate's stance on a candidate and the party platform, not a voter's behavior regarding ticket splitting.\n\nTherefore, the option that best describes the practice of \"ticket splitting\" is:\n\nB. A voter chooses the presidential nominee of one major party, but chooses congressional nominees of the other major party."
