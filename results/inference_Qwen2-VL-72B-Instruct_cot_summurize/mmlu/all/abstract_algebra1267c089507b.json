A polynomial is irreducible if it cannot be factored into non-constant polynomials with coefficients in the same field.\n\nGiven that \\(\\mathbb{Z}_3 = \\{0, 1, 2\\}\\), let's check each value of \\(c\\) to see if \\(x^3 + x^2 + c\\) is irreducible:\n\n### For \\(c = 0\\):\nThe polynomial becomes \\(x^3 + x^2\\). This can be factored as \\(x^2(x + 1)\\), so it is reducible.\n\n### For \\(c = 1\\):\nThe polynomial becomes \\(x^3 + x^2 + 1\\). We need to check if this has any roots in \\(\\mathbb{Z}_3\\).\n\n- For \\(x = 0\\): \\(0^3 + 0^2 + 1 = 1\\)\n- For \\(x = 1\\): \\(1^3 + 1^2 + 1 = 1 + 1 + 1 = 0\\) (in \\(\\mathbb{Z}_3\\))\n- For \\(x = 2\\): \\(2^3 + 2^2 + 1 = 8 + 4 + 1 = 13 = 1\\) (in \\(\\mathbb{Z}_3\\))\n\nSince \\(x = 1\\) is a root, the polynomial is reducible.\n\n### For \\(c = 2\\):\nThe polynomial becomes \\(x^3 + x^2 + 2\\). Again, we check for roots in \\(\\mathbb{Z}_3\\):\n\n- For \\(x = 0\\): \\(0^3 + 0^2 + 2 = 2\\)\n- For \\(x = 1\\): \\(1^3 + 1^2 + 2 = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4 = 1\\) (in \\(\\mathbb{Z}_3\\))\n- For \\(x = 2\\): \\(2^3 + 2^2 + 2 = 8 + 4 + 2 = 14 = 2\\) (in \\(\\mathbb{Z}_3\\))\n\nNone of these are roots, and since it's a cubic polynomial without any roots in \\(\\mathbb{Z}_3\\), it must be irreducible.\n\nTherefore, the only value of \\(c\\) in \\(\\mathbb{Z}_3\\) that makes \\(\\mathbb{Z}_3[x]/(x^3 + x^2 + c)\\) a field is when \\(c = 2\\).\n\nThe correct answer is **B. 2**."
