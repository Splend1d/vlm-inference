Reliable dose-response data are difficult to acquire and often unavailable.\n\nObservational epidemiology studies can identify associations between exposure to food contaminants and health effects, but they may not be able to establish causation or assess risk effectively due to difficulties in acquiring reliable dose-response data. Dose-response relationships are crucial for understanding how varying levels of exposure relate to different health outcomes, which is essential for risk assessment."
