They change the habitat in a way that makes it more habitable for other organisms.\n\nOrganisms that are the first to colonize a habitat undergoing ecological succession, often referred to as pioneer species, typically alter the environment in ways that make it more suitable for subsequent species. This process can involve altering soil composition, creating shade, or providing shelter, which facilitates the establishment of other organisms in the ecosystem."
