Regression toward the mean occurs when extreme scores on a variable tend to move closer to the average over time. If participants are selected based on their extreme scores (either very high or very low), their scores may naturally move toward the mean during the study, making it difficult to determine whether any observed changes are due to the treatment or simply due to statistical regression. This can confound the results and make it challenging to attribute outcomes directly to the intervention being studied."
