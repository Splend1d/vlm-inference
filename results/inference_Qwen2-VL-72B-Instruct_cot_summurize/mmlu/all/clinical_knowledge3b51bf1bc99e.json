Here's an analysis of each option:\n\nA. **It affects males more than females** - This statement is false. Systemic sclerosis actually affects females more frequently than males.\n\nB. **If telangiectasia are seen this clinches the diagnosis** - While telangiectasia (small blood vessels near the surface of the skin) can be a feature of systemic sclerosis, they are not diagnostic on their own. The presence of telangiectasia alone does not confirm the diagnosis; other symptoms and clinical findings must be considered.\n\nC. **Arachnodactyly is a feature of the disease** - This statement is false. Arachnodactyly, which refers to long, thin fingers, is not a feature of systemic sclerosis. It is typically associated with conditions like Marfan syndrome.\n\nD. **Patients have a beaked shaped nose and waxy skin** - This statement is true. In systemic sclerosis, patients may develop a characteristic beak-shaped nose due to the tightening and thickening of the skin and underlying tissues. Additionally, the skin often appears waxy or shiny due to the fibrosis that occurs in the disease.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Patients have a beaked shaped nose and waxy skin"
