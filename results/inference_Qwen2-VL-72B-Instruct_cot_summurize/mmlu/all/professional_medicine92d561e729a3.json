Six weeks ago, she received a kidney transplant from a living, related donor. Immediately after the operation, she received monoclonal anti-CD3 therapy. Current medications are azathioprine, cyclosporine, and prednisone. Her temperature is 39\u00b0C (102.2\u00b0F). Physical examination shows a well-healed surgical scar. Serum studies show that her urea nitrogen and creatinine concentrations have tripled. A diagnosis of allograft rejection is suspected. In addition, this patient's clinical presentation is best explained by an infection with which of the following agents?\n\nA. Adenovirus\nB. BK virus\nC. Epstein-Barr virus\nD. Herpes simplex virus\n"

                    "text": "The clinical presentation of the patient, including the recent kidney transplant, immunosuppressive medication regimen, and symptoms of cold-like symptoms and fatigue, along with elevated serum urea nitrogen and creatinine levels, suggests a possible allograft rejection. However, given the context of immunosuppression and the presence of cold-like symptoms, it is also important to consider opportunistic infections that can occur in transplant recipients.\n\nAmong the options provided:\n\nA. Adenovirus - While adenovirus can cause respiratory symptoms, it is less commonly associated with the specific clinical presentation described.\nB. BK virus - BK virus is known to reactivate in immunocompromised individuals, particularly those who have undergone renal transplantation. It can lead to nephropathy and graft dysfunction, which aligns with the patient's rising creatinine levels.\nC. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) - EBV can cause infectious mononucleosis, but it is less likely to present with the specific symptoms described and is not typically associated with acute renal failure post-transplantation.\nD. Herpes simplex virus (HSV) - HSV can cause various infections, but it is less likely to be the primary cause of the described symptoms and renal function decline in this context.\n\nGiven the patient's history and clinical presentation, the most plausible explanation for the additional symptoms and potential graft dysfunction would be an infection with **BK virus** (Option B). BK virus reactivation is a known complication in kidney transplant recipients on immunosuppressive therapy and can lead to significant morbidity if not promptly recognized and treated."
