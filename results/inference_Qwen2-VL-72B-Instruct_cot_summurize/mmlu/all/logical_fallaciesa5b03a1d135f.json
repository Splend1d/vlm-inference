It assumes that popularity or commonality equates to correctness or appropriateness.\n\nLet's briefly analyze the other options for clarity:\n\nA. This describes the fallacy of ad hominem tu quoque, where an argument is dismissed based on a perceived flaw in the arguer rather than addressing the argument itself.\n\nB. This describes the fallacy of appeal to consequences, where an argument is made based on the potential outcomes rather than the inherent merits of the argument.\n\nC. This describes the fallacy of suppression of evidence or cherry-picking, where relevant information is deliberately omitted to mislead or support a particular viewpoint.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. arguing that something is the right thing to do based only on evidence that other people are already doing it."
