According to Hume, if a person is unaffected by images of human happiness or misery, it suggests a lack of emotional engagement with others' experiences. This indifference would likely extend to other areas where emotions play a significant role, such as art and beauty (which often evoke emotional responses), virtue and vice (which involve moral sentiments), and even one's own well-being (since personal happiness and suffering are deeply emotional experiences). Therefore, the person would be indifferent to all of these aspects."
