Three weeks after the robbery, a defendant was arrested and charged with the crime. At trial, the prosecuting attorney seeks to introduce evidence that the defendant had previously committed a robbery wearing a yellow ski mask, goggles, and a fluorescent yellow jumpsuit. Upon objection by the defendant's attorney, the proffered evidence should be\n\nA. admissible as circumstantial evidence that the defendant committed the crime as charged.\nB. admissible, to show the identity of the defendant.\nC. inadmissible, because the probative value of the evidence is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.\nD. inadmissible, because it constitutes improper character evidence.\n"

However, such evidence may be admissible for other purposes, such as proving motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident. \n\nIn this case, the evidence of the defendant's previous robbery involving similar attire could potentially be used to establish identity if there were distinctive features or circumstances that strongly linked the defendant to both crimes. However, the use of such evidence must be carefully balanced against the risk of unfair prejudice, which includes the possibility that the jury might convict the defendant based solely on his past behavior rather than the evidence presented for the current charge.\n\nGiven the similarity in attire between the two robberies, the evidence might have some probative value regarding identity. However, the risk of unfair prejudice from introducing evidence of a prior crime is significant, especially when the attire is so distinctive that it could lead jurors to believe the defendant has a propensity to commit such crimes. Therefore, the court would likely find that the danger of unfair prejudice outweighs any probative value, making the evidence inadmissible under Rule 403 of the Federal Rules of Evidence or similar state rules.\n\nThus, option C is the most appropriate choice."
