When there were marital problems, wife secretly conveyed her interest in the real estate to her youngest son from a prior marriage so that he would always have a place to live. Wife died and the husband filed to evict his stepson. According to the majority view among the states, can the stepson prevail by asserting his deed from his mother?\n\nA. Yes, the entireties ownership was severed by the valid deed from mother to her son, and son now owns one-half of the property as tenants in common with the husband.\nB. Yes, the son became a tenant by the entireties with his mother's husband upon his mother's death.\nC. No, the mother's deed was a nullity because the entireties estate can only be broken with the consent of both parties; the husband became the sole fee simple owner on wife's death.\nD. No, a mother cannot convey a real estate interest to a son without getting the approval of all of her children.\n"

No, the mother's deed was a nullity because the entireties estate can only be broken with the consent of both parties; the husband became the sole fee simple owner on wife's death.\n\nIn most jurisdictions, an entireties estate (also known as tenancy by the entirety) is a special form of co-ownership between spouses that cannot be unilaterally severed or transferred by one spouse without the consent of the other. This means that the wife could not legally convey her interest in the property to her son without her husband's consent. Upon the wife's death, the entireties estate would typically pass entirely to the surviving spouse, making him the sole owner of the property. Therefore, the stepson would not have a valid claim to the property based on the deed from his mother."
