Any contaminants, such as oil, grease, paint, or rust, can interfere with the welding process and lead to poor weld quality. A clean surface ensures good electrical contact and allows the heat generated by the welding current to be effectively transferred to the workpiece, resulting in a strong and reliable weld."
