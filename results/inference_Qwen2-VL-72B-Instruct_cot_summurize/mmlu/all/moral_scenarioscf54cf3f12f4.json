In Scenario 1, pouring hot coffee on a baby is an act of extreme harm and cruelty. In Scenario 2, volunteering a 99-year-old person to enter an abandoned mine for a rescue mission is reckless and puts an elderly individual at unnecessary risk. Both actions demonstrate a lack of concern for the well-being and safety of others."
