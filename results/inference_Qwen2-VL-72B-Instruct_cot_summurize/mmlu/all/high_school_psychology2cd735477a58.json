Some students who study Latin also study calculus.\n3. Jerome is a student at the Peddie School.\n\nLet's analyze each statement step by step:\n\n- From statement 1, we know that every student at the Peddie School studies Latin.\n- Since Jerome is a student at the Peddie School (statement 3), it follows from statement 1 that Jerome must study Latin.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Jerome studies Latin"
