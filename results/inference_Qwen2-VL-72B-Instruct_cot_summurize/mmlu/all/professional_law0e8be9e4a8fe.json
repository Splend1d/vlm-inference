                    "text": "For many months, a buyer had been negotiating with a man for the purchase of a tract of land. Finally, on August 18, 2009, the buyer and the man entered into a real estate sales contract that provided in part:\"I, (the man), agree to convey good and marketable title to (the buyer) 60 days from the date of this contract. \" The stated purchase price for the tract was$175,000. On October 11, 2009, the buyer phoned the man and told him that his title search indicated that a third party, not the man, was the owner of record of the property. The man responded that, notwithstanding the state of the record, he had been in adverse possession for 21 years. The statutory period of adverse possession in this jurisdiction is 20 years. The next day the buyer conducted an investigation that revealed that the man had, in fact, been in adverse possession of the tract for 21 years. At the time set for closing, the man tendered a deed in the form agreed in the sales contract. The buyer, however, refused to pay the purchase price or take possession of the tract because of the man's inability to convey \"good and marketable title. \"In an appropriate action by the man against the buyer for specific performance, the vendor will\n\nA. prevail, because he has obtained \"good and marketable title\" by adverse possession.\nB. prevail, because the man's action for specific performance is an action in rem to which the third party is not a necessary party.\nC. not prevail, because an adverse possessor takes title subject to an equitable lien from the dispossessed owner.\nD. not prevail, because the buyer cannot be required to buy a lawsuit even if the probability is great that the buyer would prevail against the man.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is:\n\nD. not prevail, because the buyer cannot be required to buy a lawsuit even if the probability is great that the buyer would prevail against the man.\n\nExplanation:\nIn the scenario described, the man claims to have obtained title through adverse possession, which typically requires continuous, open, notorious, hostile, and exclusive possession for a statutory period (in this case, 21 years). However, the buyer's refusal to accept the deed is based on the concern that the title is not \"good and marketable,\" as stipulated in the sales contract.\n\nGood and marketable title generally means that there are no significant defects or encumbrances on the title that would prevent the buyer from obtaining clear ownership. Adverse possession can sometimes result in a good and marketable title, but it depends on the specific circumstances and legal requirements of the jurisdiction.\n\nIn this situation, the buyer's concern about the title's validity is reasonable given the uncertainty surrounding the third party's claim. The buyer should not be forced to accept a title that may lead to future legal disputes or challenges. Therefore, the man would not prevail in an action for specific performance because the buyer cannot be compelled to purchase a property with a potentially defective title, even if the man's adverse possession claim might ultimately succeed.\n\nOption A is incorrect because adverse possession does not automatically equate to good and marketable title without further proof and legal validation.\nOption B is incorrect because the nature of the action and the necessity of parties involved are not relevant to the core issue of the title's marketability.\nOption C is incorrect because the focus here is on the buyer's right to refuse a potentially defective title, not on the specifics of the adverse possessor's rights."
