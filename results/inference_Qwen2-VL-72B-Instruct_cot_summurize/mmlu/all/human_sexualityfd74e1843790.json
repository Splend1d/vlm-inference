In this scenario, the adult recognizes that his arousal in response to a child is inappropriate, leading to anxiety rather than continued arousal. This recognition and the resulting anxiety are indicative of cognitive dissonance, where the individual experiences discomfort due to the inconsistency between his sexual response and his moral or ethical standards."
