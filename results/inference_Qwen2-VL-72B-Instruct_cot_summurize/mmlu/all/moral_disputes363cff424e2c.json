All of the above.\n\nMichael Huemer, in his arguments regarding drug prohibition, suggests that there is no compelling reason to believe that the harms associated with drug use are uniquely worse or more detrimental compared to other legally permitted activities that also carry risks and potential for harm. He argues that if we consider the average harm, the nature of the harm, and the impact on a person's character, drug use does not stand out as significantly different from other activities that are currently legal. Therefore, all three points (A, B, and C) are part of his argument against the prohibition of drugs."
