Unlike perfect competition, where there are no barriers to entry and firms earn zero economic profit in the long run, monopolistic competition allows for some degree of market power due to product differentiation. However, in the long run, firms in monopolistic competition typically earn zero economic profit as new entrants are attracted by short-term profits, increasing competition and driving down prices. The price in monopolistic competition does not necessarily exceed average total cost or average variable cost in the long run, and while there may be excess capacity, it is not a defining characteristic of the market structure."
