They know that musical tastes vary by geographical region. Which of the following sample plans would produce the most representative sample of its customers?\n\nA. Choose all of the customers who joined in the last month.\nB. Make a list of all the customers who joined in the last 12 months and choose a random sample of customers on this list.\nC. From the list of all customers who joined in the last 12 months, classify customers by the state in which they live, then choose 10 customers from each state.\nD.

Choose all of the customers who joined in the last month.**\n- This option only includes customers who joined very recently, potentially missing out on those who joined earlier in the 12-month period. It may not be representative of the entire customer base over the past year.\n\n**B. Make a list of all the customers who joined in the last 12 months and choose a random sample of customers on this list.**\n- This option ensures that all customers who joined in the past 12 months have an equal chance of being selected. However, it does not account for geographical variation, which could lead to underrepresentation or overrepresentation of certain regions.\n\n**C. From the list of all customers who joined in the last 12 months, classify customers by the state in which they live, then choose 10 customers from each state.**\n- This option ensures representation from every state but choosing a fixed number (10) from each state might not accurately reflect the proportion of customers living in each state. States with larger populations might be underrepresented if they have more than 10 customers who joined in the past 12 months.\n\n**D. From the list of all customers who joined in the last 12 months, classify customers by the state in which they live, then choose 3% of the customers from each state.**\n- This option takes into account both the temporal and geographical aspects. By selecting 3% of customers from each state, it ensures proportional representation based on the actual distribution of customers across states. This method is likely to provide a more accurate reflection of the overall customer base.\n\nGiven these considerations, **Option D** would produce the most representative sample of the company's customers because it accounts for both the time frame and the geographical diversity of the customer base."
