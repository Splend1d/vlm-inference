They did practice agriculture but are not typically referred to as temple-mound builders.\n\nB. **Hohokam**: Similar to the Ancestral Puebloans, the Hohokam are also from the American Southwest and are known for their irrigation systems and pottery. They were agriculturalists but are not known for building temple mounds.\n\nC. **Mississippian**: The Mississippian culture is well-known for constructing large earthen mounds, often referred to as temple mounds. They were based in the southeastern United States and relied heavily on agriculture, including maize and squash.\n\nD. **Adena**: The Adena culture is known for their large burial mounds rather than temple mounds. They were located in the Ohio Valley and while they practiced some agriculture, they are not primarily known for their reliance on maize and squash.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n**C. Mississippian**"
