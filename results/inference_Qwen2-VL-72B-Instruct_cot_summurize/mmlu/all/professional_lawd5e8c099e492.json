Three days after the contract was formed, but prior to delivery of the casebooks, the publisher called the owner of the law bookstore and informed him that, because of a calculation error, the price for the casebooks should have been $11 per book, and the shipment could not be delivered unless the owner promised to pay that amount. The owner reluctantly agreed.

The owner of the law bookstore reluctantly agreed to the new price. Although there might not be new consideration provided by the owner (which would typically be required for a modification of a contract), the principle of promissory estoppel can still apply.\n\nPromissory estoppel allows for the enforcement of a promise even in the absence of consideration if the promisee has reasonably relied on the promise to their detriment. Here, the owner relied on the publisher's initial offer and agreed to the new price based on the publisher's claim of an error. Therefore, the owner's agreement to pay $11 per book is enforceable under the principle of promissory estoppel."
