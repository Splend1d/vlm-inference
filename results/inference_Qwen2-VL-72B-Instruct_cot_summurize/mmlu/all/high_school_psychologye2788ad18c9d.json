The results indicate that the test has low test-retest reliability.\n\nTest-retest reliability refers to the consistency of test scores over time when the same test is administered to the same individuals on different occasions. If a personality test yields vastly different results for the same individual on different occasions, it suggests that the test lacks stability and therefore has low test-retest reliability. This inconsistency undermines the trustworthiness of the test's results."
