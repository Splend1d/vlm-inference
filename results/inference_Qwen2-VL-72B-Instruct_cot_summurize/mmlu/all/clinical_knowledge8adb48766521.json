This can be expressed as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Concentration} = \\frac{1 \\, \\text{mg}}{1000 \\, \\text{mL}} \\]\n\nLet's convert this into other units to match the options provided:\n\n1. **Option A: 1 mg/mL**\n   - This is much higher than 1 mg/1000 mL.\n\n2. **Option B: 1 mg/L**\n   - This is the same as 1 mg/1000 mL because 1 L = 1000 mL.\n\n3. **Option C: 1 g/mL**\n   - This is significantly higher than 1 mg/1000 mL since 1 g = 1000 mg.\n\n4. **Option D: 100 micrograms/mL**\n   - This is lower than 1 mg/1000 mL because 1 mg = 1000 micrograms.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**B. 1 mg/L**"
