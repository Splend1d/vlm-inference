They have also built up their armies to a state of great efficiency and are possessed of war implements of great power and precision, in short have license to be formidable powers. If, therefore, we persistently cling to our antiquated systems, heaven only knows what a mighty calamity may befall our Empire.\n\u2014Adapted from a letter written by Lord Ii to Lord Tokugawa, 1847\nHow did Japan respond to the concerns raised by Lord Ii during this era?\n\nA. The government dismantled the Chinese-style civil service system.\nB. The government undertook a program of conquest in the Pacific.\nC. The country sent emissaries to study western democracies and industry.\nD. The country turned inward and closed its ports to all foreigners.\n"

While Japan did undergo reforms, the specific mention of dismantling the Chinese-style civil service system does not directly address the concerns about technological and military advancements.\n\nB. **The government undertook a program of conquest in the Pacific.**\n   - This option implies an aggressive expansionist policy. However, the concerns raised by Lord Ii were more about modernizing Japan's capabilities rather than initiating a program of conquest.\n\nC. **The country sent emissaries to study western democracies and industry.**\n   - This option aligns well with the concerns raised by Lord Ii. It indicates that Japan recognized the need to learn from Western advancements in technology and military strength. Sending emissaries to study these areas would be a practical response to the need for modernization.\n\nD. **The country turned inward and closed its ports to all foreigners.**\n   - This option contradicts the concerns raised by Lord Ii. If Japan were to turn inward and close its ports, it would not be able to learn from or compete with the technological and military advancements of foreign states.\n\nGiven the context and the concerns expressed by Lord Ii, the most appropriate response would be:\n\n**C. The country sent emissaries to study western democracies and industry.**\n\nThis action would allow Japan to understand and adopt the technological and military advancements necessary to avoid the \"mighty calamity\" feared by Lord Ii."
