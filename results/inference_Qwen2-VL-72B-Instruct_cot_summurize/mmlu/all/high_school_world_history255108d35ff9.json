Our strength, because it gives to us rights of the public interest over private interests; our weakness, because it rallies all vicious men against us. We must smother the internal and external enemies of the Republic or perish with it; now in this situation, the first maxim of your policy ought to be to lead the people by reason and the people's enemies by terror. Terror is nothing other than justice, prompt, severe, inflexible; it is therefore an emanation of virtue; it is not so much a special principle as it is a consequence of the general principle of democracy applied to our country's most urgent needs.\nFrench revolutionary leader Maximilien Robespierre, 1794\nThe passage above appears to articulate which of the following political principles?\n\nA.

                    "text": "To determine which political principle the passage articulates, let's analyze the key points made by Maximilien Robespierre:\n\n1. **Strength and Weakness**: The passage discusses the purity of the French Revolution as both a strength (giving rights of the public interest over private interests) and a weakness (rallying vicious men against them).\n2. **Enemies of the Republic**: It emphasizes the need to suppress internal and external enemies to preserve the Republic.\n3. **Policy Maxim**: The passage suggests leading the people by reason and the enemies by terror.\n4. **Terror as Justice**: It defines terror as prompt, severe, inflexible justice, an emanation of virtue, and a consequence of democratic principles applied to urgent needs.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. **From each according to his abilities, to each according to his needs**:\n   - This principle is associated with communism and socialism, emphasizing equitable distribution based on individual contributions and needs. The passage does not explicitly discuss this concept.\n\nB. **Might makes right**:\n   - This principle suggests that power or force determines what is right. While the passage mentions suppressing enemies, it frames this within the context of justice and virtue rather than sheer power.\n\nC. **The end justifies the means**:\n   - This principle implies that achieving a desired outcome can justify any method used to achieve it. The passage supports using terror (a severe measure) to protect the Republic, suggesting that the preservation of the Republic justifies the use of terror.\n\nD. **The government is best that governs least**:\n   - This principle advocates for minimal government intervention. The passage, however, supports active measures (terror) to manage threats to the Republic, indicating a more interventionist stance.\n\nGiven the analysis, the passage aligns most closely with the principle that \"the end justifies the means,\" as it supports using severe measures (terror) to protect the Republic.\n\nFinal answer: C. The end justifies the means"
