He was subsequently convicted in state court of possession with intent to distribute narcotics. Following his conviction, the drug dealer was sentenced to a prison term of 10 years. After being sentenced, the drug dealer's attorney appealed the conviction, citing jury misconduct. While his appeal was pending, the drug dealer was then indicted by both a federal and a state grand jury for conspiracy to distribute the same cocaine. The drug dealer's attorney filed motions to dismiss each of the new indictments on the grounds that they violate double jeopardy. In all likelihood, double jeopardy requires the dismissal of\n\nA. both indictments.\nB. the state indictment, but not the federal indictment.\nC. the federal indictment, but not the state indictment.\nD. neither of the indictments.\n"

However, there is an exception when it comes to concurrent jurisdiction between state and federal courts. This exception is known as the \"dual sovereignty doctrine,\" which allows for separate trials in state and federal courts for the same act if each court has independent sovereignty over the crime.\n\nIn this case, the drug dealer has already been convicted in state court for possession with intent to distribute narcotics. The subsequent indictments for conspiracy to distribute the same cocaine involve the same underlying act but are brought under different jurisdictions (state and federal).\n\nGiven the dual sovereignty doctrine, it is likely that:\n\nD. Neither of the indictments would be dismissed based on double jeopardy grounds because the state and federal governments are considered separate sovereigns capable of prosecuting the same act independently.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer is D."
