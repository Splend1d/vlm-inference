The cube has 8 vertices, and each vertex is labeled with the product of the three numbers on the faces adjacent to it.\n\nThe sum of the products at the vertices can be represented as follows:\n\n\\[S = abc + abe + ade + acf + bcf + bde + cdf + efg\\]\n\nNotice that each edge of the cube contributes to two vertices' products. For example, the edge between \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) contributes to both \\(abc\\) and \\(abe\\). Therefore, we can rewrite \\(S\\) by grouping terms based on their shared edges:\n\n\\[S = (ab)(c+e) + (ad)(b+f) + (ac)(d+f) + (be)(d+c) + (af)(b+e) + (bf)(a+d)\\]\n\nGiven that \\(S = 1001\\), we need to find the sum of the numbers on the faces, which is \\(a+b+c+d+e+f\\).\n\nHowever, there seems to be a misunderstanding in the interpretation of the problem statement. The correct approach involves recognizing that each pair of opposite faces contributes equally to the sum of the products at the vertices because each vertex product includes exactly one number from each pair of opposite faces. \n\nLet's correct this and re-evaluate:\n\nGiven the structure of the cube, each vertex product includes exactly one number from each pair of opposite faces. Therefore, if we consider the pairs of opposite faces as \\((a, d)\\), \\((b, e)\\), and \\((c, f)\\), the sum of the products at the vertices can be expressed in terms of these pairs:\n\n\\[S = (a+d)(b+e)(c+f)\\]\n\nGiven \\(S = 1001\\), and knowing that \\(1001 = 7 \\times 11 \\times 13\\), we can deduce that the sums of the pairs of opposite faces must correspond to these prime factors. Thus, without loss of generality, let's assume:\n\n- \\(a + d = 7\\)\n- \\(b + e = 11\\)\n- \\(c + f = 13\\)\n\nAdding these equations gives us the total sum of all numbers on the faces:\n\n\\[a + b + c + d + e + f = 7 + 11 + 13 = 31\\]\n\nTherefore, the sum of the numbers written on the faces is \\(31\\), which corresponds to option D."
