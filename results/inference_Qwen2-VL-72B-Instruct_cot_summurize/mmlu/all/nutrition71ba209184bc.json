Protein turnover is one aspect of the metabolic demand for amino acids, but it doesn't encompass all aspects.\n\nC. \"The metabolic demand involves consumption of amino-acids by a number of irreversible pathways and these are either obligatory or adaptive.\"\n- This statement is correct. Amino acids are consumed in various metabolic pathways that are either obligatory (essential) or adaptive (non-essential), contributing to different physiological needs.\n\nD. \"The metabolic demand is a fixed amount.\"\n- This statement is incorrect because the metabolic demand for amino acids can vary depending on factors such as age, health status, physical activity level, and other individual differences.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is:\n\nC. The metabolic demand involves consumption of amino-acids by a number of irreversible pathways and these are either obligatory or adaptive."
