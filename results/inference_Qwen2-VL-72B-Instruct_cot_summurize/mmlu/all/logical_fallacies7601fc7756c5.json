Equivocation\n\nEquivocation occurs when a word or phrase with multiple meanings is used in an ambiguous way, leading to a misleading conclusion. In this case, the term \"discrimination\" is used in two different senses: \n\n1. The everyday sense of making choices based on preferences (e.g., choosing pleasant tastes over unpleasant ones).\n2. The legal and social sense of unjust treatment based on prejudice (e.g., racial or gender discrimination).\n\nBy conflating these two meanings, the argument incorrectly suggests that laws against discrimination are unnecessary because discrimination is a natural part of life. This is a classic example of equivocation."
