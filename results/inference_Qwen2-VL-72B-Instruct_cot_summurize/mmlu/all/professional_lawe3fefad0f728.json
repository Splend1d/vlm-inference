The worker brought a federal diversity action against both the machine's manufacturer and the company responsible for the machine's maintenance. At trial, the worker submitted a proposed jury instruction on negligence. The court did not accept the proposed instruction and instead gave a negligence instruction that the worker's attorney believed was less favorable and legally incorrect. The attorney did not object to the negligence instruction before it was given. The jury returned a verdict for the defendants. The worker has moved for a new trial on the ground that the court's negligence instruction was improper. What argument has the best chance of persuading the court to grant the motion?\n\nA. Issues of law can be raised at any time.\nB. The court's negligence instruction was incorrect and the worker's objection to it was preserved when he submitted his it was preserved when he submitted his proposed negligence instruction.\nC.

The court's negligence instruction was plain error that affected the worker's substantial rights.\n\nIn federal civil litigation, a party generally must object to a jury instruction before it is given to preserve the issue for appeal. However, if the error is deemed \"plain\" or \"obvious,\" and it affects the party's substantial rights, the court may consider the issue even without a timely objection. This principle is based on Rule 61 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which allows courts to take corrective action for errors that affect substantial rights, even if they were not properly preserved.\n\nTherefore, arguing that the court's negligence instruction was plain error that affected the worker's substantial rights would be the most compelling argument under the circumstances described."
