Attention to handwashing and hygiene\n\nNorovirus is highly contagious and spreads easily through contaminated food, water, surfaces, and close contact with infected individuals. While vaccines and antiviral drugs are being researched, currently, the most effective way to control the spread of norovirus is through good personal hygiene practices, such as frequent handwashing with soap and water, especially after using the bathroom and before preparing or eating food. Additionally, cleaning and disinfecting surfaces can help reduce the risk of transmission."
