The three-story building had a store on the ground floor and apartments on the other two floors. The writer entered into a leasehold agreement with a shopkeeper, who would lease the first floor, where she planned to open a sporting goods store. After identifying the parties, the operative words of the lease were as follows: \"Landlord hereby agrees to lease for the three years the first floor of his building in the city to tenant, reserving unto said landlord annual rental in the sum of $12,000 payable in advance in monthly installments of $1,000. \"At the moment of signing, the leasehold agreement entered into between the writer and the shopkeeper\n\nA. created a periodic tenancy.\nB. could be terminated at will by either party.\nC. did not convey to the shopkeeper a term of years at law.\nD. was void, invalid, and had no legal effect.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is:\n\nC. did not convey to the shopkeeper a term of years at law.\n\nExplanation:\n- A periodic tenancy (Option A) is one that continues indefinitely until either party gives notice to terminate it. The lease described in the question specifies a fixed term of three years, so it does not create a periodic tenancy.\n- A lease that can be terminated at will by either party (Option B) is typically a month-to-month or week-to-week tenancy without a fixed term. Since this lease has a fixed term of three years, it cannot be terminated at will.\n- A term of years at law refers to a lease with a fixed duration. The lease in question specifies a three-year term, which is a term of years at law. However, the phrase \"reserving unto said landlord annual rental in the sum of $12,000 payable in advance in monthly installments of $1,000\" suggests that the payment structure might not align with traditional terms of years at law, where rent is typically paid annually in advance. Therefore, the lease may not fully convey a term of years at law.\n- The lease is not void, invalid, and has no legal effect (Option D). It appears to be a valid lease with a clear term and payment structure, even if there are some potential ambiguities regarding the payment schedule.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer is C, indicating that the lease did not fully convey a term of years at law due to the payment structure specified."
