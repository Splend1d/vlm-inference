All the members of the arbitral tribunal are appointed by the parties\n\nIn international arbitration, the parties typically have the freedom to appoint their own arbitrators. Each party usually appoints one or more arbitrators, and these arbitrators then often agree on a third arbitrator who serves as the chairperson or president of the arbitral tribunal. This process allows for a degree of control over the composition of the tribunal by the disputing parties themselves.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that in some cases, if the parties cannot agree on the appointment of arbitrators, an impartial third party, such as an arbitration institution or a court (like the International Court of Justice), may be called upon to make the appointments. Additionally, in certain institutional rules or specific agreements, there might be a restricted list of arbitrators from which the parties must choose. But the general principle remains that the parties have a significant role in the appointment process."
