This is known as the \"opening the door\" doctrine. In this scenario, since the defendant called character witnesses to testify about their good character, the prosecution is allowed to present evidence of the defendant's bad character to counter those claims. Therefore, the ex-wife's testimony about the defendant's violent behavior would be admissible under these circumstances."
