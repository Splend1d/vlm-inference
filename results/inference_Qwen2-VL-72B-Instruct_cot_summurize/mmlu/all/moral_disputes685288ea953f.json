The core issue revolves around whether embryos should be considered persons based on their ability (or inability) to exercise higher mental capacities.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Embryos actually do exercise higher mental capacities.**\n   - This option directly contradicts the initial argument that embryos do not exercise higher mental capacities. However, it does not align with scientific understanding since embryos at early stages do not possess higher mental capacities.\n\nB. **It doesn't make sense to say that a person exercises higher mental capacities.**\n   - This option suggests that the concept of exercising higher mental capacities is flawed or irrelevant. While it might challenge the premise, it does not directly address the specific argument about embryos.\n\nC. **The argument is sound, but its validity fails due to a common logical fallacy.**\n   - This option implies that there is a logical flaw in the argument that embryos are not persons because they lack higher mental capacities. It suggests that even if the premises are true, the conclusion does not logically follow. However, it does not provide an alternative perspective on the personhood of embryos.\n\nD. **To have killed a human embryo that developed into you would have been the same thing as killing you.**\n   - This option presents a counter-argument by suggesting that the potential future development of an embryo into a person makes it morally equivalent to killing a person. This directly challenges the notion that embryos are not persons because they lack higher mental capacities at the moment.\n\nGiven the context and the options provided, the most fitting response from Lee and George would be one that directly addresses the moral equivalence between embryos and persons based on their potential future development.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n**D. To have killed a human embryo that developed into you would have been the same thing as killing you.**"
