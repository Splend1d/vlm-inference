One week ago, she was treated in the emergency department after she accidentally spilled hot grease on her left leg while working at a fast-food restaurant. Examination of the left lower extremity shows a 7-cm, pink, soft, granular, edematous wound. The formation of this tissue was most likely caused by increased activity of which of the following?\n\nA. Glycosylation-dependent cell adhesion molecule-1\nB. P-selectin\nC. Stromelysin\nD. Vascular endothelial growth factor\n"

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)\n\nVEGF plays a crucial role in angiogenesis and wound healing. It stimulates the growth of new blood vessels, which is essential for the repair process following an injury like a burn. The granular appearance of the wound suggests the presence of granulation tissue, which is rich in new capillaries and fibroblasts, both of which are promoted by VEGF.\n\nGlycosylation-dependent cell adhesion molecule-1 (A), P-selectin (B), and stromelysin (C) also have roles in various biological processes, but they are not primarily associated with the formation of granulation tissue or the angiogenic response seen in wound healing."
