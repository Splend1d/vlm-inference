Similarly, any number between 4,525,000 and 4,534,999 will round down to 4,530,000.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. 4,500,321 - This number rounds to 4,500,000 when rounded to the nearest 10,000.\nB. 4,524,491 - This number rounds to 4,520,000 when rounded to the nearest 10,000.\nC. 4,533,372 - This number rounds to 4,530,000 when rounded to the nearest 10,000.\nD. 4,535,343 - This number rounds to 4,540,000 when rounded to the nearest 10,000.\n\nTherefore, the only number that could be the actual population of Louisiana in 2010 when rounded to the nearest 10,000 is 4,530,000 is C. 4,533,372."
