Her pulse is 55/min, and blood pressure is 150/90 mm Hg. She appears lethargic. Examination shows dry skin and a nontender thyroid gland that is enlarged to two times its normal size. There is mild edema of the ankles bilaterally. The relaxation phase of the Achilles reflex is greatly prolonged. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\n\nA. Chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis (Hashimoto disease)\nB. Defect in thyroxine (T4) biosynthesis\nC. Graves disease\nD. Multinodular goiter\n"

Chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis (Hashimoto disease)\n\nThis condition is an autoimmune disorder where the body attacks its own thyroid gland, leading to inflammation and reduced thyroid hormone production, resulting in hypothyroidism."
