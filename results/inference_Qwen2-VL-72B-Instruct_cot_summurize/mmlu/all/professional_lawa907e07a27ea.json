The case was tried to the court solely on documentary evidence. Immediately after the close of the evidence, the judge announced from the bench, \"Judgment shall be entered for the manufacturer,\" and judgment was so entered. The buyer has appealed the judgment. What is the buyer's best argument for persuading the appellate court to reverse the judgment?\n\nA. The judgment is clearly erroneous because it was based solely on documentary evidence.\nB. The manufacturer was required to file proposed findings and conclusions before the trial court ruled.\nC. The trial court erred because it announced the judgment without giving the parties an opportunity to submit proposed findings and conclusions.\nD.

The trial court erred because it announced the judgment without giving the parties an opportunity to submit proposed findings and conclusions.\n\nIn a trial conducted solely on documentary evidence, it is common practice for the court to allow both parties to submit proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law after the close of evidence but before the final judgment is rendered. This process allows each party to present their interpretation of the evidence and argue how the law should be applied to the facts as they see them. By announcing the judgment immediately after the close of evidence without allowing for this opportunity, the trial court may have deprived the buyer of a procedural right, which could be grounds for reversal on appeal."
