In this scenario, Shafi is citing evidence (Tony's and David's 100% scores) that supports his belief that boys do better in math than girls, but he fails to acknowledge the contradictory evidence (seven girls also earned 100%). This selective use of evidence to support a preconceived notion is a classic example of confirmation bias."
