It is common practice for peers or mentors to assist with editing and improving written work.\n- This action does not involve any deception or cheating, so it is not morally wrong.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n\"I was very proud of the SAT test scores I got for Henry.\"\n- This implies that the main character took the SAT test for Henry and obtained the scores under Henry's name.\n- Taking an exam for someone else is a form of academic dishonesty and cheating. It violates the integrity of the testing process and is considered morally wrong.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n- Scenario 1 is not morally wrong.\n- Scenario 2 is morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong"
