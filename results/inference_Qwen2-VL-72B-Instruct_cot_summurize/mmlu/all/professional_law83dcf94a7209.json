Most of the coastline is privately owned by persons who have permanent or vacation residences on their coastal lands. A man purchased a two-acre tract of littoral (i. e. , coastal) land in the state. When the man bought the property, there was a narrow concrete walkway (about 20 feet in length and 5 feet in width) adjoining the land. The walkway, which was designed to provide pedestrian access to the beach, was owned by the State Coastal Commission. When the man moved into his beach house, he noticed that the walkway was rarely used. As a result, the man decided to enclose the walkway and construct a paddle ball court over the entire area. He did so without notifying the State Coastal Commission. He has continued to use this area in excess of the period required for adverse possession. In an appropriate action brought by the man to establish title to the walkway area, which of the following must he establish if he is to prevail?\n\nA. Real property interests can be abandoned by a governmental entity without an official vote.\nB. Lack of use of the walkway by the state created an irrevocable license in him.\nC. Real property interests can be lost by a state by adverse possession.\nD. Due to a defect in the chain of title, the state does not own this piece of land.\n"

                    "text": "To determine which statement the man must establish to prevail in his action to establish title to the walkway area, we need to analyze the legal principles involved in adverse possession and abandonment.\n\n1. **Real Property Interests Can Be Abandoned by a Governmental Entity Without an Official Vote**:\n   - This statement suggests that the state could abandon its interest in the walkway without formal procedures. However, abandonment typically requires clear evidence of intent to relinquish ownership, which may include actions like discontinuing maintenance or use. It's unlikely that mere lack of use alone would suffice without explicit indication of abandonment.\n\n2. **Lack of Use of the Walkway by the State Created an Irrevocable License in Him**:\n   - An irrevocable license implies permission granted by the owner to use the property, but it doesn't transfer ownership. The man's use of the walkway does not create an irrevocable license; it pertains more to adverse possession.\n\n3. **Real Property Interests Can Be Lost by a State by Adverse Possession**:\n   - Adverse possession is a legal doctrine where someone can gain legal ownership of real property by occupying it openly, continuously, and exclusively for a statutory period. If the man has used the walkway area openly, continuously, and exclusively for the required statutory period, he might be able to claim adverse possession.\n\n4. **Due to a Defect in the Chain of Title, the State Does Not Own This Piece of Land**:\n   - This statement implies that there is a flaw in the state's title to the walkway, making it invalid. However, establishing this would require proof of a significant error or omission in the chain of title, which is not directly related to the man's use of the walkway.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most relevant principle here is adverse possession. The man needs to demonstrate that he has used the walkway area openly, continuously, and exclusively for the statutory period required for adverse possession.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**C. Real property interests can be lost by a state by adverse possession.**"
