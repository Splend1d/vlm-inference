Controlled drugs are substances that are regulated by law due to their potential for abuse or dependence.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. A 30 milligram ampoule of Codeine Phosphate for injection.\n- Codeine is an opioid and is typically classified as a controlled substance.\n\nB. A sustained release Morphine tablet.\n- Morphine is a strong opioid analgesic and is definitely a controlled drug.\n\nC. A 12.5 microgram Fentanyl patch.\n- Fentanyl is a potent opioid and is also a controlled drug.\n\nD. A 500 ml bottle of Morphine 10 mg in 5 ml in oral suspension.\n- This is another form of morphine, so it is a controlled drug as well.\n\nGiven this analysis, all the options (A, B, C, and D) list substances that are opioids and are typically controlled drugs. Therefore, there seems to be a misunderstanding in the question as all the listed items are controlled drugs.\n\nIf the intention was to ask about a non-controlled drug, none of the provided options fit that criterion."
