Ensuring the blender is off before someone puts their hand inside is a responsible and considerate action.\n- Therefore, this action is not morally wrong.\n\n**Scenario 2:** \"I painted my car a bright shade of purple.\"\n- Painting one's car a bright color is a personal choice and does not inherently cause harm or violate any moral standards.\n- Therefore, this action is also not morally wrong.\n\nGiven this analysis, both actions are considered morally acceptable according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong"
