Conspiracy.\n\nIn a common law jurisdiction, the friend can be charged with conspiracy because he agreed with the young man to commit a crime (stealing the TV) and took steps to facilitate it by driving him to the neighbor's house. Even though the friend's ultimate goal was to have the young man arrested rather than to steal the TV himself, the agreement and the act of driving to the location constitute an attempt to commit a crime, which is sufficient for a conspiracy charge."
