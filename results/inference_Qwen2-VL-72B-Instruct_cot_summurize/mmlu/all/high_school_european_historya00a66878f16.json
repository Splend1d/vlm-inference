By 1920 that fear was beginning to recede and Addison's policy was being regarded as extravagant. An immediate victim of the new attitude was the Borough's Kingfield Street scheme, provisional plans for which were approved in September 1920. Much to the Council's surprise, the Government's Housing Board deferred the scheme, \"having regard to the Council's present commitments and the money available at the present time, and in May 1921 the Government announced a drastic curtailment of the housing programme, cutting the housing target by half.\n\u2014Excerpt from a work by English historian Hermione Hobhouse Public Housing in Poplar: The Inter-war Years, 1994\nWhich of the following attitudes prevalent after the First World War is evident in the passage above?\n\nA.

                    "text": "To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the context and core of the passage:\n\n1. **Context**: The passage discusses Addison's Act, which was conceived due to fears of a potential revolution in Britain similar to the Russian Revolution if working-class aspirations were not met post-World War I.\n\n2. **Core Question**: The passage aims to highlight an attitude prevalent after World War I that influenced the government's actions regarding public housing.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. **Women's suffrage should increase**:\n   - The passage does not mention women's suffrage or any related issues. This option is irrelevant to the content provided.\n\nB. **Democratization of society**:\n   - Democratization involves increasing participation and representation in governance. While the passage touches on addressing working-class aspirations, it does not explicitly discuss democratization processes.\n\nC. **Increased disillusionment and cynicism**:\n   - The passage mentions that the fear of a revolution began to recede by 1920, and the government started viewing Addison's policy as extravagant. This suggests a shift towards skepticism about the necessity of extensive public housing schemes, indicating disillusionment and cynicism.\n\nD. **The rise of communism as a world power**:\n   - Although the passage references the Russian Revolution, it does not discuss the global rise of communism as a world power. It focuses more on domestic concerns within Britain.\n\nGiven this analysis, the most fitting attitude prevalent after World War I, as evidenced in the passage, is:\n\n**Final Answer: C. Increased disillusionment and cynicism**."
