Local developments were viewed through a geopolitical lens\n\nDuring the Cold War, the United States often viewed events and developments in the Third World through the lens of its competition with the Soviet Union. This meant that local conflicts, revolutions, and political changes were often interpreted in terms of their potential impact on the balance of power between the two superpowers. The US was concerned with preventing the spread of communism and promoting capitalist systems, which influenced its policies and interventions in various countries around the world."
