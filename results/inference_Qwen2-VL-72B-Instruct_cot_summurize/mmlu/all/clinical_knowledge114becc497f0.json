Preload, contractility, and afterload.\n\nPreload refers to the stretch on the heart muscle before it contracts, which is influenced by the amount of blood in the ventricles at the end of diastole. Contractility is the strength of the heart muscle's contraction. Afterload is the resistance against which the heart must pump blood, primarily determined by systemic vascular resistance. These three factors play crucial roles in determining how much blood is ejected from the heart with each beat (stroke volume)."
