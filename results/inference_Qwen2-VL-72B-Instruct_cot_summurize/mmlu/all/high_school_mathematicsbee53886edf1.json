The possible distributions (ignoring the order of the boxes) are:\n\n1. All 4 balls in one box: 1 way.\n2. 3 balls in one box and 1 ball in the other: There are 4 choices for which ball goes alone, so 4 ways.\n3. 2 balls in each box: There are \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\) ways to choose which 2 balls go together in one box (the rest automatically go to the other).\n\nAdding these possibilities together gives us \\(1 + 4 + 6 = 11\\) ways.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. 11."
