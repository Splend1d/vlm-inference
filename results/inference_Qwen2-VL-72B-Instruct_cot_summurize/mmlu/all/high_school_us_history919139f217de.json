Realizing that the power to tax is the power to destroy and that the power to take a certain amount of property or of income is only another way of saying that for a certain proportion of his time a citizen must work for the government, the authority to impose a tax on the people has been most carefully guarded.\u2026 A government which lays taxes on the people not required by urgent necessity and sound public policy is not a protector of liberty, but an instrument of tyranny. It condemns the citizen to tyranny. One of the first signs of the breaking down of free government is a disregard by the taxing power of the right of the people to their own property.\u2026 Unless the people can enjoy that reasonable security in the possession of their property, which is guaranteed by the Constitution, against unreasonable taxation, freedom is at an end.\u2026 With us economy is imperative. It is a full test of our national character.\u2026 It is always the people who toil that pay.\n\u2014Calvin Coolidge, \"Economy in the Interest of All,\" June 30, 1924\nIn the passage above Coolidge is reacting against which of the following?\n\nA. The economic policies of his predecessor Warren G. Harding\nB. The growing strength of radical politics in America following the Russian Revolution\nC. Populist agitation in the West\nD. The governmental policies of the Progressive Era\n"

                    "text": "To determine what Calvin Coolidge is reacting against in the passage, let's analyze the context and key points he makes:\n\n1. **Protection of Individual Rights**: Coolidge emphasizes the importance of guarding the rights of individuals to enjoy the rewards of their own industry.\n2. **Taxation as Tyranny**: He argues that excessive taxation is a form of tyranny and undermines individual liberty.\n3. **Government's Role**: He suggests that a government that imposes unnecessary taxes is not protecting liberty but is instead an instrument of tyranny.\n4. **Constitutional Guarantees**: He mentions the need for the people to have reasonable security in the possession of their property, as guaranteed by the Constitution.\n\nGiven these points, we can infer that Coolidge is advocating for limited government intervention and protection of individual property rights. This aligns with conservative views against expansive government policies.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. **The economic policies of his predecessor Warren G. Harding**:\n   - Coolidge succeeded Harding, but there is no direct indication in the passage that he is specifically reacting against Harding's policies.\n\nB. **The growing strength of radical politics in America following the Russian Revolution**:\n   - While this could be a concern during the era, the passage does not explicitly mention radical politics or the Russian Revolution.\n\nC. **Populist agitation in the West**:\n   - Populist movements typically advocate for more government intervention to protect the interests of ordinary citizens, which contrasts with Coolidge's emphasis on limited government and individual rights. However, the passage does not directly address populist agitation.\n\nD. **The governmental policies of the Progressive Era**:\n   - The Progressive Era was characterized by significant government reforms aimed at addressing social and economic issues, often involving increased regulation and taxation. Coolidge's emphasis on limiting government power and opposing excessive taxation aligns well with a reaction against such progressive policies.\n\nConsidering the content of the passage and the historical context, the most fitting answer is:\n\n**D. The governmental policies of the Progressive Era**"
