When we take the external direct product of two cyclic groups, we combine them in such a way that every element of the resulting group can be uniquely represented as an ordered pair where the first component comes from the first cyclic group and the second component comes from the second cyclic group.\n\nLet \\( G \\) and \\( H \\) be cyclic groups with generators \\( g \\) and \\( h \\), respectively. Then, the external direct product \\( G \\times H \\) consists of all pairs \\((g^a, h^b)\\) for integers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\). Since both \\( G \\) and \\( H \\) are cyclic, there exists a single element \\((g, h)\\) in \\( G \\times H \\) that generates the entire group \\( G \\times H \\).\n\nTherefore, **Statement 1** is **True**.\n\n### Statement 2: The external direct product of \\( D_3 \\) and \\( D_4 \\) is isomorphic to \\( D_{12} \\).\n\n\\( D_n \\) denotes the dihedral group of order \\( 2n \\), which represents the symmetries (rotations and reflections) of a regular n-sided polygon. \n\n- \\( D_3 \\) is the dihedral group of order 6, representing the symmetries of an equilateral triangle.\n- \\( D_4 \\) is the dihedral group of order 8, representing the symmetries of a square.\n\nThe external direct product \\( D_3 \\times D_4 \\) has order \\( |D_3| \\times |D_4| = 6 \\times 8 = 48 \\).\n\nOn the other hand, \\( D_{12} \\) is the dihedral group of order 24, representing the symmetries of a dodecagon (12-sided polygon).\n\nSince the orders of \\( D_3 \\times D_4 \\) and \\( D_{12} \\) are different (48 vs. 24), they cannot be isomorphic. Two groups are isomorphic if and only if they have the same structure, which includes having the same number of elements.\n\nTherefore, **Statement 2** is **False**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nC. True, False"
