It increases with an increase in temperature because the molecules of the air move faster at higher temperatures, allowing sound waves to travel more quickly. The speed of sound is not significantly affected by the frequency or wavelength of the sound wave itself, although these properties can influence how the sound wave behaves as it travels through different mediums."
