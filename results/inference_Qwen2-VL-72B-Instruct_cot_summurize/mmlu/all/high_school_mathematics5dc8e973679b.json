                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ways John can choose 4 marbles such that exactly one of them is red, green, or blue.\n\nFirst, let's select one marble from the red, green, or blue ones. There are 3 choices for this step (red, green, or blue).\n\nAfter selecting one of these three special marbles, we need to choose 3 more marbles from the remaining 9 marbles (since there are 12 total marbles and we've already chosen one). The number of ways to choose 3 marbles from 9 is given by the combination formula \\(C(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\\), where \\(n\\) is the total number of items, \\(k\\) is the number of items to choose, and \"!\" denotes factorial, which means the product of all positive integers up to that number.\n\nSo, the number of ways to choose 3 marbles from the remaining 9 is:\n\\[C(9, 3) = \\frac{9!}{3!(9-3)!} = \\frac{9!}{3!6!} = \\frac{9 \\times 8 \\times 7}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 84\\]\n\nSince there are 3 ways to choose the first marble (red, green, or blue), and for each of those choices, there are 84 ways to choose the remaining 3 marbles, the total number of ways to choose 4 marbles with exactly one being red, green, or blue is:\n\\[3 \\times 84 = 252\\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. 252."
