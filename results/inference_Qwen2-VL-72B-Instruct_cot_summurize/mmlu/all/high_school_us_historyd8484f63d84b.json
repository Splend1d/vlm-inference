Enactment of laws regulating railroads.\n\nThe song lyrics describe a struggle against monopolies and the exploitation of farmers by railroads and political bosses, which aligns with the Populist Movement of the late 19th century. One of the accomplishments of this movement was the enactment of laws regulating railroads to prevent unfair practices and monopoly control over transportation costs."
