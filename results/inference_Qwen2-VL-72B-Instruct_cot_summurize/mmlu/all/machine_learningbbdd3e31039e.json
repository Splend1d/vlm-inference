False, False\n\nIndustrial-scale neural networks are typically trained on GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) due to their parallel processing capabilities, which make them more efficient for handling the large computations required by deep learning models. CPUs (Central Processing Units) are generally used for tasks that require sequential processing and are less efficient for parallelizable tasks like matrix operations common in neural network training.\n\nThe ResNet-50 model, a popular variant of the Residual Network (ResNet), does not have over 1 billion parameters. ResNet-50 has approximately 25 million parameters, making it significantly smaller than one billion."
