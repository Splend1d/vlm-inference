(i), (ii), (iii), and (iv)\n\nHere's why each point is considered a disadvantage of the Dickey-Fuller/Engle-Granger approach:\n\n(i) Only one cointegrating relationship can be estimated: This is true because the Engle-Granger two-step method is designed to find only one cointegrating vector. If there are multiple cointegrating relationships, this method may not capture them all.\n\n(ii) Particularly for small samples, there is a high chance of the tests suggesting that variables are not cointegrated when they are: This is also true. The power of the test decreases with smaller sample sizes, leading to a higher likelihood of Type II errors (failing to reject a false null hypothesis).\n\n(iii) It is not possible to make inferences on the cointegrating regression: While it is possible to estimate the cointegrating relationship, making formal statistical inferences about the parameters of the cointegrating regression is problematic due to the non-standard distribution of the test statistics.\n\n(iv) The procedure forces the researcher to specify which is the dependent variable and which are the independent variables: This is indeed a limitation. In the Engle-Granger approach, one must specify a dependent variable and regress it against the others, which can influence the results and does not allow for a symmetric treatment of the variables.\n\nTherefore, all four points listed are valid disadvantages of the Dickey-Fuller/Engle-Granger approach to testing for cointegration and modeling cointegrating relationships."
